    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Growing up, “We Are Lady Parts” creator Nida Manzoor would have jam sessions with her sister, Sanya, and brother, Shez. “One of us would come into the other one’s bedroom and be like, ‘Oh, I’ve got this idea for a song.’ And Sanya, my sister, would start harmonizing, and my brother would start playing the guitar,” Manzoor told me in a recent interview. As adults, they still work the same way, as collaborators on the music for “We Are Lady Parts.” Now in its second season on Peacock , the bold and buoyant comedy series follows the members of Lady Parts, a punk band composed entirely of Muslim women: Amina (Anjana Vasan), Saira (Sarah Kameela Impey), Ayesha (Juliette Motamed) and Bisma (Faith Omole), as well as their manager, Momtaz (Lucie Shorthouse). Naturally, the band’s music plays a central role in the show, and, thanks to Manzoor and her siblings, Lady Parts’ songs are extremely rad. (Shez, a composer, also scored Manzoor’s 2023 film, “Polite Society.” ) In composing the songs together, it was a return to the “organic” way they would write music during childhood, as Manzoor explained. “We had a week in a studio here in Bristol, where I live, and my siblings came and stayed over.” Manzoor would come in with a song title or style in mind. “And then, we would just brainstorm ideas, lyric ideas, and then my brother would pick up the guitar, and then we would just start jamming and singing, and then we’d start writing. We’d write a song every day and then sort of move on. And we didn’t overthink it as well. We weren’t like, ‘This has gotta outdo Season 1.’ We just followed the vibe, and we were like, ‘This is cool. All right. That’s a song.’ There was not a lot of pressure on it. I think it was just ’cause it felt like we were just kids in our bedroom again. It felt very free and relaxed.” Despite the siblings’ low-pressure approach, the songs — like much of the season as a whole — do feel bigger and bolder than in the first season, something the show’s cast encountered when learning them before filming. “All the actors said that these songs this season are so much harder than [the songs in] Season 1. They’re way more intricate harmonies, way harder to play,” Manzoor said. “So the actors were really freaking out, but my brother really coached them through all that.” In addition to the original songs performed by the band, the show’s new season features several showstopping covers, including Bisma’s powerful rendition of Nina Simone’s “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood” in Episode 4. It’s one of several great needle drops this season that were natural song choices to Manzoor, who drew a lot from the songs that have inspired her work and served as a soundtrack while she was writing the show. “That Nina Simone song has always been in my sort of Lady Parts playlist since before I even wrote the pilot,” Manzoor said. “‘Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood,’ it just really resonated with me as someone trying to express a certain aspect of identity whilst not always pleasing everyone. And I’ve never heard a song that speaks to that.” “When I’m writing, I’m just open to songs that enter my orbit in a way, which sounds very woo-woo and annoying,” she added. “But with that song, I was with my producer, and we were at a festival, at Glastonbury Music Festival, ’cause ‘Polite [Society]’ was screened there, so we got free tickets. So we were watching Cat Stevens, [aka] Yusuf Islam. Watching Yusuf Islam, I’m like, ‘I need a Yusuf Islam song in my show,’ ’cause all his songs are so beautiful. I was sobbing, ’cause these are songs that I grew up with. And then he did the Nina Simone cover, which had always been in the back of my mind, and I just turned to John, my producer. I’m like, ‘Bisma should sing this, right?’ And he’s, like, ‘Yeah.’ It kind of came out of that, although it had been in my subconscious.” On a very different tonal note from Nina Simone, Hoobastank’s “The Reason” punctuates a lot of the romantic arc between Amina and will-they-won’t-they love interest Ahsan (Zaqi Ismail). Ahsan includes the song on a mixtape for her. During a rom-com moment at the end of the season, Amina performs the song outside his window, “Say Anything”-style. Manzoor credits her sister, Sanya, with the song choice. When she suggested it, Manzoor immediately thought it was “so good and ridiculous and cringe and cheesy and perfect,” she said. Another fun cover moment happens in the season’s third episode, when the members of Lady Parts, clad in matching dark suits, perform a medley of Britney Spears songs for a gig at a wedding. “I think I’d always wanted to do a Britney cover for Lady Parts for some reason — like, why not? Britney’s amazing,” Manzoor said. “And I just wanted to see them all looking amazing in suits and playing Britney — just the contradiction of that was really exciting to me.” According to Manzoor, the music from Season 2 will be released on a soundtrack album — including a special version on vinyl. Aside from the show’s original songs and covers, Manzoor said she is especially happy to “get to feature some artists that I was listening to as I was writing the show,” particularly undersung Muslim artists. “In Episode 6, Saira discovers all these different artists, and those were all musicians I was actually really listening to as I was writing the show,” she said. “So we have Elaha Soroor, who is an Afghani musician who had to flee Afghanistan because of the Taliban. And we have Rasha Nahas, who is incredible. All these musicians were people I was listening to and enjoying as I was writing. So then getting to showcase them because they’re not super mainstream was really fun as well, as well as doing all the fun covers.” “We Are Lady Parts” is now streaming on Peacock.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Paul McCartney turned 82 on Tuesday, prompting one of his former bandmates to share a birthday message for the legendary Beatles singer, albeit with a cheeky request. Pete Best, who was the band’s drummer in the early 1960s, posted the tribute to McCartney on social media Wednesday, wishing the rock icon a happy birthday. But Best also made an appeal ― to be the opening act for McCartney in Manchester, England, where he’s scheduled to play in December. “Happy Belated Birthday. Not far behind you,” the drummer wrote . “Reach out if you’d like me to open for you in Manchester. Imagine. Now that would be something.” Happy Belated Birthday. Not far behind you. Reach out if you’d like me to open for you in Manchester. Imagine. Now that would be something. pic.twitter.com/RfUFS8yNcn As one might expect, there’s a bit of history between the two former Beatles. Best was famously replaced by Ringo Starr as the band’s drummer in August 1962, after purportedly failing to impress producer George Martin with his time-keeping skills. Best has claimed that he was never given an explanation for why he was pushed out of the group. Still, he told The Irish Times in 2020 that he doesn’t hold his dismissal against McCartney. So far, the “Maybe I’m Amazed” singer hasn’t responded to Best’s generous offer to open for him, but that’s par for the course. Although McCartney is said to have reached out to Best around the time that the Beatles’ “Anthology” albums were released in the 1990s, Best told The Irish Times that he hasn’t spoken with any of his former bandmates since leaving the group.

    "article_content": "Millions of Americans sweated through yet another scorching day as temperatures soared Sunday across the U.S., while residents were rescued from floodwaters that forced evacuations across the Midwest, including in an Iowa town where the flood gauge was submerged. One person was killed during flooding in South Dakota, the governor said. From the mid-Atlantic to Maine, across the Great Lakes region, and throughout the West to California, public officials cautioned residents about the dangers of excessive heat and humidity. In Oklahoma, the heat index — what the temperature feels like to the human body — was expected to reach 107 degrees (41 degrees Celsius) on Sunday. In the Midwest where South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota meet, floodwaters rose through the weekend. In northwest Iowa, 13 rivers flooded the area, said Eric Tigges of Clay County emergency management. Entire neighborhoods — and at least one entire town — were evacuated, and the town of Spencer imposed a curfew Sunday for the second night in a row after flooding that surpassed the record set in 1953. “When the flood gauge is underwater, it’s really high,” Tigges said in a news conference organized by Spencer officials. Gov. Kim Reynolds declared a disaster for 21 counties in northern Iowa , including Sioux County. In drone video posted by the local sheriff, no streets were visible, just roofs and treetops poking above the water. Reynolds told reporters Sunday that more than 1,000 displaced residents slept in shelters Saturday night. National Guard troops were helping with water rescues and transporting needed medications lost in flooding. “Businesses are shuttered. Main streets have been impacted,” Reynolds said. “Hospitals, nursing homes and other care facilities were evacuated. Cities are without power, and some are without drinkable water.” National Weather Service meteorologist Donna Dubberke said parts of northern Nebraska, southeastern South Dakota, southern Minnesota and northwest Iowa received eight times the typical average rainfall. And more heavy rain was expected this week. In South Dakota, Gov. Kristi Noem declared an emergency after severe flooding in the southeastern part. Several highways were closed. Areas south of Sioux Falls, the state’s largest city, had an estimated 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain over three days, National Weather Service hydrologist Kevin Low said. At least one person died in the floods, Noem said Sunday, without providing details. Several rivers, including the Big Sioux, James and Vermillion, were expected to peak sometime Monday through Wednesday night, the governor said at a news conference. “I want to remind everybody to remember the power of water and the flow of water, and to stay away from flooded areas,” Noem said. “We’ve got a few days in front of us here that’ll be a little rough, but we’ll get through it.” Emergency management officials in the small South Dakota community of Dakota Dunes on Sunday issued a voluntary evacuation order for the area’s roughly 4,000 residents. Dakota Dunes is near the Nebraska and Iowa borders and is sandwiched between the Missouri and Big Sioux rivers, both of which are expected to crest in the coming days. Emergency management in Dakota Dunes warned residents that a mandatory evacuation could come quickly if flood barriers are breached. Little rainfall was forecast in coming days as high water continues working its way down the Missouri River, cresting at Sioux City, Iowa, overnight Sunday, at Omaha, Nebraska, on Wednesday, and at Nebraska City on Thursday, Low said. Minor to moderate flooding was expected along the Missouri River, according to officials with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. “As long as the levees hold, we’re not expecting any major impacts,” said John Remus, water management division chief for the corps in the Missouri River basin. But elsewhere, the heat was the biggest worry. “It’s more important for people who are going to be outside to stay hydrated, because heat, humidity and low winds, even if you’re in good shape and not really acclimated to it, it could be a danger, ” said Bruce Thoren, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Oklahoma. “It happens quickly.” The cities of Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Philadelphia all saw record heat on Saturday, with high temperatures again Sunday. Lamont Cousins, who owns the Ampersea restaurant on Baltimore’s waterfront, said business had been slow this weekend. The 40 outdoor dining seats at the restaurant, usually packed this time of year, were empty until around dinnertime Saturday. “I think it’s affected us because people are staying home scared,” he said. On Saturday, when he went to put umbrellas on the tables, it was already over 90 degrees. But Cousins said he’s not too worried about the lost business – and he expected Sunday would be better. “Yesterday, it was nobody walking around. It’s hotter today, but there’s a breeze going. Yesterday, it just felt like I was being punished,” Cousins said. Last year the U.S. experienced the most heat waves since 1936, experts said. An AP analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that excessive heat contributed to more than 2,300 deaths, the highest in 45 years of records. The National Weather Service warned of the potential for rare tornadoes in the Northeast later Sunday. Tornadoes on Saturday struck in Wisconsin, leveling the historic Apple Grove Lutheran Church, founded in 1893 in the town of Argyle. “The good news is we are all safe,” Dan Bohlman, pastor of Apple Grove Lutheran Church, said on the church website. Marvin Boyd, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Burlington, Vermont, said a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for parts of northern New York as a storm with wind gusts exceeding 60 mph (95 kph) and the threat of tornadoes head toward Vermont near Lake Champlain. It is one of several expected to pass through the region Sunday afternoon. “It’s an unusual alignment of ingredients for Vermont and northern New York to produce a threat of tornadoes,” Boyd said. ___ Associated Press journalists Summer Ballentine in Columbia, Missouri; Leah Willingham in Charleston, West Virginia; Julie Walker in New York; Ron Todt in Philadelphia; and Michael Casey in Boston contributed reporting.

    "article_content": "A friend of mine asked of Donald Trump voters: “How can they support such a sniveling, weak, low-IQ, whiny, bitch-ass snowflake? How does a corrupt liar charged with 88 felonies in four indictments and found liable for sexual assault even have a chance to win in 2024?” There may be an answer to his question. Many writers have argued that politics is the new religion in America. It’s an easy conclusion to reach. Maybe too easy. Over the past three decades, religious affiliation and church membership have fallen dramatically , from a relatively constant 70% through most of the 20th century to less than 50% today. And this has happened as ideological zealotry has intensified, even taking precedence over religion. “Today, religious Americans tend to choose their congregation with an eye toward partisanship,” The Christian Science Monitor noted, “to the point where the choice of presidential candidate can lead a voter to move to a new church.” Not that long ago, you would have been hard-pressed to find anyone putting politics over religion. In the 1960 presidential election, John F. Kennedy faced significant anti-Catholic prejudice. Many feared the pope would have undue influence in the nation’s affairs if we had a Roman Catholic in the White House. Back then, faith was a primary way people identified themselves and sized up others. It was how we assessed whether you were “one of us” or “one of them.” For a long time, religious faith could even be a deal-breaker, especially for a marriage. A Baptist, for instance, could never marry a Methodist. Where I grew up, it was almost unheard of for a Catholic person to marry a Jew, something illustrated in a scene from the Martin Scorsese film “Goodfellas.” Today, however, the biggest deal-breaker for a potential match is politics. In recent polls , participants overwhelmingly say they find it tougher to date someone with political views different from their own. And we’ve all heard stories of how national politics has fractured families and friendships . (Imagine if that were your political legacy: ruining family ties and friendships throughout the entire country you claim to love.) What I see here isn’t a national divide over politics, let alone religion; it’s a divide over personal identity. Philosophers, psychologists, psychiatrists and sociologists have long pondered the universal human need for a unique identity. For many, religion was once that go-to marker. Now it’s politics. Politics isn’t the new religion. It’s the new identity. I don’t think it’s an accident. I think it’s a replacement. Certainly not for all of us but for a sizable number — and, dare I suggest, a number that falls in a particular political camp. Their dedication to this identity is beyond passionate; it’s pathological. It borders on dogmatic fanaticism that is almost overtly religious. It’s why they get their backs up when someone attacks their politics or a figure who represents their politics. It’s not their politics that’s being attacked; it’s the identity, and they take it personally. That might explain our increasingly coarse national discourse , to the point where publicly cursing or threatening an opponent’s family are practically the norm. Where some say certain people are prone to anger, rage, and hostility , I say those people have become defensive. They’ve invested so heavily in their political identity that they have to protect it at all costs and can’t — won’t — back down. If they did, it would be an admission that they were wrong, that everything they believed and everything they invested themselves in was a sham, crumbling like a Jenga puzzle. Imagine if, magically, a time machine could bring Jesus Christ to the present day only to concede, ”Ya know what? I was a lousy carpenter and I needed to make a living, so I came up with a good line of bullshit. It worked.” What would believers say? I think you know. They’d call him a false prophet, not the real thing. They couldn’t possibly accept that everything they believe, every fiber of who they are, was based on a lie. Imagine Trump having, instead of a rally, a confessional, where he told his loyal followers, “Ya know what? It’s all a con. I lied about everything. I just wanted to be president, have power and be worshipped.” How would the base react? It’s more accurate to call it a fan base, like die-hard sports fans. You know the type I mean? The ones who watch a game and shout, “We gotta win this one!” What do you mean “we”? What are you, on their payroll? Are you an employee? There ain’t no “we.” But it’s a way to establish an identity. We are who we support, who we worship. That is our politics. It’s not about partisanship. It’s about our ego, our self-esteem, our ID. It’s a fascinating correlation, this passing of ships between religion and politics. I find it ironic, however, how onetime religious congregants taught to fully submit to the mysterious will of a single authority, according to an infallible Word, are so susceptible to the self-serving proclamations of a charismatic sociopath. I’m not so sure it’s ignorance, or even willful ignorance. Whichever it is, those who would benefit from it have effectively cultivated, shaped, and exploited that ignorance for their own gain. Indeed, we might better call it an unwitting ignorance, an unwitting suffocation of one’s own brain cells with television, social media and Golden Calf demagogues. And just like religion, they hang on to it for dear life. They belong to what is good and righteous. They’re never wrong about their beliefs or their faith in their deity— in this case, Trump. Those who disagree are evil and must be banished. Let us hope we don’t see a resurrection of Donald Trump come November."

Somehow the married people on X, formerly known as Twitter, continue to find humor in the minutiae of wedded life. Every week, we round up the funniest marriage tweets on the platform. Read on for 20 relatable ones that will have you laughing in agreement. “i have to tell you something but you can’t tell anyone” i am telling my husband i already started writing the text Some heroes save people from burning buildings. I save people who are trapped in endless conversations with my husband. We are at an adult \"pool party\" and my husband put on his bathing suit before we came here and I tried to explain to him that no one was actually going to be swimming. Anyway, he is now in the pool by himself while everyone else is standing around the edges sipping cocktails. I asked my husband what he wanted for Father’s Day & he said silence & then we all laughed & laughed & the kids went back to breaking the sound barrier. The funniest Fathers Day thing I hear is from my wife, who said, “You can sleep in, if you want.” Babe, I’ve been waking up at 5 AM since I was in my twenties. I absolutely cannot sleep in, no matter what anyone wants. Sometimes I'll just throw away old cords instead of saving them, I'm not a dad so it's allowed My husband is so confusing because, based on things he’s told me, he used to be smarter at some point. My husband just got all pissy because I put the empty glass “he was still using” in the dishwasher, and this is my villain origin story. My wife's birthday is coming up and I’m wrapping her presents with AARP magazine covers. On a scale of one to I’m so dead, how is this going to go over? wife and I are microdosing being empty nesters by removing the kids from our Netflix plan me: [grunts sitting down getting into the car] Wife: [grunts sitting down getting into the car] Me: remember when we used to get in the car silently??

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost It’s easy to curl up inside with a book or binge-watch a Netflix show when it’s dreary outside. Who wants to go for a hike or garden when it’s lightning and thundering? It’s a universally accepted truth: rainy days equal lazy days. But being a sloth when it’s beautiful outside? That can feel like a faux pas. The intrusive thought of taking advantage of the sunny weather can affect your mood and make you feel bad about yourself. If you feel guilty lounging indoors when the weather’s gorgeous, you’re not alone. “Sunshine guilt,” or the self-imposed shame you feel when you stay inside on a sunny day, is a common experience. The term went viral earlier this spring after TikTok user Renee Reina posted about her experience with the phenomenon. “ It can lead to feelings of guilt, anxiety, regret, FOMO, and for some people, even shame,” Emily Hemendinger , an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, told HuffPost. People might also end up thinking they’re worthless for not being productive or wasting time, Hemendinger added. Here’s why you feel bad doing nothing when it’s nice out and how to show yourself some grace next time you want to take it easy on a sunny day: When it’s nice out, people tend to feel like they should be making the most of the day. If they don’t, they might feel as though they’re letting themselves down or aren’t properly taking care of themselves, said Dr. Gail Saltz , a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. People can also experience FOMO , or fear of missing out, when it’s sunny out. You might tell yourself, “I feel that everyone else is out enjoying or benefiting from this sunny day, but I am missing it,” Saltz said. Another factor contributing to sunshine guilt is having a scarcity mindset, or believing the idea that there’s a limited supply of something ― in this case, sunny days. This can, understandably, make people feel even more desperate for whatever the limited commodity is, Saltz explained. Although there are endless sunny days, a scarcity mindset can make you feel awful about letting even one day go to waste, pressuring you to get outside and enjoy it. Guilt, in many cases, can be helpful. It can show you that you need to work on yourself, apologize for something you said or change your behavior. But in other instances, such as with sunshine guilt, it can be confusing and unhelpful. “Sometimes it’s due to an irrational story you are telling yourself, and it needs reframing,” Saltz said. Sunshine guilt is exacerbated by the fact that our society rewards and encourages productivity ― not just at work but in all areas of life. “ From the time we are children, we are told to not waste time, not sit around — otherwise, we are deemed lazy,” Hemendinger said. As a result, many people wind up equating their self-worth to how busy they are, what they achieve or what they are doing, Hemendinger explained. “ That striving mentality in our go-go-go society is common,” she said. “However, it also commonly leads to anxiety, depression and shame.” It doesn’t help that social media bombards us with images and videos of other people enjoying their lives. We typically see photos of people enjoying nice weather — going on a bike ride, picnicking in a park or sitting outside for happy hour ― and not their movie night at home or their sluggish morning sleeping in. “ On top of the internalized capitalism values of productivity and not wasting time, when we see others doing all the things, it taps into our human need to be one with the pack, to fit in,” Hemendinger said. This can be exceptionally painful for people who are prone to anxiety and depression, Saltz said, along with those who frequently compare themselves to other people. The self-criticism and negative self-talk can quickly become unbearable. First, you want to figure out why you’re feeling guilty about staying indoors. Are you experiencing FOMO or are you worried you won’t get another chance to be outside again soon? Or, perhaps, are you anxious that you’re not reaching your potential? Once you’ve identified what’s behind the shame, you can tackle the feeling head-on, Saltz said. If you’re feeling FOMO, you want to show yourself that you’re not actually missing out. Tell yourself, “I’m doing what I’m meant to do, and I can have this other opportunity of being out in the sun at a better time for me,” Saltz suggested. Practicing gratitude can also lift your spirits. Grab a journal and jot down a list of things that have recently brought you joy. This might help you see that you aren’t missing out or lacking activity in life. And if social media is making you feel worse, log out of your apps for the day. If you’re struggling with the uncertainty of when the next beautiful day will be, know that there will be more sunny days soon. “Remind yourself that more sun will always be coming,” Saltz said. For those who feel like they’re not doing enough, Hemendinger suggested that showing yourself some grace may help. “ Practicing self-compassion in this case looks like giving yourself permission to show up how you need to show up in life in that moment,” she said. It’s OK to not be super productive every day. In fact, it’s extremely beneficial for our physical and mental health to carve out time to rest and refuel. “People need to consider how they best feel they can recharge their energy,” Hemendinger said. Listen to your body. If you want or need rest, give yourself permission to lay low and take it easy. It’s a common misconception that we need to have fun throughout the summer, but this isn’t fair or even true. “Fun is where you make it, fun is where you find it, fun is not a limited commodity, and therefore [there] are many ways to have fun,” Saltz said. So, ditch the idea that you need to be busy when it’s nice out. Expand your definition of fun to include relaxing at home and enjoying it. “It will help you all around,” Saltz said.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer When I was a teenager, I tried to picture being married to a man one day. Each time, I saw a man and a woman in their early 30′s standing in a kitchen. The sequence was silent, but the couple’s lips moved, each of their mouths making the shape for either language or laughter. The woman stood hunched over a mixing bowl while the man stood behind her, his hands poised to wrap around her midriff. It must have been an amalgamation of scenes I’d watched in movies. The woman never looked like me — she was brunette. I never saw the man’s face. *** The night before my appointment to try on wedding dresses at a local boutique, I got a call from the sales assistant, Haley. She had three things to say. There would be champagne flutes in case I wanted to bring champagne (I didn’t). How many people would be coming with me (none)? And: What dress styles did I like? I panicked. The store had already sent me their entire inventory via a Pinterest board, and per their instructions, I screenshotted the ones I liked and texted them. I did not know the names of the styles I’d sent, and I resented the idea that I was supposed to. Haley told me she’d seen the screenshots. “So, more of sweetheart necklines and A-line silhouettes?” she asked. “Um, yeah, I don’t know,” I said, “I think I just like what I like...” I felt the implication of a question hovering between us: What kind of woman doesn’t know what a sweetheart neckline is? and a statement I’d felt the echoes of since childhood: You are not part of The Club. *** At the appointment, Haley asked, “So, did you grow up thinking about your wedding?” “No,” I laughed. “Not at all.” “Really?!” she responded, surprised. “That’s so interesting!” I didn’t tell Haley I grew up kissing my friend Julia who lived across the street. I played “the boy” because she fought harder to be the girl than I did. I knew I didn’t want to be a boy, but I also knew I wanted to kiss more than I wanted to be “the girl.” Just before Julia’s 6th birthday she informed me, “I’m about to turn six, so we can’t kiss anymore.” This was soon after her mom caught us pressed together in Julia’s bedroom — or at least we thought she had. We’d immediately flung ourselves to opposite sides of Julia’s twin mattress when we heard the doorknob turning. “What’re you doing?” her mom laughed as she walked through the door, not having seen what we were up to after all. She was just teasing us, but shame wasn’t in on the joke — it was how we knew to separate ourselves, fast. Maybe it’s how Julia also knew she needed to put an end to what we’d been doing. *** Part of my dread of wedding dress shopping came from the ways I believed I would be rendered invisible by the blinding brightness of heteronormativity. I expected many things would be assumed of me, including: I was a specific kind of woman (one who’d grown up thinking about her wedding and not being the boy ); I was straight (Haley had asked, “How’d you know this was your dude?” but did, to her credit, seamlessly adjust to the use of “she” pronouns when I mentioned Rachael, my fiancée); I needed to be told how beautiful I was (I could just imagine a perky stylist saying, “Oh my gosh, you look gorgeous !” and that made me cringe); and that this was going to be The Most Important Day of My Life and The Most Important Dress of My Life and that of course I’d always been impatiently careening toward this moment. *** My appointment with Haley was not my first attempt at finding a dress. I’d previously dipped my toe into the hunt more nonchalantly. I looked on Etsy before admitting to myself that I didn’t want to deal with the hassle that could come with purchasing something off the internet. I shopped some non-wedding dress stores at the mall, including a chain that sells prom dresses, and flipped through the racks at a thrift store. Who cares? I thought. Does it really matter what kind of dress I get or from where? I’d even agreed to a low-stakes trial at David’s Bridal one afternoon while Rachael and I were out running other errands and she had asked, “Do you want to just go in and look? Maybe even try a few on?” So we did. I hated all of them. *** I wasn’t sure I’d even wear a dress at my wedding. I am a woman, but my gender expression sometimes wants to be “boy,” sometimes wants to be “girl,” and sometimes wants to be neither. How was I supposed to know what it’d want to be on a day that was months and months away? Ultimately, because I’d been on a “girl” streak lately — and because it felt right to be in a dress when I was at David’s Bridal — the answer became clear. I’d wear a dress, and I’d find one quickly. But can any decision steeped in so much tradition and ascribed so much meaning be that simple? The more I thought about buying a wedding dress, the more I asked myself why I wanted one. Did it have something to do with Rachael’s decision to wear a suit? Perhaps part of me liked the contrast. Maybe I wanted our love to be instantly recognizable to other people — to our wedding guests — some of which were family members that almost certainly had never been to a queer wedding (or known a queer couple, for that matter). Or maybe I was grasping for something familiar — an easy and reliably classic trope — so I could just stop thinking about it. *** Despite my angst over The Dress, I do want to get married. I’m the one who proposed. When I met Rachael, love became clear — logical even. We want to be together, and we figure we might as well make it legal (taxes, health insurance, etc.). We also like the idea of a big party where love is celebrated. We’ve even decided to call it a celebration of love, not a wedding . This shift denoted something more aligned with what marriage means to us. We also feel getting married is an act of gratitude to our queer elders and allies who lobbied and organized and suffered for us to have this right. And it’s an act of gratitude to my 18-year-old self, who sat in church the Sunday after the federal legalization of marriage equality and listened as the priest said, “Despite recent legislation, I want to make clear that we will not be conducting same-sex ‘marriages’ here.” It’s a gift to that girl who, with no other choice, kept listening as the congregation stood and applauded and applauded and applauded — and who could not imagine queerness as a possibility for herself. *** When I got to the boutique, Haley was waiting for me behind the receptionist’s desk with an open mouth smile, revealing her perfect teeth. She showed me which fitting room we’d be using and the gallery where all the dresses hung. “Go ahead and look around and pick some!” she said brightly. Panic set in again. I had assumed the dresses I’d screenshotted would already be waiting for me. The appointment slot was an hour and a half long, and in my appointment notes, I wrote, “I doubt I’ll need an hour and a half.” I was convinced I’d be in and out without any fanfare. I wanted to take the path of least resistance. Alas, I was disarmed — I would have to play the part of bride and leaf through white after cream after white dress, amid swirls of silks and laces and sweetheart necklines (I finally Google d it ). I selected eight dresses, which Haley said was a good number for the “first batch,” and we took them back to the fitting room. She took one off its hanger and made a donut shape out of it on the floor, so I could step inside and pull it up without tripping. She told me to let her know when I had it on so she could come put a row of clips down its back to make it fit to my body. Once I was adequately clipped, I stepped out of the fitting room and onto a platform in front of a trifold mirror. This dress wasn’t one I imagined myself liking. I had only picked it off the rack because Haley said I should “grab a wild card!” It was pure white with a vaguely floral pattern stitched across it. I felt beautiful — sexy, even. I loved my strapless shoulders. I loved the shape that the A-line made of my body. It felt special . I’d never worn something like this, and when would I ever again? “Wow, I like this more than I thought I would,” I said, embarrassed. “Wow, really?!” Haley replied. “So you do like the A-line fit!” “Um, I guess so...” “Okay, let’s try the next one!” A voice in my head spoke five words I didn’t know I had been waiting to hear: I can have this too. *** Haley looked up at me as I tried on my favorite dress for the third time. “I have one question for you,” she beamed. “What?” I mimicked her facial expression. I was trying to play it cool, humiliated by the genuine excitement I felt. “Are you saying yes to the dress?” Her tone was half joking — she knew by now that I wasn’t in The Club — but half earnest. “Um...” I said. “Yes? I think so?” I wondered if I should think about it for a few days or get some other opinions. I wanted to make sure I wasn’t just being convinced of something. I wanted to be certain this was my choice and one I was making because I really wanted to be making it. Still, among all of the thoughts running around in my head at that moment, the one I heard loudest was I love this dress. After Haley measured my hips, belly, and bust, I bought the dress. She asked me if I’d like to take a picture with the “say yes to the dress” sign. “Sure,” I laughed. “My sister will get a kick out of it.” I held the silly wooden sign and smiled as Haley took photos with my phone and the shop’s phone. I got in my car and sent the “I said yes to the dress” photo and a photo of me in The Dress, to my sister and soon-to-be mother-in-law. I sat in there smiling. I couldn’t wait to tell Rachael I’d picked my dress. I imagined her seeing me in it and me seeing her in the custom suit that a queer designer in Brooklyn was making for her. We were dressing for love. *** One day I might regret my choice. Maybe I’ll think I was clinging to or caving into some ridiculous notion of gender roles. Maybe not. I don’t think it really matters. No matter what happens, Rachael and I will look at each other on our wedding day — and every day after — and see love. Maybe it gets to be not-that-serious. *** Shame is like whack-a-mole, isn’t it? You smash it once and it pops up again somewhere else. Sometimes, I feel ashamed of choosing the wedding, the marriage, the dress. Should I be boycotting it all? Should I be more evolved than taking part in this patriarchal, heteronormative institution? Am I doing queerness wrong ? Who’s to say? The fact that none of this was built for or by people like me is a huge part of why I want it. I guess it’s a little spiteful. I want to say, take that. Take that, priest from my childhood church. Take that, media that showed me queerness was an absurd joke or a dangerous choice or worse. Take that, shame that made two five-year-olds afraid and kept at least one of them feeling that way for years and years and years. You couldn’t stop me. None of you. And those things I thought I heard Haley implying about my being the wrong kind of woman and not part of The Club ? I’ve realized I was really hearing them from myself. I assumed what could and could not be true of and for me. And I was wrong. I now know that to wear my beautiful dress is to say take that to the stories I’ve told myself. On our wedding day Rachael and I will dress for love. Our garments, no matter what they may or may not mean or signal or share about us, will celebrate it. And when we behold each other — and are beholden by everyone around us — we will see nothing but radiance.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer Kim (not her real name) and I bonded when our sons played on the same travel basketball team. For years, we spent weekend after weekend together in loud, testosterone-filled gyms, rife with the smell of boy sweat and breakfast sandwiches. We always sat in the same place on the unforgiving bleachers, midway up in the center, and picked up our conversation from where we left off at the previous practice or game. Sometimes we lightly trashed the coaches, chastising them for how they ignored our respective son’s potential and didn’t give them enough playing time. But mainly we gossiped about the other parents (quietly and sometimes in code). And when we were out of earshot, we discussed our love lives: new relationships (hers) and divorces (mine). Kim had dated several men, but she seemed to be smitten with this latest one, a single dad and a former University of Iowa college basketball player. I saw Evan for the first time when he showed up at practice to bring her wallet. I grinned when she leaped up and shrieked at the sight of his 6-foot-something frame filling the gym’s doorway. She was so tiny next to him that they reminded me of Isla Fisher and Sacha Baron Cohen, if they were both blond. To me, Kim was the only thing that made those practices bearable. So when she missed two in a row, I called her in a panic. “I’m Evan’s plus one at a wedding in San Jose!” She was yelling over Montell Jordan’s “This Is How We Do It.” “Sorry, didn’t I tell you? Anyway, I’ll be back in time for tomorrow’s practice. I can’t wait to process everything with you.” Process? When Kim arrived the following day, I felt my shoulders relax as she sat next to me. Another mom had been vying for Kim’s spot and I didn’t know how much longer I could hold her off without being rude. “So what happened?” I whispered, sneaking a glance at her left hand to see if maybe she’d gotten engaged. We were sitting with our heads together conspiratorially, like teenagers in homeroom. “I couldn’t wait to see you. I thought about you the whole time I was there.” “About me? Why?” “It was a Black wedding.” I watched Kim’s mouth continue to move while my stomach turned to jelly. Oh no. As someone who grew up Black in white spaces, I’m accustomed to white people seeking me out to marvel at their experiences with Black people and culture. Once, at a school board meeting, a white man crossed the room just to let me know that he’d tried collard greens for the first time. A nother time, an older white woman at a party informed me (without prompting) that she’s started going to Black salons because they know how to do curly hair. Whenever I have braids, white women have no problem asking if it’s my “real” hair. And white men can’t wait to tell me about their Black girlfriends to illustrate how “down” they are for knowing about locs and shea butter. Most of the time, I see that the offender is actually attempting to bond with me, and I try not to discount that. But I’d never pegged Kim as one of those “well-intentioned white people.” I’d let my guard down with her and I was about to find out what a mistake that was. “Girl, Evan and I were the only white people there. It was crazy! I mean, don’t get me wrong, the wedding was beautiful.” Why do you sound surprised that the wedding was beautiful? “They jumped the broom like in ‘Roots,’ did you ever see that TV show?” Of course, everyone who was alive in the 1970s saw “Roots.” “It was so cool. The whole buffet was soul food, I tried fried catfish and I never ate so much mac and cheese.” OK, you really need to stop. “Everyone was singing along with the music during the ceremony; they had this gospel choir! And the woman next to me yelled, ‘Go head, y’all’ when the bride and groom kissed.” Don’t EVER do that. Imitate Black people. “And at the reception, they did something called the Cupid Stumble.” “Shuffle,” I said through gritted teeth. “It’s the Cupid Shuffle.” I felt my chest heating up. Does she know how many white weddings I’ve been to with a smile pasted on my face? What if I went to Kim after one of them and said, “Wow! I went to this white wedding and I was the only Black person there, isn’t that crazy? Oh, and they had flavorless mashed potatoes and dry, skinless chicken breasts, have you ever had that?” Or, “I couldn’t believe how stiff and silent everyone was during the ceremony.” With one wedding, I’d transformed from Kim’s friend to Kim’s Black friend, and I knew our relationship would never be the same. According to the Public Religion Research Institute, 75% of white people have no friends of color, a statistic I find both startling and consistent with my experience. Typically, building interracial friendships means that both parties need to put in work. Both need to step outside their respective comfort zones to learn and embrace a culture with which they may not be familiar. Ideally, that means my white girlfriends and I would spend equal time in each other’s worlds, acquainting ourselves with things like the other’s music, food, news and fashion. But that’s rarely how it goes. Mostly, it’s just me, meeting my white friends at white restaurants, discussing white TV shows on our group texts, and going to white book events in white parts of town. Rarely do they choose films like Ava Duvernay’s “Origin” or suggest going to a reading by a Black author like Ashley C. Ford. And as the Black, female TikTok creator @bannebean posted recently on this topic, “I’m getting tired of having to be in white spaces to maintain the friendship.” Facts. Like the old adage about the tree falling in the forest, I wonder if an interracial friendship that takes place only in white spaces is a true friendship. The assumption is that your Black friend is comfortable everywhere you are, when they may just have more practice at being comfortable with being uncomfortable. Being Black in white spaces comes at a cost, and it seems Black people are always expected to foot the bill. I met Lilah almost 15 years ago. “You are stunning,” she said to me, looking me up and down. We had just arrived at a mutual friend’s baby shower. “I want your skin. It’s amazing.” I studied her, sizing up her large green eyes and waist-length light brown hair, and decided that I should lightly and politely remove myself from the conversation. I didn’t feel like being fetishized for my skin or hair or anything else. I didn’t want to be the Black friend at this baby shower. I just wanted to be. But Lilah didn’t just let me be. During the party, Lilah sat with me on a love seat and talked like we were old friends. She spoke about current events like my Black friends do, outraged by the same policies and politicians, sympathetic to the same causes. When the shower givers asked someone to lead the limbo, Lilah went first, dancing like she was born in Trinidad instead of Orange County. As time went on, I discovered that Lilah is no ordinary white woman. First of all, she’ll be the first to tell you that she’s mixed race, with a Swedish mother and an Armenian father. Secondly, she is 100% down for going “culture-halfsies” where our friendship is concerned. I don’t think it would ever occur to her that we only go to white restaurants, white concerts or parties filled only with white people. She’s always down to see what’s new on the menu at Keith Corbin’s Alta Adams here in LA, or accompany me to see Tyla at The Wiltern. She insists on a balance, making sure our friendship isn’t one-sided. Obviously, one shouldn’t ever walk up to a stranger or even a new Black friend and offer to share a hot new restaurant with them just because it’s “Black.” (Otherwise you risk coming off like Kim or the gentleman with the collard greens.) Over the last 15 years, Lilah has proved over and over again that her enthusiastic interest in everything that makes me me, including my Blackness, comes from a place of friendship and not “festishship.” During these times of political conflict in our highly segregated society, true interracial friendships are rare. And interracial romantic relationships might be even rarer. I’m not talking about someone dating outside of their race; there’s plenty of that. I’m talking about a true romantic partnership, where, for instance, a white man steps out of his comfort zone to embrace his Black partner’s family, food, sports, music and entertainment. Yes, I’m talking about my boyfriend. Scott and I met nearly 16 years ago. At the time, he lived in Utah and he was the whitest man to whom I’d ever been attracted. Because of that, I thought it would never work between us. But, as time went on, I became besotted with him, which was both thrilling and terrifying. Because I agreed with Tina Turner when she said, “What’s love got to do with it?” — I had no faith that love could bridge our cultural divide, even a love as great as ours. Scottie comes from a quiet, three-person home, just him and his parents, who have now both passed. My family is loud. And when the 10, sometimes 15, of us get together (every week), there are spirited, sometimes raucous debates about everything from WWE to the race for the White House. At first, Scott would just kind of drift away during the chaos and watch TV in another room. Later he stayed in his seat during these verbal rows and listened to each person’s (emphatic) point. He told me recently that the most important lesson he’s learned from being around my family is listening, really listening. But over the years, he started participating in the debates and voicing his opinion. It’s hard to get a word in edgewise in my family, but somehow he manages. When it comes to seeing Black theater or movies, he’s gone from “going along” to surprising me with tickets to shows like “ Slave Play ” and “Raisin in the Sun.” It’s not that he’s changed who he is. But instead of asking me to change who I am by giving up my Blackness, he loves me all the more for it. Halfsies. The Kim of it all aside, I think that I am better because of my interracial relationships. Lilah and I are not only besties, but we are also allies and advocates for each other’s cultures. And I think that my relationship with Scott challenges the status quo and demonstrates that race need not be a barrier to love if both parties are willing to work. When I’m out in the world, everywhere I look I see people gravitating toward the familiar. But the payoff for intentionally widening your friend circle can be immense. I’d love to see our society normalize transracial friendships that allow each person to live authentically. My relationships with my non-Black friends, while sometimes hard-earned, have been some of the richest of my life. There is so much to be gained by knowing and loving someone different from you.

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost Scientists have been trying to develop a male version of the pill for decades , with a number of frustrating starts and stops along the way. This week, scientists at the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in Boston announced that we may be one step closer to male birth control becoming a reality: Judging by early clinical trials, a hormonal gel that’s rubbed on the shoulders daily may be even more effective than hormonal contraceptive options for women. The gel, developed by the National Institutes of Health and the nonprofit Population Council, combines two main ingredients , nestorone and testosterone, the male sex hormone. The nestorone suppresses the production of testosterone in the testes and, consequently, the development of sperm. By reintroducing synthetic testosterone, any negative effect on the sex drive is minimized. In a clinical trial , 86% of men achieved sperm counts low enough to prevent pregnancy after 15 weeks of using the gel. For other men, the drug worked at even brisker pace, suppressing sperm production within four to eight weeks. “We’ve been just really excited by the results,” said Diana Blithe, branch chief of the NIH’s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, at the conference. “The combination seems to provide better, faster suppression than we expected.” In the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and numerous states passing legislation designed to undermine or completely block access to abortion care , the drug’s development couldn’t come at a more vital time. As it stands, the options for men wanting to prevent pregnancy are scant: use a condom, depend on the very unreliable pull-out method, or get a vasectomy . After the Roe news in June 2022, there was a flurry of articles about men rushing into urologist’s offices to get a vasectomy. But doctors caution not to get the snip if you’re considering “undoing it” later: While vasectomies can technically be reversed, it’s not cheap and your chances for a successful reversal decrease every year after you’ve had the procedure. The good news is that the demand for the male pill exists. One 2016 multinational study found that over 50% of men would be willing to try a male contraceptive method. While it still may be a while until a male birth control method is approved by the Food and Drug Administration and put on the market, the desire for it seems to be growing. HuffPost recently asked men how likely they were to use hormonal contraceptives if they were to become available to them. Some men told us they were eager to share the burden of contraception with the women in their lives. Some single men said they just want a say in their reproductive futures. We also asked them if they’d take it if it had some unpleasant side effects ― like the headaches, weight gain, nausea and lowered sex drive some women experience with the pill ― and how they feel about contraceptives being framed as a “women’s issue.” See what eight guys of various ages and experiences had to say below. What have you and your partner(s) mostly relied on? In the past, my wife and I have used the pill and I’d wear condoms. When we wanted to try for a baby, we stopped. But I would try male birth control. What if it was approved, but it had some unpleasant side effects? All medications have side effects. Any man on this planet who complains about a headache because of his birth control methods needs to reexamine whether the sex is worth it. Is this the woman you want to be tied to for the rest of your lives? If she gets pregnant, it takes two parents to raise a child. Will you be there for every Christmas concert, soccer game, volunteer at schools, and be a taxi service when they need rides? If not, take a simple pill and use a condom as backup. I did that until I had my three children and was mentally ready for kids and could financially afford them. What are your thoughts on the idea that it’s a woman’s job to prevent pregnancy? It’s not just a woman’s job. It’s both people’s responsibility to take precautions. All my past partners had to do was say “wrap it up” and I did. When it came time to stop having children, I went for the vasectomy instead of her going to have her tubes tied. The surgery and recovery was nothing. I was back to working the next day. She wouldn’t have been able to. It’s not rocket science. No one can question we want the sex much of the time. If we want it, we have to respect what our partners want to do with their bodies and lives. Man up, guys. Take control of your futures while having your fun. I have three male children below 26 and they know how important this issue is to me. I’ve lost a child and had to make the difficult decision whether to abort a baby with less than a 10% chance of living and may have caused horrible issues for my wife. It’s the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make, and a simple pill could have prevented it. How do you feel about your contraceptive choices currently? I feel like there are a lot of choices, but they all have some sort of drawback. My partner and I have used condoms and female birth control, either the patch or the pill. Currently condoms plus the pill. In all honesty, how likely would you be to use hormonal birth control? I have a terrible memory, I forget my pills all the time. So if it was a pill, I wouldn’t even bother. This short clip sums up how I feel, about if men had to take birth control pills : I’m currently considering getting a vasectomy as I already have three kids and it seems like more of a sure thing. But I’m concerned with potential side effects. Vasectomies have so much misinformation online about it making you like a eunuch but then there are real potential issues like long-term chronic pain. I think that my younger self definitely grew up thinking contraception is the woman’s responsibility. I think men shouldn’t force that responsibility on women but I really doubt men will step up and take charge of contraception anytime soon. And for that reason I think male contraceptives will largely be a commercial failure when it comes to market. “I always came from a perspective of why don’t they hand this out like candy?” How do you feel about contraception options out there right now? It’s clearly pretty weak. I’m a hetero cis male and since I’ve been sexually active, I’ve had some partners that were able to use contraception in all of its various forms ― pills, IUDs, patches, condoms ― and some that weren’t. With most of my partners, we relied on a combination of condoms or withdrawal coupled with the pill. With a few long-term partners, I got to see the trials and tribulations that come from finding the right option, and let me tell you, in some cases it was really unpleasant for them. For me, it was simply deciding on which condom would perform the best. That’s not really a fair trial process. So I would be open to using male birth control because I simply want to prevent pregnancy. If I’m going to be completely honest, I want to get a vasectomy. My partner and I are done having children. However, if we weren’t in that stage, I’d be on any approved male birth control pill. Have you had any pregnancy scares through the years? Definitely. A couple stand out: The first was in high school, so obviously I was terrified of all the stigma that comes with it, but also the fact that I could hurt my future and that of my partner. The next was in my early 30s with a partner that was showing signs of ending the relationship. My ultimate concern was having a child and splitting time with it. I’m a child of divorce and know that has consequences. What if male birth control was approved, but it had some unpleasant side effects? Would you still be willing to take it? No question. Sign me up. I would certainly monitor the side effects, if any, and stop use if necessary. It would be worth it. I’ve been thrice injected with a COVID vaccine; preventing pregnancy is as important to me as any other health issue. How do you feel about birth control being framed as a “woman’s issue”? What isn’t placed on the woman? This is still a patriarchal country, so it’s definitely not surprising that it would be on women to make sure they don’t get pregnant. It would appear obvious that since the entire contraceptive market is geared toward women, it automatically lays the burden of responsibility at their feet. It’s complete bullshit. Has the overturning of Roe v. Wade made you more inclined to think about this subject on the whole? It hasn’t made me think more about it, because I’ve always thought about it. I guess I always came from a perspective of, why don’t they hand this out like candy? Prescribed, of course, but for free and with a doctor’s supervision. And why isn’t there a pill for me? What it makes me think about more is my children and what they may someday have to endure. It’s truly terrifying and nauseating. You said you’d take birth control if it was tested and approved. What if there were side effects? I would certainly be wary of the side effects, but I couldn’t ask my partner to do something that I wouldn’t do myself. If the side effects are that unpleasant, I would explore other avenues, such as a vasectomy. What do you think of women voicing concern that men might not take their birth control? If I were a woman, I wouldn’t trust my male partner to tell me the truth about being on a contraceptive. It’s unfortunate but I’ve been around plenty of men that are very upfront about lying to get a woman into bed and have zero concern on what might happen afterwards. Contraception and preventing pregnancy shouldn’t be a woman’s issue, but when they can’t rely on the men around them, it seems like it has to be. Has Roe v. Wade’s recent reversal impacted your feelings on any of this at all? The overturning of Roe v. Wade has made me much more inclined to think about this subject as a whole. It’s why I’m pursuing a vasectomy. This upcoming week, I have a consultation with a urologist to set up a vasectomy, since there aren’t any real male contraceptive options available yet. I’d be open to taking that if it was developed. I told my general practitioner about my intention and he tried even harder than my mother to talk me out of it, which really blindsided me at the time. I haven’t had any real pregnancy scares, but since becoming sexually active the anxiety has always been there, even when using protection. What have you used in the past? I’ve mostly relied on condoms or occasionally the female contraceptive pill. I’ve known women from all over the spectrum with that, who can take it with few side effects, who can’t take it because of the side effects, and one who had such bad period pain that she had to take it just to get relief. How do you feel about potentially taking male birth control? Have you always felt that way? In my early 20s, I was against male birth control because I was fine with condoms and didn’t trust drugs that interacted with complex organs like the brain or the reproductive system. That was pretty self-centered, since I would be fine with a woman using the pill. But my other thought was, unless you’re in a trusting committed relationship, a pill won’t protect against getting or transmitting STIs. Since then I’ve gone through a lot: I got diagnosed with ADHD, had some episodes of major depressive disorder, and just generally learned more empathy. Now I’m perfectly open to anything that’s gone through adequate testing. I would happily take something that had similar or less side effects to female hormonal birth control just to spare my partner from side effects if she felt they were detrimental to her quality of life. I’d also be open to something like the Vasalgel contraceptive injection that I’ve read about in the past. Some women say they’re apprehensive about men taking this responsibility in their hands, when it’s the woman who will get pregnant. How do you feel about that? I fully understand why many women would not trust their partners to use a hormonal male contraceptive ― especially if they require as regular dosage as the female contraceptive. It’s their body that’s on the line if it doesn’t work, especially in the U.S. at the moment. It’s something that would require a lot of trust compared to something like a vasectomy or a barrier method, assuming they can trust their partner not to be a complete sociopath and remove it mid-sex . As for it being women’s responsibility, I wholeheartedly reject that, especially in a committed relationship. On the other hand, I also know that if I were a woman, whether I was having casual sex or in a relationship where kids were definitely not on the table, I would probably go to great lengths to make sure I maintained my bodily autonomy. The woman has the highest stakes in this arrangement and I have no idea how to balance that. Why are you open (or not open) to using male birth control? I’m open for a number of reasons. The main one being that sex is a two-way street. If both partners in a relationship would like to prevent pregnancy for the foreseeable future, the responsibility of contraception shouldn’t have to automatically fall on the female. Second, and this probably only makes sense to me, but sperm count is another reason I’m very open to the use of male birth control. I know this is one of the reasons that it’s been difficult to study and create a male birth control option, but the average sperm count is 20 million to 40 million sperm [per ml]. Compare this to the single egg produced by females and the responsibility of birth control ― or at least the options to consider ― should reflect that. If I were having a potluck with a bunch of friends, but I was bringing the most friends and relatives, I wouldn’t tell my friends, “Hey, make sure you bring and make more food than you intended so that we can eat all of it.” I would make sure I brought enough for everyone I’m bringing. Do you think other guys would take it? I’ve never personally had a pregnancy scare, but know a number of friends who have and seen the amount of stress and anxiety they experienced over it. If there were more birth control options, it would hopefully prevent more of these scares and help couples focus solely on the things they enjoy about sex, while maintaining greater autonomy over their body. That said, it doesn’t surprise me that most men are hesitant to use hormonal contraception. It’s literally something that men haven’t used before. On top of that, I’m also sure there is a pervasive mindset of “Well, most women just use the pill, so why do I have to do anything?” or “if it ain’t broke ... ” What if male birth control was approved, but it had some unpleasant side effects? I would like to say it’d have no impact, but depending on the side effect, it likely would have an impact. For example, if the side effects were weight gain, I am on the higher BMI side, so I may not want to use it if it will affect other aspects of my health. However, if the side effects did have any effect on my long-term health, I don’t see it impacting my decision to use it at all. For example, if the side effects were headaches, I’m more than happy to take Tylenol or Advil to compensate. Or if it were nausea, I am happy to take Bonine or Tums to compensate. If it were mood-related, such as mood changes or lower sex drive, it wouldn’t impact my decision to use it. However, it may impact my decision for long-term use, assuming these side effects cause issues in other areas of my relationship. Has the overturning of Roe v. Wade made you more inclined to think about this subject on the whole? It definitely has ― if access to abortion is going to dwindle based on where you live, then contraception for both men and woman becomes all the more important as it relates to how woman make reproductive health decisions. I would imagine and hope more options, access and development is on the horizon. It feels silly to bring up this common saying when discussing human and woman rights, but “necessity breeds creativity.” If banning abortions only stops safe abortions, and not abortions in general, and doesn’t change people’s sexual habits and tendencies, then contraception is the one thing that can change to help support reproductive rights. “As for the side effects of birth control, it’s a small sacrifice to gain weight to avoid bringing a life into this world when you’re not ready to bear the burden.” Would you take male hormonal birth control? I would be open to it if it meant less burden on my wife, though I do have reservations about using drugs still in development since you don’t know the potential long-term effects. I have had a pregnancy scare in my early 20s. An ex told me she got pregnant after we broke up. Initially she wanted to abort. I said no, I would raise the kid. She decided to keep the girl. I had my doubts at birth and got a paternity test to find the child was not mine. Why are leaning toward getting a vasectomy? I’d prefer having [a vasectomy] done over anything else. I actually just had a consultation with a urologist last week to discuss a vasectomy. My wife and I know kids are not something we want and we are both in our late 30s. Perhaps if I were younger and not able to afford a vasectomy, I would use male birth control. As for the side effects of birth control, it’s a small sacrifice to gain weight to avoid bringing a life into this world when you’re not ready to bear the burden. Why are you open (or not open) to using male birth control? Yes. In a serious relationship both should share the burden. There were a few close calls in at least two of past relationships where her menstrual cycle was late. Taking male birth control is actually kind of romantic. Instead of just buying flowers and stuff like that, this is a sign of the love for her that a man can demonstrate. What’s more romantic than that? In non-serious relationships, it would also show that both can be responsible adults and share the fun and the burden. This conversation makes me think of the concept of hot-cold empathy. In cold moments we, of course, would say things like, “I’ll wear a condom,” “I would insist on him using a condom,” “I would respect a woman’s no” or “I would never sleep with a guy without protection.” But when we are in the heat of the moment, people do it without protection or don’t take a no for a no. Knowing that they both are on contraceptives keeps the moment going, instead of having to look for the condom in the bathroom drawer, realizing there is none and having to run down to the store. What are your thoughts on contraception being framed as a “woman’s issue”? It’s stupid. Women are not getting pregnant like the Holy Virgin Mary. Barring IVF and other methods, there is always a man involved. And it’s his responsibility, too. That should be a no-brainer, we shouldn’t even discuss that. Alas, the reality is different. That just shows how long the way is we still have to go. Has the overturning of Roe v. Wade made you more inclined to think about this subject on the whole? How so? Of course, though currently you see mostly women protesting against the decision ― you don’t see that many men. The entire Roe v. Wade discussion, SCOTUS decision and backwardness of some states is only focusing on the women. Unfortunately, the men who impregnated those women are out of the picture.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost You’ve probably heard common financial advice like keeping a budget and trying not to spend more than you make. But other tips aren’t as well-known that can help you save a lot of money and create a financially healthy life. From daily hacks to long-term tips, we talked to financial experts about not-so-obvious money advice they follow. Here’s what to know: “A low price on a lousy product is actually a terrible deal because you will end up spending more, in the long run, to replace cheaply made items that break easily,” Andrea Woroch , a consumer-finance and budgeting expert, told HuffPost. “Focus on quality and spend more if it means it will last.” Woroch tries to save on quality merchandise by shopping second-hand for name brands. For big-ticket items, she recommends taking advantage of retail sales events (like Amazon Prime Day) and buying seasonal items (like patio furniture and winter clothing) at the end of the season. Other tips: Participate in free loyalty programs and search for online coupons before making a purchase. “Although a detailed budget keeps you on track to meet your financial goals, one that is too restrictive will actually backfire quickly due to burnout,” Woroch explained. “[And] if you try to change all your spending habits overnight, it will be difficult to stick to the plan.” Instead, she suggests making a few small changes to your spending and savings habits — and then building on these once they become routine. She said it’s also important to make room in your budget for expenses that matter to you. For example, if a dinner date with a friend or partner is a priority, keep this in your budget. Find other ways to cut down on spending, like canceling unused subscriptions and unplugging gadgets to decrease energy bills. “It’s extraordinarily easy now in our society to spend money without thinking about it,” said Anne Lester , author of “ Your Best Financial Life.” “You can sign up for auto-renew … you see something cute on Instagram, you go tap and boom, you bought it.” But being able to buy things too easily can lead to unconscious spending. Instead, Lester advises slowing yourself down to make spending money more of a conscious decision. One way she does this is to always create a shopping list before she goes into a store or buys items online. For onli ne shopping, she suggests setting aside a specific time once a week to make purchases. When reviewing your list, ask yourself: Do I really need this? Is there a tangible moment when I know I’ll use this? Just making the list will give you time to reflect on whether the purchase is worthwhile. For subscriptions, it can be easy to forget ones set to “auto-renew.” Lester suggests doing a “subscription cleanse” periodically, reviewing all your subscriptions and canceling the ones you’re no longer using. “You should automate everything you can about saving so that you don’t have to make a conscious decision to do it,” Lester said. “[If you don’t] you set up a conversation … with yourself about what you could be doing with that money, and often you lose because getting stuff is more fun than saving.” Michael Finke , professor of wealth management at The American College of Financial Services, suggests setting up an automatic transfer to a high-yield savings account. For example, if you get paid at the end of the month, you can set up a transfer on the first day of the next month. “Money in a checking account can be tempting to spend,” he said. “Making regular transfers to a high-yield savings account can help you build an emergency fund without feeling the pain of writing a check.” Lester also recommends automatically transferring money to a retirement account. If you work for a company that offers a 401(k) plan, it’s ideal to sign up for the full employer match. “Not taking advantage of a match is like leaving hundred-dollar bills on the ground,” Finke explained. “Even if you took it out after a year and paid a 10% penalty, you’d still come out way ahead.” If you don’t have access to a 401(k) plan through work, you can set up an individual retirement account (IRA) and still have money automatically transferred, Lester explained. When reviewing your credit card statements, it’s easy to just focus on the bigger charges. But it’s actually key to also review the smaller line items. “Not every fraudulent charge is a four-figure shopping spree,” Sara Rathner , personal finance expert at NerdWallet, told HuffPost. “ Often, thieves test your card out with a few purchases of just a few dollars.” These purchases are easy to overlook, and if you miss them, bigger fraudulent charges could follow later on. Rathner advises checking your credit card statements monthly, and if you see something you don’t recognize (even a few-dollar charge), report it to your credit card company immediately. “[While] most of my clients have at least one long-term [investment] account, I encourage them to consider opening another investment account for mid-term goals,” s aid Elaine King , a certified financial planner and founder of Family and Money Matters . Mid-term goals could include buying a home, paying for education, purchasing an investment property or starting a business. “When separating investment accounts, we aim to match the portfolio allocation to the specific goals and time horizon and, in the end, save you time and money,” she explained. For example, if buying a home is on the short-term horizon, the “real estate fund” should be invested in short-term assets. “Personal finances [are] personal and seasonal … [they should be] based on values [and] life circumstances,” said Kara Stevens , founder of The Frugal Feminista and author of “Heal Your Relationship With Money.” Once you understand that other people’s priorities are not the same as yours, “you’ll be able to better identify the tools … that make the most sense for you.” Before creating a financial plan, Patrick Yono , founder and CEO of Sure Life Financial, recommends mapping out what’s important to you: What type of home do you want? What type of work-life balance is best for you? What interests do you want to pursue? Once you have the end goal, then you can figure out how to earn the money you need, what type of investments to make, etc. Stevens added that we also need to be flexible and responsive to what’s happening in our day-to-day and in the larger world and not feel bound by our financial “rules.” “There are a lot of rules of thumb out there when it comes to money, but don’t feel pressure to follow them all,” Rathner said. “The best thing you can build into your personal financial plan is the flexibility to make changes as needed.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life From loud budgeting to girl math , TikTok is an endless source of trends and information about personal finance. A particularly quippy one that has taken hold is the “100 envelope challenge,” an approach to saving money that uses cash and envelopes to gamify the experience. So what exactly is the 100 envelope challenge and how does it work? We asked personal finance experts to break down the method, as well as the benefits, downsides and everything else you should know before trying it out. “The 100 envelope challenge is a viral money-saving method where you number 100 envelopes from one to 100,” said Jack Howard , the head of money wellness at Ally Financial. “Each day, you select a random envelope and insert the corresponding dollar amount to be tucked away until the end of the challenge. So, if you pick envelope #32, you should put $32 dollars in the envelope.” At the end of 100 days, you should have a total of $5,050 in cash set aside. The challenge can also progress linearly instead of randomly. The alternative approach would be to start with envelope #1 on the first day and put aside $1 then $2 into envelope #2 the next day, $3 into envelope #3 and so on. “Popularized by TikTok, the 100 envelope challenge is essentially a way to make saving money more approachable,” said Courtney Alev, consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma . Having to essentially “pay” an envelope every day might encourage you to cut back elsewhere in a way that feels more natural and seamless. You can also adjust your totals to fit with your personal savings goals. “If putting away that much cash is not realistic, especially when you’re entering the double digits, you can customize the amount per envelope that fits your budget but still feels like a challenge,” said Andrea Woroch , a consumer finance and budgeting expert. “Ultimately, you’re still saving ― and saving more than if you didn’t participate in the challenge at all.” While the 100 envelope challenge is tied to the TikTok era, the concept of putting cash into envelopes to encourage saving is not new. “The envelope budgeting method has been around for a long time, but with a different focus,” Woroch explained, noting that earlier versions required budgeting out a certain amount of cash for each expense in your budget. “You can only use that amount, so if it runs out, you’re out ― which can keep you out of credit card debt and on a tight spending plan.” “Like the other viral money-saving methods, there’s gamification and a sense of fun added to something you should already be doing,” Howard said. “When saving money becomes a ‘challenge,’ it can be a motivator, especially when it results in $5,050 of cash.” She noted that this daily challenge also forces you to practice money mindfulness. Indeed, doing something positive for 100 days is a good way to develop healthier habits. “You have a daily goal that requires thoughtful planning to execute,” Howard said. “Knowing you need to meet the goal may stop you from spending on things you really don’t need and have historically purchased out of habit.” Changing your spending habits and saving money can feel like a big, intimidating endeavor in the abstract, but this approach helps you start small and take it one step at a time. “Methods like the 100 envelope challenge can help because it turns saving into a game, and you have a clear path and goal to follow, which reduces the mental load of planning and staying focused,” Woroch said. So not only are you saving a good chunk of money in a short time, but by fostering a budget-oriented mindset and new practices, you’re also setting yourself up to save more money in the long term. “It can be a great method for those who are more visual, and want to physically see the money they are saving and spending instead of using a credit card and paying a bill,” Alev noted. “If you are someone who doesn’t tend to carry cash, you may be making multiple trips to the ATM,” Alev noted. “Toward the end of the challenge you’ll have a large amount of cash on hand, and you want to secure it in a safe, hidden spot that isn’t easy for others to access.” There are risks to keeping such large quantities of cash in your home, so you might want to reconsider the envelope approach if you’re prone to misplacing things or live in a place where theft is a concern. “You may want to do this digitally by transferring money into a dedicated savings account each day and keeping track of these transfers using a spreadsheet,” said Jannese Torres, host of the “Yo Quiero Dinero!” podcast and author of “Financially Lit!” To pursue the 100 envelope challenge, you’ll also need to be realistic about your financial situation. “Make sure you’re saving an amount that won’t derail your budget or drain your bank account, as this could mean overdrafting your account or carrying a balance on your credit card to pay for daily essentials in the event you withdrew the money you had to pay for those purchases in the first place,” Woroch cautioned. “Obviously, paying interest on a credit card is not a smart money move, so it’s important to figure out where you can cut back and how much you can save each day without messing up your cash flow,” she added. “I’m sure there are plenty of unnecessary purchases you could cut out to make this work, or memberships and subscriptions you could pause for the time being.” Unexpected expenses could also arise during the 100 envelope challenge process, so you might get discouraged if you aren’t able to stick to the rules of putting aside money every single day as a result. “At the end of the day, it’s another fad that doesn’t promote a sustainable saving practice ― and the $5,050 isn’t guaranteed,” Howard said. “Some might find it difficult to remember to complete the challenge each day and fall behind on the goal to save in 100 days.” She recalled trying a similar challenge with a plastic wallet that encourages $40 contributions. “I thought it would be an easy way to save $1,000 quickly,” Howard said. “The problem is I often need cash and will pull from the envelope when I need to pay for pizza delivery, act like the tooth fairy when my daughter loses her tooth or need to pay for parking.” You could also miss out on extra earnings by saving your money in cash at home, she added. “If you choose to keep your cash in envelopes instead of a traditional bank, you’re missing out on compounding interest,” Howard explained. “A high-yield savings account will help your money grow over time, even after the 100-day challenge ends. We’re currently in a competitive rate environment which is great for saving.” “Like any budgeting method, it works if you stick to it,” Alev said. “For best results, make a plan for the money you’ll save before you start. Whether you’re looking to start an emergency fund or want to pay down debt, having an end goal will help you stay motivated throughout the entire challenge.” Accountability buddies can provide great motivation in any savings endeavor, including the 100 envelope challenge. “I think it can work, but it does require discipline,” Torres said. “So I’d recommend inviting some friends to join in on the challenge to keep each other accountable.” Think about ways you could cut down on your spending or earn extra money to help complete the challenge as well. “I also like using savings tools that save for you,” Woroch said. “Qapital that has a round up feature in which it rounds up purchases to the whole dollar ― or whatever amount you select ― with linked debit cards, and then saves or invests that spare change. That spare change can add up fast!” She recommended digital tools like Fetch or CouponCabin that allow you to earn cash back on the daily purchases you have to make anyway. “If you’re on a tight budget, you don’t have to miss out on this savings challenge ― think about canceling or pausing subscriptions and memberships you really don’t need, haggle your monthly bills or consider taking on a side hustle just for the time being,” Woroch said. She added that you can earn extra cash by pet sitting through Rover or tutoring through Varsity Tutors as well. “To make the most of your money while still challenging yourself, why not combine the Envelope Challenge with a high-yield savings account?” Howard said. “Each day you can pick a number between one and 100 and transfer the correlating dollar amount from your checking account to your savings. That way you’re taking advantage of earning interest and your money is protected.” Official banking can also remove the temptation that’s there when you have envelopes filled with cash and need to quickly grab money to pay for something. For many, it takes more effort and thoughtfulness to dig into their online savings. “It’s important for people to understand that these viral moments are typical of social media and don’t always show the low moments in life,” Howard noted. “While you might come across someone who easily completed the challenge, there are multiple people who found it difficult to keep up with or had an unexpected expense that derailed them.” These moments are rarely shared online, so try to keep that perspective when you consider a method like the 100 envelope challenge. And don’t be discouraged if you don’t find the success you saw on TikTok. “What works for one person doesn’t work for everyone else,” Howard said. “While it’s important we all have a plan of attack when it comes to our savings, you should only do what works best for you and your lifestyle.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Reporter In a repeat of damage during Pride Month last year, multiple Pride flags at the Stonewall National Monument in New York City were vandalized this week, police reported. The New York Police Department received a report Friday morning that flags were removed from Christopher Park, part of the Stonewall National Monument, a spokesperson at the Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Public Information (DCPI) told HuffPost in an email. A preliminary investigation had found that an unidentified person had removed and destroyed flags at the site Thursday night and fled, the DCPI said. No injuries were reported, and no arrests have been made, the spokesperson confirmed, adding that the investigation is ongoing. In a post on the X social media platform on Friday evening, New York City Council Member Erik Bottcher shared photos of the vandalism at the Stonewall National Monument, which is the first national monument dedicated to LGBTQ+ history. The photos show Pride flags thrown on the ground and damaged. Some scraps of Pride flags that had been burned were scattered along the sidewalk, and several flags that usually line the perimeter of the monument were missing. Last night, bigots vandalized the Stonewall National Monument, snapping flag sticks & stealing 3/4 of the flags around the permitter of the park. Also, someone burned Pride decorations at 22nd St. in Chelsea. Anyone who thinks this will intimidate our community is badly mistaken. pic.twitter.com/x6K033UXBL New York Mayor Eric Adams condemned the vandalism in a post Friday night on X, saying that “hate has no place in our city, and nothing will change that.” “We love the LGBTQ+ community and celebrate them during Pride and all year round. We’ll always have your back, and we will bring whoever defaced the Stonewall monument to justice,” Adams said. Last year, Pride flags at the Stonewall National Monument were vandalized three times in June , which is LGBTQ Pride Month. According to NBC News , there have been a slew of attacks on Pride flags and Pride symbols across the country over the past few weeks.

    "article_content": "General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Dakota Johnson epitomized the “the show must go on” ethos when she experienced a wardrobe malfunction on “ Jimmy Kimmel Live” Wednesday. (Watch the video below.) After host Jimmy Kimmel played a preview from her new movie, “Daddio,” his guest could be seen holding a severed gown strap with both hands. “Part of your dress just came unhooked. You all right? Should I get some Scotch Tape?” Kimmel said. “It just fell off,” she said, smiling. “It seems to be hanging in all right,” Kimmel said. “Well, I’ll just hold it,” she said. Kimmel praised Johnson’s acting in the film while the seemingly flustered star tried to solve her predicament. “Just hold the important part,” Kimmel suggested. Johnson grabbed one breast and then both for laughs, still managing to plug her project. “The movie is really good,” she said. Johnson didn’t skip a beat when they moved on to a conversation about auditions for a dick pic in the movie. The troublesome strap appeared to bother her earlier in the interview as they made small talk and tried to guess which random person on the street was high. But she soldiered through.

    "article_content": "Trends Reporter The Kendrick Lamar - Drake beef has officially landed in new and uncharted territory. The hip-hop feud reached a fever pitch Wednesday in Los Angeles when Lamar, the hometown hero of South Central, hosted a celebratory Juneteenth concert titled The Pop Out: Ken & Friends at the Kia Forum. At the concert, he performed his Billboard-charting Drake diss “Not Like Us” five times in a row. Thousands rapped along as Lamar spit his fiery verses onstage at the star-studded affair, which was live-streamed on Amazon . The concert event also included guests Tyler, the Creator and YG. NBA stars Russell Westbrook and LeBron James, as well as singer The Weeknd, were in the crowd as Lamar brought dozens of rival gang members onstage. “This shit gets me emotional, dog,” he told the crowd . “We done lost a lot of homies to this music shit, lot of homies to some street shit, and for all of us to be on this stage together; unity from each side of motherfucking L.A., crips, bloods, pirus — this shit is special, man. The beef between the two hip-hip titans kicked off in March when the rappers directly engaged each other on wax after years of subtle shots. Lamar fans would note that his “Not Like Us” is already hip-hop’s unofficial summer anthem. The concert attracted about 17,000 attendees. One social media user wrote on X, formerly Twitter , “This Kendrick show is the blueprint for a hometown event.” Lamar apparently named the show after his espoused ethos on “Not Like Us” that “you gotta pop out” to squash the competition sometimes. He gave 15 relatively unknown local acts the stage to open for him. Lamar held the concert on Juneteenth in commemoration of the last enslaved people in the U.S. being liberated in 1865 — after Drake accused him in a diss of “always rapping like you bout to get the slaves freed.” Lamar took a moment onstage to address Drake, saying, “Give me Tupac’s ring back.” The Canadian rapper purchased one of Shakur’s rings last year for over $1 million. While some fans are adamant the beef isn’t over, others see The Pop Out as the final nail in the coffin that is Drake’s rap career. KENDRICK OPENING UP WITH PERFORMING EUPHORIA FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH EVERY ONE SINGING ALONG THIS IS LEGENDARY SHIT 😭😭😭 pic.twitter.com/KGOQPrewV5 I personally think we needed someone like Kendrick to show the broader audience that all that shit yall thought mattered, doesn’t. People got clouded by the numbers & internet and forgot the real currency is in the community! KENDRICK RAN NOT LIKE US BACK IMMEDIATELY AND LET THE CROWD SING THE LYRICS FOR HIM DOG.. HE BARELY RAPPED!!! THIS IS THE MOST INSANE VICTORY LAP IVE EVER SEEN IN MY FUCKING LIFE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 pic.twitter.com/dig3zzZlC5 So then Drake told Kendrick that he rap like he tryna free the slaves Kendrick threw a concert on Juneteenth that united rival hoods and celebrated legends. - Me at a BBQ on Juneteenth 2054 pic.twitter.com/XNLSeflr81 KENDRICK LAMAR PERFORMING NOT LIKE US WITH DR DRE INTRODUCING IT THIS IS INSANITY pic.twitter.com/bE0CDm3oAH Kendrick really picked the right date for this show.

    "article_content": "Head of Product, HuffPost Product Manager Adding value to our users is one of the guiding principles for every product we build at HuffPost. With that goal in mind, right after the 2016 election we were inspired to create the first version of The Flipside as a tool with a very simple premise: to allow readers to explore the diversity of stories trending on Twitter at any given time on a handful of topics. Shortly after the initial launch in April of 2017, our team evaluated performance along with user feedback, and immediately identified areas of improvement. In addition to some design and functionality issues, we also realized the experience was not ideal for mobile users. Taking in all these lessons learned, we reimagined and rebuilt The Flipside from the ground up. We’re proud to introduce this new and improved version today. Some of the most noticeable changes include: We use Twitter’s Stream API to pull real time tweets that contain a set of editorially chosen terms associated with four topics: freedom of information, international politics, war on terror, and national security. We then parse the tweets for those that contain links to entries from those news sources we’re interested in, and then we list the most recent tweet and stories. Regarding the methodology: Ideological rankings come from a 2016 study on the political stances of news outlets by the American Association for Public Opinion Research. Not all of the news organizations featured in The Flipside were ranked in this study, so the tool does not include the toggle for those sources. The Flipside experience is a brand-sponsored initiative which will launch in conjunction with the premiere of the upcoming Hulu Original, ‘The Looming Tower’. It includes promotional ads, quotes and fact cards based on the pulitzer winning book by the same name. We strongly believe in the value this provides to our users so expect more iterations around this concept in the future! A special thanks Troy Dunham, who redesigned this experience, Michael Dorfman, who built it all, Han Su on the technical side and Honorata Zaklicki who put it all together."

We’ve all had an experience in which someone we don’t know went out of their way to help. Maybe it brightened your day when you needed it, or perhaps the gesture had a bigger effect on your life. The Good Kind will highlight these anecdotes ― no matter how big or small they may be ― as a way to elevate and celebrate the goodness that exists across the globe. HuffPost has amassed a collection of 127 stories (and counting!) submitted by our audience, from 14 countries and more than 95 different cities in the U.S. alone. Each submission is laid out on a map, pinpointing exactly where the experience took place. The stories range from feel-good moments that made someone’s day to incidents that dramatically altered a person’s life. Each story on The Good Kind is separated into a different category ― hopeful, cheerful, grateful, amazed, thoughtful and heartbroken ― which readers will be able to “vote” on as they go through. The categories are indicted by their own specific emoji on the interactive, which was designed and built by digital innovations agency, Gladeye . We’re not stopping: Users can still submit their own stories by filling out this form , emailing TheGoodKind@huffpost.com , or sharing their own anecdotes on social media with the hashtag #TheGoodKind.

    "article_content": "Executive Editor, Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post HuffPost today announced a collaboration with The Center for Investigative Reporting’s StoryWorks , to transform our original journalism into documentary theater. The production, titled “ Tomorrow, Inshallah ,” was inspired by the groundbreaking Islamophobia Tracker created by Rowaida Abdelaziz and Christopher Mathias. The main characters are based on people interviewed by Rowaida and Christopher during their ongoing reporting on this topic, and each performance will be followed by an interactive community discussion. The Islamophobia Tracker was launched in the wake of the terror attacks in Paris and mass shooting in San Bernardino, California ― and amidst a surge in anti-Muslim rhetoric from U.S. politicians. The purpose of the project, which ran throughout 2016, was to document the wave of hate against American Muslims using news reports and first-hand accounts. “ Tomorrow, Inshallah ,” written by award-winning playwright Rehana Lew Mirza and directed by StoryWorks’ Jennifer Welch, opens at the Living Room Theatre in Kansas City and runs from July 20 to Aug. 5. Kansas City was chosen, in part, because it was one of the 25 cities on HuffPost’s Listen to America tour in 2017, and because of its large Muslim population. The play is the third foundation-funded project at HuffPost. We created the Project Zero series on neglected tropical diseases last year with support from the Gates Foundation. Our two-year global project on transforming capitalism, This New World , is funded by Atlanta-based Kendeda and Partners for a New Economy, which is an international donor collaborative based in Switzerland.

    "article_content": "HuffPost PR Team HuffPost today announced plans for its 2018 midterm election coverage, a multiplatform effort that will go beyond the daily horse race to focus on the issues and the people who matter most. You’ll find it all at the HuffPost Midterm Election HQ . Starting in October, HuffPost will embark on the next iteration of its Listen to America franchise, with a six-city town hall series, including stops in Boise, Reno, Sacramento, San Diego, Phoenix and Boulder. The HuffPost editorial team will hit the road to host conversations with local leaders, local media and members of the community, hearing directly about the issues affecting them during this election cycle. In each city, HuffPost will once again partner with local news organizations to combine resources and help elevate stories that matter to their audiences. From health care to education to the economy, the topics covered in the town hall series will also reflect major themes u ncovered during the award-winning 2017 Listen to America bus tour. In September and October of last year, HuffPost crisscrossed the country, speaking with more than 1,700 people about their communities, their concerns, their hopes and their fears. Over 300 of those interviews can now be heard in the new Listen to America interactive audio archive , launched today. The archive offers a compelling snapshot of America, as told directly to HuffPost by each individual, that is highly relevant as we head into the last stretch of this election season. “The insight and perspective we gained from the 2017 Listen to America bus tour has been invaluable to us as a news organization. As we look towards one of the most anticipated yet unpredictable election cycles in recent history, it’s crucial that we keep our focus on the people and the issues affecting them,” said HuffPost Editor in Chief Lydia Polgreen. “That approach, combined with our world class reporting and storytelling, will ensure that the HuffPost audience knows exactly what they need to, about what’s happening across the country.” From primary season through election night, the HuffPost Politics team ― including Amanda Terkel, Kevin Robillard, Daniel Marans, Jennifer Bendery and Igor Bobic ― will continue to cover the most important races, with an eye on local and national influence. They’re well-sourced on the fight for the soul of the Democratic Party as progressives try to make their mark this cycle, and their coverage will have exclusive polling on trends that cut across districts, states or party lines, and reflect the changing face of our nation. HuffPost reporters have deep expertise in areas such as political extremism and immigration, and they’ll explore recurring topics, such as the campaign workplace environment, health care and corruption. Another distinctive area of focus for HuffPost will be following district attorney races across the country as the interpretation of “justice” is fiercely debated. HuffPost will also feature premium video coverage, including the launch of an original series, “Crash the Party.” Running exclusively on Twitter and produced by HuffPost, it will give audiences a comprehensive, nonpartisan look at what it’s like to be a woman running for office in 2018. The program will follow more than 50 female candidates across the country ― and from across party lines ― as they hit the campaign trail. The series will take a human-interest approach to celebrate their successes while also seeking to understand the unique challenges these women face daily.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Kevin Costner never got to act alongside Princess Diana in a planned sequel to “The Bodyguard,” but he nonetheless has fond memories of his brief professional encounter with the late British royal. In a wide-ranging interview on “ The Howard Stern Show ” aired this week, Costner recalled approaching Diana about a potential role in a followup to the 1992 romantic drama, in which he’d starred opposite Whitney Houston . He also credited Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, with connecting them sometime around 1996. The project got shelved in the wake of Diana’s 1997 death in a car crash at age 36. “I never made that movie because I could not replace Princess Di,” Costner said. As for plot specifics, the movie would’ve taken place at least partly in Hong Kong and, in a case of art imitating life, would’ve depicted Diana’s break from the British royal family. Watch Kevin Costner discuss Princess Diana and “The Bodyguard” below. At some point in their discussions, Diana ― who would’ve been making her screen acting debut in the film ― made a very specific request, Costner recalled. “She said, ‘Is there going to be a kissing scene?’ And I said, ‘Do you want there to be one?’ And she said, ‘Yeah,’” he explained. “And I said, ‘Then we’ll do that.’” The original “Bodyguard” follows actor and singer Rachel Marron (played by Houston), who hires a former Secret Service agent, Frank Farmer (Costner), after receiving death threats from an unknown stalker. At first, the straight-laced Frank has no patience for Rachel’s diva antics. But the pair eventually fall in love ― and their budding romance puts both of their lives in danger. The “Bodyguard” soundtrack featured Houston’s chilling remake of Dolly Parton’s “I Will Always Love You,” as well as the hits “I Have Nothing” and “I’m Every Woman.” It remains the bestselling movie album of all time. It’s unclear whether Diana would’ve been playing the film’s romantic lead, as Houston did in the original. In his chat with Stern, Costner alluded to an unnamed Asian actor who was being considered as a love interest for his character. Elsewhere in the interview, Costner also opened up about an encounter he’d had with Prince William years later. “He looked at me and he said, ‘My mom fancied you,’” he said. “It was the sweetest, gentlest thing.” Costner first opened up about his long-defunct “Bodyguard” sequel plans in a 2012 chat with Anderson Cooper . The Stern interview, however, appears to be the first time he’s shared much about the plot ― as well as his potential co-star’s alleged crush. Though the “Bodyguard” sequel never saw the light of day, plans for a remake of the original film were announced in 2021. Matthew López, who made his directorial debut last year with the gay romantic comedy “Red, White & Royal Blue,” is attached to write the screenplay.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Alicia Keys , “ Stereophonic ” and the late Stephen Sondheim were among the big winners at the 2024 Tony Awards, Broadway’s biggest night. By all accounts, it’s been a robust ― some might say overstuffed ― season for live theater. But as expected, the acclaimed Sondheim revival “ Merrily We Roll Along ” emerged triumphant on Sunday, winning Best Revival of a Musical as well as Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical and Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical for stars Jonathan Groff and Daniel Radcliffe , respectively. Maleah Joi Moon and Kecia Lewis ― who star in Keys’ bio-musical “ Hell’s Kitchen ” ― rounded out the acting awards for musicals with wins for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical and Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical, respectively. As for Best Musical, the top honor went to “ The Outsiders ,” the stage adaptation of S.E. Hinton’s classic 1967 novel. The show’s director, Danya Taymor, also nabbed the Tony for Best Direction of a Musical. On the non-musical side, “Stereophonic” ― which broke records when it became the most-nominated play in Tonys history ― picked up the awards for Best Play, as well as Best Direction of a Play for director Daniel Aukin and Best Featured Actor in Play for actor Will Brill. And Sarah Paulson finally nabbed an overdue Tony for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play for her dynamite turn in “Appropriate.” Check out the full list of nominees and winners below.

    "article_content": "Alan Cumming revealed why he thinks “ X2: X-Men United ” is the “gayest film” he’s ever made. “And that’s me saying that,” the actor, who starred as Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler in the 2003 “X-Men” sequel, recently told Entertainment Weekly . He continued: “It’s got a queer director, lots of queer actors in it. I love the fact that something so mainstream and so in the comic book world is so queer.” Cumming, who is bisexual , added that films like the 2003 box-office hit “really help people understand queerness.” “[That’s] because you can address it in an artistic way, and everyone is less scared of the concept,” Cumming explained. “It’s an allegory about queerness, about people having these great gifts and really great, powerful things that they have to hide to exist. Queer people understand what that’s all about,” he added. The actor hasn’t always liked being part of the superhero film franchise, telling “The Graham Norton Show” in 2020 that he was once paid “lots of money” to fly to a fan convention in Milton Keynes, England. “There were lots of people and everyone was very nice, but you had to wait to get paid in cash — it was mortifying. I didn’t like it at all, and I felt like a bit of a whore,” he said. In a blog post on his website , Cumming wrote that he had never heard about the X-Men prior to “X2.” “The character is really interesting, the message of the film (tolerance of others who are different from us) was very timely and unusual for a Hollywood blockbuster, but the real drag was having to spend over four hours a day having two men poke my face,” he wrote. “Then there were the harnesses for the tail and for flying, the feet, the hands — which made going to the loo a group effort, the teeth, the lenses, oh, God, don’t get me started,” he added. “When I got the press reel of all my ‘X2’ TV interviews I realized that I had gone ’round the world just moaning on every talk show.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "The shooter who killed five people at an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado , pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal hate crimes and gun violations. Anderson Lee Aldrich, 24, entered into a deal with prosecutors to accept 74 federal charges for the November 2022 massacre at Club Q. Prosecutors decided not to pursue the death penalty in an agreement that was announced in January. Aldrich will now serve 55 concurrent life sentences and an additional 190 years of imprisonment. U.S. District Judge Charlotte Sweeney, the first openly gay federal judge in Colorado, accepted this agreement at the end of the sentencing hearing. Sweeney also noted that restitution will be required for the victims and will be determined at a later date. “The admission that these were hate crimes is important to the government, and it’s important to the community of Club Q,” said federal prosecutor Alison Connaughty. Connaughty added that Club Q, which had been open for 22 years prior to the shooting, was more than just a bar in Colorado Springs, a conservative city. “It’s a special gathering place for anyone who needed community and anyone who needed that safe place,” she said. “We met people who said, ‘This venue saved my life, and I was able to feel normal again.’” Last summer, Aldrich pleaded guilty to 50 charges at the state level and received more than 2,000 years in prison, one of the longest sentences in Colorado history. The shooter is currently serving the first of five consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. Ashtin Gamblin, who was shot nine times at Club Q, spoke at today’s hearing and asserted that Aldrich should be sentenced to death, even if the punishment isn’t carried out. Gamblin remembered her friend Daniel Ashton, who was the first person killed in the massacre. “I am alive today because of him,” she said. Just before midnight on Nov. 19, 2022, Aldrich wielded an assault weapon and opened fire on patrons of the popular LGBTQ+ nightclub, killing five people and injuring more than 19. The Department of Justice described the shooting as a “willful, deliberate, malicious and premeditated attack” motivated by Aldrich’s animus toward LGBTQ+ people. During hearings in last year’s state case, prosecutors found that Aldrich ran a website that posted a “neo-Nazi white supremacist” shooting training video. A police detective separately testified that the shooter used homophobic and racist slurs while playing video games online and posted an image of a rifle scope pointed at a Pride parade. Public defenders said that Aldrich is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns, according to court documents. A close friend of Aldrich’s told NBC that he believes the shooter is “trolling” the courts and media in order to “make it as much of a show and a mockery and just confusing for everybody involved.” Prosecutors said that Aldrich had visited Club Q at least six times before the shooting with evidence from their credit card statements, scans of their identification at the bar, and interviews with people who had met Aldrich there. The shooter said that their mother had previously forced them to go to the LGBTQ club “against” their will and “sort of forced that culture” on them. An acquaintance told investigators that Aldrich said their mother, Laura Voepel, is nonbinary. Colorado Springs District Attorney Michael Allen said that the threat of the death penalty was a “big part of what motivated the defendant” to plead guilty to the state charges of hate crimes and gun violations. The case’s finale comes after several weeks of mounting threats to LGBTQ+ people and events during Pride Month by right-wing agitators. This year marks the third in a row of record-breaking proposals of anti-LGBTQ bills in state legislatures. Kristen Clarke, the Department of Justice’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, said in a press conference after Aldrich’s sentencing that fighting hate crimes is a top priority. She said the department was compelled to take up the case in order to make clear that it was a “hate-motivated mass shooting.” “We know that today’s severe sentence can’t bring loved ones, heal injuries or dissipate the lingering trauma, but today’s sentencing should send a loud message,” Clarke said. “We will not tolerate hate in our country, and purveyors of bias-motivated violence will be held accountable for their actions. Those who seek to consummate their hate-filled ideas through violence better think twice,” she continued. This month, the Colorado Republican Party sent a call to burn all Pride flags. In New York City, more than 150 Pride flags at the Stonewall National Monument were vandalized for the second year in a row. And drag events at libraries and restaurants have been targeted by bomb threats in Alaska , Texas , New York and Massachusetts . Last year, there were at least 145 incidents of harassment, vandalism and assault directed at LGBTQ+ people and events during Pride Month, according to a report from GLAAD, an LGBTQ+ media advocacy group.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost As they gear up for their first wedding anniversary next month, Scott and Mark Hoying are embarking on a new creative endeavor that they hope will both strengthen their union and boost the morale of kids of all ages who feel like they don’t fit in. Last month, the couple unveiled their debut children’s book, “ How Lucky Am I? ” It’s a heartwarming tale about a mayfly as it wings its way toward self-fulfillment and acceptance in a brief ― but extraordinary ― life. Scott, known globally as a member of the Grammy-winning a cappella group Pentatonix, said he and his now-husband dreamt up “How Lucky Am I?” while cooking dinner at their Los Angeles home toward the latter half of 2019. As Scott began retrieving ingredients, he caught sight of a fly that wound up making its way into the freezer. True to form, Scott said, Mark opened the freezer door to set the fly free. It was then the pair realized that the insect’s near-death experience could be seen as a poignant metaphor about living life in the moment and without regrets. The two men also felt it would give them a chance to share elements of their own love story, which began in 2017. “We thought: If a mayfly can live for just 24 hours, what would it want to do in its lifetime? The whole purpose of a mayfly’s existence is to find their mate, to carry on their lineage,” said Mark, a musician and model who originally hails from Seattle. “We wanted the story to parallel our own life experiences ― about us falling in love, getting married and wanting to start a family.” Scott felt similarly, and incorporated some of the couple’s July 2023 wedding vows ― in which they pledged to “adventure side by side” and “talk for hours, laugh and cry” ― into the book, which features colorful illustrations by artist Steph Lew . “We wanted a little piece of our wedding day to live on, so we can tell our future kids their dads’ vows are in the book,” Scott said. “How Lucky Am I?” is not the Hoyings’ first creative collaboration. The pair have teamed up in the recording studio together several times, including on “ Thank You ,” an original track off of Pentatonix’s 2020 holiday album, “ We Need a Little Christmas .” To ensure that their book felt musical, the men perform in duet on an accompanying single, also titled “How Lucky Am I?” Of course, the Hoyings are conscious of the fact that “How Lucky Am I?” is being released at a time when many LGBTQ+ writers are under fire , and when conservatives have gotten many queer-themed books banned . Never once, however, did they consider diluting the book’s all-inclusive message, or obscuring the fact that it was written by a gay couple. “We want to incorporate queer elements into everything that we do,” Scott said. “When you’re a kid who feels different and there are no stories in mainstream media about who you are, you start to think: ‘Is my story worth being told? Do I belong?’ Which is so heartbreaking to us.” Scott and Mark have been vocal about their hope of having children , and to that end, “How Lucky Am I?” is dedicated to their “sweet little mayfly on the way.” While the process of finding a surrogate has taken longer than they anticipated, the pair say they are now “so close” to becoming first-time dads. As for the values they hope to instill in their future offspring, Mark says that gratitude is paramount. “We want to encourage our kids to celebrate life with the people who mean the most to them, and to cherish the relationships they cultivate along the way,” he said. “Love is at the center of everything, so being grateful for the people in your life is important.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer For LGBTQ+ employees at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, what used to be a haven now feels like a nightmare — and it only took one fearmongering rallying cry from a parent. In a Facebook post from March 9, Clay Yarbrough, the father of a child enrolled at Space Camp, urged parents to pull their children from the program and started a smear campaign against a camp counselor named Molly Bowman. Why? Because she’s trans. As a bisexual woman who has struggled with her identity for years, I’m pretty tired of rhetoric that not only makes queer people question our own worth, but frequently makes us, especially members of the trans community, feel unsafe. As I watched all of this play out in the news, I knew I had to get the story from those who hadn’t yet been included in the conversation. Though the post included no evidence or credible allegations of wrongdoing on Bowman’s part, the crux of Yarbrough’s argument hinged on the idea that Bowman could do something wrong — a possibility that, of course, isn’t exclusive to the LGBTQ+ community. Yarbrough misgendered and used slurs against Bowman online, his post amassing comments that made unfounded accusations that she and the rest of the LGBTQ+ counselors had behaved inappropriately. The group dissected Bowman’s personal social media pages, and even her Amazon wish list, in their attempts to pull something from nothing. Yarbrough’s post blew up with over 6,000 shares, garnering the attention of right-wing groups and politicians. Moms For Liberty Alabama tweeted Yarbrough’s Facebook post with the comment : “Do not send your children to Space Camp in Huntsville, AL. The entire program has gone woke! Girls as young as 7 attend Space Camp and this is what they are exposed to! Protect your kids!!!! ” Given that the age range for the camp begins at 9, the group was already off to a rocky start. Meanwhile, the right-wing account Libs of TikTok misgendered Bowman and repeated the baseless claim that Bowman “went into the girl’s showers while they were changing.” Bowman’s supporters began researching Yarbrough. Commenters on his Facebook post raised questions about Yarbrough’s own alleged criminal past, which he dismissed on March 11 as irrelevant. After the backlash, Yarbrough wrote on Facebook: “Oh and because I have a mug shot on the internet and have been arrested before then I am a axe murdered with 12 criminal records, in a place I haven’t been since I was 23, IM ALSO ARMED AND DANGEROUS.” He also posted a comment that read: “The crap is hitting the fan and I just spoiled the devils plans to hurt some kids!!! Major change is coming and the GOD I worship is still in charge and still more powerful than anything they can throw at me!!” The Facebook conversation caused so many ripples that local conservative officials quickly weighed in. “I call on the Center to immediately remove this individual and open a safety review to consider the potential harm and damages they have inadvertently caused children,” Rep. Dale Strong (R-Ala.) wrote in a statement . Rep. Gary Palmer, another Alabama Republican, posted a similar sentiment on March 11, writing on social media: “The situation currently unfolding at @SpaceCampUSA is unacceptable. When parents send their kids to Space Camp in Alabama, they should be confident they are going to a safe, educational environment.” The Space & Rocket Center said in a statement that the organization conducts extensive background checks on prospective employees, so Bowman wouldn’t have landed the job to begin with if she had a criminal record . The space center said in the statement that she has not been reported for misconduct . On March 20, Alabama state Rep. Mark Gidley (R) attempted to amend House Bill 130, a lso known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill , which would ban discussions of gender identity and sexual orientation in public school classrooms through grade 12. (Under current law, discussion of those topics is only forbidden through fifth grade.) The amendment, which would have specified that Space Camp is subject to those same rules, died in committee, and HB 130 was likewise killed in mid-May. On March 15, Rocket Center CEO Kimberly Robinson sent an internal memo to staff, which an employee shared with me. The memo described how employees had been harassed and how “people on our staff have also received threats over email and phone.” Patricia Ammons, senior director of public and media relations at the Center, told me over email that Robinson “wanted to send a message expressing her care and concern for our employees’ safety and well-being.” Following an investigation, the Rocket Center said in a March 29 public statement that “there is no evidence of inappropriate behavior or malfeasance between any Space Camp staff and student campers.” The statement said the Rocket Center provides private areas for campers to change, shower and use the restroom, and no staffers had been in those areas. Four Rocket Center employees told me that the center fostered an inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ employees, but that it has soured somewhat since the incidents of harassment. “It seemed like a very queer-positive place, especially for Alabama,” said one. “My department has a ton of LGBTQ+ people in it and most of us feel a bit hung out to dry by higher-ups.” Another employee said they’d feel better if the center made a “definitive statement” against anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, instead of the “HR bullshit we always get at jobs.” When asked about its support for LGBTQ+ workers, a Rocket Center representative said: “Space Camp i s and will remain an equal-opportunity employer adhering to all state and federal laws regulating hiring practices. We are an apolitical organization with no social agenda. Our singular mission is to inspire and educate.” The Rocket Center conducted an internal investigation and a review of on-campus footage, and concluded that Bowman had done nothing wrong. But she was still transferred to a new department — something that the first employee claims amounted to “punish[ing] a trans employee for online weirdos being mad she’s trans.” As these trolls have gotten more boisterous and bold, Bowman and her peers have grown concerned for their physical safety. “As LGBTQ+ folks, we are just trying to do a job that we are underpaid for,” an employee told me. “We’re not indoctrinating your kids or being inappropriate.” Recently, there have been “many comments from guests regarding our looks and religion,” another said. “It’s a mix of hate and love, but more hate lately.” “Many [employees] have left because they are scared for their lives, regardless if they are trans or not,” this employee said. “I would feel safer with metal detectors. It’s reasonable for a place that is part of the [NASA] arsenal and that has kids to have metal detectors.” When I asked what safety precautions the center has taken to protect employees and keep them in the loop about any developing safety issues, a representative told me: “We take the safety of our campers, visitors, and staff extremely seriously. As reported [in the center’s post-investigation statement], we worked with the Huntsville Police Department to increase patrols through our campus and engaged a private security firm in the days and weeks following the social media post with accusations against an employee.” The employees told me they hadn’t seen much change, beyond noticing police cars on patrol every so often. The most concerning safety risk, multiple employees told me, was when someone shot a BB gun at the windshield of an employee’s car toward the end of March. The queer employees said the incident spurred fear for themselves and the kids who visit the center — the very children whom all these agitated conservatives are ostensibly trying to protect. The Huntsville Police Department would neither confirm nor deny that a police report was filed, citing confidentiality restrictions. The Rocket Center said it couldn’t confirm that an employee’s car had been shot at. One of my sources speculated that the center’s leadership is worried about losing funding, and is therefore opting not to confirm any specific threats or violence. The employees I spoke to don’t feel like management is showing up for them when they feel particularly vulnerable. One employee told me that a recent policy change prohibits employees from wearing any pins other than those provided by NASA. Many of the non-NASA pins that employees wore were Pride- and pronoun-related. “Regarding pins staffers may wear, it has been a long-standing policy that pins and other embellishments focus on and don’t distract from our mission,” a Rocket Center representative said. According to the workers I talked to, their pins weren’t previously policed. All in all, I believe that the center missed an opportunity to really stand up for Bowman and queer employees as a whole. Staff there are limited in what they’re allowed to say, and the political pressure brought against them has been significant. Still, the higher-ups have a duty to protect all employees, especially given the widely held attitudes about queer people in the state of Alabama. “Shame on the transphobic politicians that want to kick out the LGBTQ+ [employees],” one employee I spoke to said. In my opinion, calling for someone’s termination without any facts to back up that action is irresponsible at best and blatant discrimination at worst. If the politicians who are so up in arms about a trans person working at the Space & Rocket Center want to protect children ― as they claim ― then they need to protect all children. Keep religion-based ideology out of the classroom and out of integral programs like Space Camp. Allow for safe spaces for queer kids to feel seen and worthy of education and love. The separation of church and state exists for a reason, and dismantling that freedom is inherently un-American. It’s about time that political leaders in this country stop weaponizing religion to justify agendas based on personal bigotry. If one person’s hateful comments hadn’t snowballed, and politicians and hate groups hadn’t bullied Bowman , maybe she wouldn’t now feel like she needs to pack up and leave her state — along with her job, friends and family — to feel safe. But that’s what she feels she has to do. “ Due to recent events and media coverage I no longer feel safe living in Alabama,” she wrote in a note on a GoFundMe drive. “This move is not just a change of scenery; it’s a crucial step towards rebuilding my life and securing a stable future.” Queer people should be allowed to live, work and thrive in every single state.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life From TikTok Shop and targeted Instagram ads to influencer hauls and product roundups, our modern commercial landscape allows consumers to spend half their paychecks in mere minutes. “Online shopping makes impulse purchases easier than ever,” said Jack Howard , head of money wellness at Ally Financial. “Stores are literally right at our fingertips. In the moment, buying exactly what you want, when you want it, feels great. But after? That’s when the regret starts seeping in, and it’s all too common.” She noted that in a recent Ally survey, over 1 in 3 shoppers said they are likely to buy something impulsively to feel better about themselves, but only half said they felt happy after doing so. To combat this toxic temptation, many consumers are taking a completely different approach: slow shopping. “Slow shopping is a financial trend that pushes people to be more intentional with their spending and purchases, focusing on being more mindful with what you’re buying, why you’re buying it and how much you’re spending on the purchase,” said consumer finance and budgeting expert Andrea Woroch . “Rather than jumping on impulse to buy something as soon as a want or desire arises, slow shopping encourages you to think through the purchase in order to make the best buying decision for your budget, giving you time to evaluate need, cost and value.” There’s an emphasis on quality over quantity as you shop with intentionality ― the opposite of impulse buying. Through this practice, you consider your budget and financial situation, and appraise your purchases as investments. “Slow shopping is essentially taking a more deliberate and mindful approach to shopping,” said Bola Sokunbi, the founder of Clever Girl Finance . “This means making thoughtful purchases by taking your time and assessing the reason for the purchase, eliminating impulsive or rushed purchases and in turn, minimizing regret and allowing you to save more money.” “Slow shopping can help you dodge impulse purchases driven by emotions or fear of missing out on a deal,” Woroch noted. “This trend also gives you time to shop around, compare prices, look for coupons, wait for a deal to drop and also save up for the purchase so you don’t put it on a credit card that can drive you into debt.” She extolled the value of properly timing your purchases by snagging personal gadgets around Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday, investing in new home appliances during Maytag Month, and buying mattresses and furniture over holiday weekends like Memorial Day. “You can score big discounts on seasonal merchandise by waiting for sales to hit around mid- to end-of-season,” Woroch said. “There’s a better time to buy just about everything, and [using] slow shopping can help you time your purchase right to get the best deals, especially if you know in advance when certain sales are coming up as you can then prepare in advance to think about what you really need, how much you can afford to spend and where to shop.” Slow shopping can also give you more time to save up money or rack up credit card points and cash back from buying the essentials, so that when it comes time to make that special purchase, you don’t even have to pay as much. “You can be more methodical about your purchases, whether it’s saving for a car, a home, or even a vacation to Europe,” said Brian Steiner, executive director of the life insurance and financial planning nonprofit Life Happens . “It’s a good way to assess your finances and not overextend your budget because of things like lifestyle creep or societal pressure. It makes you think about what you can afford, not just about what you want at the moment.” As people get older and their discretionary income rises, there’s a tendency to spend more money on things that they previously would’ve seen as unnecessary luxuries ― a phenomenon known as “lifestyle creep.” In the age of social media, that spending evolution can spiral out of control as consumers see the splurge items and experiences their peers are buying, and come to perceive these things as a right rather than a choice. Woroch pointed to a recent survey from Bread Financial , which found that 62% of Gen Z consumers admit to spending unnecessary money to keep up with trends they see online, and 79% say that social media influences their guilty-pleasure purchases. The result is more regretful purchases and waste. “Because social media and other social influences can often lead to overspending and impulsive purchases, slow shopping can help you break this bad money habit and help you avoid FOMO,” Woroch noted. Freeing yourself from this harmful social media cycle is just one of many potential mental health benefits from slow shopping. In contrast to “retail therapy,” being more mindful about how you use your hard-earned cash reduces financial anxiety and spending regrets. “By taking that pause and saving money on unnecessary purchases, you ultimately begin fostering more joyful, intentional spending habits, instead of instant gratification and regret,” Howard said. “Asking yourself ‘Why am I spending money on this specific purchase?’ before hitting ‘pay now’ gives you ― the real you ― time to catch up to your first impulse and carefully think through your purchase. This practice of asking ‘why’ before you spend money helps incorporate mindfulness into your daily routine and, with consistency, empowers you to own your money story.” According to a recent study from Intuit Credit Karma, 24% of Americans say their emotional spending ― that is, buying things to cope with emotional highs and lows ― is out of control, leading many to overspend and even go into debt. “By slow shopping, you’re less likely to let a passing feeling of happiness, boredom, or depression (the leading causes of emotional spending reported in the survey) motivate you to spend money you’d be better off saving,” Courtney Alev, consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma , told HuffPost. Although personal finance experts point to many potential benefits from slow shopping, the concept is not without its drawbacks. “Thinking through your purchases thoroughly can be time-consuming, especially if you are an overthinker,” Sokunbi said. “You might miss out on sales or specials tied to limited time frames, which in turn may cause you to pay more when you finally decide on your purchase. But minimizing regrets and thoughtful spending far outweigh the downsides.” There is indeed a risk that you might miss out on a limited-time deal, but those fleeting discounts should not be the main drivers of your spending choices. “Deals will come and go, so just wait for the next sale cycle if you decide you want the item!” Woroch urged. The same goes for concerns about inventory running out. You can always sign up for notifications when the item comes back in stock. “I’m the world’s slowest shopper and was eyeing a bed for my daughter for about a year when I finally decided to make the purchase, and after much comparison shopping and budget consideration, I realized the item was out of stock,” Woroch explained. “I signed up for the in-stock alert and got a message about a month later that it was available in the size and color I was looking for. Good news, too, because it was still on sale!” Restrictive practices like slow shopping can also reach their own extreme, so it’s important to focus on balance. “If you take slow shopping too slowly, you may find yourself obsessing about every purchase, even those you may need to make,” Alev said. Another potential downside of slow shopping is that it might distract you from exploring the fundamental causes of your financial habits. Resist the urge to let quippy personal finance trends get in the way of a more holistic approach. “As with anything, what works for one person’s finances doesn’t always work for the next person,” Howard said. “It’s important to have a game plan when it comes to spending and saving, but you should ultimately focus on implementing habits that work best for you. Slow shopping is a helpful mindset, and I’d encourage anyone who’s become a serial overspender to try to pinpoint when and why they picked up this behavior, digging for the root issue behind the spending.” She noted that overspending can be related to social pressure, FOMO, the temptation of status symbols like designer handbags, and even the rise of “little treat” culture . But there are deeper influences as well. “Early memories of money often have an impact on current spending habits,” Howard said. “For example, if your family didn’t have the disposable income that you do now, you may overspend as an adult to compensate for what you missed out on as a child. Or if your parents practiced ‘retail therapy,’ you might also use that as a coping mechanism or distraction. Uncovering how your money story began is the first step to start contextualizing spending habits to inform a personalized, effective strategy to avoid overspending.” Once you’ve resolved to try slow shopping to improve your spending habits and cut down on frivolous purchases and waste, you might feel overwhelmed wondering where to begin. “If you are new to slow spending, pick an area of your finances to start with ― clothing, personal care items or groceries,” Sokunbi recommended. “Set up your shopping lists, assess and review them, compare prices and decide what purchase you’d like to make and for what reason.” You don’t have to immediately apply this approach to every aspect of your spending, and you might have to figure out what timing works best for you. “I often recommend the ‘48-hour rule,’ or waiting a full two days from that first impulse to purchase before following through with buying it,” Howard said. “And yes, this applies even if it’s on sale! This 48-hour window allows just enough time to calm your emotions and that perceived urgency, which adds clarity in determining if you really need or actually want the item.” She recommended practicing “values-based spending” ― buying only the things and experiences that align with your values. “The first step in this process is identifying what matters most to you above all else,” Howard explained. “For example, my values are creating generational wealth, nature and sustainability, experiences, and design that is really beautiful. Your values should really reflect what brings you joy and purpose. After you have identified your values, use it to guide your decisions the next time you are tempted to spend.” Ask yourself honestly whether a discretionary purchase supports your values. That way you will spend money on what is authentic to you and promotes your happiness. Howard also recommended putting together a practical budget with different categories that you can reference and prioritize. “Setting aside a percentage of your paycheck as ‘guilt-free spending money’ is another easy way to stick to a budget, while still giving some freedom for fun purchases,” she said. For Steiner, slow shopping is about fostering a sense of certainty and confidence ― no matter what your individual needs are. “Whether it’s a new set of golf clubs or a big vacation, doing extensive research and understanding the investment proves to be beneficial in the end because you can be certain what works for you financially without breaking the bank,” he said. “Remember that slow shopping looks different for everyone. How two people slow shop could be two different timelines. Be comfortable with however much time you need to make a smart decision.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life “I’ve just been so stressed lately with this big project!” You may think you are bonding with colleagues over your demanding work load, but if you are constantly boasting about how hard your job is, you are “stress bragging,” according to management researchers. And it could be harming your professional reputation. In a recent study published in Personnel Psychology, Jessica Rodell , a researcher from the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business, along with her colleagues, found that people who brag about feeling stressed at work are seen as less competent and likable by their co-workers. “We want other people to like us and think that we’re smart. But if we say it directly, then we innately kind of know it’s not going to work,” Rodell told HuffPost, adding that stress bragging can be an indirect attempt to communicate that you are a valuable hard worker, “but it doesn’t work.” If you work long enough, you will encounter a stress bragger who needs to impress you with their challenging, tough job ― or you might be the stress bragger yourself. “A large reason why stress bragging commonly happens is that we still live in a society that glorifies being busy,” said Shannon Garcia, a psychotherapist at States of Wellness Counseling based in Illinois and Wisconsin. “If we are pushing ourselves to the max and beyond at work, we want people to know about it.” In an experiment part of Rodell’s study, 360 participants were asked to read different scenarios about a fictional colleague who had just returned from a work conference, with one of the scenarios being about a stress bragger. This co-worker complained that the conference was “just one more thing on my full plate. And I was already stressed to the max … you have no idea the stress that I am under.” Participants rated that colleague as significantly less warm and competent than another employee who simply said it was “good” but also stressful, or one who boasted about how awesome the conference was. “Even though someone may think, ‘Oh, this is conveying that I have a lot of responsibility and demands at work,’ what someone else is seeing with stress bragging is, ‘You’re not good enough to keep up with your job,’” Rodell said. “And the overt, explicit kind of direct talking about it as if it’s a badge of honor is the part that lowers the likability. We value humility and relatability with others, and that bragging makes us like people less,” she added. This behavior has the potential for long-term negative consequences; participants in the experiment said they were less likely to go out of their way to help a stress bragger, for example. “They’re not going to offer to help you with a project or speak highly about you to somebody else,” Rodell said. The takeaway from the study is not that you cannot ever admit to feeling stressed at work, but to be considerate of how you express it. Psychologist and executive coach Lauren Appio said stress bragging might be a way for people to communicate their needs indirectly “and hope someone else will pick up on them without having to do the hard or embarrassing thing of speaking up more transparently.” But people often “chafe” at indirect communication and can become “annoyed that you won’t just come out with it,” Appio noted. So instead of doing passive-aggressive stress bragging, she suggested trying to directly communicate your experience with, “I’m overwhelmed and really need to adjust my workload” or “I’m really proud I got tapped for this big project!” And remember that if you’re stressed, it’s likely your co-workers are, too. So don’t forget to ask them how they are doing. That’s a key difference between a draining vent session and a commiserating two-way conversation with a colleague. “Statements like, ‘It’s a lot today, isn’t it?’ or ‘It’s been a hard week’ are both ways to invite that they may also be feeling the pressure of work,” Garcia said. “Acknowledging co-workers’ efforts and challenges shows that you recognize everyone has their own burdens.” And if you work with a stress bragger, you need to be vigilant about protecting your energy because stress bragging has a “contagion effect” on workplaces, Rodell said. In another experiment for Rodell’s study, 187 pairs of employees were surveyed over weeks about the stresses of working with each other. The employees who worked closely with stress-bragging colleagues reported higher levels of personal stress and burnout. “The more you are with somebody who’s bragging about stress, the more stressed you are likely to feel,” Rodell said, adding that in worst cases, it can create a workplace where it becomes an expectation to be stressed and to value that stress. In this way, stress bragging has higher stakes than one disgruntled co-worker — it can start to take down and lower the energies of a whole team. “If you’re already stressed and your co-worker starts unloading about their stress, you may not have the emotional capacity to hear it. So you may feel frustrated and resentful toward the stress bragger for adding more to your emotional plate,” Appio said. So for the sake of your own wellbeing, it’s important to walk away or redirect the conversation back to work if your debriefs with peers keep turning into stress-bragging sessions. “What this is showing is we internalize [stress] without realizing [it],” Rodell said about her study. “And so we should be careful not to overly indulge the stress braggart, because we will take on some of that stress over time.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life When you are hunting for a job, you know how hard it can be to find a position that can boost your career. But even after you secure an offer, your work is not done. You need to think carefully about which city the job is in. That’s because, even if you get your dream job, its location can determine the size of your wallet ― especially if it requires you to make a pricey move. “Before you say ‘yes’ to a job, it’s essential to understand the cost of living in another city, especially if your current location is more affordable,” career strategist Ana Goehner told HuffPost. “You may need more than the salary you agree upon to cover your cost of living.” And in the United States, there are cities where it will be significantly easier for young professionals to get ahead in their careers, according to a new report by personal finance company WalletHub. For the ranking, more than 180 U.S. cities were considered on 26 key metrics. These ranged from the availability of entry-level jobs and unemployment rates to the average monthly starting salary and housing affordability. Based on the criteria, there was a clear winner and loser for where young professionals should build their careers. Here’s what to know: Atlanta beat out the rest of U.S. cities for young professionals due to its high median income growth rate, abundant job opportunities, and high job satisfaction. “The city offers plenty of entry-level job opportunities, a high number of quality employers, and a strong average starting salary of $4,342” per month, according to WalletHub analyst Cassandra Happe. “Its vibrant atmosphere is reflected in a young, educated population and high rankings for fun and entertainment, making it appealing for singles and young professionals.” Here are the other top nine cities: To grow your career, you need the ability to have a thriving network and booming businesses that can pay salaries that match your value. Atlanta is one of those cities for new graduates and emerging professionals. But regardless of which city you live in, it’s important to ask yourself: “Is this the center of gravity for where things happen in this industry or company? It’s a lot easier to rub shoulders with the decision-makers if it is,” suggested Gorick Ng, a Harvard career adviser and creator of the “ How To Say It ” flashcard professional communication series. New York City was last in the ranking due to its high cost of living, lack of affordable housing, and relatively few entry-level job openings, which present high hurdles for new professionals. “The high cost of living and lengthy commute times make it particularly challenging for recent graduates entering the job market,” Happe said. If you live in New York City, good luck finding an apartment that will not eat up your whole paycheck. The median asking rent in New York City has risen by 1.7% year over year to $3,700 in April, according to a recent report by StreetEasy, a real estate company. Emiko Powers, 24, works as an assistant to three NBC anchors in New York City. When she first moved to the city in 2022 for the company’s page program, she was earning $18.50 an hour and fully supporting herself. “It’s a lot more convenient to live in New York when you have a lot of money, because you can pay for Uber s and moving and all these different things,” Powers said. “Whereas if you don’t have money, you’re paying for it in other ways where it’s taking a toll on your body.” Winning the city’s affordable housing lottery with a roommate “has definitely taken a weight off [her] shoulders,” she said. Here are the other nine cities that were seen as particularly challenging for new professionals to thrive in: If you want to work in a pricey city, first ask yourself: “Is this a temporary stop or my forever city?” Ng said. “If it’s your forever city because you have family or a particular attachment to the place, there’s clearly something special about this place that transcends any list,” he said. “If this is a temporary stop, however, then it’s time to ask yourself: ‘When will I know that I’ve gotten the most of this place ― and what’s my ‘next best place’?” And get a roommate. Ng said it is a lot easier to meet new people with roommates, and it can be easier to land a job if your roommate works there or knows someone who works there. In 2021, Samantha Shekian moved to New York City from New Jersey at 22 to work as a teacher on a $62,000 salary. She did not go for the “glitz and the glamour,” she said, but because of the teaching opportunities and the culture and community the city offers. To make ends meet, she splits her $2,800 Manhattan rent with her roommate, cooks most of her meals, buys thrifted clothes and is strict about paying off her credit card each week. She knew New York City would have a high cost of living, but for Shekian, it is worth it. “Having access to all those amazing museums and being right in the hub of the city is just something I’ve prioritized in my life,” Shekian said. But the world is a big place, and there’s a limit to how many sacrifices you need to endure to build your career. Powers said she does not recommend moving to an expensive city without a job lined up: “I don’t think that I would have been able to handle the stress of looking for a job, not having an income while living in a city as expensive as New York.” Use cost-of-living calculators that compare rent, groceries, gas prices, transportation, and utilities in your chosen city. You do not want to work in an expensive city that has you barely scraping by each month, Goehner said. “That won’t make you satisfied with your life and job for too long. You’ll often feel stressed over money,” she said. “If you can’t afford to pay rent, if you can’t afford to get groceries ... then I don’t think it’s worth it. Because living in that state of stress just for the city is not ideal,” Shekian said. Additionally, be mindful of the friends you hang out with, because they can make it easier or harder to stay within your budget. Powers said that, after college, some of her friends went on to make “six figures” while “I’m not even close to that.” Know that you do not need to be spending money to have a fun time. For the most part, Powers said, her local friends are in similar income brackets as she is, so she does not think, “‘I wish I could be doing that,’ because we’re all kind of just doing things that we’re able to do together.” Only you can know when it’s best to leave or stay in a city for your peace of mind and career. Powers knows she could have a better quality of life that wouldn’t be as expensive in a different city, “but I feel like the experiences that I’m gaining right now are irreplaceable and valuable.” “I don’t plan on leaving anytime soon,” Powers added. “But that’s definitely always something to keep in the back of my mind, like, ‘Is this the best place for me right now?’” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Compression cubes. Dopp kits. Garment bags. There are lots of great products on the market to help keep your suitcase organized when you travel. But one crucial type of item aids with organization and perhaps more importantly, hygiene. We’re talking about shoe bags. While some people feel comfortable simply throwing their shoes in with their clothing and other luggage items, the more germ-conscious among us might think twice. After all, do you really want the dirty bottoms of your sneakers or work shoes coming into contact with your clean clothes? “I think it is a good idea to put your shoes in something like a plastic bag from the grocery store or one of those reusable zipper bags you can buy before putting them in your suitcase,” said Philip M. Tierno , a professor of microbiology and pathology at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. He noted that the level of “germiness” in a pair of shoes depends on multiple factors, like the design of the shoes, the place where you walk in them and how often they’re washed. “If the bottom of the shoe has ridges or there’s ribbing on the side or other areas that can collect material, then think about what they’re picking up,” Tierno explained. “Depending on the city where you’re living, you’re likely walking on sidewalks and streets where people cough, spit and vomit. There’s urine, human and animal feces and a whole host of other things that are relatively germy.” Studies have shown that a single pair of shoes can contain millions of bacterial organisms, including E. coli and other disease-causing types. And in addition to the soles of your footwear, the inside area can also carry germs. “Some sweat more than others, and they carry staphylococcus aureus, which can be spread from the inside of the shoe, in addition to whatever you might find on the bottom,” Tierno noted. “The sweat also imparts odor, which can spread around the suitcase.” “People do the strangest things in public, and walking on the street, you can pick up all sorts of things that may be contaminated. But it’s still a relatively low risk of causing infection,” Tierno said. He emphasized that for most people, our immune responses and barriers like the skin tend to protect us from infection, even when we’re exposed to germs spread from our shoes. “You’d have to have it break through the skin for there to be an intrusion of many of the germs,” Tierno added. “And even if you get microorganisms on you, you’d have to pick up a lot of cells in sufficient number to cause an infection. You could step upon organisms that are dangerous, but in general, I characterize it as low risk.” Even if your risk of getting sick is low, you probably aren’t keen on the idea of mingling your clothes with your germy shoes in all their microscopic spit-, urine-, vomit- and fecal matter-covered glory. Sometimes, family members co-pack the same suitcases when they’re traveling together or share the same luggage that they’ll alternate using for separate trips. And while your suitcase might have a separate outer compartment where you can put shoes, odds are you need to utilize the inside of the bag as well. That’s where shoe bags come in. From washable packing cubes to colorful drawstring sacks, there’s no shortage of options to contain your footwear. This story was previously published on an earlier date.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life People are rarely at their best during air travel. Just look at the mounting number of in-flight altercations and other troubling incidents these days. One aspect of flying that really strikes a nerve with many travelers is seat reclining. In November, a video of a screaming match between passengers over one woman’s choice to recline went viral. Three months earlier, there was another viral clip of a passenger who used her arms to keep the seat in front of her in place during a flight from Paris to Los Angeles. Every time these incidents make headlines, there’s renewed discussion around a divisive travel question: Is it OK to recline or is it just plain rude? “This is a volatile subjec, and there are people on both sides of this debate,” Diane Gottsman , an etiquette expert and corporate trainer specializing in adult behavior, told HuffPost. But from an etiquette standpoint, is there an objective right answer to the question of whether or not to recline? Below, Gottsman and other experts break down the best practices. “Whether to recline your seat is a matter of polite awareness,” said Jodi R.R. Smith , the president of Mannersmith Etiquette Consulting. “We want to be able to maximize our comfort without inconveniencing anyone else. This is quite a challenge in the shrinking seats found nowadays on airplanes.” Some might argue that if they purchased a ticket for an airplane seat that reclines, then they have the right to take advantage of that function. But etiquette coach Tami Claytor believes this mentality highlights an important etiquette rule: “Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should do it.” “Etiquette isn’t just about which fork to use ― at its fundamental level it is thinking of others,” Claytor said. “As such, reclining your seat and interfering with someone else’s comfort violates the basic principle of etiquette.” There are situations in which reclining can be appropriate and more in line with etiquette standards, however. The most important thing is to consider the individual circumstances of your flight, your fellow passenger and yourself. “For a short flight, it would be most polite to keep your seat up unless you are certain you are not inconveniencing someone behind you,” Gottsman said. So if the seat behind yours is empty, recline all you want! If there’s a very small child, you can probably recline without encroaching into their space much as well. The same goes for premium cabins. “For those fortunate enough to be seated in first or business class, this is not an issue,” Smith added. “There is ample room to recline without impacting any other passenger’s personal space.” Otherwise, try to stay upright during short-haul flights. This makes things much easier for passengers who are very tall or want to use their laptop or drink a beverage on the tray table during the flight. “If your reclining will negatively impact the person behind you, such as someone with their knee in a brace, you should not recline,” Smith added. Reclining can also be acceptable for those passengers who are particularly tall, struggle with back problems, or need space to hold their little ones. “If the passenger is so tall they must fold themselves origami-style into the seat, a few extra inches can make a world of difference, and they may recline after take-off,” Smith said. “If the passenger is juggling a toddler on their lap, they may recline as well. If you do not need the space, such as a 5-year-old in a seat, there is no need to recline.” The rules are a bit different for long-haul flights, during which reclining is more appropriate. “If it’s a long flight, it’s unreasonable to expect each passenger not to do what they can to get comfortable,” Gottsman noted. “If it’s a red eye, sleep is important and reclining is acceptable, especially since everyone else is reclining at the same time.” There are best practices for executing your recline if you feel so inclined. “Look behind you to see if there is someone sitting in the seat directly behind,” Gottsman said. “Check for any issues such as long legs, tray table down, soda on tray, computer on tray, or a baby on their lap. Let the person know you would like to recline. If you are adamant about reclining, and there is no physical reason why you shouldn’t, it’s within reason, but only if it’s not going to physically impede or harm another person.” Be friendly and either ask if you might recline your seat or just share that you plan to recline your seat. “If the person behind you isn’t feeling quite so magnanimous and takes umbrage with your request, try negotiating a reasonable compromise such as slightly reclining your seat or only reclining for a specified period of time,” Claytor suggested. “You never know, a polite conversation could lead to a new friendship.” Take breaks from reclining or move your seat back upright when the crew distributes food and drinks, or the person behind you whips out their laptop. In order to show consideration and respect for your fellow traveler, also consider easing into the lean and going for a partial recline if possible. “Start out slow to see how you can feel comfortable without potentially going all the way back,” Gottsman advised. Another important factor in the reclining conversation is the timing of when you do it. “It certainly is not proper etiquette to recline your seat as soon as you sit while additional passengers are boarding and settling in their seat,” said Jackie Vernon-Thompson , the founder of From the Inside-Out School of Etiquette. “Reclining your seat during the boarding process, is quite inconsiderate because the back of the seat will obstruct the path and cause the passenger attempting to sit in the seat behind the reclined seat to perhaps have a challenge sitting.” Unless there are major delays while the plane is parked, your pre-takeoff reclining time will likely be short-lived anyway. “The Federal Aviation Administration considers takeoff and landing two very critical stages in a flight,” Vernon-Thompson said. “Therefore, they mandate that all seats are placed in an upright position. If reclined at those stages, and there is an emergency, it may prevent passengers from having easy access to the aisle and/or the seat could aggressively slam forward.” And even if you recline later at a more appropriate time, the flight crew might ask you to move back up. “Be mindful that at any time during the flight, the pilot and/or flight attendants reserve the right to require all seats in the upright position,” Vernon-Thompson said. “It is of course proper etiquette to adhere to the request. After all, it is in the best interest of all passengers and crew members.” Remember that there are other ways to make your flight experience easier that go beyond the hot-button issue of reclining. “Buy a seat with extra leg room, dress comfortably so you can move about in your seat without feeling the need to recline on a short trip,” Gottsman suggested. The main thing to keep in mind is that you’re in a relatively small communal space, not your own living room recliner. And you and your fellow passengers are all in this together. “Airplanes these days are tight, so a bit of consideration can go a long way in making everyone more comfortable,” Smith said. “Before I board a plane, with all of the annoyance and indignities, I remind myself that I will be in a chair, in the sky, and how much faster it will be than other modes of transportation. A bit of perspective can shift your attitude toward the positive.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Picture this: Your manicure is on its last legs, and your knee-jerk reaction is to start picking it off. Sure, it may seem like you’re just getting rid of unsightly nail polish, but really, your nails are suffering — perhaps even more than they would from biting. “Think of your nails as a notepad, and imagine that each time you pick off your polish, you’re tearing pages out of the notepad,” said Los Angeles-based manicurist Vanessa Sanchez McCullough with the nail brand CND. Here’s what experts want you to know about picking off nail polish. First, let’s look at how nails are structured. The nail plate is the hard, keratinized structure composed of layers of nail cells, or onychocytes — and this is what most people refer to as “the nail,” said Dr. Dana Stern , a board-certified dermatologist and the founder of nail care brand Dr. Dana . Then there’s the nail bed, a soft-tissue structure under the nail plate that carries a rich supply of nerves and blood. The “root” of the nail is called the nail matrix. It’s known as the nail-producing center and includes the lunula, the partially visible half-moon at the base of the nail plate. Finally, the cuticles are directly over the nail matrix and serve as a protective seal that prevents moisture and infections from entering the nail unit, Stern explained. It may be difficult to resist the urge to pick off your nail polish, but McCullough said that this habit is one of the easiest ways to damage your nails. “I have experienced clients who think they are peeling just polish, but in fact are peeling chunks of their natural nail, leaving the nail bed exposed,” she explained. Not only can this be painful, but exposed nail beds can also make the nails more vulnerable to environmental conditions that might cause further damage. Stern agreed, adding that when you apply nail polish, it adheres to the top layers of nail cells, which can already be fragile and prone to peeling and sloughing. “When nail polish is picked off, these top layers of onychocytes can also be inadvertently removed along with the polish, leaving the nail with an uneven surface and white patches called keratin granulations,” she said. Though keratin granulations aren’t inherently harmful, they are a sign of dehydration, and treatment may require you to take a break from nail polish in general. What’s more, picking off nail polish can cause a condition called onycholysis, in which the nail plate separates from the nail bed. “I have seen women cause onycholysis because the repetitive peeling is traumatic to the nail,” said McCullough. “The nail then needs to be cut back short, and it can be really painful.” In addition to removing the superficial layers of nail cells and leading to surface irregularities, the nail plate can thin out over time if the picking is continuous and chronic . “Thinned-out nails no longer have any structure,” warned McCullough. “They will likely snag on the simplest things, like socks, shirts or your hair, and you’ll likely have to keep your nails trimmed short to avoid this from happening.” That’s not all. Picking off nail polish can cause your nail beds to appear red and can lead to sensitivities to both hot and cold temperatures, said McCullough, explaining that it also prevents longevity with gel manicures since gel polish works best on healthy nails. “Traditional nail polish is a bit less damaging to pick off because there’s less adhesion compared to gel polish,” McCullough said. Gel base coats, in particular, are formulated to adhere to the keratin in the natural nails and remain until they’re properly removed with acetone. That’s why gel polishes are well loved for being long-lasting. So if you pick off a gel polish, you’re likely picking off pieces of your nail that are firmly bonded to the base coat — which is a recipe for onycholysis. It’s unlikely that your nails are forever doomed if you had one bad episode of peeling off polish. But if you’re engaging in the habit repetitively, it can become an issue. “Each time you pick, you’re peeling off layers of your nail plate, and there are only so many layers to work with,” said Stern. It’s important to give your nails time to recover, and this will vary depending on the severity of the damage. Stern explained that keratin granulations typically grow out as the nail regrows, usually over a few weeks. But keep in mind that toenails have a much slower growth rate than fingernails and may need months to recover. If your nails are damaged as a result of peeling off nail polish, there are some at-home remedies to consider. One is exfoliation. “When your skin is dry and peeling, you reach for the nearest loofah or brush to exfoliate the dead cells — the same concept is true of the nail,” Stern said. “If you were to look at a peeling, picked-at nail under the microscope, you would see that the nail cells are detached, lifted and separating.” Reaching for a nail exfoliation product can help expedite recovery. Cuticle oils can also be a big help since nails, like hair, are less prone to breakage if they’re properly conditioned. “Keeping your nail plate and cuticles conditioned will promote healthy nail growth and help keep the nails looking and feeling better,” McCullough said. Finally, give your nails a breather from any polish. “It’s always a good idea to let the nails recover before jumping back into nail cosmetics,” said Stern, who also recommended wearing gloves when using home cleaners or washing dishes to prevent further dehydration and damage.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost A lot goes into why we choose our sneakers when there are so many identical ones on the market. If you like an expensive pair of shoes — such as these VEJA Esplar sneakers, which cost $150 — and you want to find a cheaper option, another brand likely sells a nearly identical pair for less — such as these MIA Italia sneakers , which are priced around $50. But what, exactly, is the difference between a more expensive sneaker and a cheaper one? We spoke with a marketing expert, a shoe brand founder, and a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) to determine what the difference actually is between a $50 and a $150 pair of sneakers. “For the most part, higher-priced sneakers do tend to use more premium materials and advanced construction techniques, which, in turn, can extend the life of the sneaker,” explained Jill Topol , a celebrity fashion stylist and professor at FIT. “But [comfort] is a totally different animal.” Topol shares that since she has wide feet, certain higher-priced sneaker styles that are extremely well made and stylish may feel uncomfortable on her, but comfortable on someone with a narrower foot. “There’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to sneakers. It’s always a good idea to read the online reviews from previous customers first before purchasing.” “More expensive sneakers will usually have an outsole made from higher-quality materials like rubber, which offer better cushioning properties for longer, as they’re a bit firmer and heavier due to an increased rubber percentage, which is better for long-term comfort and general shoe longevity,” explained Anna Baird , a podiatrist-turned-entrepreneur and founder of Bared Footwear. To the eye, the $150 VEJA sneakers and the almost-$50 MIA pair are basically identical. “For a second, I thought they were the same brand until I realized the V was upside-down on the cheaper MIAs,” Topol said. “If you’re not fashion-savvy, chances are you’re going to be fooled by this and think you’re getting a great bargain on a luxury sneaker, but that’s about where the similarities end.” While the $150 VEJAs are made of leather sourced from Uruguay and Brazil with a recycled polyester lining, the $50 MIAs have a synthetic upper and lining. “Leather typically molds better to your feet and tends to be more comfortable,” Topol explained. She said it’s evident that the MIA sneakers aren’t made from leather based on the low-star reviews they’ve received. “The main complaint is that they hurt your feet. No surprise there. But what might surprise you is that the expensive VEJAs didn’t get great reviews either,” Topol pointed out. “Customers complained that they ran big. Another reason to always read those customer reviews before hitting the ‘add to bag’ button!” Baird agrees that more expensive sneakers will generally be made of higher-quality materials like leather and created with better construction methods — meaning they’ll likely offer you more longevity. “Leather or canvas are great choices for the upper materials because they are breathable and long-lasting,” Baird said. “Strong stitching and reinforced seams are also important for overall construction.” She explained that a lot of cheaper sneakers will have an outsole made from EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate) foams. While this material is lighter and helps a shoe be more comfortable initially, it tends to compress and harden easily, which reduces comfort and support over time. If you look at the material of a sneaker, you may notice that a cheaper sneaker will use synthetics that mimic leather but lacks breathability and comfort. “While they are more affordable, they often wear out faster, provide less comfort and support for your feet,” Baird explained. “Not only that, but the midsole of an inexpensive sneaker is usually quite flexible to [the] point of being flimsy. Whereas more expensive sneakers tend to focus on using superior, premium materials such as genuine leather.” Sometimes a brand may do such an impeccable job of marketing its shoe that people overlook the price. But a high price may also cause customers to seek a cheaper option. “Marketing anything is always contingent on the brand itself. However, generally speaking, if a shoe is more expensive, it’s likely because the cost to produce it is higher,” said Samantha Ribakove , a PR and digital marketing consultant and founder of Solutions by Sam . “When marketing a more expensive shoe, marketers will typically highlight its points of differentiation to justify to the consumers why the price point is what it is. In other words, if the material is driving up the overall cost of the shoe, strong marketing would speak to what this material offers and why it was chosen.” The features a brand focuses on in its marketing campaigns play a huge role in who buys the sneakers. “Brands and marketers focus on longevity and quality. That being said, it’s clear that it takes a lot more to convince the consumer to purchase when it’s a higher price point,” Ribakove said. “Consumers are smarter than ever because they have a wealth of knowledge and products in the palm of their hands these days,” she added. “It’s important that the marketing you’re putting out showcases the quality and longevity for them to consider when purchasing, especially at a higher price point.” When deciding between two shoe styles that look almost exactly the same, your personal style is a big factor. “The overall look of a sneaker really depends on the eye of the beholder. Price isn’t always a factor here. We gravitate to what we personally like,” Topol said. “Maybe you’re a nonconformist and like sneakers that are a little out of the ordinary. Or maybe you’re more conservative and prefer a simpler design with clean lines. Who’s to say one is better than the other?” Need a new pair of sneakers? Personal trainers say these are the best options for working out. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost If you’re one of those people who never seems to trip over your own two feet, bump into furniture or break your favorite drinking glass, consider yourself lucky. Many of us identify with being at least a little clumsy, and generally, it’s something to laugh about. Sometimes, however, clumsiness can be a sign of a bigger issue than just needing a bandage or waiting for a bruise to heal. It can be indicative of a larger issue related to our brains. “There are a variety of medical problems that can lead to clumsiness, including general medical conditions, hormonal dysfunction, visual problems and neurological disorders,” said Dr. Alessandro Di Rocco , the director of neurology, Parkinson’s and movement disorders at Northwell Health. “Among the more common neurological problems are ‘mini-strokes,’ due to occlusion of small blood vessels in the brain, neurodegenerative brain diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, which develop frequently in older individuals, or other neurological disorders, including accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), inflammation and peripheral nerve disease (neuropathy),” Di Rocco added. Before you panic and turn to Google for more information (please don’t), we consulted doctors who specialize in brain health to find out the specific clumsiness-related signs you may need to see a doctor about for further evaluation. Here’s what they had to say: Neuropsychologist Sanam Hafeez said that, from a medical standpoint, it’s important to consider that a certain degree of clumsiness is typical. “The average person may have moments of clumsiness, which can include knocking over objects or spilling a drink, but it’s usually nothing to worry about,” Hafeez said, noting that sometimes clumsiness can be a side effect of anxiety. However, a sign that your clumsiness isn’t normal is a sudden increase in accidents or injuries, she said. So if you notice you’re falling often or getting into minor accidents, it can be a good idea to see a doctor to get to the root of what’s going on. When functions we normally have no problem executing become difficult or impaired, clumsiness may be a sign of a larger medical problem, Di Rocco said. “For instance, even an individual who has never been too dexterous with manual tasks may start dropping objects, having difficulty typing or walking, or start falling more,” he explained. For a lot of us, a little bit of clumsiness is part of our daily lives. But it could be a sign that your clumsiness isn’t normal if you find yourself thinking, “Why can’t I keep my balance?” or “Why do I keep dropping my phone?” “Normal clumsiness is something you have always had since childhood,” said Dr. Amparo Gutierrez , a neurologist with the Orlando Health Neuroscience Institute. “New clumsiness that develops over hours or days is abnormal, and medical advice should be sought.” Di Rocco also underscored this. “Changes in dexterity or an awareness of becoming clumsy should prompt a medical evaluation, especially if the clumsiness is persistent and not occasional,” he said. While a sudden acceleration in clumsiness could be a sign of a serious health issue, there can also be other explanations with simpler fixes. “An increase in clumsiness could be attributed to deficiencies in vitamins or minerals like vitamin B12 or magnesium,” Hafeez said. It’s also possible that a new medication is causing clumsiness, in which case you can speak to your doctor about adjusting your dose or trying something else. An increase in clumsiness can also be a normal part of the aging process, according to Di Rocco. “What is normal function or clumsiness at age 30 is very different than at age 70,” he said. For example, people tend to have more trouble with balance as they age and may fall more frequently, but that doesn’t necessarily mean there’s anything serious going on with their brain. With all that in mind, if you’re worried about an uptick in clumsiness, it’s always a good idea to speak with a health professional. “If you notice persistent clumsiness that interferes with your daily activities or seems to be worsening over time, it’s a good idea to see a doctor,” Hafeez said. “If clumsiness is accompanied by other symptoms such as a severe headache, weakness or numbness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking, confusion, vision changes, dizziness or loss of balance, see a doctor immediately.” Clumsiness is a normal part of being human. But if it starts to interfere with your daily life or you notice an abrupt change in your motor skills, be sure to speak with a medical provider as soon as possible.

    "article_content": "BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand’s Senate voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to approve a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage, clearing the last legislative hurdle for the country to become the first in Southeast Asia to enact such a law. Thailand has a reputation for acceptance and inclusivity but has struggled for decades to pass a marriage equality law. Thai society largely holds conservative values, and members of the LGBTQ+ community say they face discrimination in everyday life. The government and state agencies are also historically conservative, and advocates for gender equality have had a hard time pushing lawmakers and civil servants to accept change. Thailand will become the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to allow same-sex marriage. The marriage equality bill, which grants full legal, financial and medical rights for marriage partners of any gender, sailed through the House of Representatives right before the previous parliamentary session concluded in April with the approval of 400 of the 415 members who were present. It passed its final reading in the Senate on Tuesday with the approval of 130 of the 152 members in attendance, with 4 voting against it and 18 abstaining. The bill now needs the pro forma endorsement of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, followed by its publication in the Government Gazette, which will set a date within 120 days when it becomes effective. The timing of the Senate’s vote on Tuesday, the first day of the current parliamentary session, suggests the urgency in getting the bill passed. The legislation will amend the country’s Civil and Commercial Code to replace gender-specific words such as “men and women” with gender-neutral words such as “individual.” But it was not approved without a hitch. One member of the Senate, retired army Gen. Worapong Sa-nganet, argued that the gender-specific terms should still be included in the law along with the gender-neutral terms. He said excluding them would be a severe “subversion of the institution of family” in Thailand. After the vote, Plaifah Kyoka Shodladd, an 18-year-old who identifies as non-binary, took the floor and thanked everyone who supported the legislation, calling it a “force of hope” that will help Thailand become more accepting of diversity. “Today, love trumps prejudice,” Plaifah said. The government, confident of the bill’s passage, announced several days ago it would host a celebration of the occasion later Tuesday at Government House. The building was decorated with rainbow carpets, flags and a giant balloon in the shape of two hands making a heart sign. Supporters planned to march from Parliament to Government House for the celebration. Passing the law is a “triumph for justice and human rights,” said Mookdapa Yangyuenpradorn of the human rights organization Fortify Rights. “The Thai government must now focus on ensuring swift and effective implementation of this law to safeguard LGBTI+ rights,” she said. “Marriage equality is fundamental to human dignity, and it is essential that Thailand protects these rights without delay or discrimination.” The government led by the Pheu Thai party, which took office last year, has made marriage equality one of its main goals. It made a major effort to identify itself with the annual Bangkok Pride parade earlier this month, in which thousands of people celebrated in one of Bangkok’s busiest commercial districts.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost If you’ve ever been at an outdoor party or BBQ during the fading hours of daylight and don’t personally notice an increase in the number of mosquitoes , you’ll probably hear someone complaining about it. That’s because mosquitoes are selective insects, and some people are more likely to get bites than others. There are a few factors that could contribute to why this happens: In one controlled study by the Journal of Medical Entomology, the bugs landed on people with blood Type O nearly twice as frequently as those with Type A. The researchers noted this has to do with secretions we produce, which tips mosquitoes off on a person’s blood type. More research needs to be conducted on mosquitoes’ potential preference for certain blood types over others, said Jonathan F. Day, an entomology professor at the University of Florida. But he agreed that mosquitoes do pick up on some cues we give off that make the bugs more likely to land on certain people. “These cues let them know they are going to a blood source,” Day said. “Perhaps CO2 is the most important. The amount of CO2 you produce, like people with high metabolic rates ― genetic, other factors ― increases the amount of carbon dioxide you give off. The more you give off, the more attractive you are to these arthropods.” But what separates us from the nonliving entities that give off carbon dioxide, like cars? Mosquitoes look for primary cues in conjunction with what Day calls “secondary cues.” Lactic acid — the stuff that causes our muscles to cramp during exercise — is one of those secondary cues, for example. Lactic acid is released through the skin, signaling to mosquitoes that we are a target, Day said. Mosquitoes also have other qualities that help them pick up on secondary cues. “Mosquitoes have excellent vision, but they fly close to the ground to stay out of the wind,” Day said. “They are able to contrast you with the horizon, so how you’re dressed matters. If you have on dark clothes, you are going to attract more because you’ll stand out from the horizon, whereas those wearing light colors won’t as much.” A mosquito also takes in “tactile cues” once it has landed on you. “Body heat is a really important tactile cue,” Day said. “That comes into play with genetic differences or physiological differences. Some people tend to run a little warmer — when they land, they’re looking for a place where blood is close to the skin.” That means those whose temperatures are a little higher are more likely to get the bite. Lifestyle or other health factors may also play a role, said Melissa Piliang, a dermatologist at Cleveland Clinic. “If body temperature is higher, you’re exercising and moving around a lot, or if you’re drinking alcohol, you are more attractive to mosquitoes,” Piliang said. “Being pregnant or being overweight also increases metabolic rate.” One study showed that people who consumed just one can of beer were more at risk of attracting mosquitoes than those who didn’t. Of course, drinking outside is a popular summer and fall activity. “If you’ve been moving around all day doing yardwork and then you stop around dusk and drink a beer on your patio, you’re definitely at risk of bites,” Piliang said. Just because you might be more prone to bites doesn’t mean they have to be an inevitability. “One of the very best things to do is to avoid peak activity times [for mosquitoes],” Day said. “There are very, very few species that are active in the middle of the day. They are very selective. Sunrise and sunset are when you’ll see peak activity.” Switching your early morning run to an after-work run could help here. Of course, this tip won’t help you if you’re, say, throwing a BBQ for friends later at night. Try to cover as much skin as you can in these cases, Day said, especially in areas or at times mosquitoes are most likely to be present. “I love the fishing shirts and the long-legged outdoor pants that are breathable, but they prevent mosquitoes,” Day said. “A repellent that has a good protection time ― defined as the time from when you apply to when you get the first bite ― is also great. Roughly 5% DEET sprays gives you 90 minutes of complete coverage.” DEET is a common ingredient in insect repellents, and sprays with DEET are probably the way to go if you know you’re at risk of bites, Piliang said. Despite the controversy over the health effects of DEET, a 2014 review by the Environmental Protection Agency re-concluded that normal use of DEET products does not pose a risk to one’s health, including children, pregnant women and breastfeeding women. “DEET is the most effective,” Piliang said. “If you are going to be in a mosquito-prone place, knowing that they carry disease, it is your best bet. Take a shower later to wash it off, and put on just a little bit.” Always read the directions on a spray before using it, and help children apply products by following the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. And while you may have heard that candles containing natural repellents like citronella oil can be useful, there is no research to support it yet. Instead, keep the fan on or hang out in a breezy area. “Mosquitoes can’t get around very much,” especially in wind, Piliang said. “You can run a fan to keep air moving.” If you do end up with a bite, you may or may not be bothered. “This all depends on how allergic you are to the chemicals in the saliva of the mosquito, and that can vary based on the type of the mosquito or how reactive you and your skin are to things in the environment,” Piliang said. If it is itchy, the worst possible thing you can do is scratch it. “If you do, then more histamine is released and it gets itchier,” she said. “If you scratch it, you’re also more likely to break skin. You can get bleeding, scabs and put yourself at risk for infection and scarring.” But there are a few simple things you can do to alleviate the itch, like putting an ice cube on it. “The sensation of cold travels on the same nerve as itch, so you cannot feel both at the same time,” Piliang said. “Even a drink with ice on it will help relieve itch immediately.” If you’ve received several bites after a morning or evening outside, she also recommended over-the-counter anti-itch creams with a mild topical steroid like hydrocortisone. “You can apply that two to three times a day to reduce itch,” she said. “And the last thing you can do if you’re really bit up is take an antihistamine ,” she added. “It can counteract the reaction a bit.” While OTC types that make you drowsy — like Benadryl — are more common, you can take non-drowsy antihistamines like Zyrtec or Allegra for daytime relief. Of course, prevention is always better than treatment, so use these tips to stave off bites in the first place as you head out for the season’s remaining BBQs and tailgates.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost You probably don’t feel your best when you stay up until the wee hours of the night. But beyond waking up groggy, new research says late bedtimes can actually harm your mental health . In a recent study published in Psychiatry Research , experts analyzed sleep and health data from 73,888 people in the U.K. Biobank. Those who regularly went to bed after 1 a.m. were more likely to experience mental health disorders like depression and anxiety than those who went to bed before 1 a.m. It didn’t matter if subjects classified themselves as early birds normally or night owls (this is also known as your chronotype) ― going to bed after 1 a.m. hurt people mentally, the study found. In fact, night owls who went to bed after 1 a.m. were most likely to have mental health impacts. People who went to bed before 1 a.m. had the lowest amount of mental health diagnoses. This study has some limitations: The people who make up the U.K. Biobank are mostly white and middle-aged or older, according to Dr. Indira Gurubhagavatula , a professor of medicine in the division of Sleep Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who is not affiliated with the study. “And the way they decided which chronotype you are came from a single question, although they did use one that has been validated. But typically how we assess morningness or eveningness is with a much more thorough questionnaire that has a lot more detailed questions,” said Gurubhagavatula. Meaning, whether folks are really morning people or night owls may not be totally accurate in this study. Additionally, researchers relied on mental health diagnoses data added by doctors. This type of reported data can be inaccurate or doctors can miss a diagnosis, Gurubhagavatula said. That said, she noted that the findings align with what she’d expect and said this study should be recreated in other populations, too. “Generally speaking, if you’re not going to bed until after 1 in the morning or 2 in the morning, it’s very likely you’re not waking up until several hours after the sun has come up. And you’re not going to bed for several hours after the sun has gone down, so I think it gets that this issue … being out of alignment with the environmental light-dark cycle as potentially problematic,” said Matthew Lehrer , an assistant professor in the University of Pittsburgh Department of Psychiatry, who is not affiliated with the study. It’s important for our bodies to get strong signals that it’s daytime, which can come in the form of morning sun. If you aren’t getting those signals or are getting mixed signals, it can cause issues with your biology, which could also affect your brain, said Lehrer. “The authors also mentioned that there are some brain-related mechanisms beyond circadian misalignment. Greater nighttime activity is associated with more impulsive and maladaptive behavior,” Lehrer said. “There are some mechanisms in the brain related to behavior and impulsiveness and inhibition … when you’re awake for longer and later, those things tend to decrease and so that could be associated also with poor mental health.” Gurubhagavatula noted that some brain functions are more vulnerable to sleep loss than others. “So, for example, maybe you can chew gum, you can talk, you can walk, but the frontal lobe of the brain is very vulnerable to sleep deprivation,” said Gurubhagavatula. The frontal lobe is responsible for a lot of our brain’s functioning, including mood and emotional regulation. “So, our ability to not swing wildly from one emotion to the other ― that ability to inhibit ourselves ― becomes impaired under conditions of sleep deprivation or staying up very late at night,” Gurubhagavatula said. “Then it can lead to more negativity, more anxiety ... because the higher brain functions that would regulate those emotions are more dulled.” This can all sound pretty disheartening, especially if you have a job that requires you to go to bed after 1 a.m. Both experts said there are things you can do to minimize the negative impact of a late bedtime and get more sleep, too. Napping is the first step. “One type of nap is called a strategic nap, which happens during the shift when you know that you have a slump period where it’s so hard to stay awake, your eyes are just going to close. It will be very efficient to use that time to grab a nap if you can,” Gurubhagavatula said. “And then the other thing is what’s called a preemptive nap. So before the shift even starts, you go into the shift as well rested as you can be,” Gurubhagavatula said, noting that it’s best to keep your naps to 20 or 30 minutes. Another strategy for night shift workers is “appropriately timed bright light exposure during working hours, if possible,” said Lehrer. “This would be artificial light, such as light boxes for individuals with seasonal affective disorder … they’re very bright, they do have fatigue-reducing and mood-boosting properties.” Following a specific eating schedule is important, too. “Maintaining more of a daytime-oriented eating schedule can also be helpful, potentially for mood. It’s been shown in simulated night shift work. People in the lab ate their meals during the daytime and they had better improvements in mood relative to those who ate at nighttime,” Lehrer said. Having a cool, dark and quiet bedroom can help you get better sleep, too, according to both experts. Beyond this, if you just can’t seem to get the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep , Gurubhagavatula said it’s important to be aware that you could have a sleep disorder. In this case, going to a sleep specialist is a good idea. “I think that most people by now are starting to understand that as much as we treat sleep like it’s a bonus, it’s actually essential. It’s a biologic necessity,” said Gurubhagavatula. “And we can’t go without it similar to air, food and water.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life When it’s last call at a restaurant, you as a customer may think you have all the time in the world to hang out and order another round or one last bite to eat. But for restaurant workers, it can be a different story. “What [last call] really means is, ‘Hurry up and leave, please,’” said Elyanna Calle, a server in Austin, Texas, who is also the president of union Restaurant Workers United . Asking to dine in right before closing time can be rude, depending on when you show up and the kind of service you are expecting. “I don’t show up to a place less than 15 to 20 minutes before close,” said Bill Whitlow, a Covington, Kentucky-based restaurant operator. “But I don’t get upset if a guest comes in five minutes before we close.” Calle said that an hour before it closes, she will go to a diner where she knows food comes out in 15 minutes. But she stays mindful of closing time. “If it closes at 10 p.m., I will be out by 10 p.m.,” Calle said. “I’ll be aware, like, at 9:50, get a box, box up my food, pay, and be able to walk out as soon as soon as the clock hits 10.” How rude it is to stay after a restaurant closes? It depends on how long you are lingering. There’s a difference between staying past last call to finish your drink and staying past a restaurant’s closing hours. Izzy Alcheikh, a bartender for Huda , a New York City-based Levantine bistro, said it’s all right if you hear “last call” and actually get a drink that you enjoy sipping — “That’s completely fine,” he said. But if customers do not acknowledge last call and stay long past a bar is closed, ignoring that every other table has already been cleaned up except theirs, this comes off as rude, Alcheikh said. So if you are the last person at a closed restaurant and you are making no moves to leave, you are definitely being discourteous. “The rudest thing is if you’re purposely staying past close,” Calle said. “I would never stay an hour after closing,” Whitlow said. Just because you are not being kicked out doesn’t mean your continued presence is welcome. At her former job in a pizza restaurant, Calle said staff members were not allowed to ask customers to leave after closing time. “We can only take measures such as asking people if they want boxes, busing their tables, turning off the music, trying to flip chairs really loudly so they get the message,” she said. “It’s one of those things where even when people are like, ‘Sorry, I stayed so late,’ you just have to say, ‘Oh, it’s all good.’” In some cases, closing times are not personal — they are the law. “Our liquor licenses are all different depending where we are. Some restaurants can’t serve past 1 a.m.; some can,” said Gabriella Zottola, a restaurant manager based in Waltham, Massachusetts. Workers often cannot say what they really think about how late you are staying, or else they might risk their jobs. “You just have to be accommodating to the customer,” Calle said. So here’s the truth, according to restaurant workers who spoke with HuffPost: When it’s last call or closing time at a bar or restaurant, there are simple yet courteous actions you can take to make employees’ lives easier — and avoid becoming the customer every worker secretly hates. You should recognize that the staff and managers on a closing shift typically cannot leave the building until all customers do. “At closing time, my pet peeve is when we’ve given last call, they [have] received their final drink, and the check is in front of them waiting to close out,” Zottola said. “I don’t care how late you stay, just pay your bill!” Zottola said that when a table or bar guest settles their tab right away, she can then complete her closing-out duties like writing the day’s report, distributing tips and rebalancing cash for the next shift. So when a guest pays right away, “I can at least finish my stuff and be ready to lock the door and walk out with them when it’s time to,” she said. Whitlow said that when it’s last call, he will avoid ordering a 10-ingredient cocktail and instead get something simple like a beer, a shot or a vodka soda, “because that bartender has to get 10 to 20 people their last call within a few minutes.” Be mindful of how much you are ordering right before closing time. “A bottle of wine, for example, 30 minutes before closing is a wild suggestion,” A lcheikh said. “That’s an hour [to drink]. You can’t kick them out.” Alcheikh added that it’s more courteous in such instances for customers to ask if they can take the bottle home. “For me, 30 minutes past last call is an adequate-enough time to have your drink, finish it and enjoy it without rushing, and get out,” Whitlow said, noting that the longer you linger after that, the harder you are making it on restaurant workers who would like to go home. If you order another drink after last call, you will have “your dishwasher, your bartender, your barback, your manager — there might be three or four people sitting there and waiting on you to leave,” Whitlow explained. And time spent waiting on customers is costing workers. “Let’s say you made 100 bucks that night for what would have been a five-hour shift, but they stuck around for an extra two hours. So I made 100 bucks over seven hours,” Whitlow said as an example. “Instead of making $20 an hour, I made $14 an hour.” Whenever you do decide to head out, make sure you’re not leaving behind a mess, Calle said. “Consolidate the things on your table,” she suggested. “If you haven’t already, ask for the check, get your food boxed up.” Ideally, once customers hear “last call” they should start wrapping everything up so they can leave soon. But if they stick around after closing time, it helps to tip well. “Even throwing [workers] $20 before they get up would make their lengthy stay a little less annoying,” Zottola said. “It would also make the bartenders remember them for the next time they come in as nice people who take care of them, not ‘the couple that stayed all night.’” And if you are a regular who keeps staying past closing time, you should not be a stingy tipper, because this does not endear you to the staff. “We’ll go in the back and be like: ‘Oh, Ben’s here again, I’m going to give him bad service because he never tips me,’” Calle said. “We’re very aware of that.” Instead of dragging out your stay and making restaurant workers wait for you to leave, head out by closing. That’s what restaurant workers do when they go out. Even if a bartender seems amenable, another staff member on the same late shift may not be as agreeable to you staying longer. “Maybe one person wants me to stay, but three others don’t,” Alcheikh said, explaining why he’ll leave by closing time. Another option is to find a restaurant or bar that is actually open later. “A lot of times I would go to somewhere that opened up a little bit later,” Alcheikh said. “Or I would just take a shot with the bartender and just call it a night, go home.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Have you ever experienced food poisoning when none of your dining mates got sick from the same meal? It’ll make you question whether you really have food poisoning at all. But as it turns out, it’s entirely possible that several people can eat the same food and only one person can contract food poisoning. “People always come into the emergency room stating, ‘I know I don’t have food poisoning because I’m the only one who got sick,’” said board-certified emergency physician Dr. Justin Mazur . “Patient education here is critical, as it is more common that not everyone gets sick from your garden variety food poisoning.” If you’re not familiar with what food poisoning is, it refers to a plethora of gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever. “The symptoms are generally attributed to food that is contaminated with a virus, bacteria or, less commonly, a parasite,” Mazur said. Being the only person to suffer a bout of food poisoning after a meal is a tough draw. But unfortunately, it’s a common occurrence, and there’s a reason some people may go unscathed by a little undercooked meat or an unwashed vegetable. Ahead, doctors explained why some people get food poisoning and others don’t, despite eating the same exact thing. To put it simply, your body may not be able to fight off food poisoning. Every single person is completely different in a multitude of ways, including their immune system and gut microbiome , the home of trillions of microorganisms that can influence your digestive system and overall health. When it comes to food poisoning, it completely disrupts your gut microbiome, which is why you feel so sick. If you and your friend eat the same undercooked hamburger and you have an unhealthy microbiome while they have a healthier one, you may experience a bit of an upset stomach afterward. “A person with an inadequate microbiome will experience food poisoning more often,” Mazur said. If you fuel your body with healthy foods, your microbiome will thrive. If you don’t, your gut microbiome may not be able to fight off bacteria from the undercooked or raw food that gave you food poisoning. Mazur said the characteristics of an inadequate microbiome are a lack of beneficial bacteria and microbial diversity, as well as high concentrations of pathogenic bacteria, which is a significant risk factor for frequent bouts of food poisoning. He also noted two other things that can affect whether someone gets sick or not: if they ate enough of the food to become infected, and what else they ate or drank that day. “If you started the day drinking alcohol heavily, you’ve already damaged your healthy microbiome for the day, making you more susceptible on that specific day,” Mazur said. Your eating habits and preferences can increase your risk of developing food poisoning. “Contaminated meat, poultry and seafood that is served raw or undercooked is a risk factor. Consuming raw dairy foods such as eggs, milk or raw dough is another risk factor,” Mazur said. In terms of a diet that will affect the health of your gut microbiome, Mazur said to avoid ” a diet high in refined carbohydrates, processed foods and sugar” and to maximize your intake of fiber, fruits and vegetables. He added that drinking alcohol may be at play with getting food poisoning, too. “Alcohol intake damages the microbiome and is a lesser-known cause of dysbiosis — overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria — and is another risk factor for an inadequate microbiome,” Mazur said. If your gut is inflamed from your diet, Dr. Elizabeth Sharp, a board-certified internal medicine physician, said it’s “more likely that pathogenic bacteria or viruses could penetrate and cause an infection.” Another reason you could be more susceptible to food poisoning is “if [someone has] a weakened immune system or less reserves to mount an immune response to fight off the pathogenic bacteria in the food,” she added. So how can you prevent food poisoning? Aside from reading the numerous articles HuffPost has published about food safety , proper preparation and storage methods, our experts believe that a healthy microbiome is also crucial. Mazur said this “may be the very best defense against invading pathogens. Entrenched healthy bacteria support each other preferentially and make it harder for new and/or invading bacteria to take root.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Should wearing a pair of shorts or a baseball cap keep you from enjoying an expensive night on the town? At many upscale restaurants, potential customers are turned away if they’re wearing clothes that don’t match the classy vibe inside. Some diners have complained about discrimination , especially when dress codes seem to be enforced differently for certain people due to their race, class or gender. But others agree with restaurant owners who believe that maintaining a minimum standard in their luxury spaces allows patrons to fit in appropriately with the decor, creating an atmosphere that makes everyone to feel special. After all, they say, they’ve invested quite a lot in their business, and it’s not too much to ask customers to step up a little bit for a five-star experience. We spoke with experts in etiquette and dining out to explain why things are the way they are. Richard Ford literally wrote the book on dress codes. Ford, a Stanford Law School professor and the author of “ Dress Codes: How the Laws of Fashion Made History ,” said there’s a duality inherent in the creation and enforcement of rules about the kind of clothing people are allowed to wear. “On the reasonable side, dress communicates respect and professionalism, so schools, workplaces and venues have a good reason to insist on clothing that fits with the mission and purpose of the institution,” he said. “On the troubling side, sometimes dress codes are used to screen out stigmatized racial groups.” He pointed to dress codes banning gold chains, dental grills or sagging pants. To add another layer to the issue, even establishments that cater to a largely Black customer base sometimes want to signal what Ford called “a certain type of bourgeois respectability.” “It’s true that some might find this objectionable, but it’s not exactly racist,” he said. Reuben Buford May , a sociology professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, studies discrimination in public accommodations like nightclubs, restaurants and bars. He agreed that while dress codes can be viewed as a way to attract a certain type of customer, they can also be understood as a means to keep others away. “I’ve had an owner tell me, ‘Riffraff is bad for business,’ so he has a code in place to keep certain ‘types’ out of his establishment,” May said. In the past, you could likely recognize a high-status person by the way they were dressed. If it was after 6 p.m. and they were in a tux, for example, you knew they probably weren’t a farmer. (Thanks, “30 Rock.” ) But May pointed out that dress codes can be more difficult to justify now that popular styles are often about comfort. “You might have a hoodie-wearing guest who could buy the entire restaurant, but can’t be seated because of a dress code that requires a jacket,” he explained. Juliet, a Houston-based steakhouse and fine-dining restaurant owned by Jamie Allen , says it “ enforces a strict upscale dress code .” Allen created the code himself, saying it signifies that Juliet is not an everyday spot to grab a quick meal, but a celebratory destination. “There’s a time and a place for everything,” Allen said. “I don’t want everyone dressed like they’re at a sports bar.” Allen, who is Black, said he has personally experienced racism when trying to enter certain venues, but noted that Juliet’s dress code is enforced equally. “I’ve been to places myself that have a dress code banning things Black people wear, like Jordans or big chains,” he said. “Our dress code isn’t intended to block any demographic, because Juliet is a space where all people and all races can feel comfortable.” The Juliet dress code states: “We do not allow gym attire, beachwear, jean shorts, provocative clothing, sleeveless shirts or tank tops. Athletic apparel, jerseys, beanies, ball caps, bandanas and plain white t shirts are prohibited. Clothing emitting offensive odors is not permitted to be worn anywhere on the property.” Another proponent of dress codes is Adrianne Calvo , the owner of Miami-based Chef Adrianne’s Vineyard Restaurant & Bar. “I love that there are still some places in New York and Los Angeles that you can’t get into without a dinner jacket,” she said. Her restaurant’s dress code is business casual, banning athletic wear like basketball shorts, yoga shorts and sports bras. “I feel that if you see white linen and fresh roses on the table, that’s your sign to not come in pajamas or sweaty from the court,” Calvo said. “We also feel that if we went through all this thoughtful effort to provide an atmosphere for you to feel special and really embrace our theme, dressing inappropriately ruins the ambience and the feel.” Thomas P. Farley , an etiquette expert who goes by the name Mister Manners, agreed that there’s an upside to classy attire. “In the same way I wouldn’t show up for a friend’s dinner party looking as though I had just left a water park, I wouldn’t consider bringing down the mood in a restaurant by not being at my best — whether in my interactions with the staff, my conversations at the table or, yes, in my wardrobe choices,” he said. Farley said it’s time for all of us to, well, take a look in the mirror. “If encountering the occasional restaurant dress code policy is what it takes for Americans to begin reassessing the image they’re projecting when they are out in public, I’m all in favor,” he said. Like Allen, Farley is aware that “no exceptions” should mean just that. He applauded codes that are “thoroughly communicated, graciously conveyed, consistently applied and non-gender-specific,” adding that there should be no loopholes for labels. “So, ‘no tank tops’ must mean ‘no tank tops,’ whether the tank is from Target or from Tory Burch,” he said. At the Michelin-starred restaurant Cyrus in Geyserville, California, there’s a very short dress code: no shorts, flip-flops or white sleeveless undershirts. “It’s the minimum amount of policy we could enforce to walk the tight line of people being very relaxed and comfortable in Sonoma County in general, but still trying to maintain a policy that helps keep the culture of a special evening for the other guests,” explained James Beard Award-winning chef Douglas Keane . “We do communicate our policy ahead of time, so we’re able to refer back to that if there’s strong pushback from a customer.” Vinyl Steakhouse, in New York City’s Flatiron District, takes a different approach. Co-owner and sommelier Sofia Flannery said, “We welcome any and all ways of dressing for our dining room.” One big reason? She’s never been a fan of any dress code policy herself. “I’ve always thought it stifles individuality, and people are so interesting,” she said. “I hate not being able to see who a person is because they’re wearing something to abide by a rule.” Another reason for ditching the jacket-and-tie requirement is the restaurant’s Manhattan location. “New York has always been the city where you can fully be yourself, and we try to stand by that with our dress code,” Flannery said. “Tailored suits? Adidas tracksuit? Ball cap from a Yankees game you just came from? We love it all.” Flannery has a kindred spirit in Suzanne Podhaizer , a freelance food writer and recipe developer who owned the now-shuttered Salt Café in Montpelier, Vermont. The restaurant had no dress code for the staff or customers. “It was important to me that the cheesemakers, farmers and bakers from whom we sourced felt just as comfortable dining at the restaurant as did the lobbyists, doctors and tourists,” she said. “The hope was that those who loved dressing up would still do so, but that those who weren’t interested, were coming straight from work or who didn’t own dress clothes wouldn’t feel out of place. I believe it allowed more people to feel welcomed.” That view was echoed by John Sugimura , a corporate executive chef at food service management company Taher who is on a team working to reopen the shuttered Forepaugh’s , a historically white-tablecloth destination in St. Paul, Minnesota. While the restaurant might have had a dress code in the past, its new incarnation will not. “I think a formal policy could be a buzzkill and could potentially have a chilling effect on revenue,” Sugimura said. “In this postpandemic world, our industry continues to struggle to survive, and I believe we all need to open our eyes to know our audience authentically. A dress code represents everything that’s wrong in hospitality.” While restaurant owners may be the ones drafting a dress code, it’s typically up to the staff to enforce it in a consistent way. Rick Camac , the executive director of industry relations at the Institute of Culinary Education, once worked as the chief operating officer for an exclusive country club. “Their policy was nearly impossible to understand and even harder to enforce,” Camac said, adding that there were many times when it was ignored for certain members. “It was a club of millionaires, billionaires and famous people, so if they were either extremely difficult with the managers or very friendly with them, staff would often look the other way.” After that experience, Camac said: “I think any policy has to be appropriate, reasonable to comply with and always adhered to. But as a customer, as long as a policy makes sense and is consistent, I have no issue with it.” Keyatta Mincey Parker , the chief curating officer at Pictures and Cocktails LLC , previously worked for six years at a boutique hotel in Atlanta. “We had a rooftop bar with a dress code that prohibited T-shirts, athletic wear, clothing with holes, flip-flops and sneakers,” she said. “The order came from the owners who kept saying they didn’t want ‘that crowd’ at the bar,” she explained. “The challenge was that hotel guests, who were paying top dollar, found it to be very problematic. Every night I had to explain to people they had to get dressed up to relax on the rooftop bar. At least once a week there was an issue.” As much as the owners denied it, racism was present in decisions about who was allowed and who was turned away, said Parker, who is Black. “If a person is fully dressed and presenting in a way that fits the vibe, let them have fun,” she said. “I think many places selectively discriminate under the veil of the dress code, and they don’t even hide it. If you’re going to have rules, then it has to be the same across the board, or it’s embarrassing and wrong.” Even at the world’s most luxurious resorts, dress code issues can loom large. That’s been the experience of luxury hospitality veteran Melissa Sambugaro , the sales and marketing director at Iniala Group, which owns the luxury resort Iniala Beach House in Phuket, Thailand. She’s worked at places where guests are turned away for wearing open-toed shoes or men are prohibited from wearing shorts. From her perspective, those dress codes are outdated and due for reconsideration. “I think that in 2024, we should worry about bigger things than dress policies,” Sambugaro said. “Based on my personal experience, you really can’t judge the status of a person by how they dress. I’ve seen millionaires show up wearing sneakers and then leave the best tip of the night. I’ve also seen people wearing fancy clothes who walked out once they saw the prices on the menu.” Keane, who has a relaxed dress code at Cyrus, agreed with this. But he can also see things from a restaurant owner’s perspective. “I like to be comfortable, and I find most dress code policies, like mandatory jackets and ties, silly and outdated,” he said. “I also understand that it’s hard when you’re dealing with a wide range of the public and there’s no common rule, so I understand why places enact them. “The overall philosophy as a business owner should be that you want all guests to be comfortable. You need to come up [with] what you think is best and right for your clientele and your atmosphere, so that ultimately the dress code should reflect your personality or philosophy of hospitality.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Loud budgeting . Slow shopping . Girl math . These days, there are endless quippy terms to describe the trends and phenomena in the realm of personal finance. One of the more insidious realities impacting people’s financial health has a name as well: money dysmorphia. To help keep the negative impacts at bay, HuffPost asked experts to break down this phenomenon and share their advice for dealing with it. “Money dysmorphia is when you have a warped or distorted view of your finances,” said Danielle Desir Corbett , a personal finance expert and host of “The Thought Card” podcast. “You see your financial situation much differently from your reality. Money dysmorphia can be caused by a variety of reasons, including past money trauma, societal pressures, economic crisis, or could be deeply rooted in childhood upbringing.” A recent Credit Karma survey found that 29% of Americans experience money dysmorphia. “Money dysmorphia is a play on keeping up with the Joneses, except the inability to ‘keep up’ is causing some people to experience feelings of inadequacy,” said Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma. The survey data reveals that the issue is particularly prevalent in younger generations, as 43% of Gen Zers and 41% of millennials reported experiencing money dysmorphia, compared to 25% of Gen Xers and 14% of those aged 59 or above. “While the term is new, the feelings aren’t,” said Dasha Kennedy , the creator of The Broke Black Girl and a financial wellness board member at National Debt Relief. “Many people have felt financially insecure for a long time without having a specific name for it. Now, by giving it a name, it’s easier to understand and address these feelings.” People have long worried about money and felt that they don’t have enough ― even when they do. The problem seems to have worsened, however, in the online age. Elizabeth Ayoola , a personal finance expert and writer at NerdWallet, told HuffPost she believes people’s skewed view of their finances is “often shaped by comparisons to others they see on social media or by soaking up economic news that creates worry.” “When people have money dysmorphia, they’re likely looking at their finances more subjectively than objectively,” she added. “Money dysmorphia can often make people believe they’re doing financially worse or better than they actually are,” Ayoola said. “This can manifest as saving excessively because you feel you’re behind in comparison to your peers. Likewise, it can show up as overspending because you feel you’re financially secure when that’s not the case.” If you have money dysmorphia, you might feel strong emotions about your finances when you see friends reach financial milestones, she added. Feelings like sadness, anxiety, stress, frustration, unworthiness or overconfidence may lead to behaviors that harm your financial health ― like overspending on a vacation. “People may find themselves living lifestyles they can’t afford,” Ayoola explained. “In the reverse, people who are financially secure may not be living full and abundant lives because they believe they don’t have enough, even though their financial reality may say otherwise. Ultimately, money dysmorphia can hinder people from achieving their financial goals or enjoying their achievements.” By excessively saving, people with money dysmorphia can miss out on opportunities to invest and actually grow their wealth. “Some people might be scared to spend money, even on the things they actually need,” Kennedy said. “Others might constantly worry about their finances, regardless of what their actual situation is. They may feel anxious or guilty when making purchases, including necessary ones.” She noted that common signs of money dysmorphia include obsessively checking bank balances, avoiding financial discussions, comparison to others, having a distorted perception of wealth, fear of financial ruin, being overly critical of your financial decisions, and stressing over future finances. For younger generations in particular, there’s also a temptation to tie their feelings about their financial situation to what they see and present on social media, even if it’s not reality. Many avoid addressing or seeking help for their debt, which fosters a cycle of financial instability. “The impact goes beyond money,” Kennedy noted. “It can strain relationships and affect overall well-being. People can also end up depriving themselves of basic needs and joys, which can be detrimental to both mental and physical health.” “A few ways to overcome money dysmorphia are to take an honest look at your finances, set clear goals, make a plan, and, most importantly, keep your eyes on your own paper,” Alev said. “If your goal is to build up your savings, start by doing an audit of your finances to see where in your budget you can make room for savings. From there, you can schedule automatic payments from each paycheck to help hold you accountable and incrementally increase your savings.” Set realistic financial goals and find useful resources for personal finance education. Consider seeking professional guidance from a financial planner or therapist, or simply reaching out to your support system as you pursue your goals. “Connect with an accountability buddy who you can brainstorm, vent and cheer you on,” Desir-Corbett said. “Observe your day-to-day thoughts around money. Identify and avoid triggers and distractions. Unfollow social media accounts which stir up financial insecurities. Devote time to listening to personal finance podcasts or reading books to close any knowledge gaps, especially around vulnerable areas.” Another helpful approach for those experiencing financial dysmorphia is to try to assess their personal finances with an objective lens before making judgements about how they’re doing. “That means looking at their income and expenses to see whether their cash flow is on the positive or negative side,” Ayoola said. “Another strategy is to focus on measuring their achievements based on their progress toward financial milestones and not that of their peers. While comparison can be healthy in some cases, everyone is on a different financial journey, so sometimes it can do more harm than good.” As you pursue a healthier relationship with money, Kennedy advised practicing self-compassion “Understand it’s OK to spend on necessities and things that bring joy,” she said. “Financial caution is good, but not when it harms your well-being. Financial caution should not put you in a constant state of inaction. You have to recognize when financial worries become excessive. Finding a balance is key.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "HuffPost Podcast The best part of flying has to be the snacks, right? No matter how long we’re stuck on the runway, or how annoying the person sitting next to us is, or how gross the bathroom will almost certainly be , at least we can look forward to some cookies or chips (or, if we’re lucky enough to have an especially generous flight attendant, both) and a drink. While most people have their go-to selections, it turns out there are a few popular items we might not want to order... and for a really gross reason. That’s what we — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast — recently learned when we chatted with HuffPost senior reporter and travel expert Caroline Bologna about how to make air travel less miserable. “I heard you shouldn’t drink water on planes because it can be from tanks that they never clean — is this true?” Michelson asked. “You should not drink water that you didn’t see come out of a bottle,” Bologna warned. That’s because even though the water on planes is required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to be potable, the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule passed in 2011 orders that airplane water tanks be flushed and disinfected just four times a year — or just once a year, if the tanks are tested monthly for substances like coliform bacteria and E. coli. A 2019 Hunter College study found that despite this federally mandated cleaning and testing schedule, many airlines “have possibly provided passengers with unhealthy water.” The study also discovered that the EPA “rarely levies civil penalties to airlines in violation” of drinking water safety rules. However, Bologna noted that if flight crews serve water from bottles, you can — and should — drink as much as you like. ″[Planes] are very dehydrating — it’s a very dry environment,” she noted. “That’s why when you sit in those premium cabins, they give you nice lotions. ... Even before you fly, try to really hydrate or have electrolytes.” If you see flight attendants pouring water from anything other than a bottle or can, you should probably say no thanks. “Sometimes, on flights, we would run out of bottled water,” former flight attendant Sue Fogwell told Travel & Leisure . “If you see a pitcher of water on the beverage cart in economy class, skip it — it’s from the water tank. Ask for a can of seltzer water.” You also might want to avoid two other beloved beverages while flying. “Everyone who’s worked on planes that I know says don’t have the coffee or the tea because it is [made with] the water from the tank,” Bologna said. A video that echoes that sentiment went viral on TikTok last year. In the clip, a response to a Reddit thread about flight attendants’ “dirty little secrets,” a flight attendant named Kevin called airline coffee “disgusting” and recommended passengers “get to the airport 10 minutes earlier and buy a coffee in the terminal” instead of ordering it at 35,000 feet. Other airline crew members have told travel sites they happily chug drinks made with water from the plane’s tank. Kelly Kincaid, who has been working as a flight attendant for over a decade, told The Points Guy in 2019 that she “drinks the coffee and tea all day long.” Her husband, who is also a flight attendant, “drinks about a pot of coffee a day from the plane” and hasn’t had any issues. Julie Kelley, a flight attendant who has been flying for over 40 years, told Fodors that she “consumes at least two hot beverages on every flight she works [a]nd she has never once felt sick after drinking anything made with hot water in-flight.” However, Charles Platkin, executive director at the Center for Food as Medicine and the researcher who oversaw the Hunter College study, isn’t convinced. He told Well+Good that he will not drink coffee while flying because of the chance of “trace elements — or sometimes significantly more — of bacteria, feces, and so forth” in airline water. “I won’t even touch the [lavatory] water to wash my hands,” he said, adding that he opts for hand sanitizer instead. Ultimately, like so many things in life, the choice is up to you. Still, Bologna suggests, “just have a nice coffee from the airport Starbucks [before you board].” Listen to the full episode featuring lots more flying tips by pressing play on the player above or wherever you get your podcasts .

    "article_content": "Matcha is one of those “it’s been around for centuries but it’s suddenly trendy” drinks with a major health halo. Made of finely ground leaves from the Camellia sinensis plant, matcha is a type of green tea that originated in China and was first introduced to Japan in the 12th century. Today, you may drink matcha lattes and frothy iced matcha drinks because they’re “healthy,” but do you know why? And do you realize that the way you prepare your drink could undo some of the nutritional properties that make matcha healthy? Matcha is made through a meticulous process in which Camellia sinensis plants are shaded for several weeks before the youngest leaves are hand-picked, steamed shortly afterward to prevent oxidation, and ground into a fine powder using stone mills to preserve their nutrients and taste. “Unlike regular green tea, where the leaves are steeped and then discarded, matcha involves consuming the whole leaf, which provides a higher concentration of nutrients and antioxidants,” explained Kimberley Wiemann , a registered dietitian. Packed with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most potent form of the phytochemicals known as catechins , studies suggest that matcha’s antioxidant properties can help boost metabolism and aid in weight loss , as well as reduce inflammation and oxidative stress , which are often the culprits behind chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. “Matcha [also] contains caffeine and [amino acid] L-theanine, which can provide a calm yet alert feeling, making it suitable for morning consumption to kick-start the day or in the afternoon to combat midday fatigue,” added nutritionist Lisa Richards . Per cup, matcha has about 70 milligrams of caffeine , while an 8-ounce cup of black coffee has 95 to 200 milligrams . Despite its health benefits, matcha’s intense bitter and grassy taste — due to its high concentration of catechins — leads some people to dilute and sweeten it with milk and syrups, a reason matcha lattes are such a hit. Even when you add nothing but hot water, only about 16% to 20% of matcha’s catechins get absorbed into your bloodstream because of their poor solubility, said food scientist Bryan Quoc Le . Still, the ones that don’t make it into your bloodstream might nonetheless benefit your gastrointestinal tract. However, adding milk can further impede the body’s ability to absorb catechins. “The decrease in catechin bioavailability [after adding milk] is something like 5%, so from 16% to 11% ,” Le said. This is because catechins will chemically bind to caseins, which make up about 80% of the total protein in cow’s milk. “In a way, this is beneficial because then the body can break down the protein and absorb the catechin simultaneously,” Le explained. “But the issue is that in something like matcha, where the concentration of catechins is very high, some of the catechins inhibit the digestive enzymes in your stomach if you’re consuming the matcha with milk.” These digestive enzymes help break down the milk proteins for our body to absorb, so, with fewer of them available, “now your body has a harder time breaking down the protein itself because of all the inhibition going on. It’s a combination effect. If you’re drinking a lighter tea, like a white tea with low amounts of catechins, then there’s not going to be as much inhibitory effect if you’re drinking it with milk,” Le explained. Le said plant-based milk doesn’t have as much of an impact on catechin absorption in the body. Plant proteins, like those found in oat and almond milk, “have fewer chemical components that interact with catechins so they make the inhibition process less likely to occur,” he said. But if you’re thinking about switching up your milk choice, there’s a tradeoff. Plant-based milk contains less protein , so a matcha latte with oat milk means less protein in your diet, although your body will absorb more catechins. On the flip side, using cow’s milk gives you more protein, but your body will take in fewer catechins. So, which milk variety is best? “It’s ultimately a matter of which [nutrient] you’re going for, you can’t have it all in this case,” Le said. Milk choice aside, investing in high-quality matcha can help you get the most out of its health benefits. You want tea that is vibrant green, labeled “ceremonial grade” and made from 100% pure powdered green tea leaves, Richards advised. “The texture should be fine and silky, without clumps or grittiness, which ensures it mixes well and maintains its nutrient integrity,” she added. Look for matcha specifically from regions like Uji, Nishio or Kyoto in Japan, which is generally considered superior due to meticulous cultivation and processing methods. “ Many studies use a dosage of between two and four grams of matcha per day, often spread into a couple smaller servings, which equates to about two to four cups per day,” Wiemann said. “It’s important to remember that green tea, including matcha, contains caffeine and should be limited to avoid too much caffeine intake.” If you’re making matcha at home, it’s important to pay attention to the water temperature, since the right temperature will help you get the most nutritional benefits and the fullest flavor from the tea, Richards said. “When water is too hot, above 185°F, it can scald the matcha and potentially degrade some of its delicate nutrients.” While how you prepare and consume matcha influences the absorption of nutrients in your body, the extent to which it positively impacts your health depends on various factors, including your gut microbiome, the amount of milk you use and the quality of the matcha you consume over time. “In the grand scheme of things, if you’re drinking tea, it’s always beneficial. If you’re drinking milk with tea, you’re still getting some benefit but it’s less than if you’re going to drink the tea directly,” Le said. “Your risk of cardiovascular disease may be lower and a lot of the processes with aging and chronic disease may slow down, but it’s really going to be about what you’re going to experience in five or ten years.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost When it comes to foot health and shoes, a few things are paramount: proper fit, comfort and support. Unfortunately, many summer shoes are totally flat, so they don’t provide any support for your feet or a comfy platform on which to walk. Podiatrists say you don’t have to totally give up cute yet unsupportive shoes, but you should limit the amount of time you spend in them — generally, no more than 2 to 3 hours. You should consider the kind of activity you’re doing, too; if you’re going for a long walk, you’ll want to wear sneakers. And you should be cognizant of the fact that some popular summer shoes can actually lead to foot problems. Which ones? Here’s what podiatrists say: Dr. Lesly Robinson , the interim associate dean of academic affairs at the Temple University School of Podiatric Medicine in Philadelphia, said her number-one shoe offenders in summer are jelly shoes. Jellies are becoming increasingly popular among not only little kids but adults too, with styles such as heels and sandals. “Jelly shoes are made of a PVC plastic,” Robinson said. “It’s not a breathable material, so you’ll tend to sweat more in these jelly type of shoes.” This can make jelly shoes slippery and cause people to fall, she noted. “Sometimes these jelly shoes ... become very hot, so you can have chafing, blisters and the plastic environment of a jelly shoe can lead to foot fungus,” said Robinson. Jelly shoes aren’t the only popular plastic shoes — Crocs seem to be more and more prevalent every year. Robinson said these can also make your feet sweat because of the material. Dr. Chandler Hubbard , the clinical director at Western University of Health Sciences’ Foot and Ankle Center in California, said Crocs can be a good shoe to wear in some places, like the house or the garden, but not everywhere. “I have nothing against [Crocs]; they’re just not the most supportive thing,” said Hubbard. “They’re more like a house shoe to me.” Plastic flip-flops can be a problem too, with Robinson saying “thin flip-flops that bend and twist” are perhaps best kept to the pool, the beach or hotels. “If you choose a flip-flop that bends too much and has no arch support, they’re not recommended for casual everyday wear,” Robinson said, since they lack proper support. These kinds of shoes can cause stress fractures or make you slip and fall, she noted. And flip-flops sometimes “get cracked and frayed, so no matter how much you love them, they can also cause different abrasions on your feet and chafing,” Robinson said. Meanwhile, the thongs that go between your toes can lead to irritation and blisters, she said. Robinson noted, however, that you could consider a flip-flop with arch support. Brands like Clarks and FitFlop typically provide more support and stability than plastic, bendy flip-flops that cost only a couple of bucks. Still, flip-flops with arch support aren’t for everyday use, either. “I wouldn’t recommend them for longer walks — just for a casual activity,” stated Robinson. “If you’re doing a longer walk or any type of any type of standing or walking greater than ... two to three hours, I don’t recommend flip-flops at all.” Gladiator sandals are popular summer shoes that wrap around your ankle , but Robinson said they aren’t a proper fit for everyone. “If you’re prone to ankle swelling, those sandals aren’t good for you,” she stated. Many folks will slip on a pair of gladiator sandals before evening drinks or dinner plans, but that isn’t ideal, either. “At the end of the day, that’s when your feet are swollen the most — after gravity, after you walk — that’s when your feet and your ankles are the largest,” Robinson said. The straps on gladiator sandals can indent your skin and cause abrasions, she added. For anyone shopping for sandals, Hubbard recommended Birkenstock shoes, which have good arch support, and Vionic sandals . “When you have something when the heel’s out in the back, it’s harder for your foot to grip during walking,” said Robinson, noting that this leads to “repetitive stress of gripping because the shoe lacks structure.” “You can get an Achilles tendinopathy, which is [pain] in the back of your heel,” Robinson explained. “You can get an ankle sprain because you’re trying to grip and the shoe’s lack of structure makes it more difficult.” What’s more, flat slip-on shoes don’t have much shock absorption, which can lead to pain at the ball of your foot, she said. Summertime may include a quick walk to the mailbox without shoes or a barefoot run on the beach, but Hubbard said walking around like this can lead to a range of foot injuries. “My biggest thing, especially for the summer, is to tell people not to walk barefoot,” she said. “We don’t want people to step on anything, and we do want to have that support.” Walking barefoot commonly leads to burns on hot asphalt and other injuries around broken glass, said Hubbard. “I pick a lot of glass out of people’s feet, unfortunately,” she said. “We want something that’s more stiff,” Hubbard said in terms of ideal footwear. “I know soft is usually what people are trying to look for because they want to be comfortable, but a stiffer shoe actually gives more support.” Stiffer shoes with a rigid arch can help you stay comfortable when running, walking, hiking or just doing errands, Hubbard noted. “I usually recommend people change their shoes or replace them after about 500 to 1,000 miles of wear,” she said. “That’s kind of hard for people to estimate if they’re not runners and they’re logging everything, but about every six months is reasonable to switch out a pair of sneakers.” After half a year, the support in sneakers starts to wear down, Hubbard said. (She recommended sneakers from brands like Hoka, ASICS and New Balance.) When it comes to buying new shoes, Robinson said you should shop later in the day or after exercise, to “make sure your feet feel comfortable when your feet are the largest.” If you still want to purchase certain shoes even though they might cause foot pain or other issues, that’s OK, too. “I never tell somebody that they can’t wear a shoe,” Hubbard said. “I tell them wear whatever you want ... be comfortable, be cute. Just know that if you’re wearing something that isn’t supportive, that doesn’t have that arch or isn’t stiff, or isn’t meeting the recommendation, you will possibly have some pain.” For people who don’t have chronic pain or other long-term issues, it’s fine to wear these kinds of shoes — but make sure you don’t do so for long periods of time, or if you plan on running or walking a lot, Robinson said. “No matter what type of foot you have, or no matter what type of comorbidity or health problem you have, it’s really important to check your feet every day — all sides, the bottoms, in between your toes, just to make sure that you’re not seeing anything that’s new or abnormal,” Hubbard said. If you notice something concerning, make an appointment to see a podiatrist. “We take for granted being able to walk, and one little thing can change that,” Hubbard said.

Nothing is worse than having sticky, sweaty skin underneath your bedsheets , especially when trying to catch some Z’s. If you can’t sleep without cranking up your air conditioner, it may be time to consider fighting those nighttime sweats with some airy, cool-to-the-touch bedding. Luckily, Casper just kicked off a sale on its entire cooling collection just in time to beat the real summer heat. Now, through July 10, you can take 30% off cooling mattresses , 20% off cooling bedsheets and 10% off cooling pillows . You can also save up to 35% Casper’s cooling bundles . Several reviewers say Casper’s cooling pillows, sheets and mattresses have been game-changers for sleeping in heat, and many report waking up feeling way more refreshed after use. For example, here’s what user Gfsjr has to say about the Hybrid Snow cooling pillow: “I like having a cool pillow and usually find myself waking up and flipping or turning the pillow during the night to try and get comfortable. [With] this pillow, I don’t need to do that.” If you’re unsure what to grab, check out what’s on sale below and sleep cooler this summer."

An automatic vacuum cleaner with voice control . If you’ve ever wanted to try the set-and-forget ease of a robot cleaner, now’s your chance — Amazon currently has a Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum, with a 60-day capacity self-emptying base, at a whopping 50% off . That takes the price of what one reviewer calls the “best purchase for our home so far” from $599 to only $299 . This Shark robot simplifies floor maintenance with hands-free operation by scheduling cleaning cycles via an app or connecting it with Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant for voice control. Once turned on, it’ll roll along your hardwood or carpeted floor and suck up debris before automatically docking itself to its base and emptying its innards so you don’t have to. The base has a filtered tank designed to hold up to 60 days of floor debris accumulated from daily cleaning, and it also charges the robot to full capacity between uses, ensuring it won’t just die while cleaning your living space. Several reviewers say it’s also fantastic for pet dander and hair. “It literally cleans about 95% of your floors,” says reviewer Scott McDowell . “Hair is not a problem, tangling on the roller is not a problem, larger debris is generally not a problem.” “We have four cats and run the robot every other, if not every, day.” says Cher B . “I still run our large vacuum (less frequently) and have noticed a decrease in cat hair collected so I would say the robot definitely helps.” If you want painless cleaning without pushing a vacuum around yourself, jump on this deal — and fast, because we’re not sure how long this 50% off deal will last. “ Still going strong and still highly recommend for those with mostly hard wood floors or linoleum. In fact, I recommended it to my mom and dad and now they have one and love it. We did finally get to test it with some serious dog hair. We had an Australian Shepard (which has super thick and clingy fur) and another dog that visited for several days. Both are extremely active and were all over our floors and our one carpet area. They left a ton of fur and it did take 3 or 4 cleanings to get up about 80% of the hair. Whatever was left over was bunched up on the carpet and was easily removable thanks to shark. Just be prepared to wait a few days for the fur to be cleaned up in the carpet. If it’s hardwood then it is cleaned up instantly.” — Scott McDowell (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review here .) “I managed to score this on sale and I am so happy I did! Easy to set up, app is easy to use and it is so nice to come home every day to a floor that doesn’t have dirt and dust layered on it. Our flooring has no carpet, in the main area of the house, so we just make sure nothing is left for it to get stuck on and it gets cleaned every day of the week. No issues with it not being to register obstructions. Initial mapping sequence took about 45 minutes and daily cleaning takes about the same. Setting up individual rooms in the app is easy and designating areas that are off-limits works fine. Still trying to figure out the commands for Alexa to be able to do everything but so far basic commands of telling it to clean and the return to the dock work fine. Really happy with this purchase.” — Jennifer G. “ I held off buying one of these for a long time. My son bought one and bragged on it so I decided to go for it. Best thing ever!!!! I was even able to download the app, get it set up, got the house mapped and got a schedule made. I run it every other day and you cannot believe how much dust and dog hair you get every other day. I highly recommend!!! I may get one for my upstairs... ” — Eggbert “ This vacuum is great if you have back trouble. You don’t have to get all the way down on the floor to empty the canister. There is a button at the top of the handle that disconnects it from the base of the docking station, so you can empty it much easi er than if you had to bend all the way over to pick up the robot unit. The robot itself is not very heavy, but it is pretty low to the floor. I’m glad I won’t have to mess with it very often. ” — smartypants (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review here .) “ Getting under beds was a major concern for me. My house is very dusty from being close to 3 major highways and a mile from a major international airport. The daily vacuum prevents dust buildup and helps to keep my house cleaner and with a lot less dusting needed throughout the house. I am disabled and appreciate having a resource that will do these tasks. I use the daily scheduling but don’t talk to the vacuum. It empties regularly on its own so that is a bonus. The main compartment will hold a lot of dust. It won’t last 2 months with my excessive dust but it is easy to empty the bin. Connectivity has been lost a few times but it doesn’t seem to be a regular problem and has not stopped [my robot] from doing her job. The app for [my robot] is easy to use and helps to keep track of your vacuuming results. It takes about 90 minutes to vacuum my small 3 bedroom house. Halfway through her task she returns to base to empty. She is usually about 15% battery when she returns to recharge. After she recharges there is usually about 6 more minutes of vacuuming to finish up and she does that once she is fully charged about 2 1/2 hours later.” — M Chin “ I really like our robot vacuum! I had to delete the first map it created because it left off a room and a half. Since then the map has been complete. I do wish I could create smaller no-go zones via the map. It sometimes gets stuck between cabinet legs but the space is too small to designate as a no-go on the app and with the strips (manual days minimum of 18”). I’ll have to find something to block that particular area, which isn’t a huge problem. We have four cats and run the robot every other, if not every, day. I still run our large vacuum (less frequently) and have noticed a decrease in cat hair collected so I would say the robot definitely helps. ” — Cher B By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. When Jackery gifted me a portable power station a few summers back, it went directly into my basement. With all the inputs and outlets, I thought it was a confusing computer thing, like an external hard drive or whatever else my tech-y friends talk about. It wasn’t until my landlord came by to fix something and saw the portable power station sitting sadly in the dark that I learned it was essentially a silent, portable, gas-less power source — one I could take with me to have electricity when camping, at the beach, driving or selling vintage items at a flea market. Flash forward to this summer, and my Jackery is my greatest asset. I take it everywhere with me to do things like charge devices on the go, use my griddle on camping trips and keep my fan going during the rolling summer blackouts we get in Philadelphia, where I live. Pizza Rolls!! 🍕😋 #outdoorcooking #pizzarolls #jackery #lunchideas With its compact, rectangular shape and long handle, it’s easy to carry around or pack in the car. Its rechargeable lithium battery is completely silent, so you don’t have to deal with that typical generator hum. You can charge it up by plugging it into a wall outlet, car outlet or electric generator, or you can use the Jackery solar panels ( sold separately or in a combined kit ) to charge it with the sun if you’re camping or in a power outage. The time it takes to charge depends on the size and style of the power station. Jackery’s portable power stations have all sorts of protections (over current and short current, over-discharge and overcharge, over-voltage and thermal), so they won’t explode or combust or produce any toxicity or pollution. There are different models of power stations that range in capacity, size, function and price, so we rounded up a mix of options to help you find your match. Correction: A previous version of this story referred to these power stations as generators.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. If you’re looking for a survival tool for home power outages, remote and outdoor living or maybe even your RV, the gas-free Jackery Solar Generator 1000 is one reliable powerhouse according to over 6,000 5-star reviews. This backup generator comes with two 1000W solar panels for charging up within a claimed 8 hours, three 1000W AC outlets for powering home appliances and other devices and can fully charge up for use in 5.5 hours when plugged into an electrical outlet. It’s ideal for camping trips plus unexpected power outages related to the heat , storms or other extreme weather circumstances. According to reviewer Ceez , who calls this generator a “must have,” it “easily powered the fridge overnight when the [power] wasn’t on,” and it also “ran my portable fridge for a good chunk of 3 days during one camping trip without any additional charging.” That’s one strong generator, and right now, you can grab it at 47% off , knocking it down to $879 — its lowest price of the year . This generator has a total of eight outlets: three AC, two USB-As (one with quick charge), two USB-C ports with PD and one car outlet. It also supports pass-through charging, which means you can power up other devices while charging the generator itself. Even when you’re not by an electrical outlet, you can still keep the generator powered up thanks to two solar panels included in the kit. “These panels are designed to efficiently convert sunlight into energy, replenishing the power station’s battery even on cloudy days,” says reviewer Stuart N . “The foldable and portable design makes them easy to transport and set up, ensuring you can harness solar energy wherever you go.” Whether you’re bracing for hurricane season, living in the wilderness or just enjoy some electricity during camping trips, this durable portable power station is a smart idea. Grab one now at its lowest price of the year and read on for more for use cases from happy reviewers. “ The Jackery Explorer 1000 power station itself is a standout product. With a capacity of 1002 watt-hours, it offers ample energy storage to keep your devices running during camping trips, power outages, or off-grid adventures. The multiple output options, including AC, USB, and DC ports, provide versatility to charge a wide range of devices, from phones and laptops to portable fridges and lights. The inclusion of two Saga Solar 100 Watt Solar panels complements the power station perfectly. These panels are designed to efficiently convert sunlight into energy, replenishing the power station’s battery even on cloudy days. The foldable and portable design makes them easy to transport and set up, ensuring you can harness solar energy wherever you go. The synergy between the Jackery Explorer 1000 and the Saga Solar panels is evident in the seamless integration. The power station features a dedicated solar input for convenient charging, and the included adapter makes connecting the panels straightforward.” — Stuart N. (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review here .) “ Very happy with this well made product. I ran high draw and low draw devices using the Explorer 1000 and it never choked. Easily kept my deceives powered for days, ran TVs and charged batteries. Used it to bring the party outside even! It made light work of powering up an old fog machine I had, and could easily keep the lights on till sunrise! Easily ran house fans and ventilators, types used in construction to keep air flow moving. Used it for vacuums outside for the car without having to pull out an entire extension cord. The Jackery Explorer 1000 can handle anything! The 1000W AC converter houses more than enough power to handle even the toughest jobs.”— E R (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review here .) “I love this thing. I initially considered a smaller Jackery to power a small camping refrigerator for a long road trip while the car is off. After reading other reviews and watching a ton of YouTube videos, I decided to settle on this Jackery 1000. I am so glad I did. Not only did it work fantastically for my initial use, I have since taken it on multiple camping trips and even powered some home appliances when the power went out. ” — Ceez (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review here .) “ I bought this because I’m a CPAP user and had a 2-night Cub Scout camping trip coming up. It ended up arriving at 43% as we were walking out the door. I was able to use the 12V car charger to get it up to about 50% upon arriving and then was able to get it up to 83% using the AC adapter before bed. I had purchased a 12V adapter for my CPAP (Airsense 10) since I knew I’d lose too much wattage converting it to AC. I was amazed by the performance and even used it to charge my iPhone and Apple watch. It only used about 9-10% each night. I’m hoping this means I’ll get about 8-9 nights out of the Jackery Explorer 1000 Portable Power Station. I was also impressed with the recharge time, it was significantly better than what the manual said. I’m just hoping the battery doesn’t lose capacity over time.” — Gary M “I bought this product primarily to supplement a lead acid battery/converter and a gasoline powered generator to deal with electrical power outages, but it has a number of other interesting applications. I have used it with a heat gun activating a shrink solder connector to repair a break in my invisible dog fence perimeter wire. The product is easier to deploy outdoors than a cumbersome extension cord and, untethered, it goes anywhere. My son’s family can use this product for overnight camping when they visit us in California. Its utility for this application is well described elsewhere. This is my product of choice as the first response to an unexpected power outage. Its portability allows for provision of power to the place where it is most needed in a matter of a few minutes. ” — eJames (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review here .)

I still run our large vacuum (less frequently) and have noticed a decrease in cat hair collected so I would say the robot definitely helps. ” — Cher B By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Shopping Writer for HuffPost There’s no contesting that snoring can be disruptive to your sleep and the sleep of those around you. In some cases, excessive snoring can even be a sign of something more malicious like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts, leading to a number of risks. According to dual board-certified otolaryngologist at ENT and Allergy Associates Dr. Ofer Jacobowitz , snoring — an event that occurs when the muscles of the throat relax, leading to a narrower airway — may be harmful for some people, even without having OSA. “In severe cases, the sheer energy of the vibrational trauma of snoring may damage the carotid arteries in the walls of the throat, causing plaques to accumulate,” said Jacobowitz, who’s also a clinical professor of otolaryngology, head and neck surgery at Northwell/Hofstra University . Besides OSA, he told us there are plenty of other causes of snoring that may be a little more innocuously explained such as smoking, nasal obstruction, weight gain, increased alcohol consumption and just plain exhaustion. Board-certified otolaryngologist with the Georgia Center for Ear, Nose, Throat and Facial Plastic Surgery , Dr. Aaron Fletcher , said that once you’ve seen a medical professional and ruled out conditions such as OSA or nasal polyps, there are a few over-the-counter tools, daily exercises (like singing) as well as lifestyle changes that you can implement to reduce snoring. “Snoring is not so easy to treat [and] often a combination of treatments leads to success,” Jacobowitz cautioned. Fletcher and Jacobowitz revealed some of these helpful anti-snoring items and treatments for adults below, as well as how they might specifically work for you if your goal is to finally get a soundless night’s rest.

    "article_content": "On assignment for HuffPost Sipping ice-cold sparkling water or a nice rosé from a cloudy glass certainly takes away from the experience. While that milky residue probably isn’t anything harmful, it’s still a bit gross. And anyone who regularly deals with cloudy glassware ― despite running it through hot water and plenty of soap in the dishwasher ― knows how frustrating the problem can be. So if you’d love to get rid of that hazy look to your glassware once and for all, here’s what you need to know. There’s a good chance that cloudiness on your glassware is due to residue left behind by detergent or hard water. But it could also be due to etching, which is not something you can reverse. Etching happens when the surface of the glass has eroded, and tiny scratches or pits in the glass will cause it to look milky or sandblasted. Sometimes, the beginning stages of etching will appear iridescent. Etching can be uniform or splotchy. Causes of etching include using too harsh of a detergent, washing in water that’s too hot or running the glass through too many pre-rinse cycles. So how can you tell if your glasses are etched? Try gently scraping off the haziness or wiping it off with something acidic, such as vinegar. If the haze is still there, it’s due to etching. Unfortunately, there’s not much you can do once your glasses are etched. But if that film scrapes or wipes away, good news: You can change the way you clean your glassware to prevent etching in the future. Read on to find out how. If your glassware is regularly coming out hazy, you may be using too much detergent, according to Sarah Bowen, an interior designer and co-founder of the U.K.-based home site Spruce Up . It’s a good idea to check your dishwasher instruction manual to see how much detergent you actually need to use. Next, Bowen suggested checking that your detergent is actually fresh. “Old, powdered detergent can leave hazy marks on your glassware,” she told HuffPost. “I recommend pouring fresh powdered detergent into a Ziploc bag, sealing it and rolling it tightly to keep the powder fresh.” Alternatively, try dishwasher pods. Though they tend to be more expensive than powdered detergent, Bowen said using pods may end up being cheaper in the long run since you won’t be tempted to overdo the amount of detergent you use. If your detergent doesn’t seem to be the problem, the haze on your glassware could be from the actual water. If your local water source has a high mineral content, it’s considered “hard” and can leave behind what’s known as limescale. To remove limescale buildup from glass, Bowen said you can soak your glassware in white vinegar or lemon juice. However, you’ll also want to treat your dishwasher with limescale remover to prevent future buildup. Some commercial products are designed for this purpose, such as Lime-A-Way, Jet-Dry or CLR cleaner. If you don’t have any of those on hand or want to go the natural route, you can also run an empty dishwasher cycle with a large cup of vinegar or lemon juice in place of detergent. Ultimately, however, the only way to prevent future hard water buildup is to treat it at the source. “The true way to fix it is to invest in a whole-home water softener, which will extend the life of all of your water appliances and pipes,” said Sean Busch, CEO and co-founder of Puracy , a natural cleaner company. Just be sure that if you go this route, the detergent you use is the right match for your water softness. Otherwise, you risk etching. Look for mild, clear soaps without additives, dyes or perfumes. You can also cut the amount of soap you use by half. As tempting as it is to toss every item into the dishwasher, delicate glassware in particular should only be hand-washed. “Everyday wine glasses and sturdy drinking glasses can be put in the dishwasher, but delicate glassware, handblown/painted glass, milk glass and crystal should be washed by hand to avoid breakage, yellowing or etching,” Katie Sadler, brand manager and kitchen expert for Whirlpool , told HuffPost. Knowing how to load your dishwasher the right way also helps. Stacking dishes too close together or blocking spray arms with bulky items will prevent glassware from being rinsed thoroughly. And though you should scrape off chunks of food before loading dishes (food particles can contribute to etching), avoid fully rinsing them. Many dishwasher detergents rely on enzymes to latch onto food and eat it away, Busch said. “When the enzymes are working hard, the rest of the detergent works better,” he said. Not to mention, you will save water. It’s also important to clean out your dishwasher filter every dozen uses or so, which takes less than a minute, Busch added. This ensures that any particles left behind aren’t recirculated during your next load and that your dishwasher cleans and drains properly.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost All too often, you find that you’ve fallen in love with a sweater or a shirt in the store only to bring it home and read those dreaded words on the label: “hand-wash only.” Or worse, “dry-clean only.” You tell yourself that the extra cleaning effort is well worth it. But as laundry piles up, it becomes increasingly tempting to ignore the tag’s instructions and simply throw the item into the washing machine. Surely there must be some leeway with manufacturers’ cleaning instructions. So, could throwing in a hand-wash-only or dry-clean-only item really be all that bad? We spoke to experts to get the lowdown. “Manufacturers develop their cleaning recommendations based on the type of materials used, construction and adornments,” said Rich Handel , the senior test project leader and resident laundry expert at Consumer Reports. While simply constructed clothing made of durable materials can hold up well, not all garments are suitable for the washing machine. “If the garment says ‘dry-clean only,’ it could shrink, become misshapen, or its colors may run,” said Jerry Pozniak, a dry cleaner with 38 years of experience and the CEO of luxury dry cleaning business Jeeves New York . Pozniak also noted that if your garment includes particular structural components (e.g., brims in baseball hats or underwires in bras), it’s a good idea to avoid the washing machine and opt for hand-washing instead. It may be tempting to skip a trip to the cleaners and hand-wash your “dry-clean only” pieces. After all, hand-washing is a gentler way to wash clothes, right? “If you’re adventurous and are willing to risk damaging the item, you could attempt hand-washing and hanging it to dry,” said Handel. But if it’s an item that you truly treasure or dropped some serious cash on, it’s generally not a good idea to attempt hand-washing a dry-clean-only piece. “Hand-washing” is not synonymous with “dry cleaning.” “‘Hand-wash’ means that the garment can be cleaned in water without risk of dye bleeding or shrinkage if it is not subjected to aggressive mechanical action and high spin rates,” Pozniak said. Despite the name, “dry cleaning” isn’t technically dry, as this laundering process uses liquid solvents to clean clothes . However, because the solvents used in dry cleaning don’t include water, dry-clean-only garments do not become damaged as they would if washed in water. While Pozniak noted that some items labeled “dry-clean only” could potentially be washed by hand (such as cashmere sweaters), you always run the risk of damaging the item by introducing water into the equation. “We had a client who had a black-and-white check dress labeled ‘dry-clean only’ that she got a small stain on. She tried to use a bit of soap and water to remove the stain, but the black bled into the white. She added more soap and water to correct the bleeding and made it worse,” Pozniak said. “We were able to fix the problem with a lot of effort.” While following “hand-wash only” garments’ instructions keep them in top shape, there’s no doubt that hand-washing can be a more involved process than simply tossing the items in the washing machine. Since many washing machines have “delicate” and “hand-wash” settings, is it actually necessary to wash your “hand-wash only” items physically by hand? “It depends on how treasured the item is and whether you are willing to risk damaging it,” Handel said. “Seeing how well the item stands up to hand-washing may indicate how it will bear with the delicate cycle.” While the alpaca wool sweater knitted by your late grandma should never go anywhere near a washing machine, that doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t use your machine’s gentle cycle for the less sentimental sweater you got on sale. “The hand-wash/delicate cycles vary from washing machine to washing machine, so some are more gentle than others,” Pozniak said. “In general, a front-load washer will be gentler than a top-load agitator washer,” Handel said. If you’re willing to experiment with putting your hand-wash-only items in your washing machine, mesh laundry bags may add a layer of protection. “Mesh bags are used to limit mechanical action and abrasion of the fabric during washing,” Pozniak said. “If you use a mesh bag and air-dry your garment, [the garment] technically may last a bit longer as it is somewhat protected in the wash in the mesh bag and then not subjected to tumbling during drying.” Although mesh bags can provide some protection for delicates, they won’t make these items invincible. “Even when using the mesh bag, you’ll want to wash like items together,” Handel said. “You wouldn’t put a delicate sweater with a heavy pair of jeans in the same load.” Pozniak reiterated that if your garment is dry-clean-only, using a mesh bag will not reduce the risk of bleeding, shrinking or damage when submerged in water. Don’t have a washing machine? You can actually get one of these tiny portable versions for a fraction of the price.

    "article_content": "For most, buying a home has never been easy, but in 2024, homeownership can feel like an altogether impossible milestone. Between sky-high interest rates, real estate prices far outpacing wage increases , and seriously tight inventory, many would-be homeowners can’t help but feel the odds are stacked against them. So, we asked members of the BuzzFeed Community who’ve put their homeowner aspirations on hold — either temporarily or indefinitely — to share their reasons with us. These are their stories. 1. “We’ve been trying to buy a home since 2020. At this point, we just refuse to pay outrageous prices, with horrible interest, for — and I cannot stress enough — crap. Most of the homes available in our area are new builds. Everything is plywood, staples, glue, and plastic. Everything. The entire house is basically held together by glue in various formats. I’m not paying over $400,000 for, at best, $50,000 worth of product, and most definitely not at 7% interest.” —Anonymous 2. “Because of HOAs. Screw HOAs. Knowing they exist in many neighborhoods and that you can’t just opt out of them plays a huge factor. They have the ability to be absolute assholes for no reason other than tripping on the first amount of power those bored jerks have ever had.” —Anonymous, 30, California 3. “My bank of 20+ years decided that despite them offering me outrageous credit cards every year no matter how often I told them to stop, I was a ‘bad risk’ for a mortgage due to being ‘older.’ The housing market is so screwed anyway that if I were to find something now that I could afford, it would be a shithole.” — bloodwynne 4. “It’s the lack of available homes, honestly. I have the down payment. I’m pre-approved for a loan. I feel like it’s a mad dash to beat the 2–3 groups of people that have joined up and formed landlord businesses in my town. They compete with each other, so it’s tough as a person just wanting to buy a single home for my husband and me. I don’t want to have to check home-buying apps every morning obsessively and answer calls from our realtor immediately or risk missing out on a property. Or, you miss out if you don’t immediately leave work ‘right now!’ to tour a property and make an immediate offer on the spot. Or you get stuck in a bidding war. It’s been going on for three years now. I regret not buying a home years ago. We weren’t as financially stable, so we thought waiting and building up our savings was the responsible choice. Now, I’m not so sure. There’s just nothing available in our area anymore.” — vibrantorc46 5. “I watched my parents lose their house during the recession — not because they did anything wrong, but because the economy shifted, and suddenly their income wasn’t enough. I’m looking at how unstable the economy has been since and the direction it is moving in, and I don’t have faith that we won’t have another financial crisis between now and the end of a 30-year loan. I’m also watching politics, and I am not sure if anywhere is going to be safe. As a queer female, many states are changing laws and policies to be directly hostile to my safety and health. Places that are likely to remain safe are expensive, and the cost of living is steadily climbing. I am priced out of where I grew up, and where I can afford to live may not be safe in the long term.” —Anonymous, 36, Oklahoma 6. “My kids are so rough on things just by being kids. I’d be pissed if the accidental hole they made in the wall was really ‘my wall.’ Now, I can just patch it the best I can and move on. I don’t stress as much with normal wear and tear because it’s not my investment.” —Anonymous 7. “The market decided to delay my search for me. The cutthroat market and the fact that wanting an inspection will likely cost you the house — because the seller will just go with someone who is willing to not do an inspection — mean no house for me. Why anyone would risk buying a home without an inspection blows my mind.” — winterwednesday9 8. “No matter how much I save for a down payment, it will never be enough to make any kind of dent in the monthly housing payment. It’s taken me 10 years to save $50K, and it’s a drop in the bucket compared to the housing prices in my area, where the median cost is over $500K. My partner and I have elderly parents here and jobs that don’t transfer well, so moving across the country isn’t feasible, either.” —Anonymous 9. “After working my ass off to save enough for a down payment, I realized I don’t actually WANT the experience of home ownership enough to buy one. I have cheap rent in a rent-controlled building, so I pay about half of the market rate in my city. I don’t worry about repairs, property maintenance, or leaving my house vacant when I travel, which I do about every month. If ever I fall on hard times, there are more protections for me as a renter in my home (thanks, government!) than there are for keeping a mortgage holder in theirs (screw you, banks!). The thought of being locked into a house is just not appealing compared to the low cost and freedom of my life now. Everyone my age I know who bought a home is miserable because of the money and stress involved with keeping up with it.” —Kylie, 36 10. “I was in the process of building a modular home on my small 3/4-acre property but then stopped the process in construction. Ultimately, the interest rates were too high, and my mortgage payment would still be $2,500. I make $90K a year and can’t afford to buy a house. That used to be considered good money. Here in California, home prices are dropping, but I was told that prices have nothing to do with the ‘value’ of a home. I call bullshit. When enough people stop buying at the prices that are out there, and prices fall, then the value of homes is falling. They need to fall off the cliff; we need another Great Depression to bring home prices back down to reality. Big Business has its fingers wrapped around our throats because everyone needs to sleep somewhere, right? It’s a consumable that they have figured out how to wrangle every last dollar out of people, forcing people to be renters forever.” —Suzanne, 53, California 11. “The combination of low inventory, inflated prices, and interest rates is the worst for buying a home. We would end up getting an older home that we didn’t love, and it would likely need work, or else things would start to fall apart. All at a price that we know is too high and not what it’s worth — and a mortgage that is three times what we would have gotten just a few years ago! Forget it. We’ll wait.” —Anonymous, 39, Washington, DC 12. “Purchasing a home is never ‘buy it and enjoy.’ There’s always something that needs to be done or fixed that can be a cash-sucker. I bought a condo, and on my first weekend home, Thanksgiving weekend, the refrigerator gave out with over $200 of food in it. Then the dishwasher exploded….and on and on. When I sold the place, the furnace broke down, so I had to replace it two days before the closing. I still like the idea of buying a home, but it would have to be really special and at a great price to compel me ever to do it again.” —Annie, 63, Tennessee 13. “We simply cannot find the right house that seems worth paying more for than our current rent. We’ve been in our small apartment for 16 years in a fantastic neighborhood that we love, and the rent is still very cheap. I would love to have a little more space and be able to have a garage and garden, but all the houses that become available are either way more home than we want to take care of or absolutely neglected money pits. My husband and I have construction skills and would like to be able to put some sweat equity into a house and make it the way we like it...but it seems like every house that may have been affordable is bought by a flipper whose work we don’t trust and don’t want to pay for. Now, we are looking for a piece of land to build a small house on, and we’re trying to save up more money to do so.” — sweetprincess25 14. “I have been saving for a while for a down payment on a house. Several years ago, I was close to having enough, but my mom was desperately in need of a stable home after having bounced around renting for most of her life. I contributed most of what I had saved so she could have stability as she approached retirement. After saving for a while again, I decided to become a single parent and put a good chunk of my savings towards IVF and starting parenthood. Now, I’m finally back to where I was before, financially, but the housing market has taken off so much that anything I can afford would be much smaller and in a worse location than the two-bedroom condo I currently rent. My landlord is great and hasn’t raised my rent to keep up with market rates, so I feel lucky and trapped. I don’t think housing prices will ever come back down to where they were. It feels like a chronic treadmill of trying to save enough but never getting there.” —Anonymous 15. “Being house-poor sucks. My husband and I owned a home for seven years almost a decade ago, but had to sell it because of family issues. Let me tell you: The cost of upkeep on a house is not worth it. Now, we rent a home and pay less than the mortgage we had. We don’t have to worry about if the fence blows down in a storm or if the roof needs replacing. That’s our landlord’s problem.” — ckilburn08 16. “Beyond the money, we can’t even find a decent house that stays on the market long enough for us to even look at it or consider an offer. In my area, the average time a house is listed is 18 days, and that’s if it even ever gets to be listed. My realtor told me 70% of houses he’s sold in the last year never get listed publicly — it’s all word of mouth ‘so-and-so is thinking of selling,’ and then next thing you know, the house is sold before anybody else gets a chance. The three times we have been able to look at a home and considered putting an offer in, we received word that offers higher than the asking price were coming in and beating us out. And these were for fixer-uppers, definitely nothing nice. Having the money to buy is one thing, but finding a home is another thing entirely.” — thegassygoose 17. “While interest rates and prices have skyrocketed, my income has barely changed. I already work two jobs to pay off student debt and medical bills and afford my current rent. If I bought a house, it would be a shithole for what I can afford, with no way to afford to fix it up and make it liveable.” —Courtney, 28, Nebraska 18. “I honestly have this thing about ‘ownership’ in general. The idea that people need to ‘own’ anything seems weird, as it’s a very colonial way of thinking. The idea of homeownership almost seems like a lie to oneself about how much importance we give to ourselves. Once we’re gone, we don’t own anything, so what’s the point of investing all my money in a home or buying land when it’s not really mine to begin with? Nah...I prefer to rent. At least then, I know the lease, like my time in this world, is finite, and I won’t be tied down by a deed.” —Mark, 36, Texas 19. “We can’t afford one in our school district. We live with my in-laws so my daughter can attend a school with outstanding special education services. She’s been able to thrive there, so it’s worth living in the basement for a few more years.” — jessethecowgirl 20. “As a person who has student loans, I’m aware of the decision I made, and I do make my payments, but it also makes it harder to save for a house down payment when your student loan repayment is $500/month, and hardly any of it is going toward principal! I take care of my mother, and that has its own expenses. Throw a car payment on top of that with insurance…and people wonder why millennials literally have to choose what they want: a house, a reliable car, comfortable living, having kids and growing a family, or a somewhat nice wedding. It’s only one these days. We have $15K saved up, and according to multiple lenders we’ve spoken to, we are nowhere near where we need to be to purchase a $500K home, granted our 700+ credit scores. So renting is our future for the next couple of years, and we will continue to save and see what happens with the market.” —Lee, 33, Texas 21. “My partner and I have been together for seven years, and we’re both in graduate school, so apartment living is best for us right now. We get to relocate to different cities without feeling tied down to a specific location, especially when it’s so expensive to buy a home. It’s nearly impossible.” —Eli, 27, California 22. “The cost of maintenance. In my current apartment, most repairs are free unless you’ve willfully caused significant damage. But I would have to do those things either myself or pay for someone else to do them if I owned a house. I’ve watched my parents spend over $20K in the last year alone on sudden, necessary repairs to their home that is getting older. I’d rather have the peace of mind of knowing it’s not coming out of my pocket than have to worry about and plan for huge repairs like that.” —Anonymous 23. “Life right now is too unpredictable, especially financially. I want to buy a home, but the thought of my roof leaking or needing to pay for repairs gives me anxiety. Paying rent is useless in the long run, but it gives me temporary financial relief and stability. I like that if my faucet stops or my A/C is broken, it won’t be taken out of my rent. I love knowing how much my bills, including rent, will be each month without financial surprises.” — itsmehi 24. “I’m working toward becoming a licensed architect, and I can’t see the value in purchasing a home that is a hack job of a ‘flip’ or so overpaid for that you no longer have the opportunity to fix the house because of a higher mortgage. I also went to grad school to help start my career and came out with $160,000 in student loan debt — the same cost as a home in some areas. If I got a house now, I would live paycheck to paycheck. This is why I still live at home at almost 33. I’m scared. I’m afraid of incurring more massive debt that I can’t afford. It’s just me; I’m single and don’t have another person to help manage, pay, and work on the house with me. I’m scared that I’ll never get to the point where I’ll actually be able to buy a house and live comfortably.” —Valerie, 28, New York 25. And finally: “If I think about it too long, it’s depressing and soul-crushing. My husband and I are in our 30s, have stable employment, and, as a whole, we bring in a comfortable household income...yet we feel we’ll never have the luxury of calling ourselves homeowners. It’s deflating. We work hard and are doing our best to give our son a great childhood, but I’m saddened that something as simple as a yard to play in or being a part of a neighborhood of kids will be a long road. Where we live, the average home price is nearly $500,000, and there’s a ton of competition as our area expands with more and more companies moving here. Since we’ve never owned a home, it’s not like we can just pull past home sale profits to go toward our down payment, closing costs, or renovations; therefore, we just can’t compete. Gone are the days of picking up a reasonable family home with an average income. Affordable housing is no more — but cheers to the American dream, right?” —Anonymous, 33 North Carolina By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Walks are critically important for dogs ― and their humans. They give your dog opportunities to get plenty of exercise, mental stimulation and socialization. And the same goes for you: It helps you get enough physical activity , which is key to preventing chronic diseases and boosts your mental health . Research shows people enjoy seeing their dogs happy on walks ; it’s a potent stress reliever. But it’s the 21st century, which means many dog owners don’t solely focus on their pets when they’re out and about. Instead, they multitask by scrolling on Instagram, flipping through TikTok or getting lost in a gripping true-crime podcast. Some animal experts have likened this to “ distracted driving .” If you’re not paying attention to your dog and the environment around you, you could easily wind up in a dangerous situation ― or lose out on bonding with your pet. As Dr. Katherine A. Houpt , a professor emerita of behavioral medicine at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, puts it: When you’re out walking, “your dog’s safety should be paramount.” Here’s why it’s so important to be present with your dog when you walk them: Most dogs know exactly what they want to do on a walk, which is, most likely, to sniff or, perhaps, catch up with another dog that’s a quarter mile ahead, Houpt said. But it’s not all interesting scents and fun, new friends. Some dogs might want to battle the approaching hound, snap at a nearby child or snatch a sharp chicken bone lying on the sidewalk. Worse, they could gobble up something poisonous such as chocolate, marijuana or candy containing xylitol. “Not keeping your eyes on your dog and what’s around is bad because various things could happen,” Houpt said. Additionally, when listening to a podcast, your eyes may be on your dog, but you may miss important auditory cues like an approaching bicyclist ringing their bell, a skateboard zooming by or a nearby dog growling that may trigger your dog. “Even that is probably not a good distraction when you’re walking your dog,” Houpt said. If you’re paying attention to your surroundings, however, you can stay on top of potential triggers or dangerous encounters. If, for example, you see a squirrel before your dog does, you can distract them and avoid having your elbow whipped around. You can prevent a dog fight or avert them from walking into the street right as a car pulls up. You can also enforce basic training by calling your dog closer to give them a treat before they have a chance to react to another dog or redirect them from an interesting ― but potentially dangerous ― snack on the ground. “When an owner is more attentive to their surroundings, they can be proactive versus reactive to these things,” said Dr. Melissa Bain , a professor of clinical animal behavior science at UCDavis Veterinary Medicine. If for no other reason, it’s worth keeping your phone in your pocket while walking your dog to bond with your pet. The human-dog bond significantly influences both the human and dog’s psychological, physiological and physical health. Walking a dog reduces negative emotions and boosts emotional wellness and life satisfaction, data suggests . It also creates opportunities for more interactions and bonding with your pooch, which, in turn, can decrease loneliness and increase self-esteem, empathy and self-regulation, according to research . The benefits of the human-dog bond are profound. In our ever-busy, always-plugged-in world, it might seem like an aimless strut is useless. But walking is, as one scientific report points out: “a highly sensual and complex activity where, ‘[d]ifferent encounters with objects and materiality, peculiar sensations and ineffable impressions may be experienced.’” You and your dog are exploring the world together. You’re listening to them and understanding their wants and needs in various situations. Knowing their likes and dislikes, quirks and personality, again, further strengthens your relationship , which makes it all that more rewarding. “When owners walk their dog, the hope would be that it is a time that they can spend one-on-one with their dog, enjoying their company with one another,” Bain said. This is all to say: Be present with your dog when you walk them. It’ll probably make you both happier , healthier and emotionally closer than whatever fleeting stimulation is streaming on your smartphone.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost When you’re looking to buy a top-loading or front-loading washing machine , there are some not-so-obvious pros and cons to be aware of. Beyond the location of the door, these machines can vary by efficiency, capacity, cleaning cycles and more. “There are several factors to consider before setting your heart on one model,” said Ian Palmer-Smith, an appliance expert at Domestic & General , an appliance care company headquartered in London . Consider your priorities: energy savings, space or affordability, Palmer-Smith said. We asked experts to weigh in on the differences between top-loading and front-loading washers, which they prefer, and how to decide which one is best for you. One of the biggest perks of a front-loading washer besides its “sleek aesthetic”: It can be stacked on top of a dryer, pointed out Morgan LaLonde , laundry brand manager at Whirlpool. “You can squeeze [them] into a much smaller space, which is a huge pro because a lot of people have a closet where their washer and dryer fit,” Patric Richardson, known as The Laundry Evangelist , told HuffPost. “Even if you have the luxury of space, stacking your washer and dryer gives you the extra space for a laundry sink, a folding station or a hanging bar. To me, it’s just so worth it.” While some top-loaders save space with a smaller footprint, most can’t be stacked on top of a dryer, Palmer-Smith noted. “ Front-load washers … have a rubber gasket to help keep water inside during a wash cycle, but they can prevent the empty tub from drying properly when the door is closed,” LaLonde explained. This can cause the growth of bacteria and mold and lead to a mildewy smell. The fix? She recommends leaving the door open after a wash cycle to allow it to dry. “I had the same machine for 16 years, and it was never mildewy because I never closed the door,” Richardson noted of his front-loading model. He said whether you have a front-loader or top-loader, it’s key to remember to clean your washer when you notice buildup on the door or drum — or about every four or five months. He uses a pound of Borax and a gallon of vinegar and runs it on the longest, hottest cycle. (On many washers, this is called the “clean cycle.”) Front-loaders can use up to 40% less water than top-loaders, according to Palmer-Smith. Front-loading washers “have drums with side paddles that lift up the clothes and use tub rotation and gravity to tumble them through a small amount of water,” according to the website for Energy Star , a program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. “They rinse clothes by repeatedly spraying high-pressure water on the clothes rather than soaking them in a full tub of water.” In addition to helping you save money on your water bills, front-loaders save on drying time and energy by quickly spinning clothes to wring out more water from clothing. “Top-load machines typically have faster cycle times on select models,” LaLonde explained. Top-loaders with agitators (tall spindles in the center of the basket) are usually the fastest washers, completing a load in 35 to 80 minutes, according to Consumer Reports . High-efficiency top-loaders (which don’t have agitators) do a wash in 60 to 85 minutes. And front-loading machines take the longest to finish a load, 70 to 120 minutes. The tumbling motion that front-loaders use to clean isn’t rough on clothing, LaLonde said. The motion of the agitators in top-loaders can be harsh on fabrics. Even high-efficiency top-loaders without agitators aren’t as gentle because the laundry tends to rub against each other, according to Consumer Reports . Front-loaders cost more to buy and repair, Palmer-Smith pointed out. ( According to Consumer Reports , the median cost of a front-loader is $1,038 compared with $740 for top-loaders.) But that said, front-loading washers do save you money on energy and water in the long run. It’s important to think about how the location of the door on a top-loader versus a front-loader affects accessibility to the machine. For example, if you have back pain, bending down to use a front loader may not be comfortable for you. Or if you’re shorter, it may be tough to pull clothing out of a top-loader. “My mother is … 5 feet tall. She can’t reach the bottom of a top-loader,” Richardson said. “She got a front-loader and put it on a pedestal … that put it right at her height. She doesn’t have to bend over to get into it.” From compact to extra large, most people don’t know that there are different sizes available for both top-loading and front-loading washers, Richardson said. If you’re the only person in your household, you may want a smaller machine, he noted, but “if you have four kids and they’re all in sports,” you may want to go for an oversized option. Another pro tip from Richardson: If you have a large family or large amounts of laundry, you could even stack two front-loading washers and dryers on top of each other in your laundry room. Even though Richardson grew up with a top-loader, he chose a front-loader when he bought his own washing machine and never went back. “I really prefer front-loading. It’s easier to get into and you can stack them,” Richardson said, noting he likes the motion the machine uses to wash the clothes. LaLonde likes a top-load washer with a removable agitator because it has a large, flexible capacity. It “allows me to remove the agitator when I need that extra space for larger items or bedding,” she said. Palmer-Smith said it’s difficult to choose because each model has its benefits and advantages. “There’s no right answer, and any choice is certainly a trade-off,” he said. “Both front- and top-load washers come with advantages, but it comes down to personal preference and laundry needs,” LaLonde said. Once you consider your priorities and what you need in terms of space, capacity, energy-efficiency, etc., Richardson recommends looking at the washers in person before purchasing. “Interact with it like you’re going to use it at home,” he said. “Open it up. Put your hands in it … make sure that you like the way it works.” For more invaluable laundry hacks and tips, listen to HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast episode on laundry.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Whether you’re going on an extended trip or just heading to work for the day, there are things you may (or may not) do when you leave that can actually compromise your home’s safety. “[Some] actions, or lack thereof, can significantly increase the risk of a burglary by providing information or access to potential intruders,” Gene Petrino , a retired SWAT commander and co-founder of Survival Response LLC, told HuffPost. “By addressing these vulnerabilities, you can regain control and better safeguard your home against unauthorized entry and possible theft.” From posting real-time location updates on social media to leaving your key under the front door mat, we talked to home security experts about what they don’t do — and what they do instead — to protect their own homes while they’re away. “[I would never post] that I’m going on vacation, out for the night, to a Taylor Swift concert, etc.,” said Rebecca Edwards , safety expert at SafeWise. “Don’t let the world know your every move.” She referred back to “Bling Ring,” when celebrities posted on social media that they were at an awards show or on vacation, and teens broke into their homes when they knew they’d be empty. Posting pictures of your vacation is safer to do once you return home instead of in real-time updates, advised Kirk MacDowell , home security expert at Batten Safe . “If you’re going out of town and you want to see friends, social media is fine if it’s person-to-person,” he added. “But I really wouldn’t blast out that you’re going away.” “ It’s shocking how often people do this and the number of burglaries … that take place because the burglar could just walk through the first door,” Edwards said. While double checking that your front door is shut and locked may seem obvious, it’s also important to secure entry points we don’t think about as much, like second-story or basement windows, according to Petrino. “Unlocked or open windows, especially those that are hidden from street view, can be easily accessed, allowing intruders a quiet and discreet way into your home,” he said. If you do have a security system, make sure it’s armed when you leave the house. Also, adding contact sensors to your windows allows you to conveniently double check if they are open through an app on your phone, Edwards noted. “ By maintaining a predictable routine, you allow observant intruders to plan a burglary around your schedule, knowing exactly when you won’t be home,” Petrino explained. He tries to change his routes and times when he departs and returns home to prevent potential intruders from identifying his daily schedule. If ladders or tools are out in the open, this can attract burglars, according to Edwards. Not only could burglars be tempted to steal expensive tools, but they could use them to break into your home. Since often people forget to lock their second-floor windows, someone could use a ladder to climb through a top-floor entrance, MacDowell explained. If you do keep ladders outside your home, make sure they are locked up and not easily accessible. “If you don’t normally have the porch light on all day and night, suddenly having it illuminated nonstop is a sign that the home may be unoccupied,” Edwards pointed out. Instead, you can set your lights on timers to give the impression the house is occupied. MacDowell particularly likes Z-Wave or Wi-Fi compatible systems that allow you to turn your lights on and off remotely. You can even set the lights to turn on and off after a particular “event” occurs. “Somebody walks up to the front door and rings the doorbell … five seconds later a light comes on inside the home,” he said, noting an example of how you could set things to happen. “I never leave signs that my house is unattended, [like] leaving the mailbox overflowing,” Petrino shared. MacDowell said he always notifies the post office to put a hold on his mail delivery while he’s out of town. Arrange for someone to stop by to clean up any unexpected brochures or papers that may have been left by your door. And don’t forget to pause subscription services, like newspapers or meal kits, Edwards added. If snow is piling up on your walkway or the grass isn’t mowed for a noticeably long time, this can signal that the house is empty. “An unattended property is a more attractive target because it reduces the risk of confrontation and increases the time burglars can spend undetected,” Petrino said. Hire someone or ask a friend to help with watering plants, mowing the lawn, raking leaves or shoveling snow. “These common hiding spots are well-known to burglars,” Petrino said. “If an intruder finds a spare key, they can enter your home quickly without the need to force entry, making it less likely for neighbors … to notice something amiss.” Edwards suggests giving your spare key to a neighbor or friend or using a smart lock with a code. Smart locks are particularly secure because they expire and can be changed, and you won’t risk losing your house key. “I’ll … ask a neighbor, friend or family member to use my car if it’s parked on the street or in front of my home to give the impression that I’m still coming and going,” Edwards said. MacDowell parks his car in the garage and tells his neighbors they can park in his driveway while he’s gone, which gives the impression that someone is home. Security measures like cameras, motion-sensor lighting and high-quality locks can make your home less appealing and accessible to burgers, according to Petrino. Edwards advises making your home go through the motions it normally would even when you’re away. For example, use a smart security system to turn on and off connected devices (like lights and the TV) and have a friend check on the house every couple of days. “[Do what you] can do to give burglars the impression that your home is occupied [and] that it’s secured,” she said. This increases the odds that “they’ll skip your home and move on to something that seems easier to target.” Want to invest in some tools to make your home smarter, like the one suggested above?

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Dirty dishes piled up in your sink. Clean clothes mixed with dirty ones on the floor. Junk mail sitting on your desk. Oh, and is that an old food wrapper under the couch? If your home is messy or disorganized, we’re with you. “Very few people actually experience a clutter-free or mess-free life,” said Michael Tompkins , psychologist and co-director of the San Francisco Bay Area Center for Cognitive Therapy. While some people may view messiness as a sign of laziness, the reality is that there are many unexpected reasons you might be messy — from life stages to personality traits to mental health conditions. We talked to experts about what these reasons are, and how to know whether messiness is a harmless part of your lifestyle or a problem that’s causing you distress. Read on for what might be the not-so-obvious reasons behind your clutter: Disorganization is one of the “hallmark symptoms” of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, said Terry Matlen , a psychotherapist and author of “The Queen of Distraction.” “Executive functioning is universally impaired in the ADHD brain.” This includes having trouble planning, initiating and completing tasks, and problems with working memory. “When you have difficulties with working memory... it’s very difficult for you to follow through from beginning to end of certain tasks,” Tompkins explained. “That means that you might get distracted easily.” For example, when you walk into your house, you might get distracted by your dog running to greet you, and so you put your keys down on a chair instead of in their designated bowl. “It’s not even a conscious decision,” Tompkins said. “The person just has trouble holding on to this idea of... putting their keys in the bowl.” Clutter can then ensue, he said. People with ADHD may also feel overwhelmed by the steps involved in completing tasks, which can lead to shutting down and not being able to manage clutter, Matlen said. For instance, you may be reading a magazine and then realize you forgot to clean up the dinner dishes, and that your clothes have been sitting in the washer for days. “The question/problem becomes: ‘Where do I even start?’” she said. “Executive function gets slammed.” Tasks of low interest or with no real deadline are especially difficult for people with ADHD to initiate, said Natalie Christine Dattilo , a psychologist and instructor at Harvard Medical School. Household chores like folding laundry or putting away dishes often fall into that category. “The state of our physical space can be a reflection of our state of mind,” Dattilo explained. “Our home may be messy and cluttered because we are overwhelmed and unorganized mentally, or simply too exhausted and burned out to keep up.” A person who is experiencing depression is likely feeling low energy and a lack of motivation. “Our motivation comes from a part of the brain that anticipates reward, and when we are depressed, that part of the brain effectively shuts down,” Dattilo said. “This can create a sense of apathy... which makes it even harder to generate the energy needed to initiate a difficult task like organizing, cleaning or decluttering.” Depression and anxiety can also cause difficulty with concentration, which can make small tasks feel overwhelming, Tompkins said. In addition, “studies have shown that clutter in our homes is associated with high cortisol levels ― the stress hormone,” Dattilo noted. So not only can feeling depressed or anxious affect our organization, but a cluttered home can make us feel more stressed and overwhelmed. Big life changes can be stressful, and might affect a person’s ability to manage clutter — even for someone who is usually tidy. If a person experiences a “psychosocial stressor,” it can impair their ability to cope, Tompkins explained. “Because they’re stressed... they may deprioritize getting things done around the house. Who hasn’t had that experience?” Matlen said having kids can be a particularly tough transition, especially for parents with ADHD. “Now you not only have others to care for when caring for yourself can be hard, but there’s also an onslaught of sensory electric shocks... crying babies, demanding toddlers, messes, meal planning [and] routines,” she said. Some other life transitions that can be challenging: starting college, moving in with a partner, getting married, going through a divorce and dealing with hormonal changes (like perimenopause and menopause). “It might be emotionally stressful to declutter [because] it might be a trigger to the past,” said Joseph Ferrari , a professor of psychology at DePaul University. For example, cleaning up or organizing particular items, like souvenir cups, concert tickets or keepsake gifts, may bring back emotional memories. “You pick the item up and you say, ‘Oh, I remember that trip. Oh, I remember that person.’ It [may] bring positive emotions, so you don’t want to get rid of it,” Ferrari said. “It might bring back some negative emotion... so [you’re] just going to put it down and not deal with it.” Personality can play a role in how tidy you are, particularly when it comes to conscientiousness. “Conscientious people tend to exhibit high levels of orderliness, dutifulness and self-discipline ... Think ‘Type A,’” Dattilo said. “People low in conscientiousness tend to be more easygoing, disorderly and less goal-oriented.” She said most people fall somewhere in the middle, but people who are low in conscientiousness may have a hard time maintaining an organized space. However, they also tend not to mind clutter as much. “People with lots of clutter... tend to be more indecisive,” Ferrari said. With indecision (also called decisional procrastination), people often don’t make a choice so they can’t be blamed for the outcome of the decision, Ferrari explained on an episode of “Speaking of Psychology,” the American Psychological Association’s podcast . If you don’t want to make a decision about where to put certain items, or whether to give away or keep them, you may end up avoiding the decision altogether, and so the clutter stays where it is. Most people experience at least some clutter and mess in their lives. But how do you know when it’s actually a problem? There’s a “tipping point” when you have too much, and it creates “chaotic living,” Ferrari said. He and Catherine Roster , a professor at the University of New Mexico, look at four areas when measuring the level of clutter (or “overabundance of possessions”): Is the clutter causing you distress, affecting the livability of your space, taking a toll on your relationships or harming your financial well-being? For example, if you’re late for an appointment because you couldn’t find your toothbrush and clean clothes to wear, that is disrupting an activity of daily living and causing distress, Tompkins said. Additionally, research has shown that cluttered homes can impact our satisfaction with life and our overall well-being, Dattilo explained. “In the same way that a cluttered space can make us feel overwhelmed and anxious, a well-organized and tidy space can make us feel calm and safe,” she said. If you feel like you’re struggling with messiness and disorder, you can search for a professional organizer in your area through the Institute for Challenging Disorganization . If you feel like you may have a mental health condition (like ADHD, depression or anxiety), make an appointment to get evaluated by a mental health professional, if possible. They can diagnose you and help you decide what treatment is best for you. If your messiness isn’t creating problems for you or someone else in your living environment, then it’s probably just a matter of your lifestyle preferences. “The most common misconception [about messiness] is that there’s a right way for you to live in your living environment,” Tompkins said. “People have different tolerances to clutter, [and] organization is more important to some than others ... A lot of times, the problem becomes not accepting that we have these differences.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost Summer brings lots of great elements, such as barbecues, beach days and later sunsets ― but it also means the start of a widely despised time: tick season . The small parasites can be hugely problematic in many parts of the country. Some carry the risk of Lyme disease, a debilitating tick-borne illness that can infect both people and animals — including dogs. “Nearly 90% of cases of Lyme disease in people and in dogs occur in the northeastern United States, and the remaining 10% of cases are primarily occurring in the Midwest, and the Upper Midwest area — Minnesota, Wisconsin ... and then there’s a small percentage in Northern California, but the overall spatial distribution of the disease is increasing,” said Dr. Jane Sykes , a professor of medicine and epidemiology at UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine in California. “Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi ... dogs are infected when bitten by a tick that carries the organism,” said Dr. Michael Stone , internal medicine veterinarian and associate clinical professor at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University in Massachusetts. Not all ticks are carriers of the disease. In the Northeast and Midwest, deer ticks are carriers; in California, western black-legged ticks transmit the illness, according to Sykes. No matter what, it’s always unsettling to find a tick on yourself, on your pet or in your home. While people can vocalize any symptoms they have after finding a tick, the same can’t be said for dogs. Even more troubling: “Most dogs show no signs at all when they’re infected,” Sykes said. Dogs can develop antibodies to the bacteria without symptoms, she added. “And when veterinarians are testing dogs routinely ... with tests that include a test for Lyme disease, getting positive results on that doesn’t mean that your dog has Lyme disease. It just means your dog was exposed to Borrelia and developed antibodies to Borrelia, but it’s not a reason to treat,” Sykes said. In some instances, dogs can experience issues related to Lyme disease. Here are the signs: According to Sykes, it takes at least a month for any signs of Lyme disease to appear in a dog (if they have signs at all). “The dogs that do develop signs, they can have sort of nonspecific signs like a fever and decreased appetite,” Sykes explained. They also may be more tired than usual and less active than usual too, she said. However, just because your dog has these signs doesn’t automatically mean they have Lyme disease. Many issues, from kennel cough to canine influenza to a gastrointestinal blockage can cause these issues. Either way, it’s a good idea to make an appointment with your vet if your pet shows any out-of-the-ordinary behavior. There are treatments available for most instances of Lyme disease in dogs, Sykes noted. A dog infected with Lyme disease may experience limping in one or multiple legs, Stone said. Specifically ― as with people, too ― Lyme disease in dogs can cause arthritis, Sykes noted. “The small joints ... of the limbs become inflamed, and that leads to lameness and sometimes swelling of those joints,” Sykes explained. “And so these dogs that are infected, they look almost like they’re walking on eggshells because every joint hurts.” Their lameness may shift from one leg to another in this case, she added. In a small percentage of dogs — particularly retriever breeds — a serious kidney complication called Lyme nephritis can happen, Sykes said. “It’s an acute kidney injury, there’s kidney failure and protein loss into the urine, and that can be very hard to treat,” she said. Signs of this rare condition include vomiting, more frequent urination and weight loss, according to Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine . “And that’s really the thing that we want to prevent the most through efforts to prevent Lyme disease,” Sykes added. “My primary recommendation is tick prevention,” Stone said. “There are many effective products available from your veterinarian.” Sykes added that many of the preventative products kill ticks within 24 hours of attachment to your pup. (A tick typically needs to be attached for at least 24 hours before it can spread Lyme.) “So, you can use preventative products, and they’re not going to be 100%, especially in areas where you’ve got lots of ticks ... they’ll decrease the chance of transmission,” Sykes noted. There are both prescription and non-prescription formulations available, Stone added, “but some products are more effective than others.” Lyme vaccinations and preventive pills are available, along with tick prevention collars and anti-tick sprays. As mentioned above, these preventive products don’t mean a tick won’t end up on your dog. If you do find a tick on your pup, you can remove it yourself using tweezers . To figure out the best medication for your pup, chat with your veterinarian, he said. And if your dog does become infected, your veterinarian can help determine the best treatment, too. “If your dog gets diagnosed with Lyme disease, or even if your dog has just a positive test result ... it means that your dog’s getting exposed, and you in your household are also at risk of getting infected and exposed,” Sykes said. Check yourself for ticks and be mindful of the signs of Lyme disease in people, which include joint pain, fever, chills, stiff neck and headache, according to Penn Medicine . The bull’s eye rash is a commonly known red flag, too. While it’s important to check your dogs for ticks after walks, it’s just as important to check yourself. Wearing protective clothing can also help keep ticks from attaching your skin, Sykes noted. Lyme disease can be serious in dogs and serious in people, too, making it crucial that both you and your pet stay protected.

    "article_content": "Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro were among the dignitaries marking the groundbreaking Sunday of a new structure replacing the Tree of Life synagogue , where 11 worshippers were murdered in 2018 in the deadliest act of antisemitism in U.S. history. Plans for the new complex include a cultural center, sanctuary, educational center and museum along with a memorial to the worshipers from three congregations who were murdered on the Sabbath morning of Oct. 27, 2018. The new design is by renowned architect Daniel Libeskind , whose previous works include Jewish museums, Holocaust memorials and the master plan for the redevelopment of the World Trade Center after 9/11. Emhoff, the first Jewish spouse of an American president or vice president, said his purpose on Sunday was to “send a message to the Jewish community of Pittsburgh, to the country, and to the world, that we must never forget what the poison of antisemitism can do.” “We are turning what was once a tragic crime scene into a place of hope and inspiration – a place that is full of light,” said Emhoff, who has met previously with Tree of Life family members and survivors of the attack. Survivors were among the speakers at the groundbreaking, including Tree of Life’s rabbi, Jeffrey Meyers. “Today we announce, loudly and clearly, to the entire world that evil did not win — that it did not chase us from our home, and it never, ever will,” Myers said. Shapiro, who is Jewish, reminded the audience that when he was sworn in as governor 18 months ago, one of the bibles on which he swore his oath was from the Tree of Life. To this day, that bible sits on his desk in the Capitol, he said. “Far too many people in today’s world either ignore or failed to learn from the atrocities of the past,” Shapiro said. “The task of remembering requires us to stand up, speak out, and ensure that everyone in this country knows the stories of the 11 people who were murdered here – and the dangers of antisemitism.” Much of the original synagogue complex, which had been unused since the shootings, was demolished earlier this year. The reconstruction is being overseen by a new non-profit organization, named Tree of Life. The building will include worship space for the historic congregation of the same name along with space for other activities. The attack claimed the lives of 11 worshippers from Dor Hadash, New Light and Tree of Life congregations, which shared space in the synagogue in Squirrel Hill, the heart of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community. Two worshippers and five responding police officers were also injured in the attack. The attacker was sentenced to death in 2023 after being convicted on 63 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death. “The end of our story is not victimhood, it’s about how we as Jewish people define ourselves and, out of the worst moments, our capacity to be resilient, to get up and to rebuild,” said Carole Zawatsky, chief executive officer of the Tree of Life non-profit organization overseeing the project in tandem with the congregation of the same name. Organizers aim to have the project completed by the end of 2026, she said in an interview, She said the project aims to honor the memories of the 11 who were killed and to combat the hatred behind such attacks. “What we’re truly doing is looking at the root of all identity-based hate,” she said. “In a society where antisemitism is allowed to flourish, all forms of hate are allowed to flourish. It is an American problem.” ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

    "article_content": "Trends Reporter Natalie Portman is relishing in newfound freedom after her divorce with Benjamin Millepied . The Oscar winner is sharing “gratitude” four months after finalizing her legal proceedings to separate from Millepied , the French choreographer whom she met on the set of “ Black Swan ” (2010) and later married in 2012, following rumors he was having an extramarital affair. “This year, on my birthday, I want to celebrate my gratitude for my friends who lift me up again and again,” she wrote Monday in the caption of an Instagram post , which features a carousel of selfies, group photos and travel snapshots from around the world. “HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEAUTIFUL HUMAN,” commented Kerry Washington , while Reese Witherspoon — who produced Portman’s “Lucy in the Sky” and purportedly taught her how to use Instagram — wrote: “Happy Birthday, you incredible diamond of a human! I love you.” The flood of well wishes also included heartfelt tributes from the likes of Chris Hemsworth , whom Portman starred opposite from in multiple “ Thor ” films, her “ May December ” co-star Julianne Moore , Tracee Ellis Ross, Mindy Kaling and fellow recent divorcée Isla Fisher . French publication Voici first reported in June 2023 that Millepied, who has two children with Portman, was having an alleged affair with environmental activist Camille Étienne. Portman filed for divorce the following month, which only became public once the matter was already finalized. The actor, whom Millepied molded into a bona fide ballerina for “Black Swan,” said earlier this year that the surrounding discourse was genuinely “terrible.” “I have no desire to contribute to it,” Portman told Vanity Fair in February . A friend of the former couple later told People that she’s “finding joy in her family, friends and work” and is mainly focused on “ensuring a smooth transition for her children.” “I lead a very non-Hollywood life in L.A.,” Portman told Vanity Fair. “I live on the east side,” she explained. “I have some friends who are in the entertainment industry, but many friends who are not, and we don’t do industry things when we hang out. We’re not going to Hollywood parties, we’re having dinners at home in the backyard.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Foot fetishes are often spoken of with an air of disgust or as the punch line of a joke, but it’s actually one of — if not the most — common fetishes out there. So we thought it was about time we dip a toe into the sexual fascination with feet. Broadly speaking, a fetish is “an intense sexual fixation on a generally nonsensual object, body part, practice or situation,” according to Kinkly.com . (A sexual fixation on a particular body part, such a feet, is also known as “partialism.” ) Some experts have used the word fetish to refer to something that is absolutely necessary to one’s sexual gratification. In other words, they can’t experience pleasure or orgasm without it. But the definition has loosened over time. “In the present, it’s less common for sex educators to define fetishes as things that must be part of sex,” sexologist Carol Queen told Healthline . “Instead, a newer definition says that fetishes are things that are erotic superchargers.” Below, people with foot fetishes (as defined in the more contemporary way) answer your burning questions about their kink. Different foot fetishists may appreciate different aspects of feet. Some like clean feet; others prefer dirty ones. Some enjoy big feet; others admire tiny feet. Certain individuals appreciate a high arch, a specific kind of toe shape or other physical attributes. Foot adornments, such as certain shoes, socks, stockings, nail polish or toe rings, are also popular. It’s really in the eye of the beholder. According to a 2023 survey from an online platform where you can buy and sell foot pictures, called Fun With Feet, more than half of respondents said the biggest turn-on for them was the taboo nature of foot fetishes. “The dirtiness and disgust that’s associated with feet in many cultures just makes it all the more appealing,” one respondent said. “It’s like a forbidden fruit that I just want to savor.” Others say they’re titillated by the fact that feet are a part of the body that we don’t get to see all that often as they’re typically at least partially covered in public . There’s something intimate about seeing someone’s bare feet since that’s usually reserved for the beach, pool or a private setting, like someone’s home. Jeremy M., a 40-year-old whose last name has been omitted to protect his privacy, told HuffPost that he was a teenager when he first realized he had a foot fetish and found himself “ checking out feet or toes, especially the sexy, bright-painted colored ones.” “The summertime is the best because everyone is wearing open-toed shoes or sandals,” he said. He said he enjoys smaller feet as well as “perfectly lined toes where no toes are longer than the other.” “Some guys like them dirty — for me, I prefer clean feet,” he said. His belief: If a woman has “well-maintained feet,” then she must take care of herself in other ways, too. Again, there’s no one way to satisfy one’s foot fetish. For some, it’s a concept they might enjoy just fantasizing about in their erotic imagination without acting on it. Some like to lick or suck on their partner’s toes or massage, caress or smell their feet. And others might want to have a partner use their feet to stimulate their genitals. M.K., a 32-year-old man who asked that we refer to him by his initials, told HuffPost that he personally likes to look at anime-style images and videos of feet with “some actual people mixed in there.” “From there, sometimes I look at bare feet, sometimes I like socks, sometimes pantyhose or stockings,” he said. Some of Jeremy’s previous partners who knew about his fetish would “do things like sneak their feet under the table at a restaurant and rub them on my crotch when nobody could see it and I had to act all normal,” he said. ” Something about that feeling — it was different than having them just use their hand.” He’s also had sexual experiences with a few women who instructed him to kneel down and “worship them head to toe,” he said. This kind of dominant-submissive dynamic can be appealing to folks with foot fetishes. “Sucking on their toes and being told what to do — there’s something about that dominance from a pretty woman just making you show her how much you appreciate every inch of her,” he added. Though some people turn their nose up at foot fetishes, Jeremy has learned “many men and women actually love it.” Having a foot fetish is not all that different from loving “large boobs or a big ass,” said M.K. “It’s literally one of the tamest and most common fetishes out there.” As long as a foot fetish, or any sexual desire, is explored in consensual ways and isn’t distressing to the individual, it’s something to be enjoyed rather than looked down upon.

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost In the modern age of dating, it’s usually safe to assume a couple is getting serious when they post a photo together and make it “Instagram official.” But if you’re dating and really want to signal your commitment to a new partner, you might be better off simply scaling back on those “likes” of other people’s thirst traps. That’s a key takeaway from a new study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships that looked at how certain social media behaviors can strengthen relationship stability, especially for people with high levels of attachment anxiety . To create a feeling of security, it’s less about posting about the relationship ― tagging your partner in a story, for instance, or hard launching them on Instagram with a mid-carousel photo . Instead, what fosters a real sense of security is the way in which you interact with others online: Are you “liking” random people’s selfies? Following a ton of hot people ? Most importantly, are you actively shutting down threats from attractive people? “It appears, at least from my work, that effective commitment expressions on social media rely less on a presence of the positive and instead require an absence of the negative,” said study author Alexandra E. Black, a postdoctoral scholar at the Social Connection and Positive Psychology Lab at Arizona State University. “There’s a well-known study finding that ‘bad is stronger than good’ ― and I think that dynamic plays out on social media as well,” Black told HuffPost. In the study, Black found that anxious people reported feeling threatened when seeing online “evidence” that their partner may be interested in someone else, she told HuffPost. (Those with anxious attachment styles may fear abandonment in relationships, certainly more than those with secure attachment styles .) “It can be easy to get caught up in ambiguous information on social media, and anxious people are especially vulnerable to this,” she said. The study involved participants of all gender and sexual identities, though most were women, and people who identify as heterosexual or bisexual. At first, Black was just trying to identify which online behaviors are most important for perceiving commitment by a romantic partner: “What can a person do online that makes you believe they are committed to your relationship?” she asked 240 undergraduates. She then took those behaviors and narrowed them down, asking a smaller group of undergrads to rate them on degrees of perceived commitment. From there, 900 participants were asked to evaluate hypothetical scenarios where partners performed or did not perform these commitment-signaling behaviors. Black found that four behaviors most effectively communicated commitment: “Deleting dating apps, ignoring flirtatious messages, indicating relationship status online, and unfollowing people perceived as threats,” she said. The second experiment got a little spicer, testing the above behaviors in a more experimental setting: Participants were given a hypothetical scenario where they discovered their partner had been interacting intimately with an “attractive alternative” on social media. (“Hot stranger” probably doesn’t fly in academic texts.) From there, they were then randomly assigned to read either a high-commitment response from their partner ― for instance, a response where their hypothetical boyfriend told the other person that they were in a relationship and then unfollowed them ― or a neutral response (the hypothetical boyfriend discussing a funny cat video). Participants’ feelings of relationship security and satisfaction were measured before and after reading these scenarios. Unsurprisingly, anxiously attached people reported significantly higher levels of distress, discomfort and jealousy when imagining their partner engaging with the hot stranger overall. Those “high-commitment responses” on social media (“I have a boyfriend,” for instance, followed by an unfollow) successfully increased perceived partner commitment, and the perceived devaluation of alternatives ― regardless of attachment styles, avoidant and secure types ― were convinced, too. Unfortunately, these behaviors did not translate to anxious people experiencing significantly enhanced feelings of security or relationship satisfaction, as Black hypothesized it would. “I was disappointed that the partner buffering condition didn’t seem to help anxious people feel more secure,” the researcher said. That doesn’t mean those commitment signals don’t matter, it just means that if you’re dating an anxious person, it may take more to help alleviate any insecurities and downplay any relationship threat. “Anxiously attached people actively seek out threats in their environment,” Black explained. “They may discount positive relationship behaviors because they place more emphasis on negative behaviors, as warnings that the romantic partner is going to leave them.” Needless to say, it’s probably a good thing that Instagram did away with its follower page , where you could see what people were “liking” and commenting on in real time. “I could definitely see having access to that information as adding to the long list of what makes an anxious person spiral in a relationship,” Black said. “For their sakes, I’m glad that feature is gone!” There are some limitations of the study, of course: The data was all self-reported, which can be biased. The focus was a bit narrow, too, focusing on newly formed relationships among undergraduates. Danielle Wayne , a therapist who specializes in anxiety, said she hears less about this issue from her older clientele, though she sees how some stray “likes” and follows could trigger an anxious person. “Another factor is time spent on social media,” she said. “If our partner is always on their phone and on social media, that doesn’t help us feel secure in our relationship. If anything, it feels like they’re more in a relationship with TikTok than us. I think this impacts a lot of relationships.” What psychotherapist Tess Brigham finds most interesting about the findings is how the top four commitment behaviors mirror things people do offline when they want to signal they’re in love. “Announcing your dating status is the same thing as walking down the street holding hands: You’re telling the people around you, ‘I care about this person’ and ‘we’re together,’” she said. “Deleting dating apps is the same thing as telling everyone around you, ‘I’ve met someone.’” In her office, many of Brigham’s clients admit to feeling uneasy about the ways their partners interact with others online. She thinks a lot of the uneasiness stems from the fact that these interactions are mostly with virtual strangers. If the “attractive alternative” was someone we were more familiar with ― someone in our partner’s social circle, for instance ― we could suss out the dynamic and know if the person poses a threat. The same isn’t true online. “When you can look at your partner and this other person together, you can make a more accurate analysis of the situation,” Brigham said. “Whereas, these interactions with someone your significant other follow tends to feel more mysterious and therefore ‘scarier’ versus looking up and seeing your partner having a lively conversation across the room at a party.” Social media may make it harder for people to feel secure in their relationship, but Brigham reminds clients that if someone is going to cheat, they’re going to cheat regardless of Instagram being on their phone. Ultimately, social media alone won’t change your partner’s relationship patterns or trustworthiness. “If your partner shows up when they say they’re going to show up, if they listen to you and respect your opinions then they’re probably going to approach social media the same way,” she said. “In that case, they’re going to be mindful of who they follow, they’re not going to want to friend or follow people you’re not comfortable with and they’re going to want to tell the world you’re together.” “The same is true for someone who is unfaithful,” the therapist said. “They’re going to be unfaithful with or without social media.” As for those couples who cede their passwords to each other to feel more at ease, Brigham feels skeptical. “If you don’t trust your partner, getting full control over their social media and being able to read every message and control who they follow isn’t going to make you feel more secure,” Brigham said. That said, if your partner’s social media use is bothering you, the therapist said it’s reasonable to tell them something along the lines of, “I’m uncomfortable with you following so-and-so or all these Instagram models” followed up with an explanation on why it bothers you. “If you find yourself having to go to your partner over and over again to explain how you feel, it likely has nothing to do with social media or who they follow,” she added. “Ultimately, it has to do with that other person’s desire and commitment to the relationship.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost As she gears up for the release of her first feature film in five years, Jessica Alba is sharing a rare glimpse into her relationship with husband Cash Warren . Speaking to People in an interview published Friday, the “Sin City” actor said she and Warren, a film producer, have worked hard to “really find time to make time for each other” over the course of their 16-year marriage. “Going through the motions of the day to day is what it is, but it’s important to just know that we have to be a priority, and taking those moments to see each other and have a giggle and not be on the phone and just actually connect,” Alba told the publication. She went on to note: “Anytime we ebb or flow, we just look around and it’s like, ‘Actually, at my worst, I’m still better off with you.’ You have to look up and say, ‘Would my life be better if we weren’t together?’ And every time, it’s, ‘No.’ We’re friends, you know?” Alba and Warren met in 2004 while working on “ Fantastic Four ,” which also starred Chris Evans and Kerry Washington. Shortly after the two were introduced, Alba said she “called my best friend and was like, ‘I met this guy and I feel like I’ve known him forever and I’m gonna know him for the rest of my life.’” “The romantic stuff comes and goes,” she told Cosmopolitan in 2010, according to Us Weekly , “but it’s like, ‘Does that person have your back?’ You have to be a team navigating through wherever life may lead you and I want a friend for that.” After dating for about four years, Alba and Warren were married in May 2008. The couple share three children: daughters Honor, 16, and Haven, 12, and son Hayes, 6. Alba will next be seen in the action thriller “ Trigger Warning ,” due out next week on Netflix . She plays Parker, an active-duty Special Forces officer who takes over the family business after her father’s unexpected death, only to find herself at odds with a violent gang running rampant in her hometown.

    "article_content": "Warning: This post contains mentions of abuse. We recently asked the BuzzFeed Community to tell us the “final straw” moment that made them go no-contact with a toxic parent. Here are the shocking — and heartbreaking — results: 1. “My father told my mom, whom he’d been married to for over 40 years, that he had found someone else who was ‘loving and communicative’ IN A LETTER. He is a narcissist who did nothing but bully my amazing mom for years. He gave her that letter, and she told him she’d read it when she was ready (he had moved out at that point), and he continued to act like nothing was different despite knowing full well what he had written.”“He’d done a lot of horrible things up to that point, but cheating on her was the last straw for both me and my brother. I found out today that he has essentially joined a whole other family while leaving the rest of us behind. He’s such a coward and a sad excuse for a human being. Have been no-contact for months, and it’s been the best decision.” —39, Canada 2. “I’d grown up with my parent frequently lying to people outside our family about big and little things. Some were scams on good people, and I had to cosign the lying frequently. We had a general rule of keeping family business within the family. Fast-forward 20 years, and I learned I’d been being lied to as well about everything, including the circumstances of my birth, my parent’s relationship, and subsequent divorce.” “What is worse, they had been gaslighting me for YEARS about these things, even when I asked direct questions. When I finally became a parent myself, that was it. I couldn’t take it anymore and ceased all contact. Yes, I realize my parents will lose out on their grandchildren, but I cannot force them into a life of lies.” —38, Ohio 3. “I went no-contact with my dad. He had always been emotionally manipulative, especially after my parents divorced when I was 9. But the last straw was when it was Christmas Break during my senior year of high school. I was supposed to spend Christmas with him, but I did not want to spend it with him. He then proceeded to CALL THE COPS ON ME. A 17-year-old.” “He texted me and said he was going to have them get me out of my mom’s house and into his at whatever cost. He also refused to sign my passport, so I had no form of ID for, like, a year and a half. Went to court multiple times over it, and (thankfully!) even the judge saw through his BS.” — allytou 4. “Having been emotionally abused by my father my entire life, my mother died suddenly, leaving us alone together. Never did I know what a horrendous being he really was until then. I tried for two years, looking after him, but he turned my entire family against me, revealed an affair he’d been having, stalked me, and, the very last straw, destroyed the power of attorney document he’d had me sign years ago.” “In a way, that set me free, but boy, did it f*** me up realizing he never wanted me to exist in his life.” — mintyvonspool 5. “I’ve been no contact on and off with my mom for 17+ years, and every time I try and see if she’s changed, she hasn’t. I recently had my first child, and as a new mom, I missed that connection, so when she reached out, I replied. It went okay at first, and when I finally showed her pictures of my daughter, I told her that I was not posting pictures of her on the internet. She said she accepted that. Things were fine on and off, but she would make comments that annoyed me, but not enough to cut her off until one day, she made my daughter’s photo her Facebook profile picture.” “I was so upset, and she acted like it was nothing and took hours to remove her photos. She finally did, and I refused to share any more photos. She then began lashing out at me, and I blocked her. A year later, she somehow got unblocked and messaged me after seeing a comment I left on a cousin’s photo. I made it clear I didn’t want to talk to her, and she began lashing out instantly ... told me that I’m a terrible mother, even though she has never seen me as a mother nor has she met my daughter — all while expecting access to us. I’ve finally learned my lesson.” — poeticdog96 6. “When the $200,000 that I transferred to my mom’s account wasn’t enough, and she called it, ‘Merely $200,000.’” —40, USA 7. “My dad has always been extremely judgmental and quite the vapid narcissist. Nothing I ever did was good enough, and years of therapy unraveled all of the trauma he’s caused me. With all of the criticisms he gave me growing up, I started putting on myself. I was now never good enough for myself, never good enough for anything worthwhile to happen in my life. I tried my entire life to get his acceptance, support, and love. I even changed my major in college just to appease him. I finally met my wife, and I now have the unconditional love I so longed for. When we got married, my dad didn’t call or text.” “I took it upon myself to be the bigger person and sent him a pic of us after our big day. His reply? ‘Yeah, your brother told me.’ It was a long time coming to cut him off, but I’m so much better for it.” — marisatavares 8. “They urged me to maintain a relationship with another family member who they were well aware was verbally, emotionally, and mentally abusive towards me my whole life — and all others in their life — after I’d decided to go contact with that family member. They have never truly understood the importance of mental and emotional health, or made it a priority in their lives, or the lives of the family they raised.” —Anonymous, USA 9. “I once had an amazing relationship with my mom; I talked to her every day for at least an hour. After my stepdad died, I was the only child to help her move back home (they had been living 11 hours away). It took multiple trips. I found and closed on a home with some property for her, repaired her (non-running vehicles), and fixed up her new place (painted, replaced carpet, etc). Our relationship deteriorated when she made it obvious to my son (15 at the time) that she didn’t love him because of who his father is.” “I lost it, called her a bad human, reminded her that he was the ONLY grandchild to help her move (out of six), and said a few other things that I don’t regret. I had hoped to repair the relationship, however. Fast-forward five years. My partner of eight years was murdered. We had been friends for over 20 years. I was devastated and heartbroken. I saw my mom in a local grocery store and was walking up to her, intending to give her a kiss on the cheek. She must have seen me out of the corner of her eye because she started backing away. I stopped about five feet away from her. I took a deep breath and said, “X died, mom.” She met my gaze, SMIRKED, and said, “Oh, I know.” Needless to say, I haven’t spoken to her since. I miss my mom.” —49, USA 10. “I set a boundary for the sake of maintaining a peaceful environment regarding topics that I don’t want to be discussed in my home when my parents visit (politics, conspiracy theories, etc.), and I was accused of censoring them. This was the moment I realized that any effort to have a relationship with them would not work if they were not willing to put ‘their rights’ aside for the sake of our relationship.” —41, Kentucky 11. “Not my parents, but my husband’s mother. We had a good relationship for years, even though she was out of her mind. It was always directed toward other people, so I tried to never let it bother me. My husband and I briefly separated, and she said some offensive stuff about me to him. He told me. We got back together, and I continued to be civil and attend family functions. Then, the 2016 election happened, and she went off the deep end. She said some offensive things to me out of nowhere on social media, and it exploded.” “I agreed to a ‘family meeting’ to help my husband because he felt stuck in the middle. It turned into a screaming match, and she spewed wild lies that I actually had receipts for. When I went to pull out those receipts, she lost it. However, we left that meeting with, ‘We are going to work on it and be better.’ Fast-forward two months, and we visit and have a good time and act like everything is okay. We leave, and she pocket-dials me, calling me all sorts of horrible things to my father-in-law in the background. I’m listening while my husband drives us home. She picks up the phone and realizes I’m there. Acts like she didn’t call. I hung up, looked at my husband, and said, “That will be the last time I ever deal with your mother again.” It’s been eight years, and it was the greatest decision I ever made. I still have slight auxiliary inconveniences because of our kids, and she’s still his mother, but to not have to deal with that woman face-to-face has been the biggest relief.” —38, Colorado 12. “I’ve gone no-contact with my father twice. The first time was right after he and my mom divorced. He lived near my brother and was actually pretty involved in my brother’s kid’s lives, but after the divorce, he sent a letter to my brother letting him know that he would not be a grandpa anymore, that this time was about him (it’s always been about him), and that he was going to focus on himself. This broke my niece’s and nephew’s hearts. My own children were very young at the time, and they didn’t really know him, so I decided I wouldn’t let this man hurt my children. About eight years later, my oldest daughter started asking about him. I told her I didn’t have a relationship with him, but if she wanted one, proceed cautiously.” “By this time, he was remarried and settling down again, and again had a relationship with all his other grandchildren. But I was determined to let my children decide what relationships they wanted once they were older. So, we had an uneasy reunion, but as far as I could tell, he was being kind to my kids. About two years after that, my brother was getting married. I had been seeing my boyfriend for a year and wanted him to meet my family, including my kids, at the wedding. Well, my narcissistic father walked into the wedding with a huge chip on his shoulder (probably because he wasn’t the center of attention), and when I went to introduce him to my boyfriend, he just walked away. Not a word was said. Even to this day, seven years later, he won’t say a word to my boyfriend at family functions. No one has any idea why, not even my siblings, who still have relationships with my father. My boyfriend is the kindest man I know. So, I went no-contact for the second and final time. He lives in another state now, so I doubt I’ll ever see him again, and I’ve made my peace with that. It’s not easy having a relationship with a narcissist, and you have to cut the toxic people out of your life so you don’t get sucked into it, even when it’s family.” —47, Colorado 13. “I always had a rough relationship with my mom, and it got worse when she cheated on and eventually left my dad for his brother. We were in a better place, and she agreed to watch my 1-year-old daughter while I went on a babymoon for my second child. She had agreed to do this months in advance but ‘changed her mind’ weeks before our trip when she realized she had to take a vacation from work to watch her. This was admittedly the straw that broke the camel’s back.” “We haven’t spoken in over a decade, and she doesn’t know her grandchildren at all; she’s made no effort.” —36, Wyoming 14. “The final straw with my parents was when they would not support my decision to attend college in another state, even though I was offered a scholarship and I had already worked hard at community college for two years. They would have preferred me to stay home and keep raising their three other children and continue cleaning their home (even though my mom stayed at home). I was Cinderella, and my going to college would ruin their plan for me to continue taking care of everyone else. This was also more obvious when they threatened to call the police and say I stole my own car (since my dad’s name was also on the title), and they didn’t want me to have it if I was leaving them.” “I was young and naive, and I complied. They showed further ‘support’ by giving my car to my younger sister (who then crashed it). I eventually got my car back and removed his name from the title, but it took 10 years and many years of therapy to get there.” —32, Florida 15. “My grandmother passed away, and my mother and uncles (who all own their own houses and are fairly financially stable) made sure to keep me, my sister, and our cousins out of the will. There were multiple properties (nothing too fancy, but a condo in Boca and a small cabin in Vermont) and some money. I found this out at the funeral last June and felt disgusted by the greed of the boomers in my family but kept quiet. I was a hard worker (fully employed during a challenging grad school program and having two jobs at other times). I never gave myself a break with an ‘I just have to get through this’ attitude. My husband and I had taken a single vacation in our ten years of marriage, and it was in 2014 (only because he got a disability settlement, and we decided to splurge a little).” “The month after the funeral, I confessed to my mother that I had been working so hard and still had so much debt ... She said, ‘I wish I could help you.’ She most definitely could help me, but she would rather have a summer cabin. I slowly stopped answering phone calls/texting back and then emailed both parents a little before Mother’s Day to let them know that they would not be hearing from me.” —Anonymous, New Mexico 16. “My husband and I went no-contact with his parents. The final straw after years of crossed boundaries, disrespect, and emotional incest was when my mother-in-law screamed at my mom. My MIL had paid for a cheap flight for me to go to Phoenix to get my car. It was a flight in the middle of the night, and I was supposed to drive my car (which we weren’t even sure still worked) back to Salt Lake City alone. After my flight was delayed multiple times, I asked my husband to come pick me up because I wasn’t comfortable taking the flight anymore. My MIL, who was with my husband at the time, lost her mind and started screaming at my husband, saying that they would never pay for anything for us ever again if I didn’t take that flight.” “Mind you, I could either reschedule the flight for the next day or get a full refund. But my MIL decided that I absolutely had to take that flight. My mother happened to call my husband during the fight, and my MIL ended up screaming at my mom to tell me to ‘man up’ and take the flight. After that, my husband and I had a loooooong conversation about how his parents had affected our individual mental and physical health and our relationship. There were many other horrible things that happened, but that was the final straw.” — fancyjaguar16 And finally... 17. “When I finally started therapy at the age of 40, I realized that we had never really connected to my parents. My father worked all the time; my mother dominated the house with her temper. The phrases she said to belittle me and negate my feelings all came up in therapy. I realized that I rad no desire to try for an authentic relationship as I would have to fight against my parents’ engrained dynamics and their assuredness that nothing was wrong in our family the entire time.” “I just decided to let go of the pretense I had put on for decades.” —43, Nevada By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost With a population of over 8 million people ― many of them living in older apartments with paper-thin walls ― there’s bound to be some issues with noisy neighbors in the city that never sleeps. This column’s question comes from a New Yorker who’s feeling secondhand embarrassment for her new neighbor ― a man who hasn’t learned to use his indoor voice while masturbating. We asked Thomas P. Farley ― a nationally regarded etiquette expert who goes by Mister Manners ― to tackle this very specific noise complaint. (Loud neighbor sex we’ve heard of, but loud neighbor masturbation is a different story.) “Noise issues arising from a space beyond one’s own walls are among the most sensitive of topics for neighbors to discuss. As a member of my building’s co-op board, I have heard innumerable tales of grief as adjacent neighbors recount the commotion emanating from above, next door or below ― from crying babies to loud music, piano lessons to hard-soled foot traffic. And yes, lest we forget, lovemaking. (Or in this case, solo love.) For the aggrieved party, the typical trajectory of these matters runs the course of surprise, annoyance, exasperation, and finally, either a temper eruption or frustrated resignation. Vexingly, the neighbor generating the noise is often completely unaware they are making any disturbance at all. This devolution is unfortunate. I believe firmly that if approached directly, politely and considerately, many (though certainly not all) offending parties will take steps to reduce ― if not completely eliminate ― clamorous incursions. I would advise anyone in a scenario similar to “Blushing in Brooklyn’s” to weigh the gravity of the matter and then tread carefully if at all. Is the peal of passion something you hear once or twice a month? Or is it morning, noon and night daily? A white-noise machine or a fan can drown out a whole lot. A pair of headphones even more. But if these tactics are incapable of restoring your peace and quiet, it is probably time to have a gentle word with this neighbor. Find a time outside of work hours (perhaps midday on a Saturday or Sunday) to knock on the individual’s door and have a brief conversation that ― once the pleasantries have been exchanged ― segues into a version of: ‘I’m sure you’re not aware, and forgive me, because I know this is a bit awkward, but I’ve been having difficulty getting a decent night’s sleep the past several weeks because of the activity that seems to be coming from your apartment around [fill in time] each night. I know sound travels in our building, and I’m wondering if there’s anything you might be able to do to reduce the noise at all?’ In the ideal world, the neighbor will apologize immediately and offer to make some significant adjustments. To which the petitioning neighbor should express great gratitude. Could an anonymous note do the job? In the interest of candor and transparency, I would counsel the neighbors have a respectful face-to-face conversation versus slipping any letter under the door of a noise offender. The moment a note is passed, a guessing game will begin and two possible outcomes may follow —neither ideal. First, the noisy neighbor may wrongly assume it was someone else who wrote the note and begin acting awkwardly around them with no hint as to why. Alternatively, by process of elimination, they may figure out the actual note-writer and — as their feelings quickly morph from embarrassment to incredulity — decide to take their decibels to the next level. If the neighbor is not conciliatory or makes a brief change only to lapse again into raucousness, the distressed party can elect to escalate the matter to a landlord or managing agent as a potential violation of a lease or of the building’s house rules. In such scenarios, be aware that punitive action may be slow to happen ― if it happens at all. In this unfortunate instance, grim acceptance may wind up being the least contentious way forward, chalking the moans up to being among the many annoyances that arise when residing in such intensely close proximity with eight million other people.” When it comes to etiquette columns, the questions and advice tend to be a bit stuffy: Who really cares what fork you use at dinner? But that’s not the case here: How To Be Decent will cover topics that actually affect people, like “Should you recline on a plane?” and “How do I tell my neighbors I can hear them having sex?” Got a question about a thorny interpersonal issue you’re having?

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Despite months of media speculation over the nature of their relationship, Kevin Costner insists he and Jewel are not dating. Appearing on “ The Howard Stern Show ” Tuesday, Costner said he and Jewel have had “tremendous conversations” in recent months, but clarified, “We’ve never gone out, ever.” “We have a friendship, we don’t have a romance, and we’ve not dated,” the “Yellowstone” actor explained. “She’s beautiful and smart enough for all those things. It just has never happened for us.” Elsewhere in the chat, he noted: “She’s special, and I don’t want these rumors to ruin our friendship, because that’s what we have.” Costner and Jewel were first romantically linked in December, when TMZ published photographs of the pair looking cozy together in the British Virgin Islands. At the time, People reported that there was “very big attraction on both sides,” adding that the relationship was “fresh but not brand new” by then. The reports seemed auspiciously timed given that Costner and his wife of 19 years, Christine Baumgartner, had split just months previously. The former couple’s divorce was finalized in February. Speaking to Elle in April, Jewel stayed coy on the subject of Costner. “He’s a great person,” the four-time Grammy nominee said, adding that “the public fascination is intense for sure.” In his chat with Stern, Costner said that some of his seven children had even begun to believe some of the discourse regarding their dad’s relationship with Jewel. “I have to explain to my kids, ‘No,’” he quipped. An Oscar winner for 1990s “Dances with Wolves,” Costner is currently promoting “ Horizon: An American Saga ,” which he also wrote and directed. The film hits theaters next week.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Shopping for that special dress is one of the most memorable experiences in the wedding planning process. It can also be incredibly overwhelming as you wade through endless styles, fabrics and opinions. “Wedding dress shopping entails a deeply emotional journey, especially for those experiencing it for the first time,” Anna Ramirez, head of design at Pronovias , told HuffPost. “The process serves as a learning curve for many brides, as initial perceptions of gown styles often evolve during fittings, revealing what truly complements their body and boosts their confidence. It is common for brides to discover a style they hadn’t anticipated as their own.” As the popularity of shows like “Say Yes to the Dress” have shown, there’s no shortage of opportunities for fun and drama in the world of bridal gowns. To help keep any stress at bay, we asked wedding dress experts to share some common mistakes they see people making as they shop for their special day. Read on for the biggest missteps to avoid and some advice for making the wedding dress shopping process as enjoyable as possible: “When you bring all of your friends and family to your appointment, you run the risk of being overwhelmed by too many opinions — even the well-intentioned ones,” said Nikki Deeds, global brand director at Allure Bridals . “Your mother-in-law may only like ballgowns, while your sister loves a vintage silhouette, and your mom insists on a traditional long sleeved lace gown like the one she wore in 1985. It’s hard enough to find the perfect dress, so why overcomplicate things with too many voices?” She recommended bringing only a couple of people who make you feel your most relaxed and beautiful on the main shopping journey and then inviting the larger group to a final fitting or other appointment after you’ve said “yes” to your dream dress. “Filter down your guest count to two people who are very close to you, that you have a very comfortable, loving relationship with,” echoed bridal designer Katherine Tash . “You need people cheering you on and wanting what’s best for you, not criticizing or bringing down the energy.” “Don’t wear bright colored underwear,” Tash advised. “It seems like it would be common sense to wear skin tone, but I consistently see brides forget and then become distracted by the color showing through and asking if the gown is see-through.” Wear a thong or seamless panty that blends in with your skin tone. Many brides opt for a well-fitting nude strapless bra or pasties, and some shop in shapewear as well. “The right undergarments can significantly impact how a dress looks and feels,” said designer and Studio Levana founder Evgenia Shimanov. “Consider these elements when trying on dresses to get a complete picture. Nowadays, there are plenty of options for bras, spanks and other supportive undergarments.” “You may think you know exactly what you want in a wedding look, but I can’t tell you how many people change their mind after they try on ‘the one,’” Deeds said. “I’ve seen many a chic minimalist melt at the sight of themselves in a lacy ballgown, so never say never! Try on a bit of everything and see how you feel before narrowing your search on to one particular aesthetic.” Look at your first appointment as an opportunity to experiment with different silhouettes, necklines, fabrics, embellishments, etc. Remember that clothes look very different on a hanger or even a mannequin than they do on your body. “Keep an open mind to unexpected choices that may surprise you,” Shimanov said. “Try on a variety of styles, including those you may not have initially considered.” “My number one tip is simple: Start with the budget,” Deeds said. “Don’t fall prey to trying on the gorgeous but expensive gown featured in the shop window. There is absolutely always going to be something you’ll love in your price range, but if you fall head over heels for an out of budget gown from the start, it’s really hard to come back from that.” Before you start putting on dresses, get real about your budget, taking into account the cost of accessories like the veil as well. “I know learning something is out of budget can be annoying and sometimes triggering, but it’s best to do some research and learn what designers or bridal salons are in budget and which ones aren’t before your appointment,” said Leah Langley-McClean, founder and CEO of elleNelle Bridal . “This can help save time for all parties involved and eliminate some disappointment. Most stores and designers will publish a price range of their dresses or the typical spend of their clients, and a safe strategy is to shop where you fall in the middle of that range.” “With the popularity of fast fashion, some brides make the mistake of shopping too close to their wedding date which limits the selection of designer dresses they can purchase and have altered before the wedding,” said Marissa Rubinetti, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Kleinfeld Bridal . “Brides should shop for their wedding dress nine to 12 months prior.” Shopping for a wedding dress too late in the process means limiting your options and also potentially having to pay big rush fees. “Keep in mind that veils and accessories also require time, especially if you’re considering customization options,” Shimanov said. Another reason it’s important to get an early start is to give yourself enough time for alterations. It usually takes a few fittings to ensure the dress fits perfectly to your body, and looks and feels the way you want. “Allow eight to 10 weeks before the wedding for the first alteration appointment,” Rubinetti said. Don’t forget about those all-important alterations as you calculate the timing and costs involved in your wedding dress shopping. “Always account for the cost of alterations when determining your wedding dress budget,” Langley-McClean said. “It’s rare that your dress will fit perfectly, even with a made-to-measure dress. Our bodies are all different and alterations allow you to perfectly contour the dress to the unique shape of your body,” pointing out that alterations can add $300 to $1,000 to the cost of the dress. She also advised getting in touch with an alterations specialist before shopping if you’re on a tight deadline and buying off the rack. “They may even be able to jump on the phone with you during your appointment,” Langley-McClean added. “You want something that can be easily altered. The last thing you want to do is find yourself buying a dress 10 sizes too big and thinking the alterations process will be simple. I’m here to tell you, it won’t be.” “I always think it helps to be prepared for any situation you’re entering into that can feel high pressure,” Tash said. “So do a little research on what your true style is, and research a store’s stock beforehand to understand which pieces from a designer the store carries.” Before going to shops, you can gather style inspiration and get a preliminary sense of your vision from Pinterest, bridal blogs, influencers and more. “Explore local flagship stores of preferred brands or nearby retailers listed on the brand’s website to try on specific gowns of interest,” Ramirez said. “Compile a list of preferred styles and brand names before your appointment. Sharing this information with the store in advance can help them better understand your preferences.” “Do not overshop!” Rubinetti said. “Trying on wedding dresses can be exhausting. You should not plan more than two appointments in one day.” She recommended shopping at a bridal salon with a range of styles you love to allow for some variety, at least at the beginning. Going from store to store and trying on gown after gown can get overwhelming and turn what should be a fun experience into a chore. “Furthermore, it’s advisable to refrain from exploring other gown options after making a purchase,” Ramirez said. “Continuously browsing can sow doubt and undermine the confidence in your chosen gown. Once you have found the dress that resonates with you, trust that decision and avoid second-guessing. Fashion trends may evolve, but the key is to remember the joy and certainty you felt when you said ‘yes’ to your dress.” Ultimately, you want to strike a balance and follow the process that feels right for you. Julie Sabatino , a wedding stylist and author of “Dressed, Styled, and Down the Aisle: Becoming a Stylish Bride,” recommended figuring out what type of decision-maker you are. Do you need to feel as though you’ve explored every option before deciding, or do you only need to see a sample to make a decision and feel good about it? “I’ve spoken with SO many brides that tell me they were pressured into purchasing a dress that they weren’t sure about and didn’t feel comfortable in on their wedding day, or worse, they bought another one right before the wedding,” Sabatino said. “Prioritize your opinion when making decisions about your gown,” Ramirez said. “While input from your entourage can be valuable, remember that this day is about your preferences and feeling your best in your chosen dress.” Listen to your gut when assessing whether or not you like a particular gown, not what other people say or what’s trendy at the moment. “I always tell my brides to follow their instincts and follow their own vision and not someone else’s,” said fashion designer and creative director Monique Lhuillier . “A bride that stays true to her personal style and feels happy and confident on her special day will glow from within!” “Brides come to appointments and sometimes they are their own worst critic ― focusing on all their flaws and being hyper-critical of their body,” Langley-McClean said. “When those not-so-nice intrusive thoughts creep in and you’re about to go on a self-deprecating bender, I want to encourage brides to immediately stop and think about what it is that you do like about yourself, and say that instead. Yes, we all have our insecurities, but we don’t need to be mean to ourselves about it.” The wedding dress experience understandably brings a lot of things people are self-conscious about to light, especially when it comes to the shape and size of their bodies. Ramirez emphasized keeping sizes and other numbers out of your mind as the consultant takes your measurements and places your order, especially because these gowns tend to run smaller than standard street size clothing. “Size is merely a number, and the aim is to procure a gown that fits the bride at her largest measurement, with subsequent alterations tailoring the gown to her specific body shape,” she explained. And don’t hesitate to talk to the consultant about any areas of sensitivity, whether it’s about physical insecurities or another issue that will affect the shopping experience. “Be honest with your sales associate and let them know if you have any concerns that they should know about,” advised bridal stylist Jackie Avrumson . “While this is your time to live out your bridal fantasy, some real world considerations will help you pick the best dress for your wedding,” said Daniel Sanchez, creative director at Azazie . He emphasized the importance of considering budget and season. These elements will also help you develop a clear wedding day vision. “A lot of details will impact your wedding dress decision ― location, venue terrain, time of day and overall theme,” Sanchez explained. “Shop once you have selected your venue and theme. While shopping on the fly seems fun, many brides later find themselves last minute shopping for another option more in line with their wedding planning.” The weather is particularly crucial, as choosing a dress without taking that into consideration can lead to physical discomfort. “A heavy, ornate gown might not suit a beach wedding, and a lightweight dress might be inappropriate for a winter ceremony,” Shimanov said. “Select a dress that not only looks stunning but also feels comfortable to wear throughout your wedding day. Comfort is essential for enjoying every moment without distraction. Ensure the dress allows you to move freely and makes you feel completely at ease.” “So many brides feel disappointed if they don’t find THE dress at the first visit,” Deeds said. “Try to prioritize the journey, not the destination — enjoy the champagne, and time with family and friends, even if it takes two or three trips to your local bridal shops.” Try to cherish the exciting moments throughout your wedding planning process. It’s meant to be happy, not stressful, so maintain some perspective. “Remember that dress shopping is such a fun part of getting married,” Tash said. “And the best is yet to come after you walk down the aisle.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer The first time I peed on my boyfriend’s living room floor, I was sure it spelled doom for our relationship. Why would he stay with someone who could do such a disgusting thing, especially when we’d only been together three months? I probably wouldn’t have. I’d come downstairs wearing only a towel to ask him something. I don’t remember my question or his answer, but I laughed so hard my bladder couldn’t keep up. I was mortified, even though it was an accident, like when I’d tried to make brownies and spilled cocoa powder all over his cloth storage containers. But the peeing felt like a personal failure. At 36, I didn’t want to be a woman who peed anywhere other than a toilet. He reassured me, though, helping me clean up. I was touched by his understanding. Little did I know this would be one of numerous instances over the next decade where my bodily functions got the best of me because of him. The year following the first peeing incident, after we’d started living together, while watching “Jeopardy!,” I called out “Einstein” with a trivia nerd’s satisfaction. When the answer was announced, he paused the TV, giving me a look previously reserved for my mixing up his beloved rock icons, Bowie and Springsteen. “It was Stalin. Stalin! How could you mistake Einstein for Stalin?” His absolute incredulity over having such an ignorant girlfriend sent me into hysterics. In seconds, I went from puffed up with nerdy joy to rushing across the living room carpet, hiking my dress along the way, trying to hold in my laughter and my urine. “Did you make it?” he yelled. My stream hitting the bowl was his answer. I’d saved the carpet, but not my panties, or my pride. OK , I thought, trying to calm myself. I peed myself again, but at least it mostly landed where it was supposed to. The next time, I wasn’t so lucky. Some corny joke of his landed me on our kitchen floor, scooting backward, as if physical distance could protect me. Once I reached the point of no control, I couldn’t stop. I knew my face was red and felt a puddle forming below me. He left the room so as not to keep egging me on. He didn’t need to be there, though, to exert his power over me. Every time I thought of whatever ridiculous nonsense had gotten me going, I was right back in the same, helpless place. I sat with my hands behind me, head in the air, and surrendered, tears joining the other liquid exiting my body. After 15 minutes, when it was finally over, my stomach muscles were sore from laughing. I vowed to be more prepared, to fight to hold it in no matter what. Over the next months and years, though, across four different homes, I learned this wasn’t a problem I could willpower my way through. He didn’t tell jokes like in the comedy clubs I used to frequent. Drew’s sense of humor felt as if it beamed directly from his brain into my bloodstream, where a chemical reaction took place that left me gasping for breath. I had no time to plan or prepare. No comedian had ever done that. Most of the things that set me off were lines that would never get a laugh from anyone else. Objectively, they weren’t funny, but in the moment, to me, they were. Sometimes they didn’t require any words at all. An example: I lost it when he dangled one of our mismatched knives over the garbage can. “Don’t throw it out!” I insisted, my hoarder’s hackles raised. He dropped the knife, grabbing it just as it hovered over the muck, then did it again. “Stop,” I demanded. But the more he repeated it, the more hilarious it became. The harder I laughed, the further he went. I unbuttoned my jeans, poised to head to the bathroom, to no avail. I rushed to take a shower. Another time, in the seconds it took for him to dial his mom’s phone number, I was convulsing with contagious laughter. When she answered with an innocuous “Hello?” she was met by our attempts at muffling our mirth. He hung up, while I ran right to the front door, instead of left, to the bathroom. I clung to it with my nails, feeling like I’d made it to some safe pee-free zone, as long as I didn’t shift an inch from my precarious position. “Why are you just standing there?” he asked, while all I could do was hover in place. I stayed until I could no longer hold it in, christening yet another area. Once, he merely dangled a baggie with a tiny sliver of pita bread, teeth marks visible along the edges. His face, a mix of shock and frustration, said it all: You left one bite? My bladder didn’t stand a chance. “Can’t you be less funny?” I asked when I returned, half-serious. “How can I? You find everything funny,” he insisted. After it had happened half a dozen times, Drew raised concerns. “You should talk to your doctor,” he said, setting off alarm bells in my head. What if I started peeing in public? I regularly flew cross-country and never used the bathroom on those flights, but my luck might not last. I dutifully called my GP. She diagnosed me online, not even requiring an in-person appointment. My incontinence was situational, meaning I wasn’t ready for Depends just yet. She prescribed Kegel exercises. I did them regularly, clenching and unclenching first thing in the morning and throughout the day. I hoped that when put to the test, those inner muscles would do their job and prevent me from another embarrassing episode. They didn’t. I took to preemptively peeing every hour or two, pressing down against my bladder to ensure there’d be nothing left if he caught me off guard. But even with that precaution, with him, my laughter won out. I’ve learned that urine incontinence is actually very common, affecting 50% of adult women, according to the Mayo Clinic Health System . But my problem was very specific to my relationship. When I laughed around other people, I was fine. But he continued to set me off. I had to accept the fact that dating Drew meant I had to risk being the woman knocking over her glass of water at a local pizzeria in a mad dash to the bathroom and keeping a towel on my seat on the couch. I’ve come to believe there are actually some upsides to my messy predicament. When he makes me laugh so hard I pee, he snaps me out of my constant looping fears. My laughter physically shakes me, from my bobbing head to jiggling belly on down. It feels like it’s rising up from somewhere deep in my soul; I’m one with the laughter, a gift he’s given me that I have no choice but to accept. When I tip over into being a laugh factory, there’s no room for stressful, obsessive thoughts — or any thoughts at all. My body has no guardrails up. Maybe it knew, that very first time, that he was someone it was OK to let go with, in every sense of the phrase. One recent afternoon, after an epic laugh-fest that had me changing my entire outfit, including my socks, I stood in front of the rumbling laundry machine and closed my eyes. I wasn’t proud of being no closer to solving my problem, of now being a woman in my late 40s who couldn’t contain her urine, but I was no longer embarrassed. That feeling had melted into not just resigned acceptance, but profound gratitude. Rather than Drew sharing his every thought with me like I do with him, making me laugh is his love language. When he pulls his T-shirt over his head and waddles like a penguin or sneaks “bag of dicks” onto our grocery list, I can’t help but crack up. He forces me to remember that I’m a body as well as a brain, and that sometimes, the latter needs to surrender to the former. When I laugh hard, it’s infectious; he often does too, even when he doesn’t know why. The times I don’t have to pee, I’ll nuzzle my face into his quivering neck, in a feedback loop that speaks volumes wordlessly. Losing ourselves in laughter fortifies us for times when there’s nothing to laugh about. Drew managed to pass a test I didn’t even know I’d needed him to: the pee test. Not once has he ever shamed me for peeing; he’s amused by it, and finally, so am I. Though I always hope it’s the last time, our history together tells me I’ll probably be pee-laughing for the rest of my life. I’d rather love someone who can make me lose control than someone who never tries to get that close. That he can tap so deeply into a side of me I don’t even fully understand means more to me than his sweetest endearments. It’s one thing to hear “I love you” each morning, and another to see it in action when your partner hands you a Clorox wipe to clean up a puddle of your own urine. I’ve stocked up and am ready for a lifetime of happy accidents. Rachel Kramer Bussel writes about sex, dating, books, culture and herself.

    "article_content": "General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jennifer Hudson said this week her father had 27 children ― and she isn’t even close to meeting all of them. Hudson, the talk show host and EGOT winner, discussed the importance of Sunday dinners with her son on the “ Your Mama’s Kitchen” podcast . Host Michele Norris eventually took a detour. “Your father had a big personality. And you went with your siblings and went and found him at some point and found that you had a lot more siblings.” Norris said. “Yes, a lot of us,” she said, laughing. “Apparently, he had 27 children,” Hudson added. “That’s a lot of children,” Norris said. “I’ve never met all of them,” the “Dreamgirls” star replied. “It was my dream to have all of us at this grand Thanksgiving or Christmas table, and we all sit and eat together — that was my goal at 16,” she said. Hudson, who grew up with siblings Jason and Julia, met six or seven others and discovered she was “the youngest of all of them.” Hudson said her father’s side of the family initiated a get-together. “When my grandma on his side passed, my siblings over there were like, ‘Y’all got a sister that can really sing. You should meet her,’” she said. “And eventually, we all came together.” The “American Idol” alum said she wants to ensure her son David, 14, “has his cousins circle.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer On lockdown in the Andes without Grindr, I cooked, wrote and slept too much. Several mornings a week, double-masked, I was allowed to leave my mud-brick cottage to go to the market for eggs and purple potatoes. And I began FaceTiming with Tony. A self-described gay virgin, he was a butch dreamboat who conducted endangered species surveys for a living. Several months earlier, we matched on Tinder while I was visiting friends in my hometown in Florida. When we met for coffee on New Year’s Eve, he reminded me of the surfers I drooled over in high school. But he was almost five years older, a mix of red panda and Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine, with the salt-and-pepper bearing of a ship’s captain you make excuses to go see on the bridge. In the noisy coffee shop, he told me he grew up in a staunchly evangelical household, so conservative he wasn’t allowed to watch “The Golden Girls.” He was terrified his loving parents would disown him if they found out he wasn’t straight. After being married to a woman for 10 years, they divorced without children. “I thought we were soulmates,” he said. “Then one day I came home, and I was served divorce papers.” He was shattered. In time, he stopped using alcohol to cope, came to terms with his complicated sexuality, and eventually, at age 42, came out to his best friend. “You’re bodacious,” I murmured, feeling his bravery. Not having grown up in the church, I came out when I was 15 and eventually had to cut ties with my family. I did whatever it took to not feel the ache of my loneliness. As I sipped my dirty chai and listened, I felt weirdly safe. Was it because I was leaving the country the next day for a semester-long research sabbatical? Was it because I didn’t live in Florida any longer and he did? In any case, Tony and I weren’t frantically typing messages to faceless torsos at 3 a.m. We were connecting in person, as humans, sitting across the street from my old middle school that had gone condo. “Can I kiss you?” I asked before he dropped me off at my car. “Uh, yes,” he said, fluttering his eyes, “yes, you can!” It was his first kiss from a man. As for me, it was my... 300,000th? I had been too distracted by casual flings to settle down. Yet for a moment, our kiss felt like my first one too. After our date, he texted me exuberantly. Sometimes it took me a week to respond. I kept thinking, Ugh, I mean, he lives in Florida, and if he likes me so much, what’s the matter with him? I worried he was breadcrumbing me along only to ghost me when someone closer and less weird materialized. At the same time, I was attracted to him. On Valentine’s Day, I sent him a shirtless selfie from a Peruvian bathroom, and he replied with his own. Instead of sending eggplant and peach emojis, I called him to say hello. He wasn’t playing games, I realized after our soulful conversation. Like me, he was slowly learning he was capable of committed love with another man. Speaking with him from South America where I was writing a book about psychedelics, I kept my past largely to myself. Though I told him in general terms how all-consuming and soul-numbing Grindr had been for me, he didn’t want details. Dad jokes were told. Trust blossomed. We were like two boys at summer camp effortlessly becoming best friends. When the supposedly last emergency flight to the U.S. popped up in late April 2020, I took it. As I pulled into Tony’s driveway in Florida for our second date, he knocked his knees together, dancing like a turkey. Laughing, swooning, I got out of the car, smelling the salt air. We smoked a joint. Collapsing into his bed from exhaustion, I spent the night. The next day he built a bookshelf for all the books I had unboxed. He gave me a house key. Apparently, I was moving in. He had asked that we take it slow, but we didn’t know what that meant. Nights we got physical, he couldn’t fall asleep. When he told me not to be so handsy and asked if we could sleep in separate bedrooms, I began packing up my things to leave. “If you don’t want me, why am I here?” I asked. “Repeat after me,” he said, “it’s been six days since Tony had his first sexual experience with a man.” And I did, cracking a smile. “I don’t want you to leave. But I have lived alone for 10 years since the divorce, so I need room to breathe. We’re winging all of this, and we knew it’d be risky.” Two weeks later, we were sharing the same bed again, but I knew not to spoon him like a baby lemur. We shopped for patio pillows at T.J. Maxx, and I unboxed my things again. Around the same time, we went to a nearby island where years before he had been a park ranger. We walked the beach full of dead oaks until we came to a makeshift shelter made of driftwood. I sat down while Tony, like an osprey fortifying his nest for his mate, patched it up with more wood. Soon, a boat beached itself nearby, spitting out sunburned, dad-bod dudes and their girlfriends onto the sand, their Confederate flag waving. “Let’s get going,” Tony said. “People think we’re brothers anyhow,” I said, gathering our things. “We’re fine.” Walking back to the car, he was far ahead of me, as if he were on the beach by himself, a “straight” ranger once again. We drove home in silence, on the edge of another argument. Part of him wanted me to leave, but much more of him knew I needed to stay. Living together during the pandemic before vaccines was 24/7 DIY couples therapy: We took turns playing shrink and freaking out. As Tony puts it, we were like two feral raccoons thrown into the same cage — bonding with one another brought up anguish we’d spent decades trying to self-medicate. Pain, we learned, does subside, but you need to feel it first. You can practice feeling safe even when you’re scared. Sometimes as I wept, he’d rock me like a baby, and I did the same for him. He’s been my personal trainer, leading me in difficult workouts I would never ever, ever do on my own, and I’ve been his gay sherpa and meditation coach. Much healthier now, I’m not on the couch for weekends at a time on Grindr — or ever, for that matter. Our old associations with home — fear, distrust, shameful secrets — were changing. They were giving way to coziness, mutual respect and honesty. As Tony worked through the trauma of being closeted for 42 years, just holding him could fill him with panic. Like so many men, he associated same-sex tenderness with ostracism and damnation. But he was determined to deprogram himself. As if we were Kermit and Miss Piggy, he’d drive us around town on our moped as I held onto him, getting waves and funny faces along the way. In our living room, I led a mushroom ceremony for him, leading to a breakthrough in mutual trust: He heard his deceased mother say my name and tell him that she was happy for us, that she could be my mom too. We were never the same. “You ever hear you look like a cross between a mop bucket and a moose?” I would ask to lighten the mood. “Well, goopy goop blart-tootle!” he’d reply like a tipsy preschooler. “Come here and give me a hug.” After a year of Zoom teaching, I was required to come back to my university in Virginia. Tony, a lifelong Floridian, moved back with me to the Shenandoah Valley, leaving behind everything familiar so we could be together. Two years later, a lesbian interfaith minister named Barb married us in our succulent-filled sunroom. “You are everything I have always wanted,” he told me between sobs during the ceremony, “even when I didn’t know what that was. You are my hero, my savior, my forever boo boo, and the love of my life. You brighten every day of my life in ways I never thought possible. My dark clouds have been lifted.” “I see the sacrifices you’ve made for us to be together,” I said, trying to hold it together. “I hope our souls are intertwined forever. I promise to stay faithful to you. That I vow to you. I also promise not to fart under the covers. Tony, I love you galaxies and galaxies.” But long before the tungsten wedding rings from Amazon were slipped on our fingers, it felt like we were married. We had already created a family, the one I needed but never had. When were we wed in spirit? I think it was when I brought him to a waterfall in the mountains near West Virginia. We had the water to ourselves. The crayfish and old maples. The light shimmering across the sandstone boulders. After we horsed around in the natural pool, he sat still on a flat rock. “I listen to my breath,” he said, “and hear the tides,” remembering his mom shutting her eyes in the nursing home and, for minutes at a time, being utterly at peace. What he wouldn’t give to eat one last Miracle Whip and bacon sandwich with her. In just my undies, I stepped onto the ledge underneath the waterfall. The water breaking over me was cold. Relentless. The water had integrity and was utterly free. Throwing my hands up, I hooted and hollered like Oprah had given me a car, then Tony did the same, soon taking my place under the water. We weren’t calling hogs. We were declaring ourselves worthy of love, grateful that, messy as it is, people can change and love can heal. For an hour in the forest, my husband and I forgot the unfairness of the world. We washed ourselves clean.

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost As the temperature rises, some men swear the heat has a flattering effect on their peens, adding inches in length and girth down below. Last July, Mel Magazine reporter Tracy Moore gave a name to this peculiar seasonal phenomenon: summer penis. “Summer penis is a temporary dick fluctuation that, thanks to the heat and warmth, gives you a months-long leg-up on shaft size,” she wrote , citing anecdotes from various men. “It’d be like if a woman’s boobs suddenly got huge from May to August.” In a world of growers and showers , consider it nature’s way of bringing some equality to packages everywhere. “In the summer, my dick tends to be consistently larger when I look in the mirror, and my biggest measurements have been taken in the summer,” Richard, a 30-year-old who lives in the northeast U.S., told HuffPost. (He, like others quoted in this story, asked to be identified only by his first name to protect his privacy.) “My fingers and hands swell up a bit in warmer temps, as evidenced by my struggle with taking off my wedding ring in the warmer months,” he said. “It’s logical to assume the same thing would happen to my junk.” Brian Ayers, a sex coach and author of “How to Be A Better Lover In 3 Days or Less,” said he’s also experienced summer penis. He chalks it up to seasonal lifestyle changes. “You’re outside more in the summer. Hiking, swimming or going for longer jogs in the summer gets the blood pumping,” he said. “Sitting inside for eight hours in front of a computer in the winter with no sunlight and fewer fruit or vegetable options available will leave any guy hanging smaller.” Sounds great in theory. But is this all just a pipe dream ― pun very much intended ― or are these dudes on to something? Aaron Spitz , a urologist and author of “The Penis Book: A Doctor’s Complete Guide to the Penis,” initially scoffed at the idea. “My first reaction was, ‘Oh, boy, here we go again with obsession over size,’” he told us. However, Spitz did admit there could be some truth to the phenomenon. “It makes sense to me because of the underlying mechanism of how a man’s penis can expand and contract in size,” he said. “The size of the penis can increase and decrease as a result of the relaxation or contraction of the many tiny blood vessels that comprise the inside of the shaft of the penis.” Warmth, he said, “increases relaxation of these blood vessels, which increases the blood flow through them, filling out the penis more and giving it a longer, fuller appearance.” (In short, more heat = better blood flow.) “If this is true, think of what the penises of 2050 will be like after the climate crisis/global warming. It’d be a peen-pocalypse.” If you’re a summer penis skeptic, you’re not alone. Women we spoke to were also more wary of the phenomenon (though we’ll cede the floor to people of any gender who have penises). “I highly doubt a part of the body would change that significantly due to the season,” said Ashley, a 27-year-old from Washington, D.C. “If this is true, think of what the penises of 2050 will be like after the climate crisis/global warming. It’d be a peen-pocalypse.” My favorite penis season is ‘Fall Penis’ season because that’s when the penises pull out their cute little penis peacoats with their little knit penis caps and play Bon Iver on repeat. As fascinating as this subject may be, there’s no definitive scientific evidence one way or another on summer penis, said Paul Turek , a urologist who runs the Turek Clinic in San Francisco. While there could be some truth to the idea that penises appear bigger in the heat, there isn’t enough research on the subject for doctors to say whether it’s absolutely, completely real. Your testicles absolutely do hang a little lower when it’s hot, though. “We know that the scrotal sac is exquisitely temperature-sensitive and drops way down when hot and creeps way up when cold,” Turek said. Shrinkage is definitely real, too, he noted. “With colder temperatures, there is less skin showing, less desire, less sweating and more hibernative fat,” Turek explained. “This could lead to contracted skin rather than puffy skin, more penile shrouding from a tight scrotum, and more fat and the appearance of shrinkage.” Whatever the season, if you you want to look larger, consider shaving or waxing: Removing excess hair around your penis will accentuate your package, said Fiona Hilario, the founder of Lay Bare Waxing Salon in Los Angeles. “One of the benefits of being hair-free down there is that getting rid of all that hair really does make you look bigger,” she said. “Plus, you’ll smell fresher and that’s a big bonus for you and your partner.” Can’t argue with that.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Having people over your house , whether it’s for a casual get-together or a fancy dinner party, can be stress-inducing — especially if you have anxious or perfectionist tendencies. Perhaps you’re someone who obsesses over every detail of your home needing to be pristine. Maybe you find it hard to enjoy hosting because you’re preoccupied with what guests will think of your space. But there’s no sense wasting time and energy agonizing over stuff that isn’t going to be very meaningful — or even noticeable — to your guests. That’s why we asked experts in all things homes and hosting to tell us what guests actually notice right away about your house — and what they’re probably not really paying attention to at all. Here’s what we learned: The smell of your home greets guests right as they walk in, said cleaning expert Becky Rapinchuk, the woman behind Clean Mama. And you want that first sensory impression to be a good one. “We don’t always recognize the smell of our own homes so it’s important to open a window, turn on a diffuser or burn a candle if there’s a smell to cover up,” she told HuffPost. “If your house has a pet smell, change litter boxes, wash pet bedding, and do a quick vacuum.” Good lighting helps create a welcoming ambiance in your home — and your guests will take note, said Los Angeles interior designer Megan Hersch, founder of Studio MG Interiors . “This can be as easy as adding a few more table lamps around your spaces or increasing the wattage in some bulbs,” Hersch, who is also the founder of the e-design firm roomLift , told HuffPost. “But a dimly lit home is a turn-off. We all want to see each other and feel comfortable moving in and around the spaces in your home, so light it up.” “So many times we let the fear of not living up to a certain standard stop us from gathering.” The right lighting can turn an ordinary space “into a magical setting,” Las Vegas event planner Brooke Primm , the creator behind The Uncommon Hostess , told HuffPost. “Instead of relying solely on overhead lights, try incorporating different light sources if your gathering is during the evening,” she said. “If you are hosting during the day, make sure to draw all window coverings for a bright and inviting vibe.” When entertaining, guests will notice at a glance how tidy or untidy your space is. Straightening up common areas and keeping surfaces like your coffee table and kitchen counters free of clutter can help create a more relaxing atmosphere. “We all know this and even I have a hard time sticking to this mantra, but a clear space is a clear head and that is something your guests will also feel,” Hersch said. “Make space to put away what you need to and of course, only keep what brings you joy!” You don’t need to work yourself into a frenzy deep-cleaning every nook and cranny of your home before having people over. But a basic cleaning of the kitchen and bathroom will make a good impression. “If you know that your guests will be in the kitchen, take a couple minutes to wipe down counters and clean the fronts of appliances,” Rapinchuk said. ” In the bathroom, wipe down counters, put out fresh towels and clean the toilet.” A post shared by Micah and Sarah Wallace (@micahandsarahhh) Incorporating some greenery into your home decor adds a vibrant pop of color and texture to the space that guests will appreciate. Plus, houseplants have mood-boosting properties , which will help cultivate some good energy for your gathering. “Each room [in my home] has an abundance of plants, and guests will always make comments on them!” Donovan Ho , founder of the West Coast home and lifestyle blog Hothouse Jungle , told HuffPost . “Whether compliments on the beauty of the plants, or stating that they can’t keep plants alive — they’re always a conversation starter.” If you have a traditional entryway in your home, Los Angeles interior designer Brooke Spreckman, owner of Design Hutch , recommends “going to town on most finishes and fixtures in this space,” she said. Because it’s the first room guests notice upon walking in, it’s an opportunity to do something eye-catching. “The floor can be an accent, your lighting can be more creative, the wall finishes can stand out. Artwork can be oversized — or just unique in general,” said Spreckman. Ho said he always receives compliments from guests on different pieces of furniture in his home, “whether it’s a funky chair or cool velvet sofa.” “Guests also usually notice the array and mix of traditional and modern decor pieces throughout the house,” he added. According to Hersch, bare walls can be a bit of a downer. Adding some art and framed photos can do wonders for a space. “Walking into a home that feels like someone hasn’t finished moving in feels less than welcoming,” she said. “It’s worth spending some time and budget on hanging art. There are great collections, pre-made gallery walls in fact, on Etsy and even Pottery Barn. Don’t be afraid to get a larger piece too!” Music sets the tone for your gathering, so choose something that helps create the vibe you’re going for. “You can create a playlist that matches the theme of your party or choose songs that are relaxing and soothing,” Primm said. “I personally love playing the ‘Bridgerton’ soundtracks since they’re familiar songs but not too distracting.” Temperature is one element some hosts forget about, but is quite important to your guests’ experience. “Making sure the temperature in your home is comfortable is key,” Primm said. On the flip side, there are things that hosts may fixate on, but actually aren’t all that important to guests. Here’s what’s not making much of an impression, according to our experts. Small Decor Details Several of our experts agree that little decorative elements tend to be overlooked by guests. “No one is going to notice if a vase isn’t meticulously placed or if a pillow is fluffed perfectly,” Primm said. “The little things we may obsess over in our homes are the things your guests may not even take a second look at.” When hosting, it’s a good idea to minimize the number of small decor pieces on any tabletops and counter spaces, “as those surfaces are likely to be used by your guests,” Spreckman said. “To avoid them feeling cluttered, don’t worry about having a ton of decor set up,” she continued. “If you usually have your surfaces styled in a way, but they’re not perfect for hosting, less is more in these cases.” How Thoroughly You Cleaned In terms of cleaning up before guests arrive, do what you can but try not to stress about it too much. “While I always tidy up — sometimes a deeper clean and sometimes just a quick tidy — guests never comment on how clean the house is,” Ho said. “I learned to not overly dwell or be paranoid on how clean and presentable the house is.” And if your book shelves are a little dusty, chances are guests won’t notice. “Don’t have time to dust? Dim the lights and no one will know,” Rapinchuk said. Bedrooms Your guests likely won’t be spending time in the bedrooms, so don’t sweat it if your clothes chair is piled high or your bedspread is looking a little crumpled. “Close the doors if they aren’t guest-ready,” Rapinchuk advised. Fancy Silverware And Dishes It’s not worth splurging on expensive plates or silverware for your dinner guests, Hersch said. Why blow your budget on something they won’t care about? “There are so many fun place settings. Tiffany is by no means required to have a fun and lively dinner party,” Hersch said. “With the right atmosphere in your home, Target can be more than fabulous!” Dining Chairs Guests probably aren’t going to notice your dining chairs unless, of course, “they’re insanely uncomfortable,” Spreckman said. “Guests usually spend their time sitting in a dining chair rather than looking at them,” she continued. “So if you have spent all your money on every other furniture item when re-doing your house, and are tapped for splurging on dining chairs, just buy something neutral, simple and affordable in the meantime. Because that is the least-looked-at item when hosting.” And a final thought: It’s easy to get caught up in thinking things need to be perfect when you’re hosting, Primm said, when that’s just not so. “So many times we let the fear of not living up to a certain standard stop us from gathering,” she said. “But when it comes down to it most people just want to create memories, feel connection and to be brought together in a meaningful way. Make sure to focus on connecting with the people in your home, the rest will follow.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "1. “It was actually almost immediately after getting married. Our relationship had taken a nose dive as soon as we moved in together. But after we got married, while we were in Greece on our honeymoon, he absolutely lost his mind on me in public. I wanted to go see a beach on the island that was supposed to be one of the most beautiful in the world, so we tried to catch the bus, but it never came. He screamed at me, telling me he hated traveling with me, and I ruined his vacation. Then we walked to the beach nearby, and he went swimming with his two friends, who he insisted come with us on the trip. I was too stunned and humiliated to do anything except sit on a beach chair and cry.” — u/gridironbuffalo 2. “I knew on the wedding day. She spent a fortune on unnecessary things, and I knew I’d be the one footing the bill on the credit card she ran up. So I told her no more. She said she wanted an ice cream vendor there (we already had two dessert bars), but I told her it was unnecessary. She fought me on it but finally agreed. Wedding day comes, I’m standing with my groomsmen, and in comes the ice cream truck. I knew right then, sadly.” — u/StrangeJitsu 3. “After 18 hours of labor and nearly dying while giving birth, he went out to the strip club with his brothers to celebrate becoming a father. I still stayed, and then other things piled up, so I filed for divorce.” — u/Kitchen_Mix_3665 4. “I think the first time I actually thought to myself, ‘This isn’t going to last,’ was when I brought him the positive pregnancy test for the baby we had been trying to conceive, and he paused his video game to say, ‘Good, now you can stay off my dick.’ After that, it was a series of small paper cuts that bled out our marriage, with the finishing blow being him telling me during an argument (that started by me wanting to discuss the state of our marriage) that he loved going to work more than being home with the kids and me because when he was at work, ‘People treat me with respect. Like a superhero!’ I married the boy I started dating at 16, and I divorced the insecure police officer he’d become at 30.” — u/ThrowawayJane86 5. “It was a Wednesday night after a terrible day at work. I cooked supper and did the dishes while he sat on his phone. I was trying to bathe two kids, and AGAIN, he had shaved in the tub and left all the whiskers stuck to the sides. I was in tears, rinsing them out, and exasperatedly asked him if he could clean up after himself. He said to me, ‘If you don’t like it, you can go somewhere else.’” — u/MyBlueHighway 6. “At the wedding reception, when he decided to bring out all the food before my family and I got there, and everyone already at the reception ate all of the food. My dad had to go get us burgers. I still gaslit myself into staying for the next 10 years anyway.” — u/RelentlessOlive54 7. “When he left me with a bad fever to play cards with his friends. When he accused me of cheating on him while I was pulling all-nighters to finish my degree. When he said our kid wasn’t HIS. When he never complimented me because he said it would get to my head. When he took anyone’s word over mine (and I mean anyone). When his way of flirting with me was putting me down. When I had to keep the most ridiculous secrets just to keep peace in the house. When the counselor I confided in told me he was jealous of my accomplishments instead of being proud of me. Good riddance!” – u/ozraf 8. “When he ran off to play golf after we came home from the hospital with our son. A few days later, he went again while I had to drive myself to the hospital with the baby. It turned out I had severe mastitis and a 103-degree fever, and he just took off.” — u/stinkykitty71 9. “We were in the bathroom getting showered and dressed for a friend’s wedding. I was in the best shape of my life then, feeling good about myself, and I thought I looked good in my suit. She was finishing her makeup, and I remarked on how beautiful she looked. I waited for her to say something nice in return, but she didn’t. And it just hit me. I couldn’t remember a single time when she complimented me on my appearance. So I said to her, ‘You ‘now, I always tell you how beautiful you are and how attracted to you I am, but I never recall you saying that I look good or that I look handsome.’” “She stopped applying her mascara long enough to roll her eyes at me dismissively. So I mistakenly asked her, ‘Do you even find me attractive?’ She flatly said, ‘No.’ I asked, ‘Why did you marry me then?’ and she said, ‘I didn’t think it was important at the time.’ I’ve never felt so ugly and unloved. And it hurt even more when I felt so good about myself for once in my life 30 seconds earlier.” — u/Seandouglasmcardle 10. “I realized I married the wrong person when he yelled at me that I only cared about money during an argument. This was after he quit a job on the spot with no backup plans and without consulting me yet again. This upset me because I only wanted a partner willing to share the load and work with me towards our future. I should have known better. I planned and paid for the wedding myself, and I kept us financially stable for nearly a decade as he was fired from, and quit, job after job, all while I worked at the same company, in a job I hated, for the stability. I tried so many times to talk to him about finding a job he could stick with or build on and cutting unnecessary costs so we could save to buy a house and start a family.” “After those talks, he’d say he was on board and ready to put forth the effort, but ultimately, after that argument (and so many years of nothing changing), I realized he was never going to grow up, and I’d be caring for a man-child for the rest of our marriage. I’m happily divorced from him now.” — u/UnsureAboutHumans 11. “When he didn’t mention me in his speech at our wedding. He thanked everyone else, commented on the bridesmaids, and talked about our daughters. I may as well not have even been there. On the first night of our honeymoon, I got horrendously sick, and he left me alone in our room to go watch something on the big screen on the beach. So much for in sickness and in health!” — u/LBelle0101 12. “Right after saying, ‘I do,’ we were taking photos with all our friends. I heard him tell his best man how beautiful one of our guests was. It may have been a small thing, but I felt it in my gut that we would not last. I tried my best for five years amid his violent alcoholism and gaslighting. We had a baby, and he never once got up to help.” — u/xbbn1985 13. “I was eight months pregnant. He’d lost his job a few months prior and had spent all his time gaming since. I said in frustrated despair, ‘Why can’t you get a job?’ and he said, ‘Why don’t you get a job?’ I had to leave work early because of pregnancy complications.” — u/Azazael 14. “I come from a low-income family. She doesn’t. Her family gave us $10k for our wedding, and she spent it on a motorcycle. I was struggling to pay my bills each month. She then bought a house closer to a job I was actively trying to leave despite my months of pleading for her not to. She did it anyway. After six months of living in the house I didn’t want, I told her I was done. She told all my friends and family it was because I was cheating on her. I lost many friends, but I’ve never been happier. She can keep them.” — u/Dont_Shred_On_Me 15. “I was exhausted from taking care of our newborn by myself and told him I couldn’t do it alone anymore. Instead of offering to pitch in and help, he suggested we put the baby up for adoption.” — u/angiebenz 16. “When I almost died because he refused to take me to the hospital despite my begging. I had become so isolated at that point, and I also knew better than to call an ambulance. But it didn’t hit until I was in the hospital, right after the doctor let me know if I waited even two days longer, my respiratory system was close to shutting down. All he could say was, ‘But you don’t even NEED to be here. I do! My stomach hurts so bad.’ It took a month or so longer to end the relationship. But I realized then that he never loved me. He never cared. And I was just lucky to have made it out alive. The only reason I made it to the hospital was because my parents had found out about my state, and THEY took me. I hadn’t spoken to them for weeks/months before then.” “He immediately told everyone that he wanted to take me, but I refused and that he was scared. Then, when it was the two of us, he would scream about how I was so dramatic and lazy. I am glad to have left him behind.” — u/jagkfrost15 17. “The nail in the coffin was when I drove myself to the hospital for my hysterectomy because it was too early for him to get up. This might have been at the 13-year mark.” — u/PenelopeGarcia65 18. “Before we even got married, I was trying to record our daughter’s first steps, and after multiple attempts of videoing, I was still getting him yelling expletives in the background of every video because he was angry at his computer game. I asked him to stop swearing for a minute so I could get a video of our child’s first steps, and he told me to shut up. He didn’t even look over to watch her walking for the first time. That’s when I knew.” — u/fknnutter 19. “There was a chance that I might have been pregnant, but our roof was leaking, and I still had to climb up to patch it. He refused. He was too afraid. It was at that moment I knew I would always have to be the strong one. I don’t mind having to be the strong one; I just didn’t want to live my life always having to do so. I wanted to be able to break and crumble when I felt the need to.” — u/kalisita 20. “We were married for 11 years. He planned his business trips exactly on my birthdays to avoid being with me. He always worked during our anniversaries, too. He never made any effort in our relationship. When asked, he says he’s not the romantic type or the one who puts in effort. But it hurts so bad when I see him put so much effort into making others happy.” — u/MapHistorical7368 21. “A week after we were married, we had a minor disagreement. He told me, ‘You know who you married, and you know this is how I want it.’ I realized then that if this was how he thought, he expected me to set aside my wants and wishes forever. I should have seen the red flags before I said yes, but they turned bright red with flashing lights right there and then.” — u/irislatifolia 22. “While we both had full-time jobs, he never once helped with the cooking, housework, or yard chores. All of that fell on me. And it’s not like his job was more stressful; it was quite leisurely most of the time. Whenever I brought it up, he would always protest that he needed a certain amount of free time daily to feel relaxed. I once asked him to bathe the dogs since we were expecting company. He threw the biggest fit until I finally backed down and said I’d do it myself. I’m so thankful that I’m now married to a man who willingly helps with the domestic duties without being asked.” — u/RubySoledad 23. “When I left the religious cult that we were both part of/we got married in. That was when I realized the religion had masked major incompatibilities, which I just couldn’t see until leaving the cult. By this time, we already had a kid together. If I had figured out the cult was BS just a few months earlier, I would not have a kid, and it would be so much easier to split.” — u/crystalmerchant 24. “When he said that taking care of my grandfather towards the end of my grandfather’s life ‘ruined me.’ I was depressed because my grandfather was my best friend, and he died, so I was in a bad place. Instead of supporting me, he basically told me I was broken and not worth the emotional support that I needed to deal with such an important loss in my life. That was the straw that broke the camel’s back. The divorce cost me a bit, but in the end, it was worth it not to be with a man who would not offer support during a bad time.” — u/dk573 25. “When about two years into marriage (eight years together), she started telling me about all the people she wished she’d been with. Then she started talking to a friend at work and told him she loved him. When I confronted her about it, she said it was like her love for her family, friends, etc. There were many signs before that, but I just ignored them because I wanted us to work.” — u/animusv 26. And: “We got married and went on a honeymoon in China. We were both PhD students at the time. I was from the working class, and her family was middle class. Her father gave her $10k for the honeymoon. So we went to China to celebrate, AND she wanted to do some light pre-dissertation research while there for a month or two. Fine. Well, I spent the entire two months alone in tiny hostels while she did research. I only spoke a few words of Mandarin, and I was a broke graduate student, so I couldn’t afford to get to an airport to fly back home easily. I also had no family support back home, even if I did manage to make it home. I felt trapped. I talked to her about how the trip felt like a research trip, not like a honeymoon, and how I was alone almost every day.” “We were sharing a laptop while on the trip (I was too poor to own a laptop, despite being in grad school). I opened the laptop one morning before she left to survey a field site without me. Her email was open. She left a message up on the laptop screen. It was to her father, stating she wished I wasn’t there on the trip — our honeymoon. Again, I was told this would be a honeymoon with maybe a slight detour for research. It turned out to be a research trip where I was a burden. She apologized. We stayed together for a few more years after she got sick and I became a caretaker. I wish, in hindsight, I had left China after reading that email.” — u/Mtt76812 Note: Submissions have been edited for length and/or clarity.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer “I hope you’re taking care of yourself.” That’s the line that’s been coming at me for years now –– across my texts, LinkedIn DMs and voicemails, across dinner tables and Slack messages, and haven’t-seen-you-in-forever emails. I know people mean well. I can feel their complicated mix of sympathy, pity and thank-God-it’s-not-me relief. But the words roll off tongues with an ease and frequency usually reserved for basic, mindless tasks –– not the truly daunting business of righting yourself after being pummeled by one (or more) of adult life’s most stressful experiences. According to The Holmes-Rahe Stress Inventory , I’ve been through a whole host of those experiences –– some of them a few times over. My father and maternal grandmother both died of cancer the same year, I’ve moved more than a dozen times since graduating from college, and I’ve lost three jobs. In the past year alone, I’ve gotten laid off; had my 3-year-old son diagnosed with a rare, difficult-to-control epilepsy; and tested positive for COVID on my birthday. My friends have dubbed me “a warrior,” “a real-life superhero,” and “the queen of coping.” And while I don’t know if those are fully-earned monikers in a country where almost 38 million people are living below the poverty line , I’ve admittedly asked myself: Is this a normal amount of stuff to deal with? But at the end of the day, I know I’m not special. At the very least, we’re all being subjected to the truly head-banging soundtrack of everything that’s going wrong in this world, including deep-rooted racism, misogyny, gun violence, natural disasters, political turmoil, the aftershocks of a global pandemic, and more. And these chronic stressors –– in addition to isolated events –– are heavy contributors to any given person’s cumulative stress level. But we keep on keeping on, right? After being repeatedly Whack-a-Mole-d by a few of life’s most stressful events, I continued making plans where I could. I started my own business, and I scheduled an elective plastic surgery I’d been considering for a long time. I was excited about the expected results after staring at a postpartum body I barely recognized for three-plus years. So, on Jan. 17, 2023, at 5:30 a.m., I arrived at the hospital for my surgery. The night before, I half-jokingly said to my mom and my husband, Pearse: “If anything happens to me, I love you!” “You’ll be fine!” They both replied in rapid succession. “I know, I know,” I said. “I’m just saying it.” They put me in bay number 13 for the surgery prep. I wondered aloud to Pearse over the phone if that was bad luck. We quickly chuckled about it and then it was time for me to go to the induction room. The anesthesia team gave me some medication to calm my nerves, wheeled me into the operating room, and put me to sleep. About 10 minutes later, everything went sideways. My medical team couldn’t get a pulse on me –– femoral, radial, carotid –– nothing. They started CPR. After a few minutes, they were able to resuscitate me, and I was emergently transferred to the cardiac catheterization lab. When I regained consciousness later that day, I tried to take stock of my surroundings and my body. I was still out of it from the anesthesia, but I knew this wasn’t the way I had expected to wake up –– with a breathing tube down my throat and a still-undetermined amount of lines coming out of my neck, arms and hands. I eventually learned I was in the cardiac intensive care unit, where I stayed for the rest of the week recovering from being brought back to life, undergoing invasive cardiac testing, and hosting a revolving door of medical professionals. “Are you under any significant stress?” One of the cardiologists asked me during rounds the next morning. I stared at him blankly. I thought about all the days when even four anti-epileptic drugs couldn’t stop our son from having close to 1,000 seizures. I thought about all the nights I’d spent picking up and putting down our resurrected baby monitor, in a constant panic that every breath, every shift, every groan from his room was a seizure. I thought about his medical ketogenic diet that requires us to painstakingly weigh every morsel of food to the tenth of a gram. I thought about holding him on his side time after time as he convulsed, staring at the stopwatch on my phone, silently begging some unknown higher being to make it stop. I thought about losing my job six months ago in the never-ending river of tech layoffs meandering through the workforce. I had vowed to myself I wouldn’t lose my professional edge through parenting, the pandemic, and getting cut from yet another full-time gig. Was that happening now that I’m self-employed and only working part-time? And do I even care anymore? I thought about my dad –– a former pediatric anesthesiologist –– and how I wished he was there to tell me everything’s going to be OK. I thought about how grief has a cruel way of forever siphoning off just a little bit of the joy that comes with every celebration-worthy event, every achievement. And I thought about how ironic it was that I’d coded on the operating table after getting anesthesia –– my dad’s exact work. Ultimately, my heart function eventually returned to normal and my medical team ruled out every cardiac condition except one: stress cardiomyopathy, also known as “ broken heart syndrome .” It’s a complex condition in which the heart muscle is quickly, but temporarily, weakened, often as a result of intense emotional or physical stress. According to my cardiologist, Dr. Anna C. O’Kelly, a fellow in cardiovascular medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, my case, like many stress cardiomyopathy cases, isn’t clear cut –– and was likely multifactorial. “It is hard to know which came first,” said Dr. O’Kelly. “Did you develop stress cardiomyopathy from all the many life stressors you have... which placed you ‘at risk’ for the cardiac arrest? Or did your body interact poorly with the anesthesia leading to your cardiac arrest, which then caused a stress cardiomyopathy?” The role stress played in my situation is a mystery I’m still very much grappling with. And a frustrating mystery at that, because while I probably had above-average stress in my life, I wasn’t just letting it go unchecked. I’ve been seeing a therapist regularly since my dad died, I’ve test driven many stress management techniques over the years, and I’m hyper-aware of what I’m doing (or not doing) on a daily basis to fortify my mental health and well-being. I now take an hour-long walk every day, I just finished a 12-week cardiac rehabilitation program, I joined a gym, I’m on a beta-blocker, and I’ve finally let myself spend a few nights away from home to sleep without staring at the baby monitor all night. But fitting all that in on top of day-to-day life –– figuring out how to “take care of yourself” today –– sure feels like a bonafide burden. Like that to-do list item you can never cross off. An extra responsibility that comes at you day after day with the cliché laundry list of yoga and just-10-minutes-of-meditation and daily exercise and weekly therapy and time with family and time with friends and time to yourself and time for the hobbies that help you feel like a person. And if I –– an upper-middle class, straight, white homeowner, with a master’s degree, community support, a stable of resources, and an incredible amount of privilege –– can’t take care of myself in America today enough to avoid stress-induced heart failure, then how can anyone? So, where do I go from here? Where do any of us go from here? After all, when it comes to stress, I’m certainly not alone. According to the American Psychological Association, 27% of Americans report they are so stressed they can’t function. “That’s huge,” Dr. Lynn Bufka, associate chief for practice transformation at the American Psychological Association, and a licensed psychologist in the state of Maryland, told me. Dr. Bufka also says this type of collective, debilitating stress produces a ripple effect that seeps into just about every crevice of society. “It’s not about one person being so stressed they can’t function,” she said. “It means workplaces aren’t functioning as well, students aren’t learning as well.” This type of widespread underperformance as a result of our stress only adds to our stress level, creating a vicious cycle that’s very hard to break. Plus, chronic stress –– the kind that comes from things like having your basic human rights stripped away based solely on your gender identity or sexual orientation, or caring for someone with a disability –– can impact almost every system in the body. And those resulting physical health issues (hello, broken heart syndrome) are, you guessed it, stressful. “There is definitely a link –– which we are increasingly appreciating –– between our psychological and cardiovascular health,” said Dr. O’Kelly. “The exact mechanism is not entirely clear, though it is likely bidirectional. For example, depression is a risk [factor] for heart disease, but you can imagine ways in which heart disease is also a risk factor for depression if you aren’t able to be as active, or have shortness of breath, or frequent hospital admissions.” Nevertheless, many of us who have the means and wherewithal, try and try again to tunnel our way through the stress wall, doing our yoga and just-10-minutes-of-meditation and daily exercise and weekly therapy and time with family and time with friends and time to ourselves and time for the hobbies that help us feel like people. But this isn’t something an açaí bowl or putting down your phone during dinner can fix. We need a lifeline. Because in the face of no federal bereavement policy, 12 weeks of unpaid family leave, average annual child care costs coming in north of $10,000 , average bachelor’s degree loan debt clocking in at $28,400 , a health care system that will bankrupt most people at the first sign of a significant health complication, and much more, another thing is becoming abundantly clear: Even those of us with a roof over our head and food on our table are out here falling through a safety net that was already tattered and torn at best. Dr. Bufka acknowledges that constructing an adequate safety net –– in addition to pursuing the activities and boundaries that keep our individual stress levels in check –– is crucial in helping Americans manage their stress levels. To be sure, that’s a daunting challenge all around. Just to lay a strong nationwide foundation, we’re talking universal access to annual mental health check-ups, improved distribution of stress management resources in communities across the country, every workplace and school being equipped to take on mental health challenges, and fixing complex systemic issues –– like racism, sexism and food instability –– that contribute to chronic stress. Of course, there are many dedicated professionals already working to make progress in these areas. But when 76% of people nationwide have stress-induced health problems, doesn’t it seem like our leaders’ urgent duty to help us move the needle? Shouldn’t their main responsibility be to hold fast to the ideal of having a country full of people who are in a position to achieve contentment? Can we really say we’re the home of the American dream –– the land of equal opportunity for success –– if we don’t address the stress elephant in the room? The simple fact is that a bunch of us are out here not functioning or literally coding on operating tables, because no matter how hard we try to chip away at our individual stressors, our country isn’t meeting us halfway. I’ll happily relinquish the “queen of coping” crown and the “real-life superhero” cape in exchange for more systems and policies that take a little pressure off everyone. After all, I’m just one member of an army of stressed out soldiers who I can only imagine are waving their white flags, ready to openly admit that a few weekly down dogs and sun salutations will never fully combat the stress that comes from living paycheck to paycheck, worrying your child is going to catch the next bullet, or grappling with medical trauma. We’re all warriors. We’re all resilient. We can move through hard things. We can withstand the blows life deals us. We just need a little help stopping the bleeding along the way.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer Last year, I was supposed to travel to New York City to see a Broadway musical with Ryan, the man I had been dating for the past month. This is the same man that I dated exclusively for six months beginning in April 2021. It would be a whirlwind trip. A romantic excursion. Only none of it was real. Ryan and I had broken up in November 202 because I felt that he simply didn’t have time for me. He’d cancel or change days and times of our meetings and he could never meet on the weekends due to his summer vacations, parenting schedule and work conflicts. I wanted to date someone who had ― and made ― space for me. So, I let him go. But not really. Not enough. During the time we were broken up, I dated a few men, but I never felt a true connection with anyone. I wasn’t intimate with anyone. In the back of my mind, I kept thinking, They aren’t Ryan , and it was Ryan I wanted to find my way back to. I can’t explain the draw, except to say that the connection I felt with him was the connection people talk about when they meet their person: You just know. You just feel it. I felt it. After yet another disastrous date, I texted Ryan. “I’m sitting in the parking lot of this restaurant where I’m supposed to meet this man but he just canceled … and I don’t want to be in this parking lot meeting him,” I wrote. “I don’t want to meet any man. The only man I want to meet is YOU. And it’s stupid, really, that we aren’t dating anymore. Isn’t it?” He texted back and suggested we meet for coffee. He said he’d been dating other women, of course, but hadn’t met anyone he connected with. He said, like me, he’d just been kind of going through the motions. He said he was up for trying again. We started texting every day. I had been working with my life coach to believe that I am worthy of good things ― that I can have the things I want. She encouraged me to ask for what I need, so in a burst of enthusiasm, I asked him if he wanted to go with me to Palm Springs. I was shocked when he said he would but he needed a few days to work it out. After three days, he said he realized he couldn’t go to Palm Springs. Flights were too expensive, and he was locked into spending the weekend with his boss and a group of 60-year-old men. Instead, he told me that “The Music Man” was playing in New York and asked if I would go with him. I was so happy I almost started crying. In my previous marriage, I had often asked my ex to take a last-minute trip with me, but he was always too tired or said it would take too much effort. To do something wildly romantic with Ryan was amazing. The universe would give me good things! I was worthy! I only had to ask. Ryan booked the theater tickets and I paid him for mine via Venmo. I booked the flight and the hotel. I’d cover those. He didn’t have a lot of extra money and I was happy to do it. We talked about the trip. I felt myself falling for him again, but in a new way. A way where I felt supported and cared for. A healthy way. And then... I got a message on Facebook from a woman saying she wanted to know who I was. She claimed her boyfriend, Ryan, had just broken up with her. She said she saw on Venmo that I had given him money for tickets, and she looked me up. “What were the tickets for?” she asked. She said they’d been together for two years and she wanted me to tell her what was happening. I went to her Facebook page and immediately felt sick. “I discovered that everything he told me during our previous six months together had been a lie. All of those times he had work trips or fishing weekends with his buddies or obligations with his kids, he was actually with his girlfriend.” As I scrolled through her photos, the double life that Ryan had been living came into clear view. When he said he was out of town with his boss, he was with his girlfriend in Nashville. And that wasn’t the only time. I discovered that everything he told me during our previous six months together had been a lie. All of those times he had work trips or fishing weekends with his buddies or obligations with his kids, he was actually with his girlfriend in Chicago for the jazz festival, kayaking up by the Pictured Rocks with her, or they’d been celebrating New Year’s together. Once he sent me pictures from a basketball game and complained it was hard to be a third wheel with his buddies and their wives. Now I was looking at a photo of him with his arm around this woman from that same day. Not only had Ryan created intricate lies about why he couldn’t be with me, he texted me during those trips and events saying he couldn’t wait to see me. He told me how nice it was to stay connected. He said he couldn’t wait to be intimate with me. Perhaps worst of all was that he frequently used his kids as an excuse for why we couldn’t get together. I called him and demanded to know what was going on. He confessed that during the time he originally dated me (and told me he was dating only me), he was dating six other women. Since we reconnected, he’d been dating two women other than me and his girlfriend of two years. I couldn’t believe it. He also refused to pay me back for the ticket to New York, so I lost that $600. But more than that, I lost the relationship I thought I had. What Ryan did was more than hurtful. It’s more than just not telling the truth. He crushed my spirit, my trust, and my belief in love. But I won’t let him crush my sense of self-worth. I’m was 48 years old and back in the dating world after two marriages and 15 years of being someone’s partner. I didn’t want to do online dating, but what are my other options? There’s no shame in wanting companionship, but at times it feels shameful. I wanted to be loved so badly that I let myself get hurt. I invited this into my life. Of course, though, I didn’t. I believe that online dating has created a new way for deceit and manipulation to thrive. It offers people an easy opportunity to find and prey on those who are open-hearted and trusting. These exploiters are always on the lookout for the next target and the next thrill, and the next one is only a swipe away. The ability to instantly create a new persona and however many lies to go with it lets people be whomever they want to be and do whatever they want to do. You never know if the person you’re meeting ― or falling in love with ― is who they say they are, and it’s terrifying. I made the mistake of justifying the red flags I saw early on by saying, “Ryan can’t spend time with me because he’s so busy with work and his kids.” I tried so hard to be understanding and kind to him that I missed what was right in front of me. I’m embarrassed. I’m humiliated. I’m heartbroken. But if my story helps even one other person take a closer look at their relationship ― gets them to investigate those red flags ― then it’s worth sharing my hurt publicly. And though I’m even more wary of online dating than I was before, I haven’t given up. How else do you meet someone these days — especially in a world that’s been in lockdown for two years? But now I am better-equipped to see the danger signs. I ask a lot more questions. I do internet searches on prospective dates. I’m less trusting and more cautious. It’s not how I want it to be. It’s certainly not romantic. But it’s reality, and I refuse to let Ryan and what he did rob me of the chance of finding love. He’s taken enough already ― he doesn’t get that too. So, I’m moving forward. I’m doing it a little less open-hearted, and, maybe, a little less forgivingly, and that makes me sad. This isn’t the person I wanted to be, but it’s a different world than it was 15 years ago when I was last looking for love, and this is who I am ― at least for now. Ryan will move forward too. He’ll continue dating. Maybe he’ll take someone with him to New York. He’ll probably continue hurting people, until, maybe, enough women stand up to him and call him out on his behavior. Maybe I’m the first to call him on it. I hope I’m not the last. Note: Names and some identifying details have been changed to protect the privacy of individuals mentioned.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer I t’s 6 a.m. and I can’t feel my feet anymore after being on them for so long. I pull down the bottom of my shorts in the taxi as I head home, covering my thigh harness that’s now visible. The sun is slowly waking up the city; people are jogging on the streets and I’m exhausted, but my heart is as full as it can be. Almost without exception, this is how I feel after each shift monitoring a play party or dungeon. It’s the same feeling I have after working a mixology shift: satisfaction from knowing my hard work has created something special. I’m physically exhausted, yet filled up on love and connection from strangers, people I’ve worked with, and, in the queer and kink scene, people who often feel like a chosen family. I’m a journalist by trade, but by night (or during increasingly popular daytime parties) I’ll turn my attention to the queer, kinky, and non-monogamous communities I’m a part of. At their events, I take on the role of a professional dungeon monitor. The various spaces I work in opt for different titles, with the crowds, themes, rules and focuses of each event differing too. I might be referred to as a dungeon monitor, DM, welfare monitor, armband wearer, vixen, or something else entirely. The history or where the role came from is unclear, with queer, kink, and sex-positive spaces stemming from underground routes, but with the increased normalization of these spaces, a need to keep guests safe has become a focus. Being a monitor at parties where play and bondage, dominance, sadism and masochism (or BDSM) take place involves supervising the play space or dungeon to ensure physical safety for those attending and participating. The role always varies: From being stationed in a dedicated playroom all night to roaming the venue or working in a wellness room (a chill-out space where people can catch their breath and be surrounded by calmness if they’re overstimulated), you adapt to the needs of attendees. I’ve always been drawn to connection, in all its beautiful forms, and a sex playroom is just one of the spaces where I see this beauty. The flinch of a body when a flogger makes contact. The intense gripping of furniture from someone being pegged. The wholesome giggles from a group who have met that night and are now entangled in an orgy. The cuddle puddle in the corner, filled with hugs and hair strokes. It’s our ability to be so free from shame, and connect in enthusiastic, consensual ways, that makes me feel nourished. I want to help safeguard and protect all of that. Some parties revolve around music and dance floors, with a “dark room” available for play if people want to explore that, while others prioritize BDSM and play — every event is unique. Over the years, clubs have begun tailoring their events to different niche interests: nights for pet play, femme domme worship, and rock music fans specifically, for example, are all regular occurrences. Most days of the week there’s something going on, whether that’s a full play party, a talk on consent, a kinky clothes swap market, or a day picnic to socialize with other like-minded people. My shifts usually start in a similar way. I first establish the code of conduct and particular rules that are in place (which those entering the space agree to). While these often vary, a handful of staple rules are usually enforced, such as: No lurking or disrupting scenes, and of course, guests must always be aware of others and respectful of receiving a “no.” I bundle into a green room with any other monitors and performers at the beginning of the night, where we get changed, grab some snacks, and catch up with people who’ve become familiar teammates, while welcoming any new additions. There’s something I find particularly sweet and heartwarming about this role and giving back to a community that’s created safe spaces for people to express themselves without fear of judgment. Then, my tasks include making sure the furniture is in working order with enough space for people to engage in play around it, checking there are enough safe sex products available, providing sanitizing wipes for people to clean the space they’ve been in, and ensuring the entire room is visible to monitors, leaving no corners that can’t be supervised. Monitors do not engage in play while working and are typically very experienced in being around such activities — it doesn’t feel like anything out of the ordinary to us. I started working as a monitor for London-based parties fresh out of COVID lockdown. I signed up to work a queer-focused kink party where I went through training. I learned what to look out for, how to handle difficult situations, first-aid basics, and ways to be a support for anyone who might need it. This could mean finding a quieter area for someone who is feeling overstimulated, or making sure someone’s play scene isn’t being disturbed by someone else entering it without consent. A lot of the support provided stems from communication and learning to be compassionate, informative and clear. I’ll keep a lookout for anything that seems untoward and, if needed, get support from members of a security or medical team. I learned about bystander intervention (recognizing potentially harmful situations and responding in a way that de-escalates what’s happening and inspires a solution) and effective, clear communication ― tools that have since become a part of how I operate in the world on a day-to-day basis, even outside of play spaces. I choose spaces to work where attendees are quite knowledgeable about consent and how to operate in the space in a positive way, so consent violations don’t arise much for me, but having people there who are trained to handle someone who might be disruptive or abusive is an element of extra safety. Of course, not all clubs and events are the same, and it’s taken me time to figure out which parties I like working. I’ve monitored events that have felt exhausting and draining, where people don’t know or adhere to the rules. My advice would be if you’re thinking about visiting a kink or play space, go to ones where all guests must read and agree to the house rules before attending. There are larger-scale events that can be a little “touristy,” but the ones I’ve really found my home in are the more queer-centered, smaller venues — places that focus on different niches and creative ways of expression. I started exploring kink and non-monogamous communities about eight years ago and, as I didn’t know anyone on the scene, I’d turn to Google to find parties and pub meet-ups in my area. It was a big, beautiful world, but it wasn’t until I started finding my feet (and my people) that I really found my place. Without a doubt, it’s the verbal connections and sense of looking out for one another at these events that brings me true joy. While events have monitors in place for safeguarding purposes, there’s an overall sense of self-governance and self-regulation. People are given the autonomy and agency to conduct themselves in a way that’s within their limits without being harmful to other people sharing the space. It’s like a little insight into how society could work with self-expression, consent and care. Honestly, these events could teach us all something about our lives and how we operate in this world.

Read on for 20 relatable ones that will have you laughing in agreement. *me almost finished with a chore* Husband: Here, let me do that. Folding my wife’s clothes made me realize that they didn’t teach us all of the shapes when we were in school Me: [on deathbed] Wife: It's probably just allergies. Living on a prayer. But it's me every time I get into my wife's car trying to make it to a gas station before I run out of gas. Brb. I just found out my husband has never seen an episode of The Price is Right and I'm questioning everything. Woke up, rolled over in bed, and my wife goes, “Good morning! Would you like to see a turtle having fun?” Marriage is taking your wife out for dinner while driving around until you both keep asking each other “Where do want to eat?” until you slowly swerve into oncoming traffic. One thing I really love about Greek-Americans is not only do they fucking LOVE being Greek, they want everyone to be Greek, there’s no gatekeeping. When I married my husband they treated me like I had acquired inherent Greekness from him. Hubs: you’re losing it!

Before marrying there should be a compatibility test with questions such as: “Do you believe that little pocket in the car door is for garbage yes or no?” I hate it when my wife reminds me of plans that I’d swear she never told me about in the first place. My husband obviously loves my style, anytime I say “How do I look?” He doesn’t even have to look at me, he just replies “Gorgeous.” Husband: Hey, are you listening to me?

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life As a parent, every age and stage of your kids’ lives comes with its unique set of ups and downs. But no stage is dreaded the way the teenage years seem to be — at least based on the pervasive stereotypes out there. But as it turns out, raising a teenager can actually be a pretty awesome experience. There are challenges to be sure (e.g., dealing with the moodiness, the power struggles, the messy habits, the smartphone battles) as there are with every age. But many parents find that the positives outweigh the negatives for them. “I was really afraid of the teen years, but it’s been my favorite stage so far,” reader Gwen S. wrote on Facebook . Below, members of the HuffPost Facebook community share some of the reasons parenting a teenager is actually much more fun and rewarding than many people realize. These often-overlooked joys will help you relish parts of the teenage stage if you’re in it — or they’ll give you something to look forward to down the line. “I recently dropped my son and his friends off for a day of mountain bike riding. It hit me suddenly that I was really excited for them because they were heading out by themselves for the day. It was not the first time they’d done it, but the first time I realized how great their independence and their enthusiasm was.” — Sally K. “Sleeping better, watching what I want on TV, being able to go out and do things because my daughter can stay home alone.” — Danielle J. “Cooking! Whether it be feeding himself when I don’t have time or energy, trying a new recipe he sees on TikTok or wanting to make something ‘gourmet.’ Watching him explore, be creative and even teach me some new tricks is definitely a new experience.” — Jocelyn R. “When I get to send him to the grocery store with a list? WINNING!” — Tiffany G. “I love the personality and sarcasm my teen has developed. She is so witty and funny and dark — I simply enjoy being around her.” — Lisa N. “Whenever my daughter cracks a joke that makes me authentically laugh, it’s a pretty surreal feeling.” — Alicia O. “I love talking politics with my son and learning the views of him and his friends and how they differ. It’s great to see him educating himself on the world and social justice.” — Niri K. “Philosophical discussions about current day generational differences, pronouns, gender, equality, etc. Hearing the perspectives of a new generation and asking questions without public shame.” — Ruth H. “My husband died five years ago so this is especially joyful for me.” — Tiffany B. “When you see your teen taking on responsibilities or being kind and thoughtful. A glimpse of the good human they are becoming.” — Helen W. “I love, love, love that my kids tell me things they are thinking, or worrying about or excited about. It can be hard not to react or lecture — but it pays off in the end to just listen to how their minds are working it out. I feel so much more fulfilled as a parent during these teen/young adult years than I did when they were babies.” — Alison M. “My son still likes to hop in bed with me on Saturday mornings, talk about whatever is on his mind and show me some cool things he found or learned about. I have learned so much from him and found ways to stay connected with him, even as he gets older and starts branching out. I’m grateful for those moments.” — Ebonie H. “I love listening to the music my daughter is into, going to concerts with her and hearing her thoughts about the songs and artists she enjoys.” — Stephanie C. . “Blaring music that I grew up on with my son on the way to school. They were the same songs I would listen to with my mom when she would take me to school. I now feel the joy my mom felt in those little moments.” — Andre U. “Having someone to do all the wonderfully fun geeky things with! Renaissance Fair! Comic-Con! Cosplay!” — Molly D. “They introduce you to things in popular culture that you may not otherwise know about. It broadens your horizons and gives you new things to bond over and have in common. My girls introduced me to Taylor Swift, Twenty One Pilots, “Hamilton,” John Mulaney and Iliza Schlesinger for starters. We eventually went to see all of them live and have wonderful memories of each.” — Tanya M. “I love watching them interact with their siblings in a more grown-up way with less conflict and competition and more support for each other.” — Alison M. “My son is 19, and one of the best things that has happened was when we were driving home from his summer job as a music camp counselor, and he told me how the way I raised him and treated him taught him how to communicate and connect with his students. It was an incredible feeling, realizing that all I’ve poured into him, he is now able to pour into someone else.” — Gwen S. “Seeing the switch flip from ‘I have to do this’ to ‘I get to do this.’ The appreciation for the experience is something mine are just coming into. Whether it’s sports, or school stuff, trips, etc. The maturing mindset of, ‘This is an opportunity and not a chore’ is great.” — Michelle W. “Reliving my teenage years in experiencing dating, falling in love and heartbreak through their stories and experiences.” — Melissa D.

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost An estimated 6.5 million people in the United States have endometriosis , a painful condition in which the uterine lining spreads and grows outside of the uterus. The first step for treatment of painful periods associated with the disease, according to gynecologists? Hormonal birth control . That’s what Bella, a 21-year-old New Yorker, has taken since age 13 to treat the often-debilitating symptoms of endometriosis: painful, heavy periods; gastrointestinal issues; and intense fatigue. “I know that sounds very young to be on birth control, but I have been experiencing these symptoms since my first menstrual cycle at age 12,” said Bella, who, like others in this story, asked to be identified only by her first name to protect her medical privacy. “Birth control changed my life,” she told HuffPost. “Before the pill, my period was so heavy and so painful I was missing school, sports, extracurriculars ― even just hanging out with friends was impossible.” “I would never be able to live independently, attend college, work a job or have meaningful relationships without it,” she said. “It alleviates my symptoms and makes it possible for me to function.” “Reproductive health care encompasses so much more than just preventing pregnancy.” Given how indebted she feels to the pill, she was disheartened earlier this week when Senate Republicans blocked the Right to Contraception Act, legislation that would enshrine a federal right to access contraception. “I may take it mostly for my endometriosis, but women are also 100% justified in taking it to prevent pregnancy,” she said. “It shouldn’t matter why someone is taking it, and it’s no politician’s business.” “If right-wing politicians are sick of abortions, it’d be stupid to ban access to birth control or the morning-after pill, like Plan B,” Bella said. “They’re so hypocritical.” Democrats brought the bill to the floor out of fear that reproductive rights will be further threatened after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the national right to an abortion two years ago. Just last month, former President Donald Trump said that he’d be “looking at” restricting contraception access should he win back the presidency in November, though he later backtracked. On Wednesday, the vote on the Right to Contraception Act was 51-39, falling short of the 60 votes needed to defeat a filibuster and move the bill forward. Republicans argued that access to contraception is already protected by the U.S. Supreme Court ― but Democrats scoffed at the idea , noting that access to abortion was protected by the high court, too, before Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. Prior to that, plenty of Republicans lawmakers gave the same assurances about abortion rights, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) argued. And within that 2022 ruling, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that the court should reconsider several other rights, with access to contraception among them. What’s often missing from the conversation on contraceptives is how many people like Bella take hormonal birth control for non-contraceptive reasons. Countless women and gender-fluid, nonbinary and transgender people want contraceptive care to be codified, too, just like those who depend on it primarily to prevent pregnancy. A 2011 study from the Guttmacher Institute found that 14% of women who used a hormonal birth control pill ― or 1.5 million women ― took the medication exclusively for non-contraceptive reasons. And 58% of birth control pill users took the pill “at least in part” for purposes other than contraception. Among teens, that percentage was higher: About one-third of respondents (33%) ages 15 to 19 who took a birth control pill did so for reasons other than preventing pregnancy, according to the study. That was the case for Katie Ann, a 36-year-old from North Carolina, who started taking the pill at 16. “When I’m off the pill, I get debilitating cramps,” she told HuffPost. “I passed out in a Macy’s when I was 16, and that’s when my mom decided to take me to the doctor.” Once, Katie Ann went off birth control for a year and a half. In that time, she had to take eight sick days at work. “I’d wake up at 4 a.m. doubled over in pain and by 6 a.m. could still barely get off the floor,” she said. “When I say birth control changed my life, I truly mean it.” Dr. Allison K. Rodgers , an OB-GYN and reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist at Fertility Centers of Illinois, said it’s often difficult periods like that which bring people to her office to discuss taking birth control. As mentioned before, for the symptoms of fibroids and endometriosis, hormonal birth control is the go-to treatment since there can be significant risk to surgical options, Rodgers said. “Heavy periods can also cause anemia , and the treatment is hormones to lighten the cycles to prevent anemia,” she said. That’s what happened to Elise, a 33-year-old from Texas who started taking birth control at 16, long before she was ready for sex, she said. “I knew I had a problem when one day I passed out while going for a walk in a public park,” Elise said. “Bystanders assumed I was on drugs and ignored me. It was totally unsafe.” “I was scared to go on birth control because, as a woman of faith, I had heard awful things about women that use contraception, but my period symptom left me lightheaded all the time.” Ultimately, being able to use birth control as a hormonal therapy meant reducing the amount of pain Elise experienced and reducing the amount of blood she was losing every month. “Birth control dramatically improved my health, safety and quality of life. It fixed my anemia, so now I have more energy,” she said. “I’m married now and might start a family some day, but for now I’ve been prescribed two types of hormonal birth control.” Elise said she knows a lot of people ― men and women alike ― who have no idea that hormonal birth control is used in such a way: “It’s isolating and scary when others shame birth control users just because they don’t know what the medication can really do for women’s health.” Years ago, Cheryl, a 54-year-old from New Jersey, was put on birth control after being diagnosed with bilateral endometrial ovarian cysts. She stayed on it for eight years. “I had two treatment options: Have surgery, which would have been invasive, expensive, terrifying, and would have kept me out of work for two weeks, or pop a pill every morning,” she said. “I didn’t want to risk the cysts growing larger or worse, having an ovary torsion, so birth control was a no-brainer,” she added. Rodgers, the OB-GYN, said birth control is also prescribed to people with polycystic ovary syndrome, who are at risk of developing uterine cancer if not treated with hormones. “Birth control actually reduces risks of ovarian cancer , and for many patients who are at high risk, this can be a very important long-term treatment,” she said. People undergoing fertility treatment are prescribed birth control, too, Rodgers said. It’s used to control cycles before in vitro fertilization or frozen embryo transfer cycles and to keep the uterine lining thin in preparation for a hysteroscopy, an exam of the inside of the cervix and uterus. “Reproductive health care encompasses so much more than just preventing pregnancy,” Rodgers said. For intense period pain, one alternative is an anti-inflammatory medication, such as ibuprofen, that can be purchased over-the-counter but isn’t generally as effective as hormonal birth control, said Dr. Karen Tang , a gynecologist and the author of “It’s Not Hysteria: Everything You Need to Know About Your Reproductive Health (But Were Never Told).” If someone is experiencing severe pain that is not controlled by birth control, Tang suggests discussing further evaluation and different treatment options with their doctor. Tang said she’s unnerved when lawmakers weigh in on contraceptive and abortion care. “I always say, imagine if lawmakers were deciding on someone’s right to access chemotherapy, diabetes or blood pressure medication, surgery for hip replacement,” she said. “Or imagine if senators who were Jehovah’s Witnesses could impose their beliefs about blood transfusions on all Americans and say that they were illegal and subject to criminal penalties if a doctor were to give someone a blood transfusion,” Tang said. That’s how many doctors and other medical professionals see arguments about abortion, birth control and gender-affirming care, Tang said. “It’s debate by politicians who have no medical expertise making essentially medical decisions on behalf of people without understanding the ramifications,” she said.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life About a year ago, Isabel Steckel texted her 30-year-old older brother about hanging out the following afternoon. She received a one-word reply: “Sure.” “If you’re bringing ‘sure’ attitude, then let’s not do it,” Steckel countered. “And he said, ‘lol,’ and I said, ‘I’m not kidding, lol.’” This May, the New York City-based comedian shared a screenshot of this conversation on X, formerly Twitter, and received more than 11,000 likes. The “sure” haters rose up to share how answering “sure” sounds passive and dispiriting. A “sure” texter apologized in a reply for the violence he had “inflicted while trying to appear easy and breezy.” This is only the latest entry in a perennial and continuously divisive debate over what “sure” really means. One Reddit user in the subreddit for “unpopular opinions” declared that the word “sure” is “synonymous with ‘yes’ and shouldn’t be associated with sarcasm and attitude,” while a commentator for the Outline wrote in 2018 that the word is “the most passive-aggressive affirmative phrase” that is “a thumbs up to your face, and a jerkoff motion behind your back.” Clearly, we are not sure about what “sure” should mean. Although the dictionary meaning of “sure” is affirmation and certainty, its meaning can be anything but certain but in a text conversation. Steckel said the word’s meaning is context dependent. She noted that replying “sure” for an errand or task is fine, but it sounds more devastating to hear when you are inviting someone to spend time with you. “Asking someone to hang out for me is like a very vulnerable move. So when I’m getting that ‘sure,’ I’m like, ‘Alright, fuck it. I’m not doing it,’” she said. Steckel said a “sure” reply sounds like the other person would rather “die than hang out” and “forcing someone to hang out with you is the worst feeling in the world.” The problem with “sure” is that it sounds more tentative and less enthusiastic than an outright “yes!” or “absolutely,” especially when you do not have body language or vocal cues to reassure you. “Sure is sort of indecisive, or has kind of a hesitant quality to it. Like, ‘Do want to go to the movies?’ ‘Sure.’ Do you really want to go?” explained Georgetown University sociolinguist Cynthia Gordon . Gordon said the different meanings of “sure” might also be generational. “The younger generation expects more enthusiasm in texting in general than older folks do,” she said. She also noted that “women tend to expect more of those explicit markers of enthusiasm.” In a text, the length of a message can also take on outsized importance in the absence of in-person cues. Similar to why a one-word “OK” or “k” reply sounds so alarming and curt to receive, shorter answers imply lesser effort. Meanwhile, Gordon said that the effort to write a full sentence or to write some extra exclamation points suggests, “Yeah, I really am enthusiastic about this.” It’s why a one-word “sure” stirs doubt, but “sure thing” ― my own standard reply ― can sound slightly more genuine, if you are truly down to follow through on a request. One helpful tip if you do get a bland “sure” is to take a step back and remember that it’s not automatically a sign of disinterest. Gordon said every person thinks their own way of communication is the natural way and “we all need to be more generous in our interpretations.” Gordon cited the “Key & Peele” sketch between comedians Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele as a classic example of this. In the video , “there’s a whole miscommunication just because one person misinterprets the other’s kind of short, casual messages as being like, ‘I don’t care, I don’t care.’ But that’s not what’s going on,” Gordon explained. In the sketch, it’s not until the anxious friend character sees his smiling buddy’s face at the bar that he realizes that his friend actually wanted to hang out with him. It’s a reminder that in-person intonation can provide more valuable information about the state of your relationship than just a one-word “sure” text. But until you meet up in-person, it does not hurt to give your conversation partner a little more reassurance. “I would be less happy if I invited someone somewhere and they said, ‘Sure.’ I think I’d want more enthusiasm for some social kind of engagement,” Gordon said. “If you’re making the effort to connect with somebody, and kind of put it out there that you do something together and the other person says, ‘sure,’ it wouldn’t meet my expectations for suggesting it was going to be a good time.“ Padding your “sure” with a cheerful exclamation or even an extra word or two can make it clearer that you are truly agreeable to what the other person is saying. “I do think a ‘sure’ with an exclamation point is worlds different than just a normal ‘sure,’” Steckel said. All to say: You can be “sure,” or you can be “sure!” Do you want to possibly send your friend or family member into an anxious spiral or do you want to spend one additional second adding that bubbly exclamation point or extra word?

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost There’s a lot of mystery surrounding sex in your 60s, 70s and beyond. Look online and you’ll find countless threads where curious younger people ask if older people are having sex at all, and if they are having it, what it’s like . “What does it feel like?” others wonder. (Good, we imagine? It’s still sex!) The mystery surrounding sex in older age stems from a combination of factors, according to Shannon Chavez , a licensed psychologist and sex therapist in Beverly Hills, California. First, societal taboos and ageist attitudes have led to a marginalization of older adults’ sexuality. No one wants to imagine people their grandparents’ or parents’ age having sex, so we cast out those thoughts. What we get as a result are limited discussions and representations of sex in later life; think of how few scenes we see of older people getting it on in movies and TV, and how often post-50 sex and Viagra are the butt of the joke for late-night comedians. We’re all going to get older eventually (hopefully, anyway) but because we’ve stigmatized post-50 sex so much, we’re ill-prepared for the realities of it, Chavez said. “There’s a lack of comprehensive sex education tailored to older age groups, leaving many individuals uninformed about the changes and challenges they may face regarding sexuality as they age,” she told HuffPost. “This all leads to misconceptions and curiosity about what sexual experiences are like in later life,” she said. “Overall, increased awareness, education, and open dialogue about sex and aging can help eliminate the mystery and promote healthier attitudes toward sexuality in older age groups.” The heartening reality is that those who are AARP-aged are still having, enjoying and desiring sex, even when they’re not coupled up. Four out of 10 people ages 65-80 are still sexually active, according to a 2018 study from the National Poll on Healthy Aging . And whether or not they have an active sex life, nearly two-thirds of older adults said they’re interested in sex. More than half said sex is important to their quality of life, according to the same study. To shed some light on post-70 sex, we asked sex therapists and people over 70 to share some things people should know about sex in the golden years. See what they had to say below. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length. “I can only speak for my wife and I, but I think one of the biggest things not talked about is the drive for sex and physical enjoyment ― to be desired, to be wanted, to have that feeling of giving and receiving the physical, as well as emotional release ― never goes away. When we’re young, we don’t want to believe that old, saggy humans still want sex. But we do. Physical attraction and satisfaction, communication and personal hygiene are still important, even in our 70s. “There are certain things that have to be worked out, of course: erectile dysfunction , extreme dryness , pain and limited positions . But it’s great to be alive at a time when science has solved some of these issues with easy solutions. Drugs and creams for both women and men, as well as physical exercises and therapies, make it possible to enjoy sex at this late stage. I understand that there are many people at this age who have debilitating diseases or physical limitations that make it very difficult or even undesirable to have sex. And I certainly respect that. But there are also many older people, older than us even, who still want and have sex. “I think the biggest problem is the stigma of being old, with gray hair or bald, saggy breasts and butts, means that there’s no longer a need for sex. When we were in our 50s, we thought that if we were alive in our 70s, we’d be done. To our pleasant surprise, it’s just the opposite.” ― Frank, 76, who lives in the Texas panhandle and has been married for almost 53 years “I think the most surprising thing about sex after 70 for many folks is that it has the potential to be better than ever. Many of my clients in their 70s (and 80s!) report that while the frequency of sex generally declines with age, the quality improves. Sometimes this is related to so-called sexual dysfunction which leads them to discover new pathways to pleasure. For example, if penetration is painful or uncomfortable, they often learn to explore and enjoy full-body pleasure. Or if erectile issues arise, many folks finally discover that the hands, tongue, lips, toys and skin can lead to intense pleasure and orgasms in the absence of penile erections.” ― Jess O’Reilly , a sexologist and the host of the Sex With Dr. Jess podcast “I’ve dealt with ED for over 20 years. My wife could never orgasm with [penis in vagina] but now has at least two or three orgasms and often more. I guess you could call it advanced foreplay: I use my mouth, hands and leg to stimulate her. She then stimulates me until I’m finished.” ― Norm, 71, southeast Michigan “Aging may cause physical changes that don’t have to be barriers to having sex. Aging naturally causes changes in physical comfort and mobility such as arthritis, joint pain, or mobility limitations that can be addressed easily by using products such as pillows for support , trying different sexual position s that are less physically demanding, or incorporating lubricants to reduce discomfort which contribute to a more enjoyable and fulfilling sexual experience. Also, being open to experimenting and adapting to the changing needs of one’s body can help older adults continue to engage in pleasurable sexual activities. In older age, sex is less performative and more adaptable to experiences providing pleasure and connection.” ― Chavez “Just because our bodies get worn out doesn’t mean our minds do. Adventurousness and imagination expand with experience. I may be different from other people, but I find myself giving myself permission to explore and be interested in diverse activities even more than when I was younger. When you get toward the end of your life you realize the rules don’t matter as much anymore, including in bed. No one is going to give you a disapproving glance and no one is going to discourage you from doing something you want to do and, really, who cares if they do?” ― David Daniel, a 70-something in Cedar Rapids, Iowa “The aging process has a tremendous impact on sexual functioning and satisfaction. In addition, as we age, we tend to have more medical issues and many medications can impact sexual function. As we age, we often experience changes in our sexual behavior, desire, what we find arousing, and overall sexual well-being. Some of the biological changes we experience as we age involve hormones: When women reach middle age, they experience menopause . This happens because the body stops producing estrogen. Some of the results of decreased estrogen production include vaginal dryness, decreased lubrication, and loss of elasticity in the vaginal tissues. This often leads to discomfort and even pain during intercourse. In some cases, there may be a decrease in nipple and clitoral sensitivity. The good news is, lube and longer-acting vaginal moisturizers can help.” ― Rachel Needle , a psychologist in West Palm Beach, Florida, and the co-director of Modern Sex Therapy Institutes “Emotional connection and intimacy are a priority and sex becomes intentional and more of the experience they are having. It is less about the sexual scripts and acts of sex and more about the type of connection and closeness that can be gained from mutually enjoyable experiences together. The motivation for sex may be less about looking good, pleasing your partner only, feeling like an obligation or task, and being more intentional about feeling good together and enjoying the experience.” ― Chavez “Some data suggests that very few women commonly experience sexual desire postmenopause. One study found that 24% never experience desire and 41% rarely experience desire postmenopause. But 91% experience arousal (and pleasure). What we can learn from this is that you don’t have to experience spontaneous desire to enjoy sex; if you don’t find yourself in the mood, you can put yourself in the mood — with fantasy, conversation, touch, and other forms of arousal.” ― O’Reilly “If you believe Reddit and other online forums, some folks make love several times a day. I’ve told the folks on Reddit that we make love every Friday. We tell anyone that wants to see us on Friday that we have a previous engagement. Our family knows that Friday is our chill day and never bothers us. Could we have sex more often? Maybe, but it’s very exhausting and we talk about it all of the time to keep it exciting. It’s Wednesday today, so it’s Friday, eve, eve. Lots of hugging and kissing during the week, just to be close.” ― Norm By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Reporter Howard University has decided to sever ties with rapper and alum Sean “Diddy” Combs following the recent release of a surveillance video that showed the rapper assaulting his ex-girlfriend. In a statement on Friday, the historically Black private university in Washington, D.C., said it will revoke the honorary degree he was awarded in 2014. The board of trustees also called for ties to be severed with the rapper, including by rejecting his 2016 “gift agreement” in which he pledged $1 million, and a 2023 pledge agreement to the Sean Combs Foundation, as well as disbanding the scholarship program in his name. The decision comes just weeks after CNN released 2016 footage of Diddy assaulting his then-girlfriend, singer-songwriter Cassie Ventura. The video, which was released as Diddy faced other legal woes, showed him throwing, kicking and dragging her in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. “Mr. Combs’ behavior as captured in a recently released video is so fundamentally incompatible with Howard University’s core values and beliefs that he is deemed no longer worthy to hold the institution’s highest honor,” the university said in the statement, adding that it opposes all acts of interpersonal violence. Diddy’s team did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on Howard University’s announcement. In response to the video release, Diddy posted a one-minute apology video on social media on May 19, saying he was “disgusted” by his actions in the video, both then and now. He added that he took “full responsibility” for his actions and that it happened during “the darkest times” of his life. Days later, Ventura also released a statement thanking the public for voicing support for her following the release of the hotel video and asking the public to “open your heart to believing victims the first time.” Diddy has a long history of legal troubles . Over the last six months, the rapper has been accused of violence and assault, which he had vehemently denied. On Nov. 19, Ventura filed a damning sexual assault and abuse lawsuit against Diddy, which was settled a day later. Others have come forward alleging assault, harassment and violence. Need help?

    "article_content": "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit of the last two survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, dampening the hope of advocates for racial justice that the government would make amends for one of the worst single acts of violence against Black people in U.S. history. The nine-member court upheld the decision made by a district court judge in Tulsa last year , ruling that the plaintiff’s grievances, although legitimate, did not fall within the scope of the state’s public nuisance statute. “We further hold that the plaintiff’s allegations do not sufficiently support a claim for unjust enrichment,” the court wrote in its decision. Messages left Wednesday with a spokesperson for the City of Tulsa and the survivors’ attorney, Damario Solomon-Simmons, were not immediately returned. The suit was an attempt to force the city of Tulsa and others to make recompense for the destruction by a white mob of the once-thriving Black district known as Greenwood. In 1921 — on May 31 and June 1 — the white mob, including some people hastily deputized by authorities, looted and burned the district, which was referred to as Black Wall Street. As many as 300 Black Tulsans were killed, and thousands of survivors were forced for a time into internment camps overseen by the National Guard. Burned bricks and a fragment of a church basement are about all that survive today of the more than 30-block historically Black district. The two survivors of the attack, Lessie Benningfield Randle and Viola Fletcher, who are both now over 100 years old, sued in 2020 with the hope of seeing what their attorney called “justice in their lifetime.” A third plaintiff, Hughes Van Ellis , died last year at age 102. The lawsuit was brought under Oklahoma’s public nuisance law, arguing that the actions of the white mob continue to affect the city today. It contended that Tulsa’s long history of racial division and tension stemmed from the massacre. The city and insurance companies never compensated victims for their losses, and the massacre ultimately resulted in racial and economic disparities that still exist today, the lawsuit argued. It sought a detailed accounting of the property and wealth lost or stolen in the massacre, the construction of a hospital in north Tulsa and the creation of a victims compensation fund, among other things.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer A recent federal court ruling temporarily blocked the distribution of a grant designed to support start-ups by Black women — and honestly, we shouldn’t be the only ones outraged. The most audacious part is that the Fearless Fund’s Fearless Strivers Grant, designed to support Black women-led businesses with $20,000 in venture capital, was deemed discriminatory. The Fearless Fund is one of the venture capital groups targeted for its programs designed to encourage corporate diversity. Black women are currently the largest growing demographic of business owners, yet they receive less than 1% of venture capital funding, according to Reuters. In 2023, one month after successfully dismantling affirmative action (the system put in place to address discriminatory admission practices of the past) at colleges through the conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court, the American Alliance for Equal Rights filed three lawsuits challenging organizations that support Black and other marginalized business owners. For many Black entrepreneurs, the federal court’s decision feels like a racist residual of the 1921 Black Wall Street massacre: An incident where white supremacists set fire to and destroyed an entire neighborhood of Tulsa where Black businesses thrived. Today, instead of overt physical violence, conservatives are using the courts to strip Black and minority-owned businesses from any shot at leveling a playing field that was built only for white Americans to thrive in — and has been fostered as such for decades. The American Alliance for Equal Rights calls itself a non-profit “membership” organization whose mission is to “challenge distinction and preferences made on the basis of race and ethnicity.” However, its consistent attacks on laws and initiatives that aim to rectify the disenfranchisement of minorities reveal the more obvious goal — to strip Black folks of any chance at achieving any form of financial security or long overdue reparations . According to the lawsuit against Fearless Fund, their grant violates the Civil Rights Act of 1866 , enacted after the Civil War to extend the right to make and enforce contracts to all citizens regardless of “race, color, and ethnicity.” The slightest bit of historical context will reveal that the law was meant to extend to Black Americans only the same rights that white people already had . While many Americans want to believe that we live in some kind of post-racial economy where the injustices of the past have been magically erased and that Black Americans no longer face discrimination — that couldn’t be farther from the truth. Black American entrepreneurs currently face several obstacles while getting their businesses off the ground. This Forbes piece points to exactly how racial bias in lending works — and why it sucks for all of us . As of 2022, Black business owners received only 2% of $288 billion of venture capital funding. And Black women receive a small fraction of that 2%. Anyone with critical thinking skills can see the Fearless Fund’s mission is meant to give Black entrepreneurs a fighting chance — which is actually exactly what the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was designed to protect. Aside from this being a racist attack on Black women entrepreneurs, blocking this funding also disrupts the nation’s economic growth. According to the Department of Commerce, minority-owned businesses contribute nearly $2 trillion annually to the economy and 9.43 million jobs to the job market. Yet a gaping equity gap remains between Black and brown business owners and their white counterparts. If the American Alliance for Equal Rights and other organizations could simply recognize these disparities, they might be more inclined to stay out of Black and Brown folks’ business.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump defended himself in a recent interview against those who think he’s racist, saying he can’t be because he has “so many” friends who are Black. “I have so many Black friends that if I were a racist, they wouldn’t be friends, they would know better than anybody, and fast,” he said in an interview with Semafor published Friday. “They would not be with me for two minutes if they thought I was racist — and I’m not racist!” Several Black male celebrities came to his defense in separate interviews with the news outlet. Those men included heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, retired MLB slugger Darryl Strawberry, boxing promoter Don King, and former NFL star Herschel Walker, who lost a 2022 Senate race in Georgia. Trump listed his “strength” and others’ desire to be like him as reasons that these men speak so warmly about him. “They see what I’ve done and they see strength, they want strength, okay,” Trump said. “They want strength, they want security. They want jobs, they want to have their jobs. They don’t want to have millions of people come and take their jobs.” Trump’s response follows a long history of race-baiting. In the late 1980s, the now-presidential candidate called for the death penalty in full-page advertisements , after five Black New York teens were accused of rape. (All were later exonerated.) More recently, after President Barack Obama ’s election, he helped spearhead a conspiracy that the first Black U.S. president was born in Kenya and not the U.S. He defended attendees of the infamous white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as “very fine people.” He indiscriminately smeared Mexican immigrants coming to the U.S. border as criminals and rapists and he championed a ban on migrants from several Muslim-majority countries. Despite his public history of judging and persecuting others, Trump told Semafor that he thinks he appeals to a lot of Black men because they can relate to his legal struggles, which he’s called unjust and discriminatory. Trump became the first former American president to be convicted of felony crimes last month. “They see what’s happening. And a lot of them feel that similar things have happened to them. I mean, they’ve expressed that to me very plainly and very clear. They see what’s happened to them,” he told Semafor. The Trump and Biden campaigns have been increasing their efforts to sway Black voters ahead of November, meeting with Black business leaders, community groups and faith centers. Recent polls have shown that Black voters still overwhelmingly support President Joe Biden over Trump, though the difference has narrowed a bit from where it was four years ago. In one poll published last month by the Pew Research Center, 18% of Black voters said they would vote for Trump while 77% said they would vote for Biden. That support for Trump is more than double what it was during the 2020 election, when 8% of Black voters supported him.

    "article_content": "Associate Sports Editor, The Huffington Post Senior Reporter, HuffPost Willie Mays, a Hall of Fame baseball player known to fans as the “Say Hey Kid,” died Tuesday at age 93. “My father has passed away peacefully and among loved ones,” his son, Michael Mays, said in a statement released by the San Francisco Giants. “I want to thank you all from the bottom of my broken heart for the unwavering love you have shown him over the years. You have been his life’s blood.” Mays played center field in the MLB from 1951 to 1973 for the New York Giants, the San Francisco Giants and the New York Mets. He hit 660 home runs and won one World Series during his 22 seasons. Tributes quickly poured in from other members of the Giants family. “I have no words to describe what you mean to me,” Barry Bonds, another Giants player recognized as one of the sport’s all-time greatest, posted on social media in a tribute to Mays. “[Y]ou helped shape me to be who I am today.” “I fell in love with baseball because of Willie, plain and simple,” Giants president and CEO Larry Baer said in a statement. In 1951, he was the National League’s Rookie of the Year, exploding onto the scene just four years after Jackie Robinson famously broke baseball’s color barrier on the Brooklyn Dodgers, helping usher in a new era in the MLB. Mays’ excellence played its part in helping desegregate the league, exposing fans, reporters and decision-makers to the wealth of baseball talent that had been relegated to the Negro Leagues . The entirety of Mays’ career presents an argument that he was the greatest all-around baseball player ever. On top of 660 home runs, Mays collected 3,293 hits, 338 stolen bases, two National League MVPs and one batting title. His 7,095 outfield putouts prevails as an MLB all-time record, and when paired with his 12 Gold Gloves, Mays’ statistical resume shows he was a genuine five-tool player. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979. He was fast on his feet, powerful and accurate with the bat, and strong when cocking the ball back above his head, ready to throw down any runner. Longevity was perhaps his greatest asset, as Mays went to the All-Star Game 24 consecutive times from 1954 to 1973 — a streak so remarkable that fellow Hall of Famer Ted Williams once remarked , “They invented the All-Star Game for Willie Mays.” His grace, strength and athleticism on the field made him a wonder to watch. And that’s how Mays got his first experience in professional baseball — by watching it. Born to Cat Mays, a Negro League player, and Annie Satterwhite, a standout track and basketball star in high school, Mays grew up with baseball. As a 10-year-old, Mays watched his father from the bench of games, but soon, the roles were reversed. He signed his first professional contract in 1947 at age 16 with the Chattanooga Choo-Choos, a minor league affiliate of the Negro Leagues, and by 1948, he was on the Negro Leagues’ Birmingham Black Barons. Over the next two years, Mays’ profile rose, and scores of MLB scouts came to Black Barons games to see Mays and to present contract overtures. The Boston Braves were the first to contact Mays — nearly securing an outfield pairing of Mays and former all-time home run leader Hank Aaron — but he ultimately signed with the New York Giants in 1950. At first, things didn’t go so well. Mays went hitless in his first 12 MLB at-bats, but on lucky No. 13, he smacked a home run off the left field roof of the Polo Grounds against legendary pitcher Warren Spahn. Mays won the National League MVP award at age 23 after missing two years to serve in the Korean War. Those two years prevented him from beating Babe Ruth’s all-time home run record of 714, but provided him with the bulk to become a power-hitter. “[Being in the army is] why I got strong. I think I could’ve hit maybe another 50 or 60 home runs,” Mays said. Although he quickly became a star, Mays grew to prominence in a racist era. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, he did not often speak about civil rights issues, for which he was criticized by Jackie Robinson. In his 1964 book, “Baseball Has Done It,” Robinson filleted Mays for avoiding race-related controversy and not being the crusading Black icon Robinson wanted him to be. “I hope Willie hasn’t forgotten his shotgun house in Birmingham’s slums, wind whistling through its clapboards, as he sits in his $85,000 mansion in San Francisco’s fashionable Forest Hills,” Robinson wrote. Knowing that Robinson was an activist at heart and he wasn’t, Mays was not bitter about Robinson’s comments. He felt comfortable with himself and chose to represent his race as the archetypal role model. Mays didn’t drink, smoke or scandalize, embedding himself within American pop culture as a dedicated professional who worked hard for what he wanted. As MLB’s highest paid player in the mid-1960s, he often donated to children’s causes. Overall, his success helped lift Black men in his sport. Mays was part of the first MLB African American outfield, flanked by fellow Giants Hank Thompson and Monte Irvin. In his later years, Mays remained a staple in the Giants clubhouse, often appearing at games and team ceremonies and serving as a mentor to players. In 2017, the MLB renamed its World Series Most Valuable Player award after him. When President Barack Obama awarded the Medal of Freedom to Mays in November 2015, Obama said , “It’s because of giants like Willie that someone like me could even think about running for president.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated incorrectly that Willie Mays had 3,283 hits. He had 3,293. By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Sign up here for weekly book news, author interviews and more. On June 19, 1865, 250,000 enslaved African Americans were told of their freedom, several years after the passing of the Emancipation Proclamation. This date would become known as “ Juneteenth ,” a celebratory event of Black jubilation and an exuberant marker for history that continued to evolve and nurture its own traditions and continued conversations about what it means to be free. Samuel Collins III is a historian, preservationist and president of The Juneteenth Legacy Project (J19LP) — a Galveston, Texas-based nonprofit that aims “to recontextualize Juneteenth as a pivotal moment in the arc of U.S. history.” The seventh-generation Texan has devoted a significant portion of his adult life to educating the public about Juneteenth and advocating for the day to be recognized as a national holiday. “[It’s] important to keep educating the public at the center of the celebrations because we must always remember why we are celebrating the holiday,” Collins remarked in an email to HuffPost. On June 17, 2021, the relentless work of many African American preservationists, social advocates and others was finally realized, when President Joe Biden signed a bill making Juneteenth a federal holiday. Amid this success, it’s imperative to observe the holiday, and all that it represents, in a way that strays from an overly white-centered lens and into the Black perspective. Just ahead, you’ll find a list of books recommended by Collins and other African American historians, community leaders, authors and others.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer A recent study from Pew Research Center, which found that “most Black Americans believe U.S. institutions were designed to hold Black people back,” has gotten some backlash this past week . Although the report has since been revised to acknowledge its misstep, it originally used the term “racial conspiracy theories” to describe how Black Americans perceive bias. This triggered me. Yes, most of us recognize systemic racism enough to call it out when asked — but its existence is a fact, not a “belief.” The findings, which shared new data about the Black experience in America, are an extension of a series that aims to understand how Black Americans perceive individual success by identifying what it calls our “suspicions” about the barriers we face. The study surveyed 5,000 Black adults about whether they believed claims related to racial bias to be true or false. Of the “suspicions” the study looked to explore, researchers found that about 60% of Black adults surveyed agreed that institutions such as policing, the criminal justice system and the country’s economic system are designed to hold Black people back. These systems are flawed (or, frankly, broken altogether), and there’s evidence that they are stacked against us. We are not outsiders looking in on some social experiment. Black Americans currently live the daily experiences that prove the existence of historical and present-day racial bias. Research has shown that “Black and Hispanic individuals are more likely than White people with similar criminal histories and charges to be arrested and held in jail before trial.” They also “tend to have higher bails set and receive lengthier and more punitive sanctions.” There’s the yawning wealth disparity that stems from a discriminatory economic system — one that limited where Black Americans were allowed to work and live, and that still persists after centuries . According to more Pew research from just a few years ago, even in low-income households, white families have been shown to have an income four times higher than Black families. Also, it’s been shown that majority-Black school districts often receive less funding than districts with more white students. All this just scratches the surface of why it feels reductive to frame research about Black Americans as “believing” in racial bias or “perceiving” institutional racism. And swiftly after social justice organizations such as JustLeadershipUSA vocalized their collective WTF at the word “conspiracy,” Pew revised their headline and issued an update. When HuffPost reached out to Pew for comment, a representative said that they “ cannot respond to an editorial that will not be shared” with them before publishing. However, they did offer to make themselves available to clarify any questions about their research or findings. “We recently published a report focused on the suspicions that Black adults might have about the actions of U.S. institutions based on their personal and collective history with racial discrimination,” the Pew representative wrote. “The report emphasizes there is a long history of intentional or negligent harm against Black people in the United States.” “Our decision to use a shorthand to describe a complex and mixed battery of findings was a poor choice,” the representative wrote, “and we have revised the report.” The Pew report does provide important insight and reflection from members of our community — there’s no doubt about that. But seeing the word “conspiracy” in the report felt hurtful, because it implied that we’re being paranoid . Every day, conservatives are out here misusing terms and concepts like “ woke ” and “ DEI ,” and making claims about things like “reverse racism” to push back against efforts by Black Americans to address systemic injustice. We’re not being paranoid. We’re just being honest. By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "DALLAS (AP) — American Airlines put an unspecified number of employees on leave for their involvement in an incident in which several Black passengers were removed from a flight in Phoenix, allegedly over a complaint about body odor. American CEO Robert Isom wrote in a note to staff that the incident was unacceptable. “I am incredibly disappointed by what happened on that flight and the breakdown of our procedures,” Isom said in the note this week. “It contradicts our values. … We fell short of our commitments and failed our customers in this incident.” Three Black passengers sued the airline last month, charging that they were removed from the January flight because of racial discrimination. They said they were told that a white male flight attendant had complained about an unidentified passenger’s body odor. The men said they did not know each other and were seated separately while waiting for the plane to depart for New York. The three said they were among eight passengers – all the Black men on the flight, they said – who were told to leave the plane. The men said they demanded an explanation for their removal during a confrontation with airline personnel in the jet bridge. At least one of the men recorded the discussion, capturing an airline employee seeming to agree that the men were discriminated against, according to their lawsuit. After a delay of about an hour, they were allowed back on the plane. American did not say how many employees were put on leave or describe their job titles. A spokesperson for the airline said, “We are holding those involved accountable, including removing team members from service.” Isom said American would form an advisory group to focus on the experience of Black customers, to promote the reporting of discrimination allegations, and to improve diversity training to “focus on real-world situations to help recognize and address bias and discrimination.” In his note, which was reported earlier by CBS News, Isom said he had spoken with the president of the NAACP about the incident. The civil rights group did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. American has faced allegations of discrimination in the recent past. In 2017, the NAACP warned Black travelers about flying on the airline, claiming that several African American passengers had experienced discrimination from airline employees. American promised to make changes, and the NAACP lifted the advisory nearly nine months later.

    "article_content": "Parenting reporter The soft sand, the gentle crashing sound of the waves, the warm sun: A trip to the beach always sounds like a good idea, but if you bring your children with you, don’t count on fitting in much relaxation. Between fighting with the 900 collapsible rods in the beach tent, fulfilling nonstop snack requests and fishing sand out of places you didn’t even know sand could go, you may need a day off to recover from your day at the beach. Here, the funny parents of X (formerly Twitter) describe in painfully accurate detail what it’s like to parent at the ocean’s edge. I'm trying to force 3 kids to get ready to go the beach which they \"HATE AND DONT WANT TO DO,\" so that in four hours I can tear them away from the beach which they \"LOVE AND NEVER WANT TO LEAVE TO GO HOME TO OUR STUPID HOUSE!\" Parenting us fun. Finally made it to the beach! Now just 17 quick trips back to the car to grab floaties, towels, an umbrella, the cooler... The only thing worse than listening to your kids whining at the beach is listening to their friend whine at the beach. As I buried my child in the sand at the beach, I realized I have matured so much as a parent but not enough to not give them sand-boobs. So glad I took my 5yo to the beach so he could tell me it's too sandy. It’s dad law that if you encounter a group of children building a sand castle at the beach, you have to ask them if they have the appropriate permits. I enjoy long walks on the beach digging my toes in the sand, as I carry my child (beach chairs, popup tent, cooler) mid-tantrum over a dropped ice cream cone & salt water in her eyes while she kicks, filling my backseat with enough sand to create our own private beach. #summer Saw a parenting “hack” that said to bring a laundry basket to the beach to put towels in to shake out the sand. What parent can possibly carry one more thing to the beach with kids? They may as well have suggested bringing a portable washing machine. ◦ Vacation, Day 2: Celebrate finding a great parking spot at the beach. Car is unloaded, umbrella is up, everyone is slathered in spf 50. Just settling into my comfy beach chair w/ beer in hand — ahh it’s gonna be a great d…. “Daddy I gotta go poopoo.” That awkward moment when you finally get to the beach with your kids and you realize that after getting them all ready and carrying all that stuff you're ready to go home. Kid 1: *crying bc sunscreen is in his eye* Kid 2: *crying bc she has sand in her hair* Kid 3: *crying bc flies are biting her* Me: Alright, kids, I think it’s time we leave the beach. Also kids: ALREADY?!? Almost beach time! Can anyone recommend a good book to lay open face down in the sand while I adjust children's goggle straps for four hours? 8yo: Did you know there are 7 quintillion 500 quadrillion grains of sand on the Earth? 11yo: Not counting the grains of sand that fell off your butt after we went to the beach. Word. Teenager, “I’m bored, there’s nothing to do here.” Me *spends entire paycheck on a trip to the beach* Teenager, “I’m bored, there’s nothing to do here.” Me *hurls self into ocean* Husband: \"I wonder if we should try and take the kids on a beach trip this summer?\" Me: \"Ok, close your eyes.\" H: *closes eyes* Me: *turns on both kid's sound machines to \"waves\" and proceeds to scream, cry, throw things at him and shove sand down his pants.* I AM GOING TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT STARTS WITH S! YOU WILL NEVER GUESS IT! —my 4yo, at the beach Packing for a 4 days beach trip for me, my husband, a preschooler and a baby and it legit took me 3.5 hours. I think I moved out of my college dorm faster than this tbh Any house is a beach house once my kids dust the sand off their swimming costumes Let’s get married and have kids so instead of relaxing on the beach you can keep sand out of their mouth while I blow up a raft and they ask if there is a pool. Me as a mom of one infant: Oh My God, wouldn’t it be SO adorable if we went to the beach? Me as a mom of two infants and one 3 YO: Oh My God, wouldn’t it be SO stupid if we went to the beach? Friend: You should get family pictures of you guys on the beach! *What I hear* Take my feral children to the beach for family pictures so I can listen to my kids cry bc 1 ate sand and 4 wants to poke a dead jellyfish. Then my husband and I water down our drinks with our tears. I took the kids to the beach today and let me tell you, it aged me terribly 7: (at the beach) I don’t like my feet to be all sandy, Mom. My teenager wore jeans and a black T-shirt to the beach. That’s it that’s, the tweet. Take your kids to the beach so they can say things like \"I don't want to touch water\", \"where are the good snacks\" and \"is this sand in my penis\" Ode to the Beach: Sand sand, lots of fun Sun and surf for everyone Sand sand, dig it up With a shovel, with a cup Sand sand, near and far In the backseat of my car Sand sand, everywhere In my crack and in my hair You don’t realize how stereotypically “mom” you’ve become until you realize how much you’re willing to pay for a shaded spot on the beach. Beach vacations are awesome if you’re looking for a more scenic backdrop for your toddler’s tantrums. 5yo: Is this the beach with the COLD water? Me: It’s the same ocean no matter where we go, bud. 5: pic.twitter.com/PKFxsB9zUv Let's go to the beach so the seagulls can steal the kids' sandwiches while we yell at the kids to wash sandy hands so they can eat- oops... I’m taking my kids to the beach tomorrow and there’s already sand in my purse. 7% of divorces are caused by a husband clipping his nails while a wife gets everything ready for family day at the beach. You may ask yourself, “Was the 1 1/2 hr prep time, the 2 hr round trip, the hr of schlepping the wagon full of our bags for the beach, the splash pad & the park really worth the 30 minutes of uninterrupted sun time I got while husband played with the toddler?” The answer is YES. My 7yo told us she loves everything about our beach vacation except for the beach. Vacations are great if you want to hear your kids complain about the same things they always complain about, but near a beach. Spent 10 minutes at the beach and came home with a lifetime supply of sand to remember it by.

Prices and availability are subject to change. With so many bedding options to choose from for getting a good night’s sleep , finding sheets that are comfy, durable and affordable can feel impossible. Do you splurge on percale or silk ? Snuggle up with eucalyptus, flannel or linen ? The decision is even harder if you’re a hot sleeper who often wakes up in a pool of sweat and hasn’t yet found the holy grail of sheets that won’t make you feel like you slept in a damp towel all night. But what if I told you there’s one bed sheet set that’s hot-sleeper approved (by me and plenty of reviewers) and has a softness that oozes luxury without the heavy price tag? Introducing LuxClub’s cooling sheets , which come in over 40 attractive colors like lavender, burnt orange, olive green, rose gold, emerald green and sky blue. In addition to being ridiculously soft, these sheets are known for their breathability and being gentle on sensitive skin . LuxClub’s sheets, which have over 119,000 five-star reviews Amazon , are made of a cotton blended with microfibers and equipped with moisture-wicking technology. They even have deep, elastic pockets so you don’t have to worry about your fitted sheet snapping back in the middle of the night. I immediately bought these sheets after seeing them raved about on TikTok and have been using them on my full-sized bed for almost two years now. I purchased them in silver to match the rest of my bedding and am already planning to get them again in another color (to go with my future fall aesthetic, perhaps). Like I previously mentioned, I am an extremely hot sleeper, even during the colder months, and have found myself feeling less overheated at night while slumbering on these sheets. They don’t completely stop me from sweating, but I definitely don’t wake up in a daze wondering when I decided to nap in a sauna. Before putting them on my bed, I washed and dried them and noticed little to no wrinkles, which is always a plus for getting that sleek and crisp hotel look we all love. But if you still need a little more convincing to elevate your snooze time with just one easy swap, peruse these glowing Amazon reviews: “These sheets are amazing. This is my second set. Stays cool, very soft, and so durable! My cats tend to sink their claws into the bed and with standard sheets I always had snags. After a year the first set I bought did not have and snags or pulls. I bought a second color recently, the quality is just as good on these. Deep pockets too, fit my 12 inch mattress with no issues!” — portermom 123 “I was searching for a sheet set that would help me sleep more comfortably at night and found these. I have terrible hot flashes with night sweats and get up in the morning just miserable. Of course, these do not eliminate my hot flashes as no sheets will, but they definitely make my nights much more comfortable by eliminating wet bedding and I definitely appreciate that! Aside from their moisture wicking abilities, they are very soft, easy to look at and launder extremely well. I would highly recommend these for anyone shopping for sheet sets and especially for anyone experiencing night sweats!! ” — Shannon Warfel “I typically don’t order sheets online as I want to feel them. This item and color was suggested when I was ordering a new comforter. The color exactly matches the accent color in the quilt. They are very soft and do not “sleep hot”. The pockets in the fitted sheet are deep enough and kept snuggly on all night. They are not the thickest or heaviest fabric in the world, but they are sufficient in my opinion. Very nice to sleep in. Very happy with my purchase and the color is beautiful.” — Annie Gilmoreshee By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Parenting reporter A source recently let me know that the responses to an article I had written were a bit mean-spirited. “That’s why I don’t read the comments,” I found myself thinking. I moved quickly past this news and on to the rest of my day. My reaction suddenly struck me as very adult . I didn’t begin my life online never reading the comments, but it’s a strategy I’ve learned to keep my head above water. I arrived at this realization via experience, much the same way that I’ve learned I should stop after two cups of coffee or I’ll feel jittery. Young people tend to lack this kind of wisdom. They also deserve opportunities to gain it. And therein lies the rub for parents, educators and others who care about teens. We want to protect them from the harm that social media can do while also teaching them how to use it in a way that minimizes such damage. To make a teen a safe driver, you first have to let them sit behind the wheel. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who issued a national advisory on youth mental health in 2021, is now calling for warning labels on social media for teenage users, à la the warning labels on tobacco products. In a New York Times essay published June 17, Murthy wrote, “The mental health crisis among young people is an emergency — and social media has emerged as an important contributor.” In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 42% of young people reported “persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness” in 2021, up from 28% in 2011. The number of youth who considered or attempted suicide also rose steadily over that decade. There is a documented correlation between the increased use of social media and the rise of mental health issues in youth, although it isn’t always clear which is the cause and which is the effect. In his recent essay, Murthy cites research that shows kids who use social media for more than three hours a day are more likely to show signs of mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. Again, it’s possible that heavy social media use contributes to these problems, but it’s also possible that kids who have anxiety or depression tend to spend more time on social media. Murthy also cites an August 2022 survey conducted by the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital of 1,480 youths ages 13 to 17. In the survey, 46% said that using social media made them feel worse (either “a little” or “a lot”) about their bodies. These are alarming statistics, ones that parents should be aware of. At the same time, the Digital Wellness Lab survey found that teens also see upsides to the socializing that they do online. Seventy-nine percent reported that using social media made them feel more socially connected, and 69% said it made them feel more emotionally supported by peers. HuffPost spoke with several experts on the topic of teens and technology about their thoughts on Murthy’s proposed warning labels. “Cigarettes are a product that is toxic when used as directed,” Dr. Michael Rich, a pediatrician who is the director of the Digital Wellness Lab, told HuffPost. With social media, on the other hand, “it’s how you use it.” One danger of vilifying social media is that it may then become a “forbidden fruit” and tempt teens even more. Another risk is that it would throw out the good along with the bad. In recent years, kids (and adults) from historically marginalized communities, such as those who have disabilities or who identify as LGBTQI+, Rich said, “have been connected, and many of them use [social media] quite respectfully and quite gratefully.” Devorah Heitner, author of “Growing Up in Public: Coming of Age in a Digital World,” told HuffPost: “Social media is more like other risky things we do that have benefits.” She mentioned swimming, riding a bike and driving a car — as opposed to the cigarette comparison. Social media, she added, is neutral for many kids and positive for some, “and then there are kids for whom there is significant harm, that maybe they access something really dangerous, or they experience a very, very negative interaction or bullying.” All parents are eager to prevent such things from happening to their kids, but, particularly when it comes to social media, are often not sure how. One challenge is figuring out what the equivalents of car seats, bicycle helmets and lifeguards are in this digital landscape, which, for us, can be unchartered territory. An official signal of potential danger, such as a surgeon general’s warning, won’t solve the problem on its own, but all of the experts we spoke to felt that it could be a significant step in the right direction. “The impetus behind a warning is to really stop and think,” Jill Murphy, content officer at Common Sense Media, told HuffPost. “Instead of just clicking without thinking, it causes that pause.” To signal a warning from on high and broadcast it widely implicates everyone whom the issue touches. “It also puts a stake in the ground to acknowledge that we recognize, as a society, that social media is having a significant impact on the mental health and wellbeing of kids and teens, we can’t pretend that it isn’t, and that it’s all of our responsibility to acknowledge that, instead of just the parents,” Murphy said. If we see an official warning as an acknowledgement of risk, we can use it to pressure social media companies to minimize that risk for their youngest customers. Murphy thinks the situation calls for a multi-pronged approach that involves government, parents and product developers. Common Sense supports the Kids Online Safety Act , which would require companies to protect kids’ data and prevent them from seeing harmful content. Polls show that almost 90% of Americans support this legislation — with near-equal support from voters who favor Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden in the presidential campaign. “There are elements within these platforms that could be adjusted to make the overall experience better and more beneficial, but we need that large-scale impact that comes from a warning label or legislation to really force companies to protect this next generation,” Murphy said. Rich argued that such protections will also be a good business move for companies: “I think that it’s important to help them understand that the kind of meteoric rise in their business is over, and now they’re in a place where they need to stabilize and maintain and sustain their businesses, and the way they’re going to do that is by making their businesses focus not just on profits but on the wellness of their users.” This focus needs to include meaningful responses when a user reports abusive or dangerous online behavior, Heitner said. “If my kid is getting sexually harassed or bullied online, if your kid is being impersonated, if there’s a fake account with your kid’s picture and name, and you contact these big companies like TikTok, Snapchat, Meta, Discord... [and] you get a bot, or you get referred to a call center, or you just don’t hear back at all — that is unacceptable,” she said. Heitner wants to see companies “invest much more heavily in being responsive to complaints and concerns that kids or adults reach out to them with,” hunting down solutions to these issues with the same tenacity they devote to their own growth. “One upside I can really see of the warning label is if it leads to caregiver-child or parent-child conversation,” Heitner said, noting that, as with driving, parents should not just “hand over the keys and forget it.” “Parents of especially younger teenagers should know if their kids have social accounts. They should be leaning in to teaching their kids about being safe in terms of what information they share and who they connect with and who they follow in terms of content. Those are conversations that should be happening at school and in homes,” she added. An important part of this conversation is balance. Even if the content a teen is accessing on social media is positive, if they’re spending so much time online that it’s interrupting their sleep or in-person socializing, the overall effect on their life can be negative. To encourage kids to strike a balance, Heitner is in favor of measures such as a proposed law in Colorado that would require apps to display a pop-up warning to users younger than 18 after they spend an hour on the app in a 24-hour period or if they are active on it from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Helping guide teens in social media use is an ongoing conversation that parents will need to keep revisiting as their kids and the technology grow and change. “There’s just no easy button,” Murphy said. “There isn’t a 10,000-steps goal in all of this. Parents are always asking us, ‘What’s the one thing I should do? How much time is OK?’ It’s not like that ... It is a real constant maintenance.” Though the ground is ever-shifting and there’s never just one solution, Murphy did note that in all of her conversations with teens and young people, none had ever expressed a wish that they had spent more time on social media. Speaking of the way parents are currently wrestling with the issue, she said, “It’s not for nothing.” If you or someone you know needs help, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org for mental health support.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Growing up, your parents likely told you not to talk to strangers and to be wary of people you don’t know who might try to lure you away and harm you — also known as “stranger danger.” These days, however, top child safety experts are more likely to recommend teaching the concept of “tricky people” instead — and for good reason. It’s a term coined by child safety expert Pattie Fitzgerald, founder of safelyeverafter.com . She defines a tricky person as someone who “tricks” a kid or a parent into believing they’re a safe person when, in reality, they are not . They might ask a child (rather than another adult) for help, tell a kid to keep a secret from their parents, try to arrange alone time with them (like special outings that don’t include a parent), touch their body excessively and/or inappropriately, or invade their personal space. “A tricky person who intends to target a child often uses ‘grooming tricks’ to gain access and/or privacy with a child. This means gaining the trust of the child or the parent, until personal boundaries become blurry and lines are crossed,” Fitzgerald, author of “Super Duper Safety School,” told HuffPost. One reason to use the term tricky people? It’s more accurate. Consider the fact that more than 90% of reported child sexual abuse cases happen at the hands of people the child knows — not strangers — according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). Child abductions by strangers are very rare ; most abductions are committed by a family member or acquaintance (though stranger abductions do usually pose more of a threat to the child’s safety). “If we are only teaching kids about ‘stranger danger,’ then we are missing a much larger and more important issue that needs to be addressed.” “If we are only teaching kids about ‘stranger danger,’ then we are missing a much larger and more important issue that needs to be addressed,” said Fitzgerald. We need to make it clear that it’s not just people they don’t know who might be unsafe. Adults they do know — a relative, a coach, a neighbor, a family friend — can be tricky people, too. What’s more, kids often expect strangers to appear scary or dangerous. But folks who are looking to harm children may actually come across as quite friendly or charming. “The other problem with ‘stranger danger’ is that even when there is an inappropriate stranger seeking out a child — particularly in a public place — that person will not seem scary or threatening to your child, but rather outgoing, fun or interesting,” Fitzgerald said. “It is easy to get tricked when that stranger offers a treat, a toy, a puppy or something else that would grab a child’s attention.” The “tricky people” concept puts more focus on strange behavior than it does on fearing strangers altogether. “Listen to your instincts and remember it’s not what someone looks like that tells you if they are tricky. It’s how they act, behave or seek out your child,” Fitzgerald said. Rather than trying to instill fear in your child with scary stories, take a “loving, nurturing” approach, Fitzgerald advised. “Use empowering words and phrases like ‘boss of your body’ or ’boss of your own touches,’ thumbs up and thumbs down behavior in other people, listening to their ‘uh-oh feeling’ when their heart or their brain tells them something doesn’t seem quite right,” she said. This kind of language gives your child more agency. Fitzgerald also recommends teaching kids about what to do rather than only teaching them what not to do. This “gives them a proactive response in case something doesn’t seem right to them,” she said. When you’re in public, teach your child that they need to check in with you “before running off with someone else to see or do something new,” Fitzgerald said. “Even if it’s the ice cream man.” You can start having these kinds of discussions with toddler-aged children, said child psychologist Cindy T. Graham, and build on them over time. “This would be a very simplified version early on and as the child gets older, the choice of wording will mature as appropriate,” Graham, founder of Brighter Hope Wellness Center , told HuffPost. “These conversations can then naturally evolve to include topics on consenting to sexual behaviors as the child matures.” It’s also important to use the anatomically correct terms for body parts when talking to your kids. This will help your child communicate clearly if they are ever touched inappropriately. “Let your child know that no one else should try to ‘share those private parts’ with them — not our friends, relatives, or other people we know and like,” Fitzgerald said. “Teach kids they have permission to say ‘stop touching me’ to anyone and to let you know all about it as soon as they can so you can help.” Another important point to stress: Tell your kids that we do not keep secrets from parents (or other trusted caregivers), “especially if it’s about a secret touch or a secret gift,” Fitzgerald said. You can also explain the difference between a secret and a surprise. “Grandma giving you an extra cookie isn’t a secret,” Kate Schweitzer wrote for Chicago Parent . “Nor is not telling Daddy what his birthday present is going to be. Those are surprises. Teach your kids the difference and remind them that they never keep secrets from their parents.” You might also want to spell out problematic behaviors for kids to be aware of. “A helpful approach can begin with, ‘It is not OK for anyone to...’ then discussing the inappropriate behaviors in a developmentally appropriate way,” Graham said. “Then go on to clarify, ‘This includes friends, family, neighbors, classmates, teachers, strangers, anyone.’” When having these conversations, be comfortable and confident in your delivery. That will help kids know there’s no shame in talking about these topics, Graham said. There are books that can help adults better navigate these conversations; pediatricians are also trained to have these talks with children, Graham noted. “Parents or adults who have a history of trauma may benefit from seeking help from a psychologist to help them work through triggers that may arise from having these discussions with their children,” she added. Fitzgerald’s best piece of advice for parents? Pay attention to who is paying attention to your kid. “Monitor the types of relationships others have established with your child, and listen to your instinct,” she said. “If someone is too good to be true, ask yourself: Does this really make sense?” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Another thing to consider is your outdoor surface area: Is it flat and relatively smooth, or will you need a tarp or liner to prevent tears and spills on uneven ground? You’ll also need a way to inflate it, Reviewers love this super versatile electric air pump that you can hook into your car if you want to take your pool on the go. For every pool listed below, we’ve given the general size and shape as well as any listed specifications.

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost In plenty of places, the start of summer means sweltering heat. According to a study published in Nature , 2023 was the hottest summer in the Northern Hemisphere in more than 2,000 years . This year is shaping up to be a scorcher, too. Cities in the Midwest, the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic are all experiencing extreme heat and humidity this week, factors that health experts say could lead to to heat exhaustion and heatstroke if you’re outside for too long. Heat-related deaths have been increasing in the U.S. : There were approximately 1,602 in 2021, 1,722 in 2022, and 2,302 in 2023. Signs of heat illness include excessive sweating, nausea, cramps and confusion, said Meghan Kennihan , a National Academy of Sports Medicine-certified personal trainer and running coach. “Heat illness can escalate to heat exhaustion or heatstroke, which are life-threatening conditions requiring immediate medical attention,” she said. If you’re a runner, it’s especially important to be aware of extreme heat conditions. “Running in the heat poses risks such as heat exhaustion, heatstroke, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances,” Kennihan said. What’s more, you’ll probably be running poorly if you’re overheated and pushing yourself too hard. “Your performance typically declines because your body prioritizes cooling over running efficiency,” Kennihan said. “Heat stress can reduce stamina, slow your pace, and increase perceived effort, making your usual run feel significantly harder.” “Heat illness can escalate to heat exhaustion or heatstroke, which are life-threatening conditions requiring immediate medical attention.” To reduce your risk of heat stress, it’s important to time your runs for either earlier or later in the day, said JohnEric Smith , an associate professor at the department of kinesiology at Mississippi State University. “Training earlier and later in the day will result in significantly lower radiant heat loads and air temperatures,” Smith told HuffPost. If you run in areas that include stretches of grass, you should encounter less heat than you would on asphalt. “[Running] through the woods and forests can provide shade to also reduce heat load,” Smith said. And if you have to change your planned distance, duration and pace because of the heat, you’re in good company. “ Research has shown that even elite runners in competition run at slower paces in the heat,” Smith said. “As runners continue to train smart and gradually increase their exposure to running in the heat, they will be better able to run safely.” Of course, it’s also important to know the signs that it’s just too hot to run. Below, our experts share five reasons you may want to put off your regularly scheduled jog. Generally speaking, the answer to “Is it too hot to run?” doesn’t come from one distinct numeric temperature, said Amy Rantala, a primary care sports medicine physician in the Mayo Clinic Health System’s department of sports medicine and orthopedics. There are several factors that go into answering this question, Rantala said, including temperature, humidity, speed, how acclimated you are to running in the heat, how hydrated you are, your general health and your sweat-loss rate at any given time. One relatively easy way to check if it’s too hot, though, is to consult the WetBulb Globe Temperature , a free forecasting tool from the National Weather Service that estimates the expected heat stress on the human body when in direct sunlight. “It estimates the effect of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation on humans using a combination of temperatures from three different thermometers,” Rantala said. “The [wet bulb temperature] is typically used at running competitions to determine if the conditions are favorable for running and to make recommendations to runners.” There’s no universal minimum temperature at which heat illness risk is greater for everyone. But when the WBGT is above 82 degrees Fahrenheit, there are usually increases in heat illness, said Rebecca Stearns, chief operating officer of the Korey Stringer Institute in the Department of Kinesiology at the University of Connecticut. “Generally, if it’s more than roughly 10 degrees hotter than what you have been exercising in for the past one to two weeks,” then the risk of heat illness is greater, she said. Listen to your body. If you’re experiencing muscle cramps, especially in the legs or calves, that’s often a sign of heat-related illness, said Roger Adams , a personal trainer and owner of Eatrightfitness, a nutrition and fitness consultation company. “Elevated temperatures increase sweat rate and can lead to dehydration and loss of electrolytes,” Adams said. “We need electrolytes for muscles to properly function, contract and relax. If you’re having cramps, you may be dehydrated.” High humidity is a red flag because when the air is saturated with moisture, sweat doesn’t evaporate efficiently, which impedes your body’s cooling mechanism, said Kennihan. “If you are dehydrated, too, running in the heat can exacerbate these symptoms, which include dark urine, dizziness, and dry mouth,” she said. “Dehydration reduces blood volume, making it harder for your heart to pump blood and regulate temperature.” If you’re running and get dizzy or lightheaded, you’re in the obvious danger zone for heat-related illness. “When the body’s core temperature gets too high, it can affect the central nervous system, causing a protective trigger of fainting or dizziness to occur to get the runner to stop,” Adams said. Other, more extreme signs of possible heat illness include nausea and vomiting. “When the body struggles to regulate normal temperature, the core temperature gets too high, [and] the body shunts blood flow more to the surface so the blood can cool off easier,” Adams said. “When blood is taken away from the visceral cavity, this can cause stomach cramps, nausea, and even vomiting, as there is now less blood flow to your internal organs.” Acclimatization is important if you’re going to be running in a hotter and more humid climate. It can take seven to 14 days to really acclimate to changes in elevation, temperature and humidity, Adams said. Your degree of fitness can greatly affect your performance in the heat. “If you are new to running, it will be much harder to perform and regulate body temperature in warmer temperatures,” he said. “Allow yourself to get in better shape before expecting more heat tolerance. That means preparing for the heat starts before the run, with a proper hydration strategy.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Every week, we round up the most hilarious quips from parents on the social media platform to spread the joy. Scroll down to read the latest batch, and follow @HuffPostParents for more! Being a mom is so weird because other kids can sense it and they'll just randomly hand you a piece of trash. My 6yo doesn't want to go to the park because he's tired of wearing sun scream I realized that my dear sweet daughter thought having your period is a *choice* and now she’s crying because I informed her it is not My 3yo just told me, wrathfully, \"Well, if you won't play with me then I'm gonna take a NAP on the COUCH!\" Ooooh. That'll show me. My kids come up with all these cute and silly names for their made up games for instance the dancing competition on the trampoline is called the tramp dance Heard another dad at the park refer to the approaching ice cream truck as the music truck. His kid didn’t make one mention of ice cream, just said “oh cool, I love the music truck!” I was stunned. Absolutely brilliant. My 13yo told me we're never truly alone, because we're always carrying 2 1/2 pounds of fungi, bacteria, and mites on our bodies at all times. And I've never wanted to forget something so badly before in my life. Today will go down in family history as she day my mother forgot her reading glasses and began showing my four year old The Aristocrats, instead of The Aristocats. no one: not a soul: my daughter: if I ever get rich I'm going to buy a family crypt for all of us because we don't want random dead people buried around us When little kids play baby dolls nowadays, do they tuck dolly into the cradle with blankie, or do they dress her in a sleep sack and put her in an empty crib, drowsy but awake? “Where the hell have I been?” -my infant waking up from a nap probably Wow ok when I said my teen eats everything I was exaggerating... pic.twitter.com/11vYzPemZO Wellness experts: Get plenty of rest, eat whole foods while sitting down, focus on fruits and vegetables, get rid of stress in your life Me, standing at my kitchen counter mainlining chocolate marshmallow ice cream after another sleepless night with the baby: Sounds good My son asked me if we could do the Irish goodbye at his class party so I bumped him up in the will. When you get overstimulated by your kids just go outside, take a few deep breaths, and run as fast as you can and just never go back. Me and my son are the only ones home tonight and he talked to me for 2 straight hours until I said \"Hey bud I just need a half an hour to do a little bit of work,\" and he said sympathetically \"I bet,\" then continued talking to me for another 2 hours. Things that now seem obvious but I did not consider before having kids: -you can’t just take an Uber -they are always in your house, even at night, you can’t leave -you cannot pee/shower alone, even if you lock the door, they’ll wait outside -must feed and water constantly none of my babies have ever really taken to a pacifier what is their problem???? I ruined my toddler’s life this morning. Yeah, I accidentally flushed the toilet for him, and before he got the chance to say goodbye to his poop. My kid does not eat eggs. This has been established for years. But she picked out a bluey cookbook at her book fair. It has a omelet recipe. So she made an omelet and she is sitting here eating it??? Because it’s a bluey omelet?? My 10yo daughter got in the car this afternoon and was like “workin hard or hardly workin” someone get this kid an honorary dad card. Dads be like: I’m really proud you’re getting your own place. It’s now time we have the talk. Dewalt and Ryobi and others all have an exclusive battery system and you’ll want to just commit to one… If you want to hide something from your kids, put it in the laundry basket under the clean laundry. my 13yo stepdaughter just said, \"remember when the night before vacation you would have all the suitcases packed and in the car and the house totally clean and we would wake up and you'd have breakfast ready for me and we'd leave? but now we have extra children.\" By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Parenting reporter If you’re not a parent or in a job where you’re talking to kids every day, finding yourself face-to-face with a child can feel unnerving. What are you supposed to say to them? Do they even speak the same language? You don’t need any experience in parenting or teaching to make a positive connection with a kid in your life. You, too, were a child once upon a time, and if you can tap into those memories and find some common ground, you’ll be able to hold a real conversation with the next kid who pops up beside you at a wedding, family reunion or your coworker’s desk. We asked a couple of people who are experts in talking to kids about their tips for making conversation. Literally, that is. If you’re standing, try coming down into a squatting or kneeling position so you’re both comfortably at eye level. This can help put a child at ease. “Sometimes we can forget the impact that we have on a young person,” said Mitru Ciarlante, senior director of youth safety and well-being at Big Brothers Big Sisters of America , a program that matches young people with mentors. It’s important to remember “how powerful the adult appears from the child’s point of view,” Ciarlante told HuffPost. Addressing children by name is another way to show care and respect; to instill trust with them, you can have someone they know, such as a parent, introduce you. In addition to listening carefully to their words, look at what a child is telling you nonverbally. These “nonverbal communication cues” might include “facial expressions, pointing, gestures and body language,” Alisha Simpson-Watt, a social worker and clinical director of Collaborative ABA Services , told HuffPost. You’ll also want to keep in mind what your own body language is communicating. Try to keep it relaxed, and make sure to give the child appropriate personal space. “If any type of boundary crossing happens too early, the young person is very likely to just freeze up and shut down right from that point on,” Ciarlante said. It’s important to keep reading the child’s cues throughout your conversation. While leaning in to listen and making eye contact are often recommended strategies, they might make some young people uncomfortable. “Try to really pay attention to the young person’s reactions and moderate your responses based on that,” Ciarlante said. “Sometimes we kind of forget how anxious children can be in those kinds of situations with a new person.” If you’re uncertain whether a goodbye hug is warranted, ask the child to choose: hug, high-five or handshake. This strategy maintains their autonomy and doesn’t force you to make assumptions. Sometimes kids need a minute to think, or just consider whether or not they want to tell you something. “Children need time to process what is being said to them, so when you are talking to a child, be patient and give them time to respond,” Simpson-Watt said. Another thing to avoid is throwing too many questions at them at once. “That can feel like more of an interrogation,” Ciarlante said. Instead, she recommended that you begin by sharing something about who you are (“I’m your cousin Kevin’s wife”) or starting from a shared experience (“I think the cake looks delicious. What’s your favorite dessert?”). No, there’s not some special “kid-speak” that you need to learn in order to make yourself understood. But you’ll still need to choose your words with your audience in mind. In general, fewer words are better. “Use clear and concise language,” Simpson-Watt said. “Use words that are age-appropriate and not putting anyone down to create a positive and safe space for the child.” In terms of topics, try to think of something that could interest them but won’t likely be triggering. You could say, “I went to the beach last week and found a starfish. What do you like to do at the beach?” or “Have you seen the new Spider-Man movie? Which Spider-Man would you want to be?” A child probably doesn’t want to hear a detailed description of what you do for a living or your investment portfolio. Instead, try asking “their favorite color, favorite TV show, favorite superhero, do they have any pets and what do they like to do when it’s sunny outside,” Simpson-Watt suggested. It’s always a good idea to try open-ended questions so you don’t get stuck in a conversational rut of yes-or-no responses. When they do respond, listen attentively and show your interest with nods, smiles and your tone of voice. Ask follow-up questions, such as which character on a show is their favorite. “Build on what the child is interested in,” Simpson-Watt said. Also, be careful not to interrupt them while they’re talking. If you have some lead time before meeting the child, ask what their interests are and what activities they enjoy. If you’ll be caring for them, you might want to plan around a preferred activity, such as baking, painting or walking the dog. Puzzles and games work, too. Side-by-side activities like these offer great opportunities to build relationships. Even a small gesture to show that you are thinking about them, such as printing out coloring sheets with characters they love, can show a child you care and provide an opening for conversation. At the end of the day, kids — just like adults — appreciate and respect when you are being your authentic self. There’s no need to try on a completely new personality just because you’ve been called on to babysit. Just be thoughtful, pay attention and follow the child’s lead as to what makes them comfortable. “Children and teens are definitely people who want to be treated with respect and authenticity,” Ciarlante said.

    "article_content": "Parenting reporter School is out, and the sun is blazing. This is great news for kids who are ready for days filled with popsicles and sprinklers, as well as for parents who are eager to send their kids outside to play. But when the temperature rises, kids are more susceptible to the harmful effects of the heat. It’s important for parents to recognize the signs that a child is getting overheated and to take measures to keep kids safe. Heatstroke is clinically diagnosed when your body reaches a temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) or higher. At these temperatures, organ damage can occur. Your body will actually stop sweating when it gets this hot, so you lose an important cooling mechanism. Your central nervous system is affected, causing symptoms such as confusion, delirium and seizures. “Heatstroke is a severe, life-threatening condition,” Dr. Jen Trachtenberg , a pediatrician in New York, told HuffPost. It requires emergency medical attention. Children are particularly vulnerable to overheating. “When you’re smaller, you have a smaller volume of blood, and so you are much more likely to get dehydrated,” said Dr. Janine Zee-Cheng , a pediatrician in Indiana. In addition, kids’ skin is “a little more permeable to sweat and water loss,” making dehydration more likely, they said. Kids also “may take longer to acclimate and start sweating, which helps lower body temperature,” Trachtenberg said. If your child is running around outdoors on a hot day, it’s normal for them to sweat, get rosy-cheeked and feel thirsty. “Where you start to worry is if people are starting to complain of other things,” Zee-Cheng said, such as feeling like they are going to throw up. Symptoms that a child is getting dangerously overheated may include: Zee-Cheng said you can see these symptoms emerge in long-distance runners who begin to stumble or lose coordination in the heat. The symptoms may come on suddenly, they added. A person may not notice that they are beginning to feel unwell if their focus is elsewhere. “You don’t always recognize that you’re getting overheated,” Zee-Cheng said, and in many cases, “kids are great until they’re not.” Though an adult who begins to feel ill from the heat will likely seek out a shady spot to rest, a child may “want to keep playing and having fun and doing stuff,” they said. It can be hard to monitor signs of overheating in babies or pre-verbal children. Trachtenberg recommended that parents look out for “lethargy, irritability, crankiness, vomiting and rapid breathing or any unusual behaviors.” She emphasized that a baby should never be left in direct sunlight or a hot car. According to the organization Kids and Car Safety , there were 29 deaths of children left in hot cars in 2023. If a child becomes confused or loses consciousness, it’s time to call 911. For less serious symptoms of overheating, give the child water and help them cool down using ice packs and cold water. Zee-Cheng recommended pouring cool water on the back of their neck or center of their body, as opposed to their hands and feet, to help them cool off quickly. “If a parent is concerned and [the child] is showing worsening symptoms, even if out of the hot weather, and unable to cool with cold packs and drinking, [they] should seek medical care,” Trachtenberg said. When it comes to heatstroke, prevention is the best medicine. “The most important thing is going to be hydration and getting into the shade whenever possible,” Zee-Cheng said. The easiest way to make this happen is to take “lots of breaks,” they added. Trachtenberg recommended that kids: Camps are generally good at building in snack and water breaks that give kids a chance to cool off and prevent getting overheated, Zee-Cheng noted. In most cases, the drink of choice to keep kids hydrated is water, and, unless they’re doing intense exercise, like long-distance running, you don’t need to worry about replacing electrolytes. The exception to the water rule is babies. People often want to give babies water to help keep them cool, but babies can get all the hydration they need from breast milk or formula, and giving them water can actually be risky. With babies, Zee-Cheng explained, “you have that very, very small blood volume, and if you are diluting it with water, then your sodium level will drop, and that’s super dangerous.” The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no water for babies younger than 6 months, and just 1/2 to 1 cup of water a day for babies 6 to 12 months old.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost Childhood should be whimsical, nurturing and validating. But for many kids, this just isn’t the case. Some children have parents who may provide for their kids physically but don’t quite understand how to support their child emotionally or mentally. These types of parents are known in the therapy world as emotionally immature parents. “An emotionally immature parent is a parent who is unable to meet your emotional needs, either as a kid or an adult child,” said Aparna Sagaram , a licensed marriage and family therapist, and owner of Space to Reflect in Philadelphia. “They center themselves regardless of what’s going on in your life.” In other words, everything is about them, their emotional needs and what’s going on in their day, Sagaram explained. An emotionally immature parent often struggles to regulate their own emotions, said Jennifer Chaiken , a licensed marriage and family therapist, co-owner of The Therapy Group in Pennsylvania and co-host of ShrinkChicks podcast. Emotionally mature parents are the opposite: “They’re parents who are more able to emotionally engage with you,” said Chaiken. “They’re able to really recognize and understand, and also affirm your emotions without taking them personally, or trying to change how you feel.” Emotionally mature parents possess emotional intelligence, which allows them to navigate their emotions while communicating with their child in a way that’s effective and nurturing, added Chaiken. “That level of support, it allows the child to grow and give[s] them the space to be their true self, rather than kind of imposing their own desires on the child,” Chaiken said. Whether someone is an emotionally immature or emotionally mature parent has a lot to do with how they were raised. These behaviors were modeled for them, so it’s how they think they should handle situations with their children. “Often, parents who are emotionally immature tended to also grow up with emotionally immature parents. It gets passed down generations until we realize this is what’s going on and do the work to heal the wounds of having emotionally immature parents,” Chaiken said. Below, experts share the signs of an emotionally immature parent and how to cope if you have one (or are one). Emotionally immature parents don’t handle their emotions well. In fact, according to Sagaram, emotionally immature parents are known to vent to children about their adult problems. This could be anything from issues at work to problems in their marriage to financial difficulties. Emotionally immature parents tend to do this because of the hierarchy that exists in parent-child relationships, said Sagaram. “Parents who are not able to regulate themselves now turn to their kid because it feels safe, it feels comfortable, it feels like, ‘Oh, this is like a nonthreatening person that I can dump all my stuff on,’” Sagaram said. “If you’re a kid, and you’re hearing all these adult problems, you can imagine how chaotic that must feel,” said Sagaram, “But then you eventually learn how to deal with those emotions.” Often, this results in children shutting down emotionally or projecting onto other people, she stated. Additionally, it can make the child feel like they’re responsible for their parent’s moods and emotions. Another big sign is a dependence on their children for emotional support, according to Chaiken. “So, they may turn to their children for a level of validation and comfort and companionship ... the flow of care is off,” Chaiken added. Children can’t properly give their parents the support they need (and shouldn’t have to), so this leads to another problem. “Another characteristic is that they get mad at you for not being there for them in the way that they want,” added Sagaram. “So, oftentimes, emotionally immature parents expect you to know what it is that they want and need ... if you’re not able to do that, or you’re not able to support them in the way that they want to be supported, they get emotionally explosive with you.” Emotionally immature parents are “unable to recognize how their emotions may impact those around them,” noted Chaiken. These kinds of parents can struggle to understand their children’s feelings and needs, she said. Think about it: Someone who centers everything on themselves won’t be able to think about how a decision or conversation impacts you. If your parent refuses to respect your boundaries or has questionable boundaries of their own, it is a red flag. “That can go either way — they may set overly rigid boundaries or may, on the other end of the spectrum, be extremely lenient and have a really hard time finding the balance,” said Chaiken. What’s more, they also have a hard time with boundaries you set with them, noted Sagaram. For example, if you ask your mom to call before stopping by your house, she may become offended and continue stopping by unannounced. As you get older and work to set boundaries with an emotionally immature parent, you may notice that they use shame or guilt as a weapon, said Sagaram. This may sound like, “Oh, you never let me see my grandkids anymore” or “No one ever calls me back.” Additionally, emotionally immature parents often employ the silent treatment, Sagaram said. If they feel unhappy about your behavior, they avoid speaking to you instead of talking out the problem like an emotionally mature person. “And you’re left thinking that you did something wrong, even though it’s been a power struggle this entire time,” she noted. Oftentimes, when an emotionally immature parent has a rough day at work, they make it everyone’s problem — even though it has nothing at all to do with their kids or spouse. “It leads to emotional outbursts in the family ... they really don’t have the ability to regulate their emotions [and keep them] separate from their parenting,” Chaiken said. This can also lead to inconsistent behavior, she noted. For example, if your mom usually helped you with your math homework but had a rough day at work, she may explode when you ask for your regularly scheduled help. “So, they may have these unpredictable reactions to situations leading to a level of inconsistency in their parenting,” Chaiken said. “Another characteristic, they don’t respect your individuality ... when we think about healthy family systems, parents raise their kids to be individuals and a person outside of themselves,” explained Sagaram. “And you want to start that pretty early on.” Even when your kids are young and still dependent on you, you should work to encourage (and respect) their likes and dislikes. “So, eventually when they do become an adult, that transition is smoother,” Sagaram said. When you respect your child’s individuality, you see them as someone who has their own values, beliefs and boundaries, she added. “But, an emotionally immature parent is not able to do that.” If you recognize any of the behaviors above in your parents or caretakers, take a deep breath. According to Sagaram, the most important thing is recognizing this fact — it will help you feel less alone. “There’s a name for this type of parent, which means you’re clearly not alone in that, and I think that itself can feel really validating,” said Sagaram. You should also give yourself credit for simply being able to notice this: It isn’t easy to admit that your parents have faults. “I think it’s hard because sometimes people have a hard time admitting that maybe their parents didn’t do what they needed when they were a child,” said Chaiken. “But, I think both things can be true: Your parents did the best they could and, at the same time, they were also unable to give you what you needed as a child because they weren’t given what they needed as a child.” Chaiken said re-parenting is a huge part of healing; to do this, take notice of the things that you needed in your childhood but did not receive. This could be emotional support, an opportunity to voice your opinions or unconditional love. As you re-parent yourself, you can give these things to yourself. Additionally, social support is important, Chaiken said. “We don’t choose our parents, and you get the choice as an adult to build a family in your life of people who are able to give you support and the support that you really need,” she added. “I think that that’s a really important thing, to find people in your life who you feel like can give you that support,” she said. When it comes to your parents, Chaiken noted that it’s important to set clear and healthy boundaries around what you will and won’t accept from them. Emotional immaturity is a learned behavior that is likely something that’s been in your bloodline for generations. “The fact that you want to do something different itself is breaking a cycle, so that is always a really great first step,” said Sagaram. Your ability to recognize your behavior is emotional maturity in itself, Chaiken added. To combat this behavior, Sagaram said it’s important to be self-aware and to take notice of your triggers — what makes you fall into emotional immaturity? “I definitely recommend professional help here because this is not an easy thing to do,” noted Sagaram. A therapist can help you learn to self-soothe, create an emotionally supportive community so you don’t feel like you have to rely on your child and heal the wounds that likely will emerge from your own childhood.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost When it comes to restaurant staff, your first thoughts are probably of chefs, servers and bartenders. But there’s one major player that you’re probably forgetting about — the restaurant host. The host is the person you first see when you walk into an eatery, the one who answers your calls and works to solve any last-minute reservation changes. “I don’t expect people to have an in-depth knowledge of how a restaurant operates — and the host, the maître d’, is kind of like the conductor of a big symphony, and people aren’t privy to that,” said Patrick Murphy, the director of hospitality and partner at Rootstalk and Radicato in Breckenridge, Colorado. The role of the host is demanding yet oft-overlooked, Murphy added. “There’s a lot of vectors of information coming your way ... there’s a good amount of pressure to make sure that people are getting their tables,” said Murphy. “And, oftentimes, people think that person at the front door is sort of the low man on the totem pole, or someone that can kind of be pushed around ... people think that they can kind of bully those people to get their way, and I think that that can be really challenging.” When it comes to challenging, difficult and downright rude interactions, there are certain situations and phrases that really irk hosts. Below, restaurant hosts and front-of-house staff share the rudest things people do and say to them at a restaurant: If you’ve ever skipped over the greeting pleasantries when walking into a restaurant, you’re being pretty rude. “When someone walks in ... [the host says], ‘Hi, good evening, how are you tonight?’ and there’s no reciprocation or response, it’s just, ‘We have a reservation,’” Murphy said. It’s a simple thing to reply with a greeting like, “Hi, I’m doing well” or “Hi, how are you?” and when you don’t do that, it can be off-putting for the host, said Murphy. “They just kind of breezed by the most basic human interaction, which is a simple hello, a smile, a greeting, an acknowledgement that you are a person and you’re doing a job and that you value that first interaction at a restaurant,” he said. “I think that one is probably the one that is most persistent,” Murphy stated. If you’re on the waitlist for a walk-in table but not paying attention to incoming calls or texts from the restaurant, you’re adding stress to the host’s day. Hannah Brown, a host in New Jersey, said that sometimes people won’t reply to a waitlist notification at all, or will take too much time to reply — resulting in the restaurant giving up their table. This leaves the restaurant in a tough spot if the person does decide to show up since there are likely other people on that waitlist, too. “So, just not having any urgency to respond when we’re trying to communicate with them,” Brown stated. “One of the things is showing up with more people in your party than you’ve reserved for,” said Brown, “that happens pretty often.” “And then we kind of have to scramble to accommodate,” she added. If you do need to bring an extra person, let the restaurant know ahead of time, Murphy said. “Because walking into the front door and being like, ‘Oh, we’re five instead of four’ changes the entire landscape of what kind of table we can offer you,” Murphy noted. The same goes for requesting a specific table, Murphy said. If you’re a party of two, you can’t just request a table for four when you get to the restaurant. If you want a certain spot, this should also be communicated ahead of time, too. Similar to showing up with more people than you reserved for, having extra people join your table during your meal is bothersome, too. “When people have other friends or family join them halfway through the meal and add to a table that doesn’t accommodate that many people ... it affects diners around them,” Brown said. Think about it: You’re trying to enjoy a night out as the table next to you adds chairs to their table, making your corner of the restaurant inappropriately packed. If you are having more folks meet you during your meal, let the host know. This way, if they can accommodate the extra guests, they can seat you somewhere with the extra folks in mind. Otherwise it causes “unnecessary stress for everybody,” Brown said. This goes for bringing a newborn or infant, too, Murphy said. Just because your baby isn’t eating a meal doesn’t mean the restaurant doesn’t want to know they’re coming — they may set you up with a little more space for their carrier or set up an area with a high chair. “For me, it’s just, kind of a safety thing for the kiddo, I don’t want to put a 10-week-old baby in one of the main walkways of the dining room,” Murphy said, adding that there’s lots of foot traffic, hot food and trays of drinks in certain areas, too. Restaurants take walk-ins when they can, but, oftentimes tables may be fully booked (even when they’re empty), said Murphy. And, in that case, there is one thing you shouldn’t do. “You come in and it’s a fairly empty restaurant — it’s early in the night, let’s say, and I have to tell you, ‘Oh, no, we don’t we don’t have a lot of space right now,’ and someone’s looking around the room and like, ‘Well, what about this table?’” Murphy said. In other words, just because it’s 5 p.m. and there are empty tables doesn’t mean there are no reservations for those seats — “there’s other people who have reservations,” he said. “That is a little rude and kind of lacks some understanding that while the restaurant may appear empty at the moment, in a half an hour or an hour, it will be full,” Murphy stated, “And we have to save those tables for people who have reservations with us.” According to Brown, when folks are unhappy with the wait time for a table, they’ll sometimes insist that they can quickly eat and don’t need much time at a table, in hopes of getting squeezed in faster. They try to “convince you insistently” that you should give them a table sooner because they can quickly eat, Brown said. The good news is people aren’t very rude too often, Brown noted, but it’s important to know that even a one-off decision to bring an extra person or neglect to reply to a waitlist text can be stressful for hosts. “Just understanding that we’re people at work ... hospitality is something that we love and take a lot of pride in, and just understanding that we are people, too,” Murphy said. “When someone is genuinely interested, or kind or understanding ... it opens up that realm and allows us to connect with you on a level,” Murphy added. When dealing with rude guests, Murphy said he always reminds himself that he doesn’t know what is going on in that person’s life or if they traveled far to get to their dinner reservation. “And that’s why they come off as terse or rude, and so that’s how we handle those situations,” he said, “there’s just empathy and grace and understanding that people have lives and we don’t really know what’s going on with people.” So, as restaurant staff do their best to see the humanity in people, diners should do the same by respecting rules, being polite, communicating any changes and remembering that hosts are people at a job, just like you and me.

    "article_content": "Parenting reporter When my youngest child was a toddler, I remember learning that a colleague, who also had a small child, was training for a marathon. “But... how?” I wondered. Between full-time work and parenting, just getting dinner on the table in those days required Herculean effort. The idea of adding regular exercise to my schedule felt as distant as another planet. I eventually found out that my colleague had a secret weapon: A live-in grandmother, available to provide childcare at a moment’s notice. The support of a grandparent can make a huge difference to a mother’s well-being, even when they’re not living under the same roof. In a study published this year of over 400,000 Finnish mothers of children 12 and under, researchers found that when grandparents were available, mothers were less likely to fill prescriptions for antidepressants. “ We found that these mothers are less likely to purchase antidepressants if their own parents are younger than 70, employed and do not have severe health problems,” Niina Metsä-Simola, a professor at the University of Helsinki and a lead researcher on the study, told HuffPost. Women whose own parents were still living together, or who lived in proximity to any of their children’s grandparents, were also less likely to use antidepressants. Of course, not everyone who has depression seeks treatment, and not everyone with a diagnosis of depression takes medication for it. Numbers of prescriptions are just one way to estimate the prevalence of depression in a population. Maternal grandparents were more likely to have a positive impact than paternal ones. This was not a surprise to researchers, Metsä-Simola said. “It is well-known from previous studies that maternal grandparents, particularly the maternal grandmother, provide more support and are more involved in the lives of their grandchildren as compared to paternal grandparents.” Another study published this year, for example, found that maternal grandmothers invested in their grandchildren’s lives can protect them from the negative impact of experiencing multiple traumatic events. Metsä-Simola and her co-authors found that grandparents seemed to have even more of an impact on mothers who were separating from their partners. “Differences in maternal depression by grandparental characteristics were larger among separating than non-separating mothers, particularly during the years before separation,” Metsä-Simola said. The study didn’t track what kinds of assistance, specifically, that the mothers were receiving from grandparents, but grandparents often provide childcare or financial support. Several factors affect the likelihood that grandparents are able to help: age, employment and health status. “Our findings suggest that grandparental characteristics associated with increased potential for providing support and decreased need of receiving support predict a lower likelihood of maternal depression, particularly among mothers about to separate,” Metsä-Simola said. Finland, where the study took place, offers significantly more support to parents than the U.S. Kela, the Finnish social insurance institution, provides new parents with 320 days of paid parental leave to divide between them. In addition, families all receive a “ child benefit ” check — the amount determined by the number of children they have — every month until a child turns 17. Since the study was conducted in a place that assists parents with money and childcare, the impact of grandparents’ support may go beyond that. “The findings suggest that support exchanges across generations matter for maternal depression, even in the context of a Nordic welfare state,” Metsä-Simola said. While this study was limited to the effects of grandparents’ support on mothers, we can be fairly certain that those benefits extended to children as well, since we know that kids do better when their moms are not depressed. “The association between maternal depression and adverse child outcomes is well-established,” Metsä-Simola said. A grandparent’s support can begin upon a baby’s arrival. “Grandparents who have a strong relationship with their children are uniquely positioned to offer invaluable support during the fragile post-birth period,” Princess McKinney-Kirk, a postpartum doula and the author of a book about postpartum belly-binding, told HuffPost. “Isolation and lack of support is one of the biggest precursors for postpartum depression,” she said, noting that traditional postpartum care rituals from around the world provide precisely that kind of support. In its absence, or in the absence of sufficient nutrition or sleep, new parents are more likely to experience problems such as “brain fog, anxiety, baby blues, mood disorders, and prolonged recovery,” McKinney-Kirk said. “Oftentimes grandparents bring a deeper layer of connection and comfort for a new mom,” McKinney-Kirk said. “Their involvement can significantly enhance the well-being of both the mother and the newborn, providing crucial support that fosters a healthy mother-baby relationship.” In addition to offering words of encouragement and “gentle guidance (when asked),” she suggested the following ways for grandparents to offer postpartum support to new parents: Cook favorite meals and freeze during your visit, or give gift cards to restaurants or meal delivery services (not the ones that require cooking) Do chores like folding laundry, washing dishes, or taking out the trash. Provide childcare for older siblings. Offer to hold the baby so that a parent can take a shower or eat a meal with two hands. Pay for the parent to receive recovery care, perhaps from a lactation counselor, physical therapist, acupuncturist, chiropractor or psychologist. McKinney-Kirk emphasized that part of caring for a new baby means caring for the person who has just given birth.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost I was settling in for an interview over Zoom when I glanced at my baby monitor and saw it: the unmistakable wiggle of a toddler who’d pooped himself awake from a nap. I sighed and set the monitor aside. I had no choice but to wait till after the call to check on him. When the Zoom ended, I dashed in to clean him up, then texted my friend a photo of the three of us (my baby, myself and my laptop). “Look at me,” I wrote wryly. “I have it all.” I started thinking a lot about “having it all” after my son was born in late 2021. I went back to work after four months of parental leave, breast-pumping my way through phone calls and changing diapers on the sly. I loved being close to my son and was lucky to have a husband who thrived as a stay-at-home dad, but it was all so completely exhausting. For every stolen midday snuggle there was sobbing (on both sides of the door) when I had to close my eyes and tune out my son’s cries for Mommy as I buckled down to get a project done. Surely, I often thought to myself, this isn’t what Helen Gurley Brown had in mind when she published “Having It All,” her famed book of advice on balancing sex, work, relationships and more, in 1982. I may have a career and a family, but I often “have it all” — or, rather, do it all — at the exact same time. In the summer of 2012, just a couple of years into my journalism career, The Atlantic published Anne-Marie Slaughter’s culture-defining text, “ Why Women Still Can’t Have It All .” In it, she described stepping back from powerful government work to be closer to home and more available to her two teenage sons, and she outlined the workplace changes she saw as necessary to allow ambitious women to pursue big careers and remain present mothers. I read it hungrily, feeling smug about my own ambivalence toward motherhood. At 25, I was climbing the career ladder fast and loving it. Why derail the train with a baby when the ride was so exciting? Plus, I couldn’t imagine a world where Slaughter’s proposed changes — more flexible schedules, remote work, less business travel, teleconferencing instead of in-person meetings — would materialize. Little did I know a global pandemic would abruptly shift that tide. A decade later, in a post-COVID world, I had, in many ways, exactly what Slaughter had described: an exciting career with a flexible, remote job that allowed me to be close to the baby I’d decided I wanted. But I also had a hefty dose of burnout. For me, it was all too much — the constant doing it all. And I was losing my ambition as a result. I’m not the first millennial mom with an office job to feel this way. Between lazy girl jobs , the death of the girlboss and the countless ambitious women who’ve written about losing their drive in recent years , the collapse of millennial women’s ambition is well-documented. Heck, we now even have the millennial mom midlife crisis . But it’s no wonder: Millennial moms work more than previous generations of mothers , and we spend more time parenting our kids , plus our parents can’t or don’t want to help us out (or need care themselves). And then there’s the astronomical cost of child care. We are at capacity all the time, even with the trappings of professional flexibility. I decided to ask Anne-Marie Slaughter what comes next. Slaughter acknowledged that we’ve made strides toward her envisioned workplace, but we’re not there yet. “We’ve transitioned the where we can work, and we have the flexibility — so now, if your kid is sick or you have a teacher’s conference or you need to take a parent to a doctor’s appointment, you have the flexibility to do that,” she said. But we haven’t reached the place where professional and personal ambition can coexist. Aside from major structural changes we know are needed to support families — such as 12 months of parental leave, plentiful and affordable child care, free pre-kindergarten and well-funded public schools — there is one big thing that needs to change in the workplace, according to Slaughter: management practices. Face time is still the reigning tool for performance measurement, and that disadvantages anyone working remotely. “If you’re in the office and that other person is in the office, you are still going to have a better sense that they are working than the person who is not [in the office],” she said. “I’ve said for a long time, to really make this work, you have to have much more objective and precise management practices, and that takes more work. I don’t think we’re there yet.” Indeed, McKinsey’s Women in the Workforce reports from both 2022 and 2023 found that women in leadership are leaving their roles in record numbers, in part because their labor isn’t being recognized by their superiors. They’re taking on diversity, equity and inclusion work or heading up employee resource groups in addition to their full-time roles, for example, but it’s not being counted toward their overall performance, and they’re working remotely (often to juggle family responsibilities), which is being counted against them. “They are looking for the ability to advance. They are looking for flexibility and choice in terms of where, when and how they work. They are looking for companies that authentically prioritize DE&I. They are looking for people who are backing their careers,” said McKinsey senior partner Lareina Yee in a podcast about the 2022 report . But, quite frankly, she said, “companies haven’t stepped up.” Beyond changes in performance evaluation and management, Slaughter also advocates for what she described in her Atlantic article as “investment intervals,” the idea that you grind hard in certain periods of your work life ― early in your career before you have kids, for example ― and then make different choices as your career moves forward, including saying no to promotions that won’t work for your family life or taking time off from full-time work to consult, take a sabbatical or accept project-based work. Then when your kids are grown, you can lean back in and keep rising. In my view, when it comes to frazzled millennial moms, a wholesale shift in the way we understand and reward professional ambition is due. Forget this idea that moving up, down, back or sideways in your career is a sign that you’re not committed. Instead, we must think of ambition as a tide — sometimes rolling in, sometimes rolling out, always doing its part. Under this rubric, millennial moms aren’t losing their ambition, they’re simply moving with the tide, and there’s no reason to feel ashamed about that. We shouldn’t be sent back to square one in our careers simply because the tide of our ambition went out while our children needed us most. Slaughter said that taking a break to have kids or to work on professional development isn’t the kiss of death that it used to be, but “there are still plenty of workplaces where, if you get knocked off that straight-up path, it’s going to be very, very hard to get back on. I can see it changing; it just hasn’t changed yet.” At her company, New America , Slaughter said she’s found that a flexible and supportive culture, which includes hybrid work, paid parental leave and a “family comes first” mantra, has ensured the work always gets done without sacrificing people’s personal lives and has also helped more junior staff find opportunities to rise and be seen. Parental leave, for example, “creates opportunities for other people, younger people, other members of the team” to step in and work with Slaughter and other senior staff who they might not have otherwise crossed paths with directly. “It builds resilience in the workplace.” Slaughter sees millennial and Gen Z workers rejecting the old hustle-culture model and applauds it, but also notes that many of us aren’t sure where to go from here. “There’s a sense that the world that we knew is coming apart in many ways, and people are not sure what they should be wanting,” she said. “But they know that the traditional whatever it was that was going to make you happy is not likely to.” That said, she thinks the idea of striving to be a “whole, healthy person” is a move in the right direction. “By whole, I really do mean having different dimensions to your life. That could be work and family, that could be sports, hobbies, friendships.” She doesn’t even use the phrase “having it all” anymore. “The whole framing makes me uncomfortable, even though that is the phrase I grew up with that meant having a career and a family,” she said. “There’s a hyper-capitalist dimension to it” that runs counter to the way most millennials and Gen Zers think about their lives. It’s time we tossed it for good and focused on building workplaces that support the multidimensional lives of all workers. As for our millennial mom midlife crises and waning ambition? Slaughter advises us all to hang in there. “It is a life passage that many, many, many people go through. We are maturing into our fuller selves who realize that there’s more to life and there’s more to ambition. I have plenty of ambition. It’s just not expressed in the way that it once was, to climb to the top of a particular ladder.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Parenting reporter It’s every parent’s worst nightmare: You turn your back on your child for just a moment to do something completely mundane, and when you look again, they’re gone. Parents are advised to trust their guts when it comes to safety matters, but the truth is that gut reactions are often based on the size of a person’s fears rather than the size of the threat. Leslie Dobson, whose personal website identifies her as a clinical and forensic psychologist, posted a TikTok recently that fanned the flames of parents’ fears. In a video that has now been viewed over 11 million times, she explains why she doesn’t return her cart when she goes grocery shopping with her kids. “I’m not returning my shopping cart and you can judge me all you want,” Dobson says in the video, filmed with her sitting in the driver’s seat. “I’m not getting my groceries into my car, getting my children into the car, and then leaving them in the car to go return the cart. So if you’re gonna give me a dirty look — fuck off.” Over 100,000 users have commented on the video. Many criticized Dobson for what they see as poor shopping cart etiquette and simply rude behavior. “It was never about the shopping cart. It’s about the principle. It’s about answering the question: Am I willing to take some time out of my day to do something nice for nothing in return?” wrote user AresArchdemon. Plenty of mothers explained how they resolve the issue either with strategic parking or by bringing their kids with them to return the cart. “Either take the kid with you to return it or lock your doors for the 20 seconds your gone. Oh or park beside a cart return. I have 4 kids & return mine,” wrote user Jessica Cabe. “Bring your kids with you to return the shopping cart after loading the groceries into the car ✨ i have two young babies and ALWAYS return my cart OR even park right next to the cart return 🤦♀️” wrote user Jess 🦋✨🤍. While, as Dobson predicted, the comments were heavy on judgment — “I’m going to raise a child who always puts the cart back” — few addressed the fear at the root of Dobson’s choice. In a follow-up video posted May 31, Dobson defends her decision, this time backing it up with some data: “I wanna give you some statistics. Last year 265 children were abducted in parking lots in America. Half of those were sexually assaulted.” She continues, stating that a “single mom” returning a shopping cart is “prime” for a predator and mentioning that, in a lot of states, it’s illegal to leave your car running if you aren’t inside it. The 265 figure comes from a fact sheet published by an organization called Kids and Car Safety . But what the organization was tracking was not people setting out to kidnap children: It’s the number of children who were inside cars when the cars were stolen. Car thieves typically abandoned the car once they realized a child was present, or removed the child from the car. Obviously, this is another variety of parental nightmare, but it isn’t the kind of child abduction that Dobson seems to be referencing. It is unclear where her claim of half of these cases involving sexual assaults comes from; HuffPost could find no mention of sexual assault on the Kids and Car Safety website. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children analyzes data from the reports of missing children that it collects. “Nonfamily abductions are the rarest type of case and make up only 1% of the missing children cases reported to NCMEC,” its website states. Nonfamily is defined as “someone known, but not related, to the child, such as a neighbor or an online acquaintance, or by someone unknown to the child.” NCMEC has tracked a number of unintentional abductions that occurred during carjackings. In a report analyzing nonfamily abductions, NCMEC says there were 366 cases during the four-year period from 2016 to 2020. Seventy-three of these 366 were motivated by an attempt to steal a car. NCMEC refers to these cases as a “co-ocurring crime” in which the abductor’s goal was to steal a car, not to kidnap a child. The report highlights one such case: “A 1-year-old Black male child who was left in a running car at a gas station while the mother went inside to pay. During her absence, a stranger got into the car and drove it away. There was a cell phone left in the vehicle which allowed investigators to track signal information from the carrier. An AMBER alert was issued that included a description of the stolen vehicle. A resident called 911 after they saw the vehicle. The child was recovered within an hour and less than 5 miles from the abduction location.” In a 2021 blog post by Patricia Davis on the NCMEC website, Davis cites a statistic of 40 children abducted in cars during vehicle threats in which an AMBER alert was issued “since the beginning of the pandemic.” She states that this is probably an undercount, since police say in many cases an alert isn’t issued. She also explains that thieves generally abandon the car, or the child, once they realize the child is present. None of the NCMEC communications mention the return of a grocery cart, but they do support Dobson’s reluctance to leave her kids alone in the car — even if the risk comes from car thieves, not child abductors, and is relatively small. Davis quotes NCMEC President and CEO John F. Clark: “Please, never leave your child alone in your car, not even for a few seconds, not even if you have them in your sight.” In a subsequent video posted June 4, Dobson addressed the fact that most commenters have been critical, saying, “I’ve received probably, I don’t know, two- or three-thousand messages saying that people would post comments that they would not return the shopping cart because of safety, but they’re too scared of the attacks they’ll get on social media.” She encourages viewers to “empower” themselves and “choose you” if they are in a situation where they feel their safety is at stake. Jodi Smith , an etiquette consultant at Mannersmith, told HuffPost, “In general, it is the shopper’s responsibility to return the cart to the store, to a corral, or a place in the parking lot where it is not in traffic or blocking a spot.” However, she continued, her motto is “manners matter, but safety first.” “It simply is not safe to leave young children unattended in a car for many reasons. Parking next to the corral is the ideal situation, but not always possible. The next best option is to leave the cart in a place in the parking lot where it is not in traffic or blocking a spot,” Smith said. She noted that parents of young children aren’t the only ones unable to return a cart. Doing so can also be a challenge for people with mobility issues, or for people who are assisting someone with a disability. Smith observed that “this is a classic example of how the American culture holds the caretakers of young children to impossible standards. They are criticized for not returning a cart or they are demonized for leaving young children in a car unattended ... literally a no-win situation.” She also suggested that an observer might offer to return a mother’s cart to the store for her. “Look for ways to help,” Smith said. “Be part of the solution.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Parenting reporter Dad jokes, dad bod, dad ... brain? A new study adds to a growing body of evidence that birth mothers aren’t the only ones who undergo neurological developments after a child’s arrival. Dads’ brains change too — and it appears that these changes have an impact on their sleep and mental health. Curtis Davis, a university professor, is the father of toddler twins who were born during the pandemic. He told HuffPost that the work of caring for them has been intense. “[My wife and I] have careers, too, that could be demanding,” he said. “If there’s a gender norm or gender expectation, I kind of threw it out the window.” When it comes to allocating the work of parenting, “it’s really about whoever gets to it,” Davis said. “If I recognize there’s something that needs to be handled, I just jump in.” Davis does feel the weight of all this responsibility, both on his psyche and his sleep patterns. His job provides the children’s health coverage, and “there’s definitely some anxiety that comes with that,” he said. He finds himself “being on pins and needles a little bit more,” he said. “The stress is definitely there.” The highs of hands-on parenting, too, are significant. Davis and other dads reap great fulfillment from caring for their children. Darby Saxbe , a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California, has conducted multiple studies using MRI scans to measure changes in the brains of men who became fathers. Saxbe and her fellow researchers found that fathers lost brain volume — their brains grew smaller — after they became parents. This shrinking of grey matter is similar to what other studies have found in women who became mothers, although the loss is less pronounced in fathers. It’s important to note that a loss of brain volume, which sounds negative, doesn’t correspond with a loss of brain function, or of cognitive decline. It does mean that the brain has changed to adapt to a new situation: parenthood. Researchers have theorized that the loss of gray matter might represent a pruning of synapses, or connections in the brain, streamlining the way the brain works and making it more efficient. In a subsequent study published in April 2024 , Saxbe and her co-authors took images of 38 first-time dads’ brains while their partners were pregnant and when the babies were six months old. They also had the fathers answer questions about their involvement in parenting and their own well-being at three, six and twelve months after the child’s birth. Again, they observed the loss of brain volume found in previous studies. Fathers lost an average of 1% of their gray matter after becoming parents. As in similar studies conducted on mothers, Saxbe and her colleagues found that fathers who were more involved in child care showed greater brain changes. Dads who reported stronger bonding with the baby (either before or after birth), planned to take more time off from work, reported less parenting stress or spent more time with their babies experienced a larger loss in brain volume. Not all of the changes associated with brain volume loss were positive, however. In that 2024 study, Saxbe found that fathers who lost more brain volume were also more likely to report signs of anxiety, depression, psychological distress and poor sleep. Because researchers found that the volume loss preceded these mental health and sleep problems, it appears that the brain changes cause the problems, not the other way around — although Saxbe cautioned reading too much into one study. “This is preliminary research with small samples of parents,” Saxbe told HuffPost. “We really need to see more funding for studies of the parental brain so we can better understand plasticity during this critical and understudied life stage.” A loss in brain volume isn’t the only physiological change that dads who engage in caregiving undergo. The more parenting they do, the lower the levels of their testosterone dip . They also experience a rise in prolactin, a hormone involved in milk production, and in oxytocin , commonly known as the “love” or “connection” hormone. Oxytocin is what brings on labor, and is released when a person nurses a baby. Gestational mothers, too, experience lower levels of testosterone and higher levels of oxytocin and prolactin, among other hormonal changes. These shifting hormones are widely viewed to be one of the reasons that people who give birth are at an increased risk for depression and anxiety. Lee Gettler is a professor of anthropology at the University of Notre Dame who has published a number of studies about hormonal changes in fathers. He noted that while in most mammals, young are cared for primarily by the mother, there are plenty of other examples of fathers providing care in the animal kingdom, and they share a pattern of hormonal changes. “In other vertebrates that have evolved invested fatherhood, males often show declines in testosterone when they are cooperating with mothers to raise young,” Gettler told HuffPost. In a large longitudinal study conducted in the Philippines, Gettler and other researchers studied the testosterone levels of men throughout their 20s, all of whom were single non-fathers when the study began. “Men who became newly partnered new fathers experienced large biologically meaningful declines in their testosterone, while testosterone was relatively stable in men who remained single non-fathers,” Gettler said. Here, too, men who were more involved in parenting showed greater changes. “Fathers who spent the most time with their children and caring for them had lower testosterone than fathers who were not involved with care,” Gettler said. Using data from this same study, researchers also found higher levels of prolactin — the hormone that spurs milk production — in fathers than non-fathers. “Prolactin is commonly elevated in vertebrate fathers who help care for their young, suggesting it often helps support fathers’ care,” Gettler said. In subsequent studies, Gettler found that fathers who had lower testosterone and higher levels of cortisol (a stress hormone) after their baby’s birth were more likely to be involved in caregiving tasks 2-4 months later. “These findings also help show that dads’ biological responses to the transition to parenthood help prepare them for the demands of parenthood,” Gettler said. Gettler and co-authors also found that fathers’ oxytocin rose after first holding their newborns. “First-time fathers show especially large increases in oxytocin,” Gettler said, showing that “the biology of new dads is ‘online’ and ready to help them engage and bond with their babies from the outset.” Over time, Gettler and co-authors found, fathers who spent more time caregiving saw their testosterone levels continue to dip, while those who engaged less frequently in caregiving saw their testosterone levels rise again. Taken together, all of these findings suggest a bidirectional relationship between fathers’ hormone levels and their caregiving. Greater changes in hormone levels predicted more involvement in caregiving, and more involvement in caregiving corresponded with greater hormonal shifts. “Fathers have underlying physiology that can help support their engagement with their children from the beginning, and that can also respond to sensitive, nurturing father-child interactions,” Gettler said. Both Saxbe and Gettler believe that their research highlights the importance of giving fathers — as well as other non-birthing parents — opportunities to engage in caretaking. “This research highlights that anyone who devotes time to caring for a young child might show transformations in their brain or body. It helps underscore that great parents are ‘made, not born,’” Saxbe said. Encouraging this caregiving and bonding can benefit the whole family. “These changes in fathers’ physiology can help encourage caregiving and sensitivity, contributing to strong father-infant bonds and healthier family functioning,” Gettler said. “Paid leave for fathers when their babies are young can provide windows of time for these biological changes and positive interactions to come to their fullest expression.” The mental health vulnerabilities that Saxbe found in her research are not a reason to discourage paternal caregiving, she said. Rather, they highlight the stress that caregiving involves and how all new parents are in need of support. “It’s an important priority to support new parents’ well-being through policies that reduce stress and protect time in the first years after birth,” Saxbe said. “Comprehensive paid family leave, with some time specifically earmarked for dads, is one important step in the right direction,” she continued, noting that countries with generous leave policies, like Finland, have found that fathers are more likely to take leave when it is specifically designated for them. Tony Spatafora and his husband have “adopted and fostered many children over the past eight years” in their Los Angeles home. Spatafora told HuffPost, “I have matured in so many ways.” These psychological changes are accompanied by anxiety at times, Spatafora said. “There are no handbooks ... the pressure from figuring out if you’re doing the right thing in the moment is tough.” Spatafora works evenings as a bartender and his husband works during the day walking dogs. “Our schedules, and generous support network, allow us to be present for a lot of the time needed to care for our family,” Spatafora said. “The ability to be in the moment, watching their development and sharing all that they suffer/savor is genius. We are blessed to have these small things that many miss.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Kids may say the darndest things, but parents tweet about them in the funniest ways. Although Twitter has rebranded to X , the humor lives on. Every week, we round up the most hilarious quips from parents on the social media platform to spread the joy. Scroll down to read the latest batch, and follow @HuffPostParents for more! When my 4yo woke up, she said \"I'm so excited for my party today,\" and I have no idea what she's talking about. “Your daughter has been training the other children to cry on demand, seemingly in order to disrupt the class” is among the many things that parenting books have not prepared me for My 3yo: Mommy, I want more chicken leaves for lunch. That’s what she calls a chicken caesar salad. 💀 I showed my daughter A Bug’s Life for the first time recently and this is her god now pic.twitter.com/KJglXp2Jwv Kids always choose the best time to ask silly questions. You’d be out at a Baptism ceremony and your kid will ask “What does it mean when you do this?” as they hold up their middle finger. My oldest son informs me that it’s been three weeks since he graduated high school and he still hasn’t used trigonometry. it’s the baby’s birthday! i say happy birthday!!! he says “it feels so nice to be 6 again” 😃 what 😃 do 😃 you 😃 mean 😃 sir Yesterday was a day that will go down in infamy in our family as The Honey Incident: the 3 year old brought a FULL container of honey to her room, opened it, and the 1.5 year old spilled the whole thing and spread it all over the room. I will be reminding them of this until I DIE My kid transcribed something her teacher said in class today and is it giving it to her as a gift tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/Ebj3dekord It’s important to open your kids up to a variety of sports when they’re young. Soccer, baseball, death match wrestling their brother on the living room floor. All great options. [On a road trip] Kids: Oooh a Waffle House! Can we eat there?! Husband: Hard pass. I’ve seen y’all fight, and frankly, it’s not gonna cut it. End of school is wild. Just this week, my kid has brought home two notebooks I bought, four notebooks I didn’t, three water bottles, 18 art projects and the lost city of Atlantis. My 5yo only has two modes: loud and louder Have teenagers so you can wake up in the morning to a random trash can inside a trash bag sitting by the back door. why. [At a restaurant] Alright kids, what combination of starch and cheese are you gonna have this time If you have kids under the age of 6 and fun plans this summer, DO NOT tell them about the fun plans until you are literally arriving at the plans. Pulling up to the gate. Watching too many cooking shows like hold on kids, we need to let the chicken nuggets rest a few minutes I’m confident the inventor of the kazoo did not have children.

    "article_content": "On assignment for HuffPost This year, respiratory illnesses are on the rise, and our family has added to that count more than once. Well, most of our family. You see, I’m sick in bed — because my kid has coughed, sneezed and, oh yeah, vomited all over me. But my husband is completely fine, living his best healthy life out in the world, trying to locate his phone and food in the fridge. When our kid is sick, my husband’s parenting “fight or flight” response kicks in, and his usual can-do attitude vanishes, along with our much-needed stash of tissues. “Honey, can you get us a cold cloth?” I text my partner. My son’s fever is high, and my little guy has asked me to stay with him because his head hurts. After reading my husband’s response, I immediately reconsider the request. Maybe I should ask my mom (who lives 15 minutes away) to bring us a washcloth. I wouldn’t need to text her detailed instructions on how to make a cold cloth. Texting my partner with one hand, I comfort my crying son with the other. The sleep-deprived knot in my stomach won’t let me ignore the truth: I wish parenting felt more equal. Why isn’t taking care of our son when he’s sick more balanced between us? Slate reported that 74% of moms (versus 40% of dads) stay home when their kids get sick. Julie Spears , a licensed clinical social worker, told HuffPost that for many heteronormative couples, a “she-fault” situation can occur in the parenting dynamic. “Women are typically expected to be caregivers,” Spears said. Historically, girls have been expected to be caring and empathetic, gender socialization theorists say, while boys have typically been taught to inhibit these kinds of prosocial behaviors. Connecting these caregiving dots, we see how gender beliefs form in childhood and continue to influence our parenting in adulthood. “I wish parenting felt more equal. Why isn’t taking care of our son when he’s sick more balanced between us?” In many households, it’s the moms calling the pediatrician, cleaning up the vomit and attending to the needs of their feverish children. Supatra Tovar , a clinical psychologist, told HuffPost this pattern persists due to factors including implicit expectations and practical habits. “There may be unspoken assumptions (or expectations) that the mother should take on more caregiving duties,” Tovar said. Plus, some mamas take on more caregiving responsibilities from the start, and Tovar said this can form a lasting pattern. Any of this feel familiar? If the responsibility to care for your coughing kids is all yours, know that you are not alone. Linda P. from Aurora, Illinois, told HuffPost that taking care of her three children when they got sick fell to her because “I made less money than my kids’ dad, so the potential of losing my income would be less impactful than him losing his.” One 2012 study found that even if working mothers and fathers have similar access to paid sick days, mothers miss work more often to care for their kids. Choosing between your career and comforting your children when they’re ill isn’t a choice moms should face, but many do. “Men don’t feel empowered to take off work, and that’s a societal shift we need to work on,” Spears added. Amanda J., a mother of two from New Albany, Indiana, told HuffPost that looking after her sick littles was a job she wanted as a stay-at-home mom. But when her kids were 2 and 6.5, she started working outside the home again. Parenting duties became more equal, but her husband was easily overwhelmed and frustrated when caring for their sick kiddos. “I felt like it was my fault they (the kids) had to deal with it,” Amanda said. So she took over caregiving duties when she could to ease tensions. “The research tells us that moms generally worry more than dads, and this worry may push moms to stay home to care for a sick child even when it may make more sense for dad to stay home,” said Katie Smith, a licensed clinical and child psychologist who treats children, adolescents and families. Societal expectations, family habits and conflicting work schedules are a few reasons a mother’s workload can unfairly increase when kids are sick. And then, in some cases, it’s about “perceived caregiving competency” — as is the case in my family. “If the mother has historically been the one to handle most caregiving tasks, she might be viewed (by herself or her partner) as more adept at managing the children’s needs,” Tovar said. She added that for working mothers, the dual expectations and pressure to perform both as a professional and the primary caregiver can create potential mental health issues and feelings of resentment. But there is a way to make all this “nurturing” more equal between partners — or at least, there is a place to begin. “Working parents should be in frequent communication about the equity of shared parenting responsibilities,” Smith told HuffPost. “For many families, the model of a caregiver has always been Mom. But with communication, commitment and collaboration, this model can change.” It’s a good idea to have a plan in place before the kids get sick. “I think it’s a talk that needs to happen, and having that intentional proactive conversation about who’s on point for the week can help,” Spears added. When talking to your partner, clear communication about boundaries and expectations is crucial, Tovar said. Express your needs using “I” statements, and suggest practical, divided responsibilities so you can both see a clear plan of action. Smith added that moms and dads need to get more comfortable allowing and expecting dads to enter this role. From the beginning, I’ve been the go-to parent offering comfort to our little guy, so it’s no wonder the simplest caregiving instincts elude my husband. Awareness can break any pattern, so I think I’ll start small: This time, my text reads, “Honey, can you sit with him while I shower?” My husband peers around the doorway, and our 10-year-old smiles at his dad — giving my husband the little confidence boost he needs. For many families, the model of a caregiver has always been Mom. But with communication, commitment and collaboration, this model can change. In our 10 years of parenting together, it’s clear that my husband and I bring different parenting strengths to the table, but that doesn’t mean we can’t learn some new ones, too.

    "article_content": "Opinion Editor It’s been quite the week for white people in politics! So far we’ve had porn actress Stormy Daniels’ testimony of the alleged sexual encounter between her and former President Donald Trump , New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s blatantly racist comments about Black kids in the Bronx, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s brain worm , and House Speaker Mike Johnson’s useless integrity election proposal to prevent mythical undocumented immigrants from voting in elections. And it’s only Friday. Which brings me to the obvious question ― white politicians, are y’all OK? The train isn’t just off the tracks, it’s driving down the street like a regular car, and everyone’s acting like everything is just fine. And I say this even in a post-Trump, apocalyptic, dystopian nightmare where king-size M&M’s cost damn near $5 — it’s been a hell of a week. And we have all learned to accept that the new normal is anything but. Pre-Trump, this would’ve been a full month’s worth of news that would’ve included analysis, commentators from both sides of the aisle, flow charts and graphics. Now, it’s just a random week in May. Has anyone even looked to see if Mercury is in retrograde? Have you made wellness calls to your closest white politicians to see if in fact they are still of sound mind? It just seems that we all have learned to roll with the punches even when the punches include a dead worm in a presidential hopeful’s brain, and a porn actress spanking the former president’s butt with a rolled magazine. On Tuesday, Trump was back in court and was so flustered during Daniels’ testimony of their alleged sexual encounter that he began cursing loud enough for the judge to hear. According to The Washington Post , New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan called Trump’s defense attorney Todd Blanche for a sidebar on Trump’s foul language inability to sit still. “I understand that your client is upset at this point,” Merchan said, “but he is cursing audibly, and he is shaking his head visually, and that’s contemptuous. It has the potential to intimidate the witness, and the jury can see that.” Trump is on trial for reportedly adjusting financial records to cover up some $130,000 hush money payments to Daniels. Trump denies that the two ever had sex. Daniels apparently explained the encounter with a bit too much detail and the judge was like, “Please stop.” And none of this, not the trial, not the possible infidelity, not the possible payoff, not the lies, or the image of Daniels spanking the former president’s bottom with a rolled magazine (this reportedly happened during their encounter) has stopped Trump’s chances from possibly winning the White House. Because, America, are y’all OK? I wish the part of my brain that knew about Daniels and Trump’s affair was eaten away by a worm, which brings me to The New York Times story that claimed in 2010 that Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was having some health complications including memory loss and mental fog. During a divorce deposition some two years later, Kennedy noted that his health issues were “caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died.” Kennedy noted at the time that the whole “worm ate my brain and subsequently died” had decreased his earning potential, and rightfully so. And as if this news wasn’t wild enough, Kennedy, who is himself a spry 70-year-old, took to X (formerly Twitter) to send out this message: “I offer to eat 5 more brain worms and still beat President Trump and President Biden in a debate,” the post read. “I feel confident in the result even with a six-worm handicap.” It would be the kind of news to laugh at if this man wasn’t trying to run the country. Granted he’s got about the same chance of being president as I do of being the starting point guard for the Washington Wizards, but the fact that he’s being taken somewhat seriously, despite making Trump look like a Rhodes scholar, is white privilege. He doesn’t even have to explain his nonsensical diagnosis; he can make light of it. Because privilege doesn’t require evidence. Which is why Johnson and a bunch of Trump enthusiasts posing as congressmen took to the Capitol on Wednesday to introduce an “election integrity” bill. Despite no evidence of non-citizens voting in elections and laws already in place to prevent such a thing, Johnson is still grandstanding on this non-issue because well, he can. “We all know, intuitively, that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections,” Johnson said . “But it’s not been something that is easily provable. We don’t have that number. This legislation will allow us to do exactly that. It will prevent that from happening. And if someone tries to do it, it will now be unlawful within the states. We’ll have a mechanism to prove whether they are or not.” It’s all imaginary fear, trumped up (pun intended) to explain away whatever new vanity project that politicians want to push. It’s sleight of hand that’s so effective their constituents don’t even have to believe it’s magic, they’re just taking the word of the magician that whatever was in front of them has disappeared. Which leads to Hochul, you know the Democrat dressed in Republican clothing, who recently spoke at the Milken Institute Global Conference where at some point she opened her mouth to say: “Right now, we have young Black kids growing up in the Bronx who don’t even know what the word computer is. They don’t know, they don’t know these things.” Yep, you read that correctly. Mythical Bronx Black kids, who despite growing up in the age of smart electronics, are poorly underfunded and under cared for, and wander the streets of the big city dressed in clothes worn only by Huckleberry Finn begging for soup. It’s a common troupe used by white politicians when they want to make a point about the disparity between Black children and their white counterparts. And it’s almost always untrue. Hochul would apologize claiming that she misspoke. “Of course Black children in the Bronx know what computers are — the problem is that they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs in emerging industries like AI,” Hochul said . “That’s why I’ve been focused on increasing economic opportunity since Day One of my Administration, and will continue that fight to ensure every New Yorker has a shot at a good-paying job.” The problem with this apology is that it doesn’t address why Black Bronx kids (which is really specific, btw) are this downtrodden lot in Hochul’s mind. It doesn’t explain why, in order to make her point that kids without access to technology education often fall behind, Black kids from the Bronx had to be thrown under the bus. It’s easy to dismiss the comment as stupid because it was, but the problem with all of these examples of flagrant whiteness is that no one ever truly has to own up to the damage they caused. It’s white privilege that allows for these slights, these damaging blows to both the ego and the confidence of the victims to go completely unpunished. It’s white male privilege that allowed Trump to openly behave as a white supremacist and misogynist who was caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women without consequence, and he is still celebrated and revered. Trump is still positioned to possibly become president. It’s the same privilege that has him in a courtroom cursing and not sleeping on a prison cot for being held in contempt of court. It’s a privilege to walk into a divorce deposition and claim that a worm ate part of your brain and not have to be forced to explain this. In fact, when it’s mentioned again, you just joke about it because, I mean, who hasn’t had a worm eat part of their brain. It’s a privilege to continuously push a destructive fantasy narrative like undocumented citizens voting in elections when there isn’t one bit of data that supports this. Then imagine (because most of us will never know this level of delusion and power) to propose a bill stopping the thing that isn’t happening. But the worst offender of them all is the privilege to willfully and aggressively create a false narrative about Black children to push an agenda. It is why I hate when politicians apologize for hurtful things they’ve said. Hochul isn’t sorry for her comments, she’s sorry that she may have lost votes come election time. She’s sorry that she may have hurt herself. But when it comes to Black kids in the Bronx not being smart enough to even know the word computer, she meant that, she’s just sorry that she said the quiet part out loud."

    "article_content": "It was a warm spring day, and I sat at a fold-up table at the construction site of the Go-Go Museum & Café, my latest project, located in the heart of Washington’s historic Anacostia neighborhood in a retail strip The New York Times hailed as the new epicenter of Black-owned businesses. The door popped open. The stranger walked in wearing work slacks and a light button-down shirt and a swooping curly haircut. By the furtive, stuttering way he moved and surveyed the building from the other side of a glass wall, I took him for a real estate vulture. I was wrong. I raised a curt eyebrow and cocked my head in a way that said: State your business, MF. He never did. He mumbled something about wanting to buy a bumper sticker and left. Later, I learned the real identity of the surprise visitor. It was a former GOP candidate for Congress in his 20s, Matthew Foldi. Despite being listed as a political reporter, Foldi described himself as an “investigative reporter” for The Spectator, a magazine established in the United Kingdom in 1828. Motto: “firm but unfair.” Foldi scurried out the door, his “investigation” complete: He suspected we were operating a front using $4 million in city money to sabotage local political enemies. With a few weaselly caveats, Foldi tied the payments to an unrelated activism campaign to stop the Washington basketball and hockey teams from leaving the district. The piece landed in The Spectator a few days later. A whole story based on an unproved, logistically impossible and unreported theory. I think they call this sort of thing “fake news.” * * * In mass media, “stereotypes are shortcuts to character development,” as my former Howard University professor Clinton Wilson II has explained . The fastest way to build a career in mainstream journalism is to color in the lines that draw Black people as criminals and buffoons. Especially green reporters in search of copy to feed the 24-hour news cycle of ravenous editors like to wade into the wilds of the Chocolate City , in places like Anacostia, to see what characters they can “discover.” I call it the “ Welcome to the jungle ” exposé. It’s a whole genre of mass media and journalism, part of a long and sordid history of quasi-anthropological studies of Black people without the immersion or real reporting. It’s fringe viewing, full of misconceptions and preconceived ideologies about who Black people are. It’s generally tainted by the white gaze, wealth, access and a belief that there are bootstraps dangling from hood street lamps just waiting for Black bodies to pull themselves up. I first came to Washington in 1994 as a 17-year-old freshman studying political science at Howard University and working part time as an intern journalist for The Palm Beach Post in South Florida and the Cox Newspapers chain, roaming the halls of Congress right after Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich’s conservative revolution. Washington Post journalist Leon Dash visited my freshman English class to talk about his multi-year study of a Black family of addicts and petty thieves in Washington, “The Rosa Lee Story,” that won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism. In 1998, as an intern at The Wall Street Journal ’s bureau in the District of Columbia, I crossed paths with journalist Ron Suskind, who was then promoting “Hope in the Unseen,” the book version of his investigation of “inner city Washington, D.C.” which also won a 1995 Pulitzer . Suskind investigated a young Anacostia high school student who was the only person at his school who wanted to learn or had any human-resembling qualities. We even saw the genre recently, in a Washington Post “deep read” by Emily Davies, a tear-jerking dive on a Washington teenager solemnly waiting for his turn to have a funeral. The Jan. 20 report is destined to land in journalism award submissions. These narratives are problematic not because they are not technically true. They are problematic because of their parachute focus on maximizing pathology and limiting character development, ignoring historical structures and assets. My students call it “trauma porn.” The genre reveals a mass media blinder to the complexity, vitality and agency of Black people in these neighborhoods. They miss some damn good stories, too. These media distortions have consequences for democracy. We feel this acutely in D.C. because of the city’s status — not a state but essentially a colony of Congress with limited “home rule.” Our license plates say “Taxation Without Representation” because any otherwise irrelevant junior member of Congress could read a headline and decide to stop us from making decisions about our own rules or tax dollars. Washington’s elected officials try to make policies that respond to their constituents. But they know that the Big Brothers and Sisters in Congress are watching, ready to shoot half-cocked. We saw this with the fevered national debate over the Washington crime bill. We also saw this when the mayor at first left student protests about Gaza alone and then changed her mind when Congress demanded it . City officials stay in a defensive position, trying to make sure they evade their colonial overlords. * * * Over the years, I’ve worked as a staff writer, editor, columnist, etc., for many “mainstream” publications. These days, when I’m not researching books or curating museum exhibitions and other art projects around the world, I am teaching journalism to undergrads. A lot of what I do is coach 18- to 22-year-olds to overcome a natural aversion to walking up to strangers and asking them invasive and sometimes rude questions. But it comes with the job. This is how you speak truth to power. This brings us back to The Spectator ’s intrepid young reporter Matthew Foldi. I was able to reach his editors in Washington and London, but he himself declined to answer written questions or be interviewed for this story. From his website, it appears that he grew up in wealthy, white Montgomery County, Maryland. All I can go on is what I saw when I witnessed him venturing into the dark, throbbing heart of Anacostia. Kudos to him for attempting to do the bare minimum expected of a journalist — stepping away from his home office. When I saw him in the flesh on that spring day, he was at the museum construction site investigating a piece on my creative partner, Ronald “Moe” Moten, a community organizer, and founder and CEO of the Go-Go Museum & Café. He’s also co-founder with me of Don’t Mute DC , a coalition of scholars and activists that uses art for social change. I was absolutely shocked to see what came of Foldi’s “investigation.” His article in The Spectator implied the museum construction site was a front funded by the city. The headline labels Moten based on a prison stint that ended 30 years ago. Foldi cataloged management problems with previous nonprofits Moten organized but left out his subsequent exoneration by the city’s attorney general. Foldi’s theory was that the city was paying Moten millions in city grants in exchange for his successful “stop the move” campaign to halt Monumental Sports owner Ted Leonsis’ attempt to move the NBA and hockey teams from the District of Columbia to Virginia. He said it was “big business” ― implying Moten was getting rich by speaking out. Within a week after Foldi’s story was published, city officials showed up for a surprise inspection. Ah. I was right there. I know I may seem scary, but I’m really just a soccer mom of two. I have a doctorate in journalism and public communication. I could have helped! If Matthew Foldi had found the courage to state his business, there are so many things I would have told him. For one, I would’ve said he was on sacred ground. Black enslaved people built the nation’s capital for free. He stood in sight of a Civil War plaque near the 11 th Street Bridge commemorating the enslaved people who marched across the district line to claim their freedom during the war. Just last November, just steps from the home of the Go-Go Museum & Café, a street was renamed Marion Barry Avenue , for the late four-term mayor. Foldi’s theory of city grants to the Check It program being political payoff for the Stop the Move campaign that started in December is legally and logistically impossible. First of all, the deal about Check It is far from a secret. Moten’s work mentoring and getting the fierce LGBT gang off the streets of D.C.’s Chinatown neighborhood and into their own clothing business in Anacostia was the subject of a 2016 documentary produced by Steve Buscemi. Foldi listed about $4 million in grants to Check It. To get money to acquire the land and begin museum construction, Check It and the Go-Go Museum went through rigorous public processes that began in 2020-2021. This was more than three years before anyone knew that Leonsis’ company had plans to leave the district. A lot of Foldi’s “investigation” drips with details that invoke stereotypical urban crime narratives.He suggests the press is ignoring Moten’s past missteps in past working lives. But Foldi mentions nothing of the way the press seems to have forgotten about Leonsis’ own history of violence at his place of business in Chinatown. Leonsis, who is white, once choked and body-slammed a season-ticket holder. Despite thousands of witnesses, police were never called. Charges were never pursued, and The Washington Post downplayed the incident that bloodied and bruised a 20-year old fan, reporting it was “out of character for Leonsis… a gregarious team owner who routinely speaks with fans during games.” Keep things in perspective. The $4 million to Check It pales in comparison to the city’s $50 million investment in Ted Leonsis’ company expansion into southeast Washington for the WNBA Mystics arena, where he only had to put up $5 million. I would have told Foldi that the $4 million the city has invested in the museum is not nearly enough. In 2020, we commissioned a study by the museum firm Gallagher & Associates, which estimated the Go-Go Museum project would cost $8 million, not including money to acquire the property. We are grateful for the city’s support, and we are even more grateful to the thousands of people who joined us and demanded it over the years. Thousands of Washingtonians took to the streets as part of the Don’t Mute DC movement to protect go-go music, which Moten and I are co-founders. We pushed hard for the city to pass a new law making go-go the “Official Music” and to support the years-long effort to create the museum. The museum is part of a People’s Plan required by city code. A Black radio station hosted a telethon for the museum in 2020, hundreds of people stopped by and many donated — some with crumpled $5 bills, raising $18,401 of people’s hard-earned, post-tax money. We need them all. We don’t have enough money. We’ve been cobbling things together with volunteers and begging favors and a zillion partnerships, and we are so close to opening this summer. I would have told Foldi that I could not be prouder of the real accountability work Moten and other activists are doing now that local journalism is a shambles and more watchdogs are needed than ever before. Don’t Mute DC fired one of the first warning shots against a plan to stop Ted Leonsis from running from hundreds of millions in city investments and shaking down our neighbors in Virginia. It took real brass for Moten to stand nearly alone , in the snow on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, with a handful of young activists and musicians at Capital One Arena. Early stories leaked to The Washington Post reported on the deal as a done deal, baked and immovable . Moten was out there, hammering away without a huge groundswell of support. Weeks later, we learned the full extent of the sham of a deal, but only after other groups issued Freedom of Information Act requests to see the details of the plan unredacted. Turns out Virginia taxpayers would be taking out more than $1 billion in bonds to pay for the privilege of gentrifying their own sporting experience with $ 75 parking and $730-a-night hotels . This month, the city announced it had struck a deal for the sports teams to stay; it was only the Black press there, to document and demand questions on why city officials turned Moten away from the news conference. I would have told Foldi that if more people don’t start finding their voice in this country, billionaires will continue to demand public subsidies for getting richer. We are going back to the days before democracy, when we had to bend to the will of a permanent elite. Agree or disagree — it’s not complicated. This is America. Everyone has a right to say their piece. Don’t character-assassinate the messenger. I mostly wish that when Matthew Foldi had arrived on the scene, he had taken a few deep breaths, calmed himself and worked up the nerve to have a conversation with Ronald “Moe” Moten, the man he’d asked Spectator readers to “meet.” Moten was wandering somewhere around MLK Avenue. Foldi could have learned a thing or two about democracy and real courage."

    "article_content": "It takes a special kind of person to believe that bragging in a book about shooting a dog would boost their political standing. But those seeking affiliation with Donald Trump have long perceived debasement as a means to endear themselves to the former president and front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. This is evident in the likes of Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum showing up at Trump’s trial in New York City. This week, they stood before reporters and acted as if Trump, who faces charges of trying to cover up hush money payments to a porn actor just before the 2016 election — is the greatest offense to the rule of law in American history. Others, such as Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), have gone on the Sunday talk shows to talk in circles about Trump’s long list of lies and alleged crimes. They’re all behaving pathetically in pursuit of power. But in the case of Kristi Noem — the South Dakota governor who, like the aforementioned, so obviously wants to join Trump’s ticket — we are bearing witness to one of the most self-destructive political strategies employed in quite some time. For weeks now, Noem has been taking hits over various claims made in her memoir, “No Going Back,” which was released May 7. According to excerpts first reported by The Guardian , Noem wrote about her choice to kill one of her family ’s dogs, a 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket. Noem claimed the dog possessed an “aggressive personality.” “I hated that dog,” Noem writes, describing Cricket as “untrainable,” “dangerous to anyone she came in contact with” and “less than worthless … as a hunting dog.” After describing an incident that led to her concluding that she had “to put her down,” Noem described a male goat she felt was “nasty and mean” and that also had to go. Noem is not the first person to ever tell a story about having to put an animal down, but rarely have I heard of anyone doing so with such glee and lack of remorse. She even wrote that, after Noem sent Cricket to glory, her daughter arrived home and asked, “Hey, where’s Cricket?” Noem believes that those anecdotes show how capable she is of doing what’s necessary — even when it comes to life’s most unpleasant moments. After this excerpt was published online, Noem found herself widely mocked — and the ridicule only widened as one dismal interview followed another. In her book, Noem also falsely claimed to have met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and French President Emmanuel Macron. When called out, she shifted blame away from herself and onto her ghostwriter . About that: When you read the audiobook version of your memoir yourself, as Kristi Noem did, you should be able to say, in real time, “Hey, I didn’t meet any of those people.” Yet, here we are. As a memoirist, I generally don’t like to police what other authors choose to share and why. On the other hand, what the hell? I suppose we all share different goals as writers, but political memoirs are generally designed to bolster one’s national profile, so one rule above all is: Do no harm . Noem was warned years ago to not include the anecdote about killing a dog for a separate book. She ultimately didn’t and made the New York Times bestsellers list. And now she’s known as the dog-killing governor who does strange veneer ads on social media . That can’t be good for her standing — though, to her credit, Trump, a known dog hater , hasn’t completely thrown her under the bus (publicly anyway). In an interview with radio hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton, Trump described Noem as a “terrific person” who is merely having a little bit of trouble right now. “She had a bad week. We all have bad weeks,” Trump said in the interview, which aired Tuesday . “Couple of rough stories; there’s no question about it,” he added. “Until this week, she was doing incredibly well. And she got hit hard, and sometimes you do books, and you have some guy writing a book, and you maybe don’t read it as carefully, you know. You have ghostwriters do it, they help you — and they, in this case, didn’t help too much.” Meanwhile, some in Trump World have expressed to CNN that even before the brouhaha about Noem boasting about Cricket, she had already fallen off the shortlist of VP contenders. It appears no one has informed Noem of that, though, as she continues to audition by way of speaking engagements. Recently, she went before a Trump fan club in West Palm Beach, Florida, where she discussed her book — but mostly tried to sell herself as a “good investment” and someone who would do “everything I can” to help Trump’s reelection bid. Later this week, she’ll speak at a California Republican convention . Noem can try to regain ground. But it would not at all surprise me to find that Trump recognizes that as much as his base will put up with his abuse of others, they will not tolerate abuse from the likes of her — especially when it comes to their precious pets."

    "article_content": "Opinion Editor The evolution of man — you know, the chart that shows an apelike character evolving over time into an opposable-thumb-having, upright-walking man — is supposed to be 6 million years of progress. But even after 6 million years of coaching, encouraging and coddling them, trying to undo some of the ancient philosophies that propagated the caveman era, there are still men like Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, who hasn’t progressed past homo habilis . In case you have blocked all the “Make America great again” propaganda from your social media, you might’ve missed that last weekend Butker spoke at the commencement at Benedictine College, a Catholic private liberal arts school in Atchison, Kansas. Butker didn’t just offend the left — he offended everyone who is not a white cisgender male. He completed the full house of offenses by railing against women in the workforce, the LGBTQ community, abortions, IVF and President Joe Biden ’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, to name a few. Butker didn’t just go after women, he told women who were graduating from college that wanting to have a life beyond serving their husband is evil. “I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolic lies told to you,” Butker said during his dumb-ass speech . “Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.” “I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabelle, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and a mother,” Butker added. “I’m on this stage and able to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her vocation as a wife and a mother.” Mothering and homemaking is serious work. But it shouldn’t be thrust upon a woman as if that is her life’s purpose — it should be her decision. I’m assuming that Butker’s antiquated thinking is informed by his upbringing; with a mom who stayed home and tended to the family, and as such he understands the importance of… Editor: Stephen, his mother was a physicist. Me: What? Editor: Yes, Butker’s mom holds two degrees — chemistry and medical physics. WTF is wrong with this guy? No, seriously, WTF is wrong with him? I can’t say that he’s been knocked around too many times, as he’s a kicker (which is Latin for definitely not getting knocked around ). But how can a man raised in a house with a mom who works as a medical physicist hold beliefs that are so archaic? When you’ve not evolved as a man, you do things like binge-watch episodes of “Naked and Afraid,” kill unsuspecting animals in your spare time — and give commencement speeches that discourage the female graduating class from aspiring for more, because men need to be propped up. Butker could’ve ended his speech by smashing a beer can on his forehead and that would’ve probably been the eighth most obnoxious thing he did that day. But before we keep going, I have so many questions. So. Many Questions. First, who the hell wants to hear from an NFL kicker? Even the most exciting kicker is still the 100th-most exciting football player on any game day. An NFL kicker can play a full NFL game and wear his game uniform to a nightclub that evening without even taking a shower because everything on him is still fresh. I get that kickers are strategic players who are specialty artists at their craft, but has anyone in the history of ever been like, “I really wonder what Mark Moseley thinks about this”? Oh, you don’t know who the hell Mark Moseley is? That’s funny, because he’s arguably one of the most famous kickers to have ever played the game. In fact, to this day, he’s the only NFL kicker to have ever won the NFL MVP award, a feat that most likely will never happen again. And yet no one knows who the hell he is, which is proof that kickers are inconsequential in the American zeitgeist, even when they are amazing. Secondly, where are all of his teammates? Do they support Butker’s All-American pickup-truck brand of thinking? Since word broke that Butker is a throwback from the 1950s, not one player has come out to show their love for him. The Chiefs’ quarterback doesn’t even talk to him. “Honestly, I don’t talk to Harrison all year long, man. I just let him do his thing,” Patrick Mahomes said during an appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” earlier this year. By “do his thing,” I’m sure Mahomes means he just lets him keep being his misogynistic, homophobic, pro-white-male self. In his speech, Butker also encouraged men to lean into their masculinity — which, as a man, let me tell you what manly men never have to say to other men: “Hey, why don’t you lean into your masculinity?” Butker’s entire dreadful speech could be summed up in a few words: He’s a white man who is afraid of losing. What he’s actually afraid of losing, no one knows. But someone, some mythical someone, is always working to take something away from white men. This fear is what pushed the Supreme Court to gut affirmative action and kneecap women’s rights. It’s this fear that’s behind the inhumane treatment of undocumented citizens. It was the basis of Donald Trump ’s presidency. For centuries, white men have been afraid of losing something, and so they’ve always fought against this fear. This fear is what prevents commonsense gun laws and reparations. Butker’s speech wasn’t about uplifting the graduates or the endless possibilities that await them, which is what most commencement speeches are about. It was mansplaining couched in biblical text, the way that most MAGA Christians use the Bible: by taking the pieces that substantiate racism, sexism and transphobia at face value and ignoring the bits about being a kind, decent person. It was Butker’s chance to rain down on the hopefuls before the rest of the world does. It was a sadistic opportunity to dash the hopes of women who have often had to deal with limitations put on their dreams. It was cruel and uncalled for. And though the Chiefs have declined to comment on Butker’s address, know that over the last 10 years, the Hunt family, which owns the Chiefs, have donated close to $1 million to conservative candidates and committees. They’ve supported the candidacies of some of the most vile politicians , including Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) . And there will be no repercussions for his actions. The NFL only punishes nonviolent protests like kneeling on the sideline during the national anthem as a show of solidarity for equal rights for people of color — as the league is done even pretending that it cares about anything else. Butker merely proves that there is an audience for hate speech of his kind, and, as such, he will always be employed, never be forced to evolve and will be pristine even on Sundays. It takes a special kind of person to be a kicker — which is another way of saying, when it comes to masculinity, Butker only looks the part."

    "article_content": "Even after the FBI raided his Texas home in January 2022, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi staunchly defended Congressman Henry Cuellar. Before the Laredo-area representative became known for that raid, he was infamous for being the rare anti-abortion Democrat. That alone should have made him persona non grata in a caucus that at the time sold itself as the great defender of abortion rights. Still, that May, as Cuellar faced a primary challenge from Jessica Cisneros, a progressive candidate who had run against him in 2020 and lost by a small margin, Pelosi sang his praises . “I’m supporting Henry Cuellar. He’s a valued member of our caucus. The FBI has said he’s not under investigation,” she said that May at a press conference, adding to the reporter: “I thought that you were going to take it to choice or something,” indicating she had expected questions about abortion rights a month before Roe v. Wade was overturned. As much as some lionize Pelosi, no one, much less a politician, is above reproach. Take it to choice or something. How flippant of her. It recalls her goofy claims that the Russians are behind the college protests and shows just how detached she actually is. Some readers may be booing and hissing at that sentence, but she’s your superwoman, not mine. Pelosi may be able to wield power and “has earned her places in history,” but she has often proved that she won’t always flex her power in the interests of the voters she serves, much as she may claim otherwise. She gets so much credit for wagging her finger at then-President Donald Trump and for tearing up pieces of paper after his State of the Union address, but not enough to deflect criticism over how she contributes to the justified cynicism toward the political system. The FBI raided this man’s home as part of a corruption investigation, but Pelosi, along with other senior Democratic leadership ― Jim Clyburn and Steny Hoyer ― supported him anyway . After a recount, Cuellar ended up winning the 2022 primary by only 289 votes. Political endorsements are often overvalued in electoral politics, but it’s hard to believe that their blessing didn’t affect the race. Pelosi repeatedly stressed that her decision was rooted in her support for incumbents. Cuellar had the feds beating down his door and was anti-abortion on the cusp of Roe v. Wade’s reversal, but incumbency was what counted most. Last summer, new Democratic House leadership ― Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, caucus chair Pete Aguilar, Minority Whip Katherine Clark and Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn ― all announced their endorsements of Cuellar well ahead of the 2024 campaign. Cuellar was recently indicted in a case that alleges he and wife accepted nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and Mexico-based bank. Cuellar is accused of agreeing to use his power as a member of Congress to support foreign policy that would be favorable for Azerbaijan and push bank regulators for similar policies favorable for the Mexican bank. They could face a significant amount of prison time. His staff has reportedly fled en masse, and two of his aides have already pleaded guilty to funneling bribes. There is another person tied to the investigation who is pleading guilty , but Cuellar says he won’t plead guilty nor will he resign from Congress. This is the part where I acknowledge everyone is innocent until proved guilty. With that out of the way, the feds don’t usually knock on one’s door on those kinds of charges without good reason, and if everyone around you is pleading out, unless that man has miracle-working legal representation, I don’t see him ending that situation on a high note. Democrats now find themselves trying to reclaim the House and have an indicted congressman making a safe seat in Texas presumably more competitive. Cuellar went unchallenged in this year’s primary and has already secured the nomination. He is unlikely to step down given that he is pleading not guilty. Democratic leadership had the opportunity to nominate a politically informed attorney in her late 20s and instead chose the man nearly 40 years her senior who constantly voted against many of the party’s professed priorities. All for the sake of the preservation of their own influence and power. In an interview with The Prospect’s David Dayen , Waleed Shahid, a former spokesperson for Justice Democrats, said: “The Democratic Party establishment chose to wholeheartedly side with a corrupt, anti-choice Democrat rather than let the progressives grow their ranks by just one member.” House Democratic leadership should have abandoned him at least two years ago. Now everyone must contend with the consequences of their choice to support Cuellar. I won’t hold my breath on any of them acknowledging what a mistake it was to continue to support him, because that is not their way. But they will continue to profess being morally superior than the GOP while making the same mistake s. Republicans are not the only ones guilty of normalizing political candidates under federal investigation when it suits their own interests. They’re just more forthright about it."

    "article_content": "Mad magazine used to have this featurette called “Scenes We’d Like to See,” where they lampooned a famous movie scene in their inimitable style. The new debate structure agreed upon by our two top presidential campaigns comes close to something I’d like to see, that perhaps many of us would like to see. It could be even better. For the longest time, I have complained that our debates have been more circus than substance, more a television event than a public service. They’ve hardly been thoughtful. They’ve hardly even been debates. They’ve been so much closer to laughable that they’ve hardly even mattered. Instead, they became about zingers, applause lines and the occasional high-five moment for your guy or theirs. Like NASCAR, you waited for the crash. It’s what we talked about the next morning: who had the best witticism, who tanked like a bag of hammers. It fit neatly with our short attention spans and our need for affirmation. That is not a debate. We should be watching debates to be informed, not entertained. There’s promise we might get more of the former and less of the latter if the new and improved structural elements crafted by the campaigns are finalized: a TV studio rather than a large venue; no audience; alternative turns to speak without interruption; microphones automatically cut off when a speaker’s time limit has elapsed. Nevertheless, President Joe Biden ’s campaign and former President Donald Trump ’s brood have agreed on two debate dates: June 27 and Sept. 10. The June debate will take place at 9 p.m. EDT in Atlanta. The Sept. 10 debate is still being decided. It’s a good start, but it’s not enough. Here are some other rules I’d like to see: Accountability . A structural feature that assures the candidates are held accountable for what they say. We don’t have that and we still need that for these debates to matter. Debates should not only inform voters of what candidates know, they should also tell us what candidates don’t know. What safeguard is in place when the candidate veers off into a Wackyland word salad or avoids the question so he can force-feed a well-rehearsed talking point? Lawmakers have made this a common practice only because journalists always allow them to get away with it. It’s also something Trump does regularly, not because he’s mastered the practice but because he’s incapable of articulating direct, informative answers. Reporters have let him get away with that for far too long. Forums like a debate are where this should be stopped dead in its tracks. Are the moderators up to that task? They won’t be helping voters if they’re not. Moderators with guts . Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will helm next month’s debate. They should be fearless, unafraid to stop a candidate flat out when he utters a falsehood. “Nope, sorry but that’s false.” More like “That’s a lie.” And the moderators should be well prepared to show how such a statement is false. They ought to know that; they’re the ones asking the questions and don’t feel the need to be nice about it. These candidates are applying for a job. Don’t let them snow the viewers. Be the gatekeepers against falsehoods and spin. If we have to have a gotcha moment, let it be from a moderator who puts a candidate in his place for blurting out a long-debunked falsehood. George Stephanopoulos had the right idea about what the first question should be. But it doesn’t work without a proper setup and follow-up because those are more important than the question itself. You begin with a proviso: “Gentlemen, this question requires no more than a two-word answer. Two words. Nothing more, nothing less.” Then the question: “Who won the 2020 election?” Biden’s answer: “I did.” When Trump rambles on about a stolen election, you follow up with a series of questions: How do you explain the failure of more than 60 lawsuits to prove the claim you just made? How is it that Republican candidates won their races in every state where you claim the Democrats cheated? Not a single Republican who won objected to their victories on the same day, on the same ballots, using the same election systems. Can you explain that? Can you explain why every state and federal investigation found no evidence of such voter election theft? Do you understand that when you called Georgia’s secretary of state and asked him to find you 11,000 more votes it sounded like the person trying to steal the election was you? Do we have to play that sound bite? And while we’re at it, can you tell me why all the fake electors that have been indicted in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are all Republicans ? He won’t be able to answer, and, “Mr. Trump, you haven’t provided a single effective answer to any of those questions. How can you continue to claim the election was stolen in the face of such immutable evidence you are unable to refute?” If Trump then responds with one of his standard childish retorts, like, “Ya know what? You’re a nasty person,” be prepared. ”I don’t care if you don’t like me, Mr. Trump. I only care that you answer the question and then defend your answer. You’ve done neither. Over to you, Mr. Biden…” Brutal? No, vital. If we insist on having presidential debates, we need moderators who not only ask questions but relentlessly ask follow-ups consisting of (A) What do you mean by that, (B) How will you do that? and (C) You didn’t answer my question. Real-Time Fact Checkers : Why aren’t we doing this? News outlets routinely fact-check debates on their websites as they happen. We ought to have it for viewers: a panel of offstage fact-checkers quickly passing along verifications and corrections that moderators can readily see on computers they have before them. This would prevent candidates from offering spin, misinformation and outright lying. Imagine candidates being told beforehand that they’ll be fact-checked in real time. You want to see drama, some theatrics or a gotcha moment that so many viewers seem to crave? See how the candidates handle the pressure of knowing they’ll get called out on their crap. Don’t voters deserve an unvarnished look rather than gauzy obfuscation? Voters deserve politicians who don’t lie, and when they do, we deserve to see how they handle it when they’re called out for lying. Hell, I’d like to see which candidate rejects the idea of fact-checkers as a condition of the debates. What’s the matter? What are you afraid of? More depth : Enough with the time limits. Let the candidates finish their thoughts rather than cut them off because time has elapsed. Frankly, insisting on 90-second solutions to the economy, Ukraine or the Middle East demeans the entire process of self-government and makes an absurdity out of running for office. Is it really so hard to have an honest adult conversation? Two candidates, moderators effectively refereeing, and everyone chats. But it’s Trump, you say. If he rambles or gets into schoolyard insults, remember the rules of your follow-up and take it a step further: What do you mean by that? Why did you resort to childish insults? You’re rambling. How about: Do you remember the question I asked? Take a seat : Instead of standing, the candidates should be sitting down, roundtable-style. Not in deference to age but because it’s more conducive to an actual conversation. Perhaps the most substantive debate I’ve seen in modern times was that between then-Vice President Dick Cheney and his Democratic opponent, John Edwards, in 2004. No one complained about the idea of sitting down, which Cheney requested. Maybe no one cared since no one seems to care about vice presidential debates. But it was formal without being stuffy, civil with no memorable headline-grabbing moments and staid rather than staged. You had to listen to what they said rather than be distracted by how they looked. Turn up the heat : Instead of a relaxed atmosphere or making the candidates look good, which is what each party wants, make them uncomfortable. These debates should be pressure cookers, like putting candidates on a witness stand, except with the caveat that they’re guilty until proved innocent. Candidates should be grilled like an intense cross-examination to ensure they can square their campaign rhetoric with facts, be called out when their answers contradict the facts and stopped cold when they’re not answering the question. Uncomfortable for the candidates while comforting for us. Of course, the campaigns would never go for that. They wouldn’t dream of letting the media make fools out of their candidates (even though most of them are fools). No doubt the upcoming debate will still have moments both viewers and the media seek: the gotcha line, the impertinent Trumpian boorishness, a Biden memory lapse misconstrued for dementia. We already have a level of theatrical anticipation — or maybe anxiety — built into the telecast: How many will tune in just to see whether Biden looks old and feeble? You can’t tell me viewers didn’t tune in to the State of the Union address with that question in mind (much to the relief of his supporters and much to the disappointment of Trump acolytes). I try to assess political debates for what they are: dog and pony shows that do little more than leave a general impression. That’s how they’re treated; that’s how the candidates are prepped; that’s how voters respond to them. Unless there’s a dramatic moment or a major gaffe, the result is the same: Your candidate won. That’s true regardless of whom you’re talking to, whether Republican or Democrat. People always tend to think their candidate won, largely because bias tends to override critical thinking, especially in politics, which is the one place where we need bias the least. Maybe the improvements will help. I won’t be holding my breath."

    "article_content": "In a recent Fox News interview that doubled as an audition to be the running mate of a budding authoritarian, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) predictably cried foul about what’s been branded as “the hush money trial.” “There is only one person that would ever face charges like this, and it has to have the last name Donald Trump,” declared Rubio. “Little Marco” has fallen so far from the days of GQ profiles like “All Eyez on Him,” which saw him as the future of the Republican Party, but in spite of how much more pathetic he’s shown himself to be since, he does make a point ― only it’s not the one he thinks he’s making. My law knowledge is limited to Maxine Shaw, old episodes of ” Law & Order” and whatever the contracted legal beagles on cable news say, but even without a JD, it has always seemed foolish for people to downplay the significance of the Trump criminal case related to money paid to Stormy Daniels in the waning days of the 2016 presidential campaign. I agree that the 34 indictments related to payments reimbursing lawyer Michael Cohen amount to nothing more than paper crimes and alleged business fraud and are far less serious than an attempted coup and stealing the most secretive documents the federal government has and storing them in the bathroom of his members-only club. So what, though? No, it’s not a coup, but to Rubio’s point, only Donald Trump would be caught up in a case like this because Trump is the only politician who would use a tabloid to defame his political opponents while protecting himself. Any other politician would have suffered from such a scandal, and yet Trump has managed to continue to skate by. He does so thanks to the cable news anchors, newspaper columnists and analysts, pundits and TV lawyers with paid TV contracts that have actively downplayed this case as less serious and, in many cases, unworthy of criminal prosecution. You can also add unserious, useless politicians like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to the list, as he told CNN : “There’s two really solid cases: Jan. 6 and Georgia. Everything else doesn’t make sense.” Some of the critics of this case and its prosecution may have informed opinions about the use of law here, but ultimately a lot of folks don’t like this case and find it less significant because it involved a porn star and an extramarital affair. Yes, people voted for Trump in spite of the multiple accusations of sexual assault leveled against him near the end of the 2016 election, but there was obviously enough concern about Trump having sex with an adult film actor shortly after his wife gave birth to their son to make a payment to keep her quiet. I don’t want to hear about Trump being spanked with a magazine or his alleged condom usage either, but this is the man who says the most outlandish, vehemently racist and sexist things since he’s become a political force that if we have had to endure all of that, people can drop the faux Puritan act and talk about this. Another argument against Trump’s prosecution in this case was that indictments with more serious charges should have gone first. Sure, but when it comes to Trump facing justice, beggars can’t be choosers. Trump has long proved himself adept at bending systems to his will, and when it comes to the criminal justice system, he has done so since the 1970s, so I don’t know why all of those justice warriors in political media thought that somehow he wouldn’t manage to do the same with his rotating felony charges. In some instances ― cough , Fulton County, cough ― the actions of some of Trump’s prosecutors have indirectly assisted him in his efforts to delay his trials. The result of these narratives being perpetuated about the case have arguably caused Americans to largely tune it out. According to a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll released in early May, 55% said they were not following it much or at all, versus 45% who reported paying some or a lot of attention to the trial. And as Trump’s criminal trial in Manhattan heads to closing arguments, in a separate poll from CBS News , 56% say Trump is definitely or probably guilty of his crimes but split nearly in half on what they think the jury will decide. Considering the reality that the next president can be a convicted felon , I’m irritated by how polarized Americans remain on this. And Republicans already have their line of defense. Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican strategist, recently explained to The New York Times , “An acquittal would vindicate him, and a guilty verdict would martyr him — and, hey, that’s how you start religions.” Granted, the conservative media ecosystem is massive enough to always blur the lines, but again, this was done with the assistance of the mainstream media who actively lowered the severity of the “hush money” trial because they felt the other crimes were more important. Fortunately, at least some people have come to their senses. In “The New York Trump Case Is Kind of Perfect,” George Conway writes in The Atlantic : “The truth is, I’ve come around to the view that People v. Trump is, in at least some ways, the perfect case to put Trump in the dock for the first time, and — I hope, but we’ll see — perhaps prison. Because this case really captures Donald Trump.” Reason being that no matter what you call his current criminal trial, Conway notes, “what the case is really about is Trump’s modus operandi — lying.” Indeed, all of his felonies and each of his impeachment trials deal with some underlying lie that he wanted to perpetuate in order to defraud the American voter. And he will not just lie, but he’ll also inflict force ― no matter how violent ― in order to facilitate his lie and get what he wants. It was always a mistake to not bring him to heel sooner with regards to this case because it allowed him to continue thinking no lie is too big to tell in order to get his way. We are unlikely to get any other trial before the November election, so no matter what the verdict ultimately is in this case, it is not too late for those in control of our news narratives to reshape and reimagine Trump’s modus operandi before it’s too late."

    "article_content": "How was your weekend? Nice and long? Relaxing? Did you go anywhere? Barbecue? Buy something? I’m not happy with what we’ve turned Memorial Day into, and I think it might provide at least one answer to a puzzling question: How can people who say they support the troops support Donald Trump ? Like so many things we can think of, Memorial Day isn’t what it used to be. Memorial Day was originally called Decoration Day, established in 1868 to honor the soldiers who died in the Civil War. Friends, relatives and patriots decorated the graves of the fallen with flowers. The word used in those days was “strew”; they would strew flowers on the graves. Of course, many still “strew” flowers on the graves of lost loved ones, and more. Some bring photos of children grown and grandchildren growing who maybe will serve in the armed forces. I knew one woman who read poetry to her husband; another would place earbuds atop her son’s gravestone and play his favorite music. Each year, soldiers of the Army’s 3rd Regiment walk through Arlington National Cemetery and place American flags at each grave — 280,000 of them this year — in an honorary ritual known as Flags In. For most Americans now, however, it’s different. It never seemed proper that the federal government moved Memorial Day from its original date to the last Monday in May. It just seemed to make it easier to turn a day of honor and commemoration into a long weekend for getaways (the official start of the summer driving season), backyard barbecues (the official start of the summer grilling season) and gluttonous shopping extravaganzas. Websites last week barked out tips galore: The “ 53 best ”; the “ 70 best ”; the “ 118 best .” “The deals are so good,” shouted Wayfair , “it’s almost like having Black Friday in May.” Thanks for that visual. Memorial Day is the day we long ago set aside to honor those who died fighting for what we cherish most about our country: the freedom to live as we please. I guess you can say we’ve had the freedom to turn the holiday into a convenience for the living rather than a remembrance for the honored dead. Never mind the dead. How do you like your burger? Medium rare or well-done? Ironically, the military remains overwhelmingly popular. Ever since the first Iraq war, we have gotten ultra-gushy about our armed forces. We put them on a pedestal and cheer for them in those pretentious pre-game and halftime ceremonies. We say “Thank you for your service” at the sight of a uniform in a way that is far more Pavlovian than sincere. Veterans can tell the difference. You can tell when you talk with them. That is, if you bother to have a real conversation with a veteran. You can see it in thoughts shared on websites catering to service members, like RallyPoint , the Military Times or Stripes . At best, they’re uncomfortable with it. Others simply don’t like it . “ You’re thanking me for something you don’t even understand” is a common thought . I wonder if this faux appreciation is because our country has a different divide you rarely hear about: the one between civilians and the military. It’s more a disconnect, maybe a lack of empathy. We civilians who have never served can never know what it’s like to serve, especially under fire. Especially when your buddy is shot dead before your eyes, his blood splattered on you. Especially when you’ve come home and realized the war has never really left you, nor you it. Years ago, I interviewed a veteran who jumped out of a Higgins boat onto Utah Beach on June 6, 1944. “You never heard ‘Thank you for your service’ back then,” he said. “That’s because everybody served.” And he didn’t mean that everyone got drafted. Today, less than one-half of 1% of the U.S. population is in the armed services — the lowest rate since World War II. Every branch of the military is struggling to meet its recruiting goals, a problem made worse by “a record low percentage of young Americans eligible to serve and an even tinier fraction willing to consider it.” The younger the demographic, the l ess likely they are to have a family member serving or who has served in the armed forces. Today’s Congress, the 118th, has the second-lowest percentage of members with military service. The lowest rate? The one right before it, the 117th. We’ve now had three successive presidents who never served on active duty. The closest was Joe Biden , whose late son did. Donald Trump, on the other hand, has the dubious distinction of being seen as a draft dodger. At first, Trump claimed he was never drafted in the lottery held during the Vietnam War. But had his number come up, he said, “I would have proudly served.” Except he wouldn’t have, even if his number had come up. He did what members of many wealthy, influential families did to get out of military service. He got medical deferments — five altogether . He didn’t reveal that at first, but when reporters found out, he pivoted and said it had to do with bone spurs in his heels, an odd thing given he was active in college sports, playing baseball, tennis and squash. Trump’s relationship with the military has ranged from tenuous to terrible. The denigration of war heroes, prisoners of war, Gold Star families and former military staffers is easy to recall . But a deeper examination reveals a complete cluelessness about civilian-military relations. Or maybe he didn’t care. Despite touting his love for the military during campaign rallies, he steered budget cuts at Veterans Affairs and placed non-veteran business cronies in charge of its operations. Folks within the VA called them “the Mar-a-Lago crowd,” who used their ties to Trump for personal gain while ignoring government rules and processes intended to help veterans. Only the best people. In November 2018, for the centennial of the end of World War I, Trump rejected a scheduled visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris. This is hallowed ground, where more than 1,800 Marines lost their lives in the Battle of Belleau Wood . It is a powerful part of Marine Corps lore. “Why should I go to that cemetery?” said Trump, according to four staffers on hand that day. “It’s filled with losers.” In a separate conversation during that trip, Trump referred to those 1,800-plus Marines as “suckers” for getting killed. Earlier that year, Trump announced plans for a military parade in Washington featuring all five branches of the armed forces and massive displays of military might, like those embraced by authoritarian regimes. But he told his staff not to include wounded veterans. “Nobody wants to see that,” Trump said. Donald Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly told CNN that on Memorial Day 2017, while the two men stood before a tombstone in Section 60 at Arlington National Cemetery, where soldiers killed in Afghanistan and Iraq are buried, Trump turned to Kelly and said, “I don’t get it. What was in it for them?” The tombstone they stood before? Kelly’s son, a 29-year-old Marine officer killed in Afghanistan. What’s in it for them? How about protecting your right to be a callous scumbag? Even if you weren’t a fan of the military, even if you had contempt for the military, I can’t imagine a single human being, let alone a single Trump voter, saying something so heartless at a moment like that or thinking it’s OK for someone else to say it. How could anyone say that to the father of a fallen Marine on Memorial Day at the gravesite in the cemetery where he’s buried? “Trump can’t imagine anyone else’s pain,” a friend of Kelly’s and a retired four-star general would later explain . “He can’t fathom the idea of doing something for someone other than himself.” “As a nation, we’ve learned to separate the warrior from the war,” wrote retired Army Gen. Martin Dempsey in a 2015 commentary for The Washington Post, “but we still have much to learn about how to connect the warrior to the citizen.” Is it possible that this disconnect, this lack of shared sacrifice, is why Republicans who say they love the military can support Donald Trump? Do they dismiss his obscenities because they are disconnected, because so few of us serve in any sense, because they’ve gleaned their concept of war off of television, NFL games and tripwires like seeing a uniform and saying thank you reflexively rather than reflectively? These are the same moralists who in 1992 called Bill Clinton a draft-dodging lothario and said that electing him would irredeemably stain the nation. Yet they refuse to confront Trump’s multiple indecencies toward the military and his own evasion of service in it. The real Memorial Day, May 30, falls squarely between last Thursday, when many began their long weekends, and June 6, next Thursday, which, this year marks the 80th anniversary of the Allied landing in Normandy. The direction of the world hinged on what would happen that day. The task was to get back a whole continent that had been taken from its rightful owners, and what the Americans, the British and the Canadians did that day was one of the most monumentally unselfish things any group of people ever did for another. What a bunch of losers. Not surprisingly, Trump decided that Memorial Day was the perfect time to “unleash a tirade against the judges and other ‘human scum’ handling his legal battles.” (Nor was it his first time making such occasions about himself .) To hell with the honored dead. The previous two presidents? A little different . I can’t imagine Donald Trump ever experiencing a cathartic moment of purgation and genuine remorse for his odious crudity toward the military, but I sure wish his supporters who claim to love, love, love the troops actually loved them as much as they claim they do. Surely those voters must see how wrongheaded he is and at least acknowledge it, and maybe even question whether they’re supporting the right person. If they truly love, love, love the troops, I can think of a couple of ways they might show it, starting with their vote. That would be a Memorial Day worth celebrating."

    "article_content": "Donald Trump is guilty . On Thursday afternoon, after less than 10 hours of deliberating, 12 ordinary jurors hailing from New York City found the former president guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal alleged affairs that threatened to implode his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump’s reaction was as expected: The soon-to-be convicted felon emerged from the Manhattan courtroom defiant, declaring the verdict a “disgrace” while attacking the judge, the venue, the prosecutors and the judicial process itself. Reactions from rank-and-file Republicans were just as predictable. Members of the so-called party of “law and order” were quick to defend their presumptive presidential nominee , shamelessly echoing his outright lies that the case was a “purely political exercise,” a sign of a “corrupt and rigged” justice system, and election interference “brought forward by Joe Biden” and his “allies.” Senator, podcast guy and Cancún aficionado Ted Cruz went on Fox News to share that in the wake of Trump’s unanimous conviction, he is “furious and heartbroken .” While it’s reassuring to witness a judicial proceeding live up to the far-too-often fallacious claim that “no one is above the law,” I’m not celebrating. Instead — like the GOP Texas senator who apparently loves the NRA more than protecting fourth graders in their classrooms — I am also furious and heartbroken. Don’t get me wrong: I disagree with MSNBC host Jen Psaki and other Democrats who are choosing to meet this historic moment with serious reverence simply because a former president was found guilty. Whatever a convicted felon running for the highest office in the land does to this country’s political, cultural and social fabric, it was and will be done by Trump and his allies — not the prosecutors, judge and jury who simply did their jobs. May 30, 2024, is not a “sad and somber” day for America but a flicker of hope that some of the best of this country’s ideals are, in fact, not dead and buried. No, I am furious and heartbroken because a twice-impeached , convicted felon found liable for sexual assault put three judges on the U.S. Supreme Court who ultimately destroyed the Constitutional right to bodily autonomy and abortion access. I’m angry that despite three women — E. Jean Carroll, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal — holding Trump legally accountable when damn near all of our elected officials have not or will not, the majority of white women voted for a man who bragged about groping and kissing women without their consent , both in 2016 and 2020. According to a recent 2024 Quinnipiac University poll, female support for the former president has only dropped 5%. I’m grieving the undeniable fact that a man who attempted to subvert a free and fair election and who has three additional pending criminal cases levied against him was successfully buoyed into the Oval Office, only to irreparably harm this country’s political process, democratic future and, as I type, the most marginalized among us. There is no denying that the American electorate has long known who Trump is— a criminal in deeds and words. As a candidate, Trump vowed to elect Supreme Court judges with the sole intent of overturning Roe v. Wade . Now, one in three women no longer has access to abortion care , one in five abortion patients are forced to travel out of state for that care, and story after painful story of pregnant people forced to carry unsafe and nonviable pregnancies to term — risking their health and their lives — have become an unforgivable norm. As insurrectionist flags fly outside Justice Samuel Alito’s home and Justice Clarence Thomas continues to serve on the bench despite his wife’s involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, Americans are waiting for a corrupt high court shaped by Trump to decide if a president has immunity from any and all prosecution if pregnant people can access emergency, life-saving abortion care and if people can access medication abortion pills safer than Penicillin, Tylenol and Viagra . Because Trump was gifted the executive power to embolden conservative anti-abortion zealots, the Supreme Court and Republican lawmakers have set their sights on birth control, emergency contraception , IVF and surrogacy. At one point, a Republican bold enough to claim a woman’s body has a way of avoiding pregnancies in cases of “legitimate rape” would end their career. Now, Republican lawmakers are proudly championing legislation that forces rape victims as young as 10 to carry their traumatic pregnancies to term. The right to marry who you love, regardless of gender, is also on the proverbial chopping block, as the highest court in the land continues to whittle away at our fundamental right to privacy and Republicans continue to demonize trans and LGBTQ+ youth . Under a Trump presidency, hate crimes surged 20% . A man who believed there were “very fine people on both sides” of the 2019 Nazi rally in Charlottesville ; whose 2016 presidential rallies caused a 226% increase in hate crimes in the area ; who consistently spews antisemitic rhetoric and continues to evoke the same language regurgitated by Adolf Hitler and other white supremacists, has forever altered how politicians conduct themselves on the campaign trail and inside the halls of Congress. For the foreseeable future, hate and fear are the sole platforms of a major political party, to the apparent delight of that party’s members. After Trump and his Republican cohorts spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election outcome even before voters cast their ballots, only to continue peddling the “Big Lie” that the election was stolen, an untenable amount of Americans do not trust the electoral process and only 37% of Americans believe the 2024 election will be “honest and open.” He has likened himself to Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela and Abraham Lincoln , successfully creating a cult of personality where up is down, wrong is right and an alternative reality reigns supreme. So yes, I am too furious and heartbroken to celebrate Trump’s unanimous guilty verdict. While I am grateful he has been held legally accountable for his actions, I cannot ignore how much damage has been done because a man as corrupt, self-obsessed and drunk with power as Trump was handed the keys to the White House. That everlasting and punishing damage will long remain — Trump’s ultimate legacy — no matter how many times a jury declares the former president of the United States guilty."

    "article_content": "Following weeks of deafening silence from congressional leaders, the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into Rep. Henry Cuellar on Wednesday, after an indictment charged him with accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from Azerbaijani government-linked entities in exchange for political favors. The Texas Democrat is seen by members of his own party as key to regaining control of the House and by Republicans as a reliable conservative vote on social issues, so leadership on both sides of the aisle have refused to publicly call for disciplinary action against Cuellar — placing politics before the imperative to confront attempts to subvert U.S. democracy. While the House of Representatives has only moved six times in its history to expel a sitting member of Congress, it is hard to imagine a member more deserving of expulsion than Cuellar, whose actions have fundamentally undermined faith in the integrity of our democratic process. And given Azerbaijan’s track record of money laundering and “caviar diplomacy,” Cuellar’s scandal may be just the tip of the iceberg — warranting intense scrutiny of the extent of Azerbaijan’s foreign influence operations in Congress. The magnitude of Azerbaijan’s global influence operations was first exposed by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project in its report on the “Azerbaijani Laundromat” — which found that, between 2012 and 2014, over $2.5 billion was laundered through slush funds into the accounts of European politicians and international organizations including UNESCO and the Council of Europe to suffocate criticism of the Azerbaijani regime’s abuses at home and abroad and promote Azerbaijan’s image on the world stage. While Europe has been the most notable target of Azerbaijan’s influence operations, the U.S. has not been immune. In 2013, reports revealed that a congressional delegation to Azerbaijan involving 10 members of Congress and over 30 staffers had been paid for without their knowledge by SOCAR, the state-owned oil company of Azerbaijan. The trip was the subject of an Ethics Committee investigation — and ultimately led to the indictment of the delegation’s organizer, Kemal Oksuz, who worked closely with Cuellar to connect Azerbaijani oil executives with U.S. business leaders and elected officials. This collusion went beyond money laundering and bribery, however, as the indictment against Cuellar alleged that Azerbaijani embassy officials regularly directed the congressman to promote Azerbaijan’s interests in the U.S. Congress — and block congressional efforts to support Armenia amid Azerbaijan’s assault on the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The indictment alleges that text message exchanges show that embassy officials instructed Cuellar — whom they unironically referred to as “boss” and “El Jefe” — to block legislative initiatives led by the Congressional Armenian Caucus that sought to hold Azerbaijan accountable for war crimes and human rights abuses. And on at least one occasion, Cuellar was allegedly asked to block the allocation of critical humanitarian aid to The HALO Trust’s efforts to remove land mines planted by Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh that posed a threat to civilian lives — something the authors of this article have long fought to secure. Cuellar has denied the allegations. Cuellar and his colleagues on the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus often sought to bolster Azerbaijan’s image as a strategic partner to the United States. As an oil-rich nation, Azerbaijan has positioned itself as a solution to Europe’s energy crisis against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Bordering both Russia and Iran and maintaining close energy and military ties with Israel — which supplies Azerbaijan with 70% of its weapons — also contributed to the perception that Azerbaijan has a role to play in confronting threats to U.S. security interests in the region. Ironically, despite the West’s efforts, Azerbaijan has deepened its cooperation with both Russia and Iran — serving as an energy conduit between the two authoritarian regimes, while purchasing significant volumes of Russian oil and gas in order to meet European energy demands. Not only have the U.S. and European Union closed their eyes to to Azerbaijan’s collusion in Russian sanctions evasion, they have rewarded Azerbaijan with lucrative energy contracts and military assistance, and even bestowed on the capital city of Baku the privilege of hosting the United Nation’s COP29 climate summit in a puerile attempt to placate its regime while ignoring the central role Azerbaijan’s energy industry plays in promulgating corruption and authoritarianism in the country. It should be self-evident that the attempt to contain Russia and Iran by empowering an authoritarian regime in Azerbaijan — which has consistently been rated as less free than the very regimes it has been enlisted to contain — is a self-defeating premise. Yet this persistent belief continues to characterize U.S. policy toward Azerbaijan and has led Washington to neglect what Armenia says is Azerbaijan’s ethnic cleansing of Nagorno-Karabakh’s entire Armenian population last year and ongoing occupation of sovereign Armenian territory. As a result, the United States has, counter to its own proclaimed foreign policy goals, abandoned Armenia’s fledgling democracy to the whims of Azerbaijan’s authoritarian regime. Ironically, in its misguided efforts to appease Baku’s regime, the West has emboldened Azerbaijan with impunity — and counterintuitively undermined U.S. interests in the region. As a matter of principle, Cuellar’s alleged transgressions should have warranted strong action regardless of which government he had scandalous dealings with. But the fact that Cuellar appears to have chosen to act on behalf of a regime engaged in the torture of prisoners of war, the execution of civilians, the systematic destruction of Armenian cultural heritage, and the blockade and forced displacement of 150,000 Armenian civilians last year demonstrates a contempt not only for our democratic process but for the principles of human rights and international law that supposedly underpin U.S. foreign policy. In light of the gravity of the charges against Cuellar, both Republicans and Democrats must realize there’s much more on the line than control of the House of Representatives. As the U.S. hemorrhages credibility on the world stage amid its abject failure to uphold the principles of democracy and human rights it proclaims to hold dear, the refusal to expel Cuellar will only signal to Azerbaijan — and other abusive regimes — that U.S. democracy is for sale."

    "article_content": "Among the reactions to Donald Trump ’s conviction in New York last month, I was struck by something Richard Thau said the other day. Thau conducts focus groups for the public opinion research firm Engagious. He coordinated with NPR to share audio from two very small groups. Just six people per group, and not a sample of the electorate overall, but remarkable in the impression you get from their responses, or at least the impression I got. As I listened to the group respond to Thau’s questions, I thought, “Do these people follow current events? Do they even understand the issues they’re being asked about?” You can listen to the report yourself, but two things Thau said about the focus groups stood out. The first came when the host asked if some level of deception played a role in their responses. “If they’re being deceived,” said Thau, “they don’t seem to realize that they’re being deceived.” You know the old saying: The first step to solving a problem is to realize you have a problem. I’m reluctant to say these people are just plain dumb (though I’ve posed that question before ). But when the host asked if it was fair to see these people as “low information voters,” Thau said, “I would say that they are generally not paying close attention to what’s going on day-to-day politically.” That unawareness, either due to incuriousness, obliviousness or laziness, seems a microcosm of who we are today, a society that, as it moved forward, became dumber — OK, less informed. A scary thought here is that those folks may not even know how unaware they are. Instead of willfully ignorant, a choice, they’re unwittingly ignorant — ignorant of their ignorance. Or, ignorance is bliss. And again, not necessarily because they’re stupid. Blaring headlines keep them generally aware, but not sufficiently so. For example, because Trump’s trial was so top of mind, perhaps they heard the first policy issue out of Trump’s mouth following his conviction: immigration and Biden having failed at the border. But he didn’t mention that there was a bipartisan bill to address matters at the border, and he especially didn’t say he was the reason congressional Republicans scuttled that bill because a) he didn’t want Biden to have an election-year legislative win, and b) he needed an issue to campaign on. Mr. Thau undoubtedly has to maintain neutrality when conducting focus groups, but I sure wish he had pointed that out when the majority of focus group participants said they felt Trump did a better job handling the border than Biden is doing. You could then picture those focus group participants saying, “He did that to that bill? Wait, we had a border bill?” Uh, yeah, we did. See? Not dumb. Just not working that hard to be better informed. Funny, one of my conservative acquaintances couldn’t resist trashing Biden’s executive orders to address the border. He texted, “It’s official, as suspected. Joe’s move on the border crisis = strictly to try and get votes come Nov. If it wasn’t election year he wouldn’t have done anything.” I asked: How is that any different than Trump getting lawmakers to quash a bipartisan border bill earlier this year to prevent Biden from getting an election-year win so Trump would have a campaign issue? His response: “Because Joe has to go.” Classic invincible ignorance fallacy . That’s the fallacy of defending one’s position while refusing to consider immutable contradictory facts to the contrary. “I don’t care what the experts say; no one is going to convince me that I’m wrong.” Sometimes, it’s just, “Fake news!!” Sound familiar? We had a moment some 50 years ago when intellectualism and literacy were prized in American culture, when writers, artists and scientists were also genuine celebrities, fixtures on talk shows and in socialite columns, not only for what they wrote, painted or theorized but because they were thinkers cultivated by a nation that aspired to intelligence. You could know of Gore Vidal, Andy Warhol or Wernher von Braun without ever having read The New Yorker, visited a museum or studied aerospace engineering. Today, people are famous just for being famous or, in various stages of devolvement, for being untalented, obnoxious, clueless, naked, or sexually ravaged, with television shows wholly dedicated to promoting it, and social media guaranteeing its permanence. Go to YouTube. Type “Americans are stupid” in the search box, but if you laugh, be advised: Surveys repeatedly show that ignorance, willful or otherwise, is widespread in American history, basic civics and current events. In a 2009 survey of 1,000 adults by the American Revolution Center, a nonpartisan educational group, 60% knew that reality TV’s Jon and Kate Gosselin had eight kids. But more than one-third didn’t know in which century the American Revolution had occurred, and half believed that either the War of 1812 or the Civil War preceded it. Ninety percent of those survey participants said knowledge of the American Revolution and its principles is extremely important, yet 83% failed a basic test on knowledge of our founding, with an average score of 44%. Remember, those were the days of beloved Birther conspiracies . Things have not improved. A dozen years later, the Institute for Citizens and Scholars, also a nonpartisan educational institution, found that while two-thirds of participants could name all three branches of government, nearly one-fifth couldn’t name any. Only 1 in 20 could name all five freedoms protected by the First Amendment (speech, religion, the right to assembly, freedom of the press, and the right to petition the government). Over a fifth said the First Amendment protected the right to bear arms. (Nope. Second Amendment.) How can you cherish or work to protect freedoms if you don’t know them? How does one hold the elected accountable if one does not understand the nature and prerogatives of each branch and how the power of each is kept in check? Over half said Facebook is required to let all Americans express themselves freely on its platform under the First Amendment. (It is not.) You want worse? A 2006 National Geographic-Roper Survey of 18-to-24-year-olds found that only 14% of participants could find Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran and Israel on a map — a map, by the way, that had the countries lettered on it. The future isn’t promising. In its most recent nationwide testing, the National Assessment of Educational Progress found that only 13% of eighth-graders had a proficient knowledge of American history; only 22% scored proficient in civics. These kids will soon enter high school where civics and history are under fire in highly politicized debates over content and instruction. Statistics and companion lamentations about our descent from higher rungs of erudition are nothing new. We are routinely treated to news of indifferent students without a kindling of curiosity annually performing poorly in math and geography. However, in her 2008 book “The Age of American Unreason,” scholar Susan Jacoby noted a disturbing cultural shift: the belittling of intelligence. “During the past four decades,” Jacoby writes, “America’s endemic anti-intellectual tendencies have been grievously exacerbated by a new species of semiconscious anti-rationalism, feeding on and fed by an ignorant popular culture of video images and unremitting noise that leaves no room for contemplation or logic.” In short, stupidity became fashionable, hostility to knowledge acceptable and challenging the ignorant deplorable. That was 2008. We’re much further along on that path today. This is far beyond the days of Truman Capote as a celebrity; it’s tragic irony for a nation founded by an exceptional and uncommon cadre of intellectuals intimately familiar with the Greeks and deeply influenced by European thinkers from an era so profound, we called it an age of Enlightenment. Today, Enlightenment thinkers and the Greeks are more honored by invocation than emulation. But here is the fine point of it: Our political culture is a reflection of our general culture. If we don’t know what our Constitution says about the separation of powers, if fully half of us mistakenly believe Trump was better at handling immigration without considering how the pandemic slowed border migration to a trickle, or if faithful legions continue to insist that the 2020 election was stolen, it affects how we decide to govern ourselves. Bad enough we forget the past; worse still is when we refuse to comprehend the present and its consequences for the future. What matters most is not what we think but how we think. Getting worked up over a Barbie movie doesn’t help us govern the country any better.Will we as a nation learn to dismiss tonsorial talking-point artists and shrill performance politicians and relearn to revere the learned? Will we ever tire of empty sloganeering and yearn for reflective thought and honest, intelligent dialogue? In 2011, NASA engineers succeeded in landing the largest and most sophisticated mobile laboratory ever launched to another planet, aptly named Curiosity , evoking a seemingly bygone era in which we not only believed there were ideas beyond the first ones that occurred to us, but we actively pursued them. Its two-year mission was extended indefinitely and continues even today. Curiosity is still alive and well, at least on Mars. Sadly, though, and frighteningly, baby boomers nurtured in that era may well become, as historian Michael Winship put it , “the first generation to teach the next generation less than we know,” which “may turn out to be our final, fatal mistake.”"

    "article_content": "Women’s sports have started to gain the modicum of popularity they deserve. But with those viewership numbers , high-profile brand deals and equal pay settlements has also come a (sadly) to-be-expected amount of sexist criticism directed at the athletes — and at WNBA athletes in particular. Over the weekend, Chicago Sky teammates Angel Reese and Chennedy Carter became the latest to draw the ire of pearl-clutching hoops fans after the pair went toe-to-toe with Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark. Carter committed an off-the-ball foul against Clark , shouldering her to the ground prior to an inbound pass — a move that later earned her an elevated flagrant-1 violation after Saturday’s 71-70 Fever victory. When asked about the foul after the game, Carter simply responded: “I ain’t answering no Caitlin Clark questions.” Reese responded to Carter’s foul by leaping off the bench and cheering , then eventually greeting her teammate with a celebratory smile and one-armed embrace. Reese — who maintained a well-documented on-the-court NCAA rivalry with Clark — was later fined for deciding not to appear for a post-game interview. Viewers, perhaps many of whom were new to women’s basketball, were quick to condemn both Carter and Reese online while simultaneously voicing concern for Clark and her wellbeing. “The cheap shots on Caitlin Clark are an embarrassment for the WNBA,” Jake Asman, a sports broadcaster and media personality, posted on X, formerly known as Twitter . “Clark is the only reason I’m even watching a WNBA game right now. What a joke.” The real joke is the idea that these women athletes should be viewed as delicate flowers in need of rescuing by their growing fanbase — and not as fierce competitors with natural on-the-court rivals who, like their male counterparts, are vying for a “W.” In fact, WNBA players both past and present have been low-key begging for the proverbial hand-wringing to stop. After Saturday’s game , Clark herself said that while she “wasn’t expecting” the foul from Carter, “it is what it is.” “It’s a physical game, go make the free throw and then execute on offense,” she continued. Clark did in fact go on to sink her post-foul free throw, making it a one-point game in the 3rd quarter and helping her team secure their second win of the season. During a May 25 matchup between the Connecticut Sun and Chicago Sky , star forward Alyssa Thomas grabbed Reese by the neck and threw her to the ground as the pair battled for a rebound. Thomas was called for a flagrant-2 foul and automatically ejected from the game. In her post-game press conference, Reese thanked — yes, thanked — Thomas for “sending her a message.” “I’m a player. I’m a basketball player … I mean. I want them to come at me every day; I want them to come at everybody,” Reese said. “I mean, they’re not supposed to be nice to me. I hope you all know that.” When she was competing at the NCAA level against Clark, Reese clarified that on-the-court trash talking is not personal. “Me and Caitlin Clark don’t hate each other. I want everybody to understand that,” she said. “It’s just a super competitive game.” Clark agreed, telling the press that both players “want to win more than anything, and that’s how it should be when you’re a competitor.” Three-time WNBA champ and 5-time Olympic gold medalist Diana Taurasi even issued a would-be warning to newcomers about the level of physicality at the professional level, regardless of gender. “There’s levels to this thing, and that’s just life,” Taurasi told ESPN’s Scott Van Pelt . “We all went through it. You see it on the NBA side and you’re going to see it on this side.” In other words: Basketball is a physical sport, especially at the collegiate and professional levels. There’s a reason why, as an admittedly sub-par point guard in high school and college, I stayed the hell out of the paint (gulp) and said a silent prayer before attempting to draw an offensive charge (it really hurts). Clark, Reese and their fellow WNBA players are not lacing up their shoes for a friendly pick-me-up game at the local Y where, in the end, they all receive those participation trophies conservatives can’t stop demonizing. They’re all pushing, shoving, boxing out and shit-talking their way to potential basketball immortality. What’s arguably more frustrating is the undeniable fact that, surprise surprise, this level of play and on-the-court animosity is nothing new. Last year, a fight broke out between Layshia Clarendon and Brittney Sykes . In 2019, Kristine Anigwe, Taurasi, Briann January, Kayla Thornton, Kaela Davis and Brittney Griner were all ejected from a game (and on Griner’s bobble-head night no less, gasp!). Hell, in 2008 there was an all-out bench-clearing brawl between the then-Detroit Shock (now the Dallas Wings) and the Los Angeles Sparks after Candace Parker — considered one of the best WNBA players of all time — was targeted as a rookie. (Legend Lisa Leslie was also involved.) As A’ja Wilson put it, women athletes are “not new to this. We’re true to this.” It’s even more infuriating to see which players are treated like delicate flowers and which are branded as violent thugs. There’s a reason why no one clutched their pearls after Reese was thrown to the ground by her neck, or why Clark is not met with the same vitriol when she commits an obvious foul . Racism is alive and well in professional sports and has played a painfully obvious role in viewers’ assumptions that white players need protection from their Black opponents. Athletes throw elbows, shoulder-check, mouth off and lose their cool, regardless of gender or race or the expectations of a chauvinistic society. While Republicans , Kansas City Chiefs kickers and Americans who wax nostalgic about the 1950s may yearn for the days when female athletes were predominantly white, wore skirts and had to be reminded that, “ there’s no crying in baseball ,” this is 2024. Women are here not to be palatable, dainty or polite, but to loudly and unapologetically take up space and compete, both on and off the court. In the words of Taylor Swift: “Players gonna play.”"

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost Between financial troubles, relationship woes and health scares, there are plenty of worries throughout our lives. According to the American Psychological Association , about a third of people report that stress feels overwhelming most days. Some of these concerns are incredibly valid. Cost of living is absurdly high, health problems (a pandemic, anyone?) can spark intense anxiety, and conflict can be extremely painful. However, there are plenty of other scenarios we often ruminate over that aren’t worth it. As the old adage goes, “most of the things we worry about don’t happen.” To test just how true that is, HuffPost spoke with people in their 80s, 90s and 100s to get their thoughts on the things they worried about when they were younger. And, it turns out, they wasted time fretting over some of the things you may be concerned about now. Here’s what they said: Jackie Stricker, who is 100 and lives independently at St. John’s Meadows in Rochester, New York, said that, during her teenage years, “I suppose it mattered to me what people thought about me.” While this was a worry of hers during her younger days, what people thought of her became less of a concern as she got older. “Sometimes people don’t like you, and there’s really nothing you can do about it,” she explained to HuffPost. “They themselves don’t even know why, so I don’t worry about it.” When asked what he thinks young people should worry about less, Kenny Vance, an 80-year-old musician who splits his time between New York City and Florida, told HuffPost that the outcome of some situations should be less of a concern. “If you go to the result before you went through the process, it’s just something that’s in your imagination ― it’s not connected to reality,” said Vance, who is the lead singer of the doo-wop group Kenny Vance and the Planotones and has a documentary, “ Heart and Soul: A Love Story ,” premiering on PBS this June. Instead of overthinking a situation or allowing your negativity to prevent you from doing something, just show up, Vance said. “I guarantee you that if you do show up, something will happen that you never expected. It’s never what you expect,” he said. “‘Don’t expect what you expect’ I think is a good aphorism.” Ruth Snyderman-Works, 87, said she worried a lot about all of the free time she’d have once she retired. Snyderman-Works co-owned an art gallery in Philadelphia with her husband, Rick Snyderman, for more than 50 years. “I was very worried about closing the gallery and what would I do with myself all day long after being tied up for 52 years,” Snyderman-Works told HuffPost. “Since that time, it seems like the days fly by. We live in a condo on a street that has so many people that we can socialize with.” The couple said they stay busy and social by seeing former staff, former clients, friends, artists and people young and old and with differing beliefs than them. “There are so many ways you can talk to people that you find places where you can have some kind of commonality,” Snyderman told HuffPost. “And if you only talk about the ones where you have differences, it’s a pretty sad and empty life, and we’ve never lived that kind of a life.” “So, we’re not worried anymore about our time,” Snyderman-Works added. “That biggest fear has gone away.” “I worried a lot about appearances that I stopped worrying about in my 40s and 50s,” Naomi Goldrich, a 91-year-old who lives in California, told HuffPost. “Was I dressed right? Did I look OK? I was very tall and very skinny, and always worried that I felt like a geek.” She added that appearance became very important, especially in high school when girls were eager to have a certain kind of sweater or certain kind of shoe. “And I come from a poor family. We didn’t have the money to buy those shoes and that sweater,” she said. As time went on, Goldrich learned that appearance actually wasn’t that important, she said. “As long as I was clean and groomed, my appearance didn’t matter,” Goldrich said. What really mattered “was what I did — and I set out to actively redirect my life. I took myself to law school and began to live my life away from appearances.” “I remember maybe when I was 5 years old ... adults talking about the world was going to end,” said Diane Johnson, an 85-year-old who lives in Connecticut. “I remember looking out the window for a long time waiting for it to happen.” For Johnson, this was during the early 1940s when World War II was raging and the United States was recovering from the bombing of Pearl Harbor. People now might be worried about political strife, racial tensions or the effects of climate change. All of these are real concerns, and, much like back then, many people in the world today aren’t safe from these situations. But, for those who are physically safe from these threats, there is a difference between worrying and catastrophizing , which is when you fall into the “what if” trap and your mind goes into fight-or-flight survival mode when it doesn’t need to. This leads to stress, anxiety and lots of worrying about a situation that you’re physically safe from. Bob Wheeler, an 82-year-old from Connecticut, said he wasn’t much of a worrier at any point in his life, but he does see many folks around him worry about one thing that’s a waste of time: revenge. “Some people ... they feel that they need to take revenge. If they get up an unsolicited phone call or an email or whatever, they need to take revenge and try to get back at the person that’s doing it, and that never works,” Wheeler said. “You’d have to just ignore those things ... and you’ll live longer if you do that.” (Feeling like you need to get back at someone creates stress, and stress is bad for your heart , gut health and more.) Jerry Spoerl, an 87-year-old who lives in New Jersey, said instead of worrying about a situation, he did research so he could make necessary and informed changes. He also prays when he’s worried. Worrying just creates distraction, he said. “Get the ants out of your head — just concentrate on the real things, not what might happen,” Spoerl said. When he does deal with a worry, it’s quick. Spoerl can easily push it aside and remind himself that what he’s concerned about isn’t true or isn’t as big of a deal as he thinks. “ Part of my mental approach if I have a bad thought or something, I will tell myself, ‘Jerry, you’re a good-looking old man and you should have confidence,’ and it helps me help myself,” Spoerl said. For Jerry’s 80th birthday, his kids had shirts made with one of his go-to slogans “75% of this life is pure bullshit.” It’s a good mantra: Who wants to waste their life worrying about B.S.?

    "article_content": "Recently, comedian Jerry Seinfeld publicly mourned the societal loss of “dominant masculinity” during an appearance on the “Honestly With Bari Weiss” podcast. “I miss dominant masculinity,” the actor said, referring to the days of yesteryear when “an agreed-upon hierarchy” reigned supreme, helmed by “real men” like John F. Kennedy Jr., Muhammad Ali, Sean Connery and Howard Cosell. “Yeah, I get the toxic [masculinity], but still, I like a real man,” Seinfield added. The comedian’s remarks are hardly original — in fact, lamenting the so-called extinction of the virile dude brah bro man is a conservative staple. In his final address on the U.S. House floor, Madison Cawthorn — who lost his reelection bid in the 2022 after a slew of controversies — begged young men to “reclaim your masculinity,” saying that in the United States “young men are taught that weakness is strength, that delicacy is desirable and that being a soft metrosexual is more valuable than training the mind, body and soul.” Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson ran a special titled “The End of Men.” Republican Sen. Rick Scott issued “An 11 Point Plan to Rescue America” that included “men are men, women are women.” Hell, insurrectionist supporter and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley wrote an entire book on the subject, aptly titled “Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs.” In it, the Missouri lawmaker argued that being a “real man” means being equal parts husband, father, warrior, builder, priest and king. Um, OK. Hawley’s Mad Libs-like definition of masculinity notwithstanding, rarely are the men pining for a resurgence of red-blooded machismo able to adequately articulate what a “real man” actually is, or more importantly why they think their version of manhood has gone by the wayside. Is a “real man” a human with the social intelligence of a gnat, who confuses vulnerability with weakness, asking for help with failure, and crying with an innate, personal shortcoming? As the Anxiety & Depression Association of America points out, toxic masculinity encourages men to oppose mental health treatment, causing a possible increase in rates of depression, trauma, anxiety, isolation, and even suicidal ideation among men overall. The same political party that is quick to blame poor mental health — and not easy access to weapons of war — for the frequency of mass shootings in America is actively championing harmful stereotypes that make men less likely to seek mental health treatment . Maybe this “real man” is the one suffering from a “friendship recession” and, as a result, is lonely. According to a 2023 State of American Men report from Equimundo: Center for Masculinities and Social Justice, two-thirds of men ages 18 to 23 say “no one really knows me.” A 2021 study by the Survey Center on American Life found that, since 1990, the number of men who say they do not have a single close friend has increased fivefold — now, 1 in 5 unmarried men say they have no close friends at all. Studies have shown men in general are less emotionally intelligent and empathetic than women — perhaps that is Seinfeld’s masculinity in practice. Women are more likely than men to be victims of intimate partner violence — maybe that’s the contribution to society for Hawley’s “warrior man.” Then again, maybe all of these silly little things like statistics and studies are beyond the pale for those who actively peddle conspiracy theories while denying reality and science. Perhaps we only have to look as far as Hawley himself, the “warrior” who defiantly raised his fist in a salute to a violent mob of insurrectionists only to later flee like a coward from those same insurrectionists as they stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Unlike true hero and former Washington, D.C., police officer Michael Fanone — who almost died while defending the Capitol that day — Hawley displayed his “manhood” by selling campaign merchandise, including a coffee mug highlighting his infamous fist pump and the phrase “Show-Me Strong.” Or maybe we should simply rely on Seinfeld’s latest example of virility — constantly complaining about “political correctness” and how “difficult” it has made life for wealthy comics such as himself. In an April interview with The New Yorker , Seinfeld claimed funny television simply doesn’t exist anymore, despite wildly successful, envelope-pushing shows like “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and “Veep” (just to name a few). “This is the result of the extreme left and PC crap and people worrying so much about offending other people,” he said of today’s television programming. In response, his former co-star and longtime friend Julia Louis-Dreyfus told The New York Times such comments are a “red flag.” “I believe being aware of certain sensitivities is not a bad thing,” she continued. “I don’t know how else to say it.” Apparently for Seinfeld, that awareness runs antithetical to the manliness of years gone by. Whether it’s simply looking at the faulty examples from the wannabe bastions of masculinity, or taking a gander at a society still dominated by patriarchy, if all this constitutes the uber-conservative’s version of a “real man,” it’s clear that’s very much alive and well. Misogyny, toxic masculinity, harmful stereotypes of manhood — they all remain a bulwark of American society, American politics and American culture. It’s why more than half the population lost the constitutional right to nationwide abortion access and bodily autonomy, why white men still make up the majority of lawmakers in this country, and why the U.S. has yet to elect a woman president. And it’s why, in mere months, voters will decide whether a convicted felon found liable for sexual abuse who encouraged a violent insurrection to overthrow a free and fair election will, if you can believe it, return to the White House. Honestly, gentlemen — what is to miss?"

    "article_content": "Of all the problems presently plaguing American media, more white men rank fairly low on my list of potential solutions, with white men from the land of England ranking even lower. Unfortunately, I am not the owner of The Washington Post; Jeff Bezos is, and he has chosen British media executive Will Lewis to lead the newspaper. Lewis, who was hired as the Post’s CEO and publisher in June last year and began his tenure in January, had his first meeting with staffers in November, where he reportedly charmed them and made assurances that he valued diversity and inclusion. “I’m very passionate about that at all sorts of levels, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but actually it’s very good for business, as well,” Lewis said . “We need to look like America and that is a really important thing.” Several months later, the British import is backtracking on that pledge amid another controversy: creating a working environment where “morale has fallen off a cliff,” according to a recent report from CNN . The drama began on June 2 after Lewis announced in an email the abrupt departure of Sally Buzbee, the Post’s then-executive editor, as part of a restructuring of the newsroom. In her place would be ex-Wall Street Journal E ditor-in-Chief Matt Murray as interim executive editor, along with the hiring of Robert Winnett, the deputy editor of the Telegraph Media Group, in a newly created editor role following the 2024 presidential election. Both Murray and Winnett have previously worked for Lewis. While some expected Lewis to replace Buzbee, they didn’t anticipate the change happening in the middle of an election year, as well as so many white men being handed control of the Post. This was evident in the all-hands meeting held on June 3, which staffers described as “tense,” “combative” and “extremely defensive” in a report from NOTUS . Ashley Parker, a political correspondent for the Post, even reportedly told Lewis that “the most cynical interpretation sort of feels like you chose two of your buddies to come in and help run the Post, and we now have four white men running three newsrooms.” Defending the changes, Lewis told staffers at one point : “We are losing large amounts of money. Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff. I can’t sugarcoat it anymore. So I’ve had to take decisive, urgent action to set us on a different path, sourcing talent that I have worked with that are the best of the best.” To be clear, the Post lost $77 million last year and half its site traffic since 2020. It is not difficult to grasp why Lewis would want to shake things up. Yet, though the business model may need to change, white men are not the only people capable of managing such a transition. For all the ills private equity and media consolidation have wrought on the industry, in many ways, most publications helped facilitate their own demise, allowing their material to be consumed largely for free for decades on the internet and letting tech companies cobble up the advertising model. It was always going to take new revenue streams to survive, but it’s not the fault of Post staffers that search engines are dying and Post executives failed to mirror The New York Times, its perceived main competitor, and create new revenue streams in the digital age. So what’s the reason Lewis hired his friends? He hired them because he believes they are “the best people.” I believe he genuinely believes that — and it sounds about white. Then there is the matter of what Lewis and Buzbee beefed about before her abrupt departure. According to the Times , last month Lewis objected to a Post story on Prince Harry’s long-standing lawsuit against News Group Newspapers, the U.K. tabloid arm of Rupert Murdoch’s publishing company, News Corp. Working for News Corp. at the time, Lewis had the responsibility of effectively cleaning up the chaos , a period it appears he wants others to leave in the past. When Buzbee informed him that the Post planned to cover an update to the lawsuit, Lewis told her that the case involving him did not merit coverage. After she published the story anyway, Lewis told Buzbee she had a lapse in judgment. ( According to a report from Semafor , Post newsletter editors were told not to include the story in their newsletters.) As if this all didn’t look bad enough, David Folkenflik, a media correspondent for NPR, recently reported that late last year, Lewis had tried to kill his own story about the same lawsuit, claiming that Lewis repeatedly and heatedly offered to give Folkenflik an exclusive about the Post’s future if he’d bury the story. Late last Friday, Lewis sent a lengthy memo to staffers, stating in part, “So, time for some humility from me. I need to improve how well I listen and how well I communicate so that we all agree more clearly where urgent improvements are needed and why.” He went on to acknowledge that “trust has been lost” because of “scars from the past,” but asked staff to leave those scars behind “and start presuming the best of intent.” Intentions don’t negate impact, which is why Lewis has alienated his staff. As a subscriber to the Post , I want the paper to succeed, but the person put in charge of fixing its problems has now become an issue himself. There has been a growing trend of British folks running American publications , but it sounds like more of the same to some of us darker folks in the media — nonwhite people finally put in executive positions being pushed out in favor of the familiar white guys. If Lewis wants to save his relationship with staffers, he should think about the messages he’s sending to future hires. Why not go after this diverse staff he claims to value so much? Go do that while letting your reporters do their jobs in peace."

    "article_content": "When the U.S. Supreme Court issued its unanimous decision in Alliance v. FDA last week, it handed down a little victory for reproductive freedom by tossing a suit brought by far-right extremists who hoped to entirely block federal approval of mifepristone. They failed. For now. Abortion pills remain available and can be dispensed via telemedicine through providers like Hey Jane, and that’s something to celebrate. Telemedicine now accounts for 1 in 6 abortions in the U.S., and abortion care by phone, video and mail has become the most viable form of access for much of the country. We are glad the Supreme Court did not let the Alliance plaintiffs get in the way of that access, but this week’s shallow win is not what it seems. This frivolous case never should have gotten as far as it did. For decades, we have known that mifepristone is incredibly effective and safe, having one of the lowest complication rates of any medication on the market. Since this litigation began in late 2022, it has been successful only in its efforts to sow fear and confusion, delay access to essential health care and distract us from the ongoing threats to our reproductive rights, which have escalated since Roe v. Wade was dismantled in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in June 2022 . What the Supreme Court unanimously decided last week is obvious. The plaintiffs ― four anti-abortion medical associations and several doctors actively opposed to abortion rights who formed the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine in August 2022 ― have no standing to challenge the Food and Drug Administration’s decisions based solely on their ideological beliefs. This shouldn’t have made it up to the Supreme Court, and we should all be concerned that seven Republican-appointed lower court judges decided otherwise with complete disregard for the law. But last week’s “victory” is not what it seems for another reason as well: It leaves open the door for other plaintiffs to continue ushering the baseless claims against mifepristone through the courts. The justices wrote that “it is not clear that no one else would have standing to challenge FDA’s relaxed regulation of mifepristone,” despite being on notice of equally hollow and insincere plaintiffs waiting in the wings. Idaho, Missouri and Kansas are trying to inject their legal standing into the case by arguing that they too will be burdened by the possibility of increased emergency room visits . The Northern District of Texas had allowed the states to intervene in January, and even though the Supreme Court rejected their attempt to join the preliminary injunction appeal that was just decided, the high court did not put an end to the states’ intervention. Their grievances are even less applicable than those of the original plaintiffs. Idaho is arguing before the Supreme Court that it is not required under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) to provide abortion-related care in emergency rooms. In Missouri, two hospitals are being investigated for EMTALA violations for denying abortion-related care in emergency rooms. These states are simultaneously denying abortion care in emergency rooms while claiming they will be burdened by the possibility of more emergency room visits. This hypocritical position is alarming, and these plaintiffs, like the original ones, are singularly aimed at eliminating the agency, capacity, and fundamental rights of patients to make their own health care decisions. The intervening states’ complaint seeks to stop mifepristone from being distributed by invoking a 151-year-old ghost law called the Comstock Act. The Comstock Act was enacted in 1873 as an “anti-vice” law, and it was historically used to persecute and prosecute individuals who distributed things or information intended for contraception, abortion or other “indecent” or “obscene” purposes. The Comstock Act has always been interpreted by courts to apply only to unlawful distribution, not lawfully prescribed, products. This interpretation has been acknowledged by all branches of government. The notion that the 151-year-old Comstock Act could suddenly be enforced in the context of lawful abortions is wrong and has no basis in law or history. Yet we’ve already heard Justices Samuel Alito’s and Clarence Thomas’ attempts to legitimize such a view during oral argument in Alliance v. FDA. Comstock revivalists believe they have found a way to turn back time to when women were disenfranchised, and they will not stop at mifepristone. Thomas’ concurrence in Dobbs invited constitutional challenges to the right to contraception, and the fringe idea that frozen embryos have rights is percolating up through state courts. It’s not just the courts that should be of concern: Over the past two weeks, Republicans in the Senate blocked protections for contraception and in vitro fertilization (IVF) while claiming that these forms of health care are not at risk ― just as they did with abortion rights before Dobbs. And if an anti-abortion candidate wins the presidency in November, Project 2025 , the Heritage Foundation’s policy road map, indicates there will be attempts to enforce the Comstock Act in complete disregard of our constitutional rights and well over a century of precedents. If we want a true, long-lasting victory for medication abortion access — and to put an end to baseless litigation threats against it — we need Congress to repeal the Comstock Act. To do that, we need to elect more new members of Congress who are vocal in their support of abortion access. Otherwise, the Comstock revivalists that have risen up post-Dobbs will continue fearmongering their way through the courts. We cannot become complacent with a shallow and illusory victory. Far-right extremists are tireless in their blatantly misogynistic attempts to take away our bodily autonomy. Luckily, the people are on our side. And last week, so was every single member of the Supreme Court. While we celebrate that, let’s channel our collective power to truly protect and expand reproductive rights for all."

    "article_content": "Jeremy Allen White has revealed that a group of chefs “crushed” him as he physically trained with them in Copenhagen, Denmark, while working on the upcoming third season of “ The Bear .” “I really embarrassed myself in front of these really incredible chefs and maniac masochists,” said the actor, who appeared on “ The Late Show with Stephen Colbert ” Thursday. White, who portrays chef Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto in the comedy-drama series, said the chefs were “a little crazy” and that he spent “a lot of time” with them in Copenhagen before describing what led to his workout with the group. “I said, ‘Great, yeah, I’ll get in the kitchen with him and we’ll go over some stuff,’” said White, who learned of the training through the show’s culinary producer, Courtney Storer. “She was like, ‘No, he’d like to physically train with you.’” The actor said Storer informed him that it was a “circuit training sort of deal,” and he wound up going alone to workout with the chefs. “These guys, they’re like 45, 50, and like, they, you know, they look like they’re fit, but they don’t look like they’re in crazy shape or anything,” said the actor, who noted that he frequently exercises. “I was like, ‘I feel like I’ve got this,’ like it’s going to be fine.” The actor said the group did 30-minute circuits, including one featuring an assault bike. “And then we did bench presses, and then we did burpees, and then we did dips. We did 10 rounds of this, and after the fifth round, I had to excuse myself to go throw up, and I did,” White revealed. Check out more of White’s “Late Show” appearance below.

    "article_content": "Overnight Editor, HuffPost Longtime Republican strategist Karl Rove delivered some bad news to Donald Trump and his supporters over the weekend. “Take a look at the evidence,” he said on Fox News on Saturday when asked if polls have shifted since the former president’s conviction last month on 34 charges in the Stormy Daniels hush money case. He said polls show Trump losing ground to President Joe Biden since the conviction. As a result, Trump’s modest lead over Biden has been shrinking on RealClearPolitics and other poll aggregators, and Rove predicted that Trump’s lead may be about to vanish altogether. “We’re likely to see that lead dissipate because the most recent polls have had Biden ahead,” Rove said in comments posted on Mediaite , using his white board to show poll results since the conviction. Much of that shift is from a core group of voters who may ultimately decide the election. “The movement is among independents,” said Rove, who helped lead George W. Bush ’s two presidential campaigns. “And they have moved, in recent polls, roughly nine points towards Biden.” Rove noted that polls of independents have previously found that 21 percent have said they would be less likely to vote for Trump if he’s convicted. Trump and Biden will meet for their first debate since the 2020 election on Thursday evening.

    "article_content": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — After Melania Trump missed key events in her husband’s presidential bid earlier this year — from the kickoff of the 2024 election in Iowa to Donald Trump ’s Super Tuesday victory party — reporters asked the former first lady whether she planned to hit the campaign trail. Her response: “Stay tuned.” But since making that comment in March, after she and Donald Trump voted in Florida’s primary, Melania Trump has largely refrained from public appearances. The few exceptions have included a couple of fundraisers in April and their son’s high school graduation. The former first lady noticeably did not accompany the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on any of the days of his more than monthlong hush money trial in New York. She was not there last month for the guilty verdict or the following day for his remarks at Trump Tower. She also did not appear June 14 at a 78th birthday party organized for Trump by his fan club, or at any of the campaign rallies he has held in recent months. Her absence during the trial and for other important moments is unusual, said Katherine Jellison, a professor of history at Ohio University who studies first ladies. But Jellison said maybe it should not come as a surprise as Melania Trump seems reluctant to follow the traditional public role of a politician’s wife. As first lady, she also kept a low profile and she was not a regular presence on her husband’s losing 2020 presidential campaign. “But everything the Trumps do seems to be against the standard playbook of how candidates and spouses behave,” Jellison said. Melania Trump’s behavior deviates from how other politicians have relied on their spouses. Sometimes male politicians turn to their wives to try to reach out to female voters. Candidates also may be joined by their spouses as a way of giving voters more of a sense of what the candidate is like outside the political arena. During this year’s GOP primary, for example, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ wife, Casey DeSantis, traveled with him, granted interviews and formed a coalition named Mamas for DeSantis before he suspended his bid for the nomination. Vivek Ramaswamy’s wife, Dr. Apoorva Ramaswamy, also was on the campaign trail, often appearing along with their two young children to talk about the importance of family. The Associated Press reached out to 15 people who have been in major fundraisers or in Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate recently. None said they had encountered Melania Trump on the Florida property. Her office has not responded to several requests for comment. Her only public statement of late came two days after the Florida Republican Party announced with fanfare that son Barron Trump, 18, was chosen as a state delegate for the Republican National Convention and her office said he could not make it , citing prior commitments. Reporters at the New York courthouse during Trump’s felony trial repeatedly asked him, “Where’s Melania?” but he never answered. Trump allies cited their son’s school calendar as the main reason for her absence without denying it was a delicate time for the family. Trump’s attorney, Todd Blanche, was asked whether there were talks about her accompanying him to court. “That wasn’t a discussion that I wanted to have,” Blanche responded, speaking to Miami trial attorney David Oscar Markus for his “For The Defense” podcast. “This was a tough case because of the nature of the charges, the evidence that came in, the history, how long it had been.” Some of the testimony aired how Trump allegedly had sex with porn actor Stormy Daniels in July 2006, about four months after Melania Trump had given birth to Barron; Trump has denied Daniels’ claim. Trump’s former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen testified that Trump did not appear to care about how the story of an encounter he was looking to bury would hurt his marriage as much as he cared about it damaging his 2016 presidential aspirations. But Hope Hicks, Trump’s 2016 campaign communications chief, testified that Trump was concerned in 2016 about how a story related to Playboy model Karen MacDougal would be viewed by his wife and wanted her to make sure newspapers were not delivered to their residence. Melania Trump did not post anything on her social media accounts after her husband was convicted on 34 felony counts. That’s in contrast to Trump’s elder sons, who quickly condemned the verdict. Daughter Ivanka Trump posted on Instagram a photo of her as a toddler with a younger Trump and the message “I love you dad.” Tiffany Trump, his younger daughter, accompanied him to the courthouse last month for the trial’s closing arguments. “I think it’s very hard for her,” Trump said about his wife, in an interview with Fox News after the verdict. “I mean, she’s fine. But, you know, she has to read all this crap.” Despite her absence on the campaign trail, Trump often mentions her and shares conversations between the two, showing supporters that she is still involved behind the scenes by offering feedback to the former president. Larry Snowden, president of the “Club 47” fan group, said he last saw the former first lady at a February gala hosted by the “Trumpettes,” a group of female supporters. He said he has never had a one-on-one interaction with her, but that when he saw her there, she was “so charming.” “She was so happy, and she was smiling and accommodating anyone that wanted to come up and shake her hand or anything,” Snowden said. Snowden said he does expect Melania Trump to show face throughout the campaign and to make key speeches, but that he also thinks that the former president would “continue to be very protective of her.” Gomez Licon reported from Miami.

Glenn, a reporter with Real America’s Voice who is dating Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), dismissed the former president’s hush money conviction as he spoke to Adam Mockler from the progressive MeidasTouch Network . “It’s worthless because there was no crime that was committed,” claimed Glenn less than a month after Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts. “Falsifying business records with the intent of covering up another crime, Michael Cohen —,” Mockler interjected. “That’s what they said, that’s what you say,” Glenn replied. “That’s what the jury said, the jury hand picked by Donald Trump’s lawyers,” Mockler said. Glenn went on to call Mockler a Trump hater who was trying to get people “tripped up” before rapper Forgiato Blow got in front of the camera and flashed a chain resembling the former president’s head. “Would you rather have Joe Biden in the White House for another four years?” Glenn asked Mockler. “Absolutely, absolutely, President Biden –,” Mockler responded. “Interview over, interview over,” Glenn said. Forgiato Blow, who once let Greene appear in his music video as “ MAGA’s MVP ,” proceeded to get closer to the two amid their clash before Mockler pushed the rapper away from him. “Don’t put your hand on me again, bro, don’t touch me. Don’t, bro, don’t touch me, my dog,” said the rapper as he got in Mockler’s face. “Don’t bring that bullshit over here,” Glenn later shouted.

    "article_content": "Senior Staff Writer, HuffPost Even those of us who try to avoid heat styling know that it’s necessary at times, especially during the winter months. No one wants to deal with having wet hair soaking their back and giving them the shivers all day long. It’s especially trying when you have thick hair , like I do, which is why it’s imperative to have a great hair dryer that works quickly and with the least amount of damage possible. But not all hair dryers are alike. On more than one occasion, I’ve been foiled by a self-purported fast-acting hair dryer that ended up being a waste of money. To find out which dryers are best for varying textures, I consulted hairstylist Betsy Duggan of The Color Palette salon in New York City, and she shared her favorite must-have dryers for thick hair. “When the hair has texture, you need [a dryer] to have good airflow and get very hot to [straighten] those curls,” she explained. “If you have straight (but thick) hair, you need it to have either the heat or the airflow, but it doesn’t need to have both.” She further pointed out that if your hair is curly and you like to style it as such with a diffuser to define your curls, you need less air flow coming from your dryer. Below, you’ll find her recommendations alongside my tried-and-true editors’ picks. They’re available at a range of price points with different functionalities, so you can find the one that best fits your need and budget.

    "article_content": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Police said a fourth victim died a day after a shooter opened fire at an Arkansas grocery store , wounding nine others and riddling cars with bullet holes as panicked bystanders scrambled for cover. The latest victim died Saturday evening, Arkansas state police said in a statement, listing a total of 14 people as hit by gunfire, including 11 civilians, two law enforcement officers and the suspect. It was the latest mass shooting with a grocery store as its backdrop. In 2022, a white supremacist killed 10 Black people at a Buffalo supermarket. That came a little more than a year after 10 people were fatally shot at supermarket in Boulder, Colorado . The shooting in Arkansas took place around 11:30 a.m. Friday at the Mad Butcher grocery store in Fordyce, a city of about 3,200 people located 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of Little Rock. Video posted on social media showed at least one person lying in the parking lot, while another captured multiple gunshots ringing out. Images from reporters on the scene showed a slew of bullet holes in the store’s window, and spent shell casings strewn throughout the parking lot. Local and state agencies could be seen responding, with at least one medical helicopter landing nearby. The dead were identified as Shirley Taylor, 62; Callie Weems, 23; Roy Sturgis, 50; and Ellen Shrum, 81. They were all civilians, according to the statement. The wounded range in age from 20 to 65, police said. Four were still hospitalized, including a woman who was in critical condition. The wounded agents were identified as Fordyce Police Officer James Johnson, 31, who was released from a hospital Saturday evening; and Stuttgart Police Officer John Hudson, 24, whose injuries were said to be minor. Police identified the suspect is Travis Eugene Posey, 44, of New Edinburg, and said he will be charged with four counts of capital murder. “He was treated for non-life-threatening injuries after exchanging gunfire with law enforcement,” police said in the statement. Posey was released to police custody and taken to the Ouachita County Detention Center. Authorities have not released a motive. A media briefing to update the public about the shooting was slated for 2 p.m. Sunday. As of Friday, a state police spokesperson did not know if Posey had an attorney, and there was no immediate response to a phone message left with the agency’s public information office Saturday night. The Ouachita County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Posey was being held at the detention center, but said the office had no information about who might be representing him. An inmate record had yet to be posted online. Roderick Rogers, a member of the city council, said he called the sheriff when employees at his restaurant nearby notified him of the shooting. When he got there, he saw people running for cover in every direction, even one running to the hospital nearby. “People were just jumping into cars to get to safety,” Rogers said Friday.

I don’t know one person who enjoys any part of using their mop aside from it doubling as a faux microphone. The process can be time-consuming, not to mention the toll it can take on the neck and back thanks to all the stretching and straining. That said, the better and more efficient your mop is, the easier the experience can likely be. If you’re looking to improve your cleaning tool arsenal, then you’ll be happy to know the 10-in-1 PurSteam mop is at your service and currently under $60 on sale — though I’m confident the slashed price won’t sit on Amazon very long. This cleaning device uses the power of heated steam to remove dirt while helping to sanitize the surface with zero chemicals required. The mop comes with various attachments to help you clean almost any surface in your house including brushes of multiple sizes, an angled nozzle perfect for tight spaces, a brush specifically for grout lines, a scrape tool, steamer jet, squeegee, carpet glider and microfiber cloths. You can use the steam mop to clean carpet, tile, grout, laminate flooring and even high-up windows thanks to that squeegee attachment. Beyond that, you can also detach part of it and transform it into a handheld steam cleaner for upholstered furniture, drapes, and other linens. Reviewers love having all of these functions in one cleaning tool and how tough it is on grime while being gentle with the surfaces in the house. “My parents have a home with wood floors and cannot use most floor cleaners. This tool is great for getting oils and caked on grease off the floor without using chemicals that could damage the wood,” reviewer Hannah Banana wrote earlier this month. “It heats up immediately and is easy to refill. We used it to clean floors, walls, gas range, behind the sinks in hard to reach areas, shower grout, etc. It’s nice because it disinfects everything as you go without odors.” People who bought this steam mop also love that despite the device having various attachments and water added to it for steaming, it still manages to be easy to use and transport all throughout the house. “The great thing is that it is lightweight and easy to maneuver,” reviewer Julie Andrade noted earlier this month. “The steam and heat is just right. The cord is long enough to reach many areas. It said not to use in real leather but I tried it on my white leather couch and it was great. Definitely recommend this product for your cleaning needs.” Several reviewers who experience pain and other mobility challenges also appreciated the ease of this powerful steam mop. “I have ME/CFS and was hoping a steam mop would make mopping a bit easier,” shopper Rookery wrote in a review . “Its a difficult chore for me because sometimes I don’t have the energy or muscle strength for the elbow grease needed. This thing really did meet my expectations.” We’ve seen the price of this mop fluctuate, but during my time tracking it, this is the lowest price I’ve seen. I do recommend you scoop the deal now before the price shoots back up again. “Love this mop! Awesome price. Love the attachments! It has taken so much work out of my cleaning routine. I have a lot of animals and my house is a converted barn with a cement floor, it is painted, my GSD is getting older and was having very bad heats and was leaking everywhere. She ended up having emergency surgery. She is fine now but the blood has dried to the floor multiple times and I had to scrub and scrub and it would be right back dirty. With this it all came up so easily and made the floor as clean as it was when I first painted it. It’s very easy to use, assembly is very simple, it’s basically already together. It has a long power cord which is awesome especially in big open areas! It also is ready to use very quickly. I was using mine 5 minutes after opening it. You can’t beat this steam mop for the price, the attachments and the fact that you can use it hand-held is even better! I would definitely recommend and would buy again! “ I’d tried everything to clean the white tile/grout in our kitchen and bathrooms. It never looked clean no matter how much I scrubbed or what I used. I sprayed with some cleaner and followed with my steamer, and it has never looked cleaner! Very pleased.” — Harrison “I’m obsessed. I can’t believe I waited so long to buy a floor steam mop. I have a 4 month old puppy and don’t want to use chemicals on the kitchen floor. This is amazing. It has picked up so much dirt!” — LaHunter “Powerful steam mop. I have ME/CFS and was hoping a steam mop would make mopping a bit easier. Its a difficult chore for me because sometimes I don’t have the energy or muscle strength for the elbow grease needed. This thing really did meet my expectations. I have hardwood and tile floors and took this for it’s first run on the tile. It made moping SO easy. Kitchen stains that had refused to lift with a standard push mop lifted easily. It made light work of a chore that I dread. The head of this mop is very flexible so it made getting into tight or awkward corners easy. I love that it has adjustable steam as I would like to try it on the hardwood but want a gentler steam option for that. The detachable steamer is easy to get in and out of the body of the mop but is a but awkward and heavy and not the best design quality. This might be a me problem but it is my only complaint about functionality. For the price I would absolutely recommend it. I do wish the company would make replacement attachments as some reviews state that they are not long lasting.” — Rookery “ I didn’t realize how bad of a job my old mop was doing until I purchased this one! The picture shows just how bad my hallway was, even though I mop every week, yuck! 🫣 I love that this steam mop has a detachable handheld. The different uses that are all listed in the manual (with pictures, yay!) as well as instructions for easy assembly. The design itself is lightweight, which is wonderful for cleaning stairs and other difficult surfaces (for those of us that are DONE with lugging a heavy bucket of mop water). The cord is just long enough for each room you’re in and the tank is bigger than most of the other designs I looked at. It also makes a really loud sound when it is on and needs to be refilled, you can’t miss it! The compact folding design allows it to store away nicely, and it doesn’t take up a ton of space in your closet. My only problem is that I wish a little bag came with the product to keep all the extra attachments in when you’re not using them. Other than that, I have been absolutely loving this ❤️” — Julie Greenwood “The steamer relay works! Easy to use, easy to fill tank, long cord, puts out strong flow of steam. Pads easy to change. I am 82 years old and this is the bast steamer I have found. I recommend without hesitation!” — Jay-Aah “I am in a wheelchair and LOVE this product. I clean my own floors from my wheelchair. It is easy to use, and does an amazing job on the grout and my floors. I can’t wait to tell my family and friends that I did it myself. I(with this amazing steamer.) No more mop and pail,expensive cleaning products. I can feel good about myself again. I can be useful and have beautiful floors again. PLUS the time you save. Any one who cleans other places for a living could save time and energy plus make more money if they used this steamer. Plus it is compact. I JUST CAN NOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS STEAMER. Plus it is affordable!!!” — Laura Angelotti By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "ATLANTA (AP) — Republicans and conservative activists have increasingly been targeting an executive order issued three years ago by the Biden administration that is intended to boost voter registration, claiming it’s unconstitutional and an attempt to interfere in the November election. A recent fundraising email sent by a GOP political action committee is an example of how they are framing the order, saying it compels federal agencies “to act as Biden’s personal ‘Get-Out-The-Vote’ machine.”A Republican-led House committee recently issued subpoenas to agency directors and a group of GOP secretaries of state asked the Supreme Court to take up a case challenging the order. Despite the pushback on the right, there has been no indication the order favors voters of one party over another. White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said the administration will continue to protect the voting rights of eligible citizens regardless of political affiliation. Biden issued the order in 2021 as Republican legislatures across the country were debating a wave of state voting restrictions amid the false claims that widespread fraud had cost former President Donald Trump reelection. “These are baseless claims brought by the very people who spread debunked lies about the 2020 elections and have used those same debunked lies to advance laws across the nation that make it harder to vote and easier to undermine the will of the people,” Patterson said in a statement. Here’s a look at what the order does, what federal agencies have done so far to comply with it and what Republicans are saying about it. Biden issued the executive order on March 7, 2021, noting the federal government’s “duty to ensure that registering to vote and the act of voting be made simple and easy for all those eligible to do so” and that it would be implemented “consistent with applicable law.” Agency leaders were asked to submit a strategic plan within 200 days. The order directed updates to the federal website vote.gov, including ensuring that voting information be made available in more than a dozen languages. The site is not engaged in registering voters directly, but instead connects visitors with state and local election offices to begin the registration process. The order specifically mentions the Department of Defense and asks it to establish procedures to provide active-duty military personnel the opportunity each year to register, update their voter registration information or request an absentee ballot. It also directs the Department of Justice to provide educational materials about registration and voting to those in federal custody as they prepare to be released, along with information about rules that might prohibit them from voting. A year after the order was issued, congressional Republicans sent a letter to the White House raising concerns that the administration had exceeded its authority and was directing federal agencies to engage in activities beyond their mission. Republicans said the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service had informed state agencies that the costs of providing voter registration services were allowable administrative expenses under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and could be “reimbursed at the 50 percent level.” “Using the nation’s multi-billion-dollar nutrition program to implement the Biden Administration’s voter registration scheme is not only a cause for concern, but one that necessitates further scrutiny,” the Republicans wrote. What the letter didn’t say, according to a former White House official who helped implement the order, is that states administer the food assistance program and that states were specifically directed to provide voter registration information under a federal law passed years ago. Justin Levitt, who served as a senior policy adviser at the White House, also said the agency was only reiterating previous guidance that those expenses were reimbursable. A few months later, Republicans sent letters to federal agencies requesting information about their plans to comply with the order. They also included repealing the executive order in a broad elections bill they introduced last year. Last month, the chairman of the Committee on House Administration sent letters requesting documents related to the order and set a two-week deadline to comply. The chairman, Wisconsin Republican Rep. Bryan Steil, then issued subpoenas. He called the federal order “another attempt by the Biden Administration to tilt the scales ahead of 2024.” A White House official said the Office of Management and Budget had sent an initial response and other agencies were working on responding to the committee when it issued the subpoenas. While federal agencies have not published their proposals, they have announced steps they’ve taken to comply with the order. Levitt, a lawyer and expert on constitutional law, described the order as groundbreaking but limited in scope. Although federal law allows agencies to help with voter registration, he said military recruitment offices were the only ones doing it before Biden issued the executive order. He also said a federal agency can do this only if a state requests it. “Most of what the agencies have done is directly what states have asked them to do or clarified the rules to make sure people know what the rules are,” Levitt said. Kansas and New Mexico designated two Native American colleges run by the U.S. Department of Interior as voter registration agencies. Kentucky and Michigan have said they will designate Veterans Administration offices in their states. Michigan also plans to add offices of the federal Small Business Administration. A group of Republicans, who serve as their state’s top election officials, also has been critical of the order, calling it federal overreach into states’ administration of elections. West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner sent a letter in May 2022 asking Biden to rescind it and spoke against it when testifying before Congress last year. A few months ago, he issued a statement saying his state would refuse to accept any voter registration forms collected by federal agencies. “Adding federal agencies to an already complex administrative process will make it even more challenging for election officials to ensure timely and accurate registration services before the election,” he said in a statement in April. In May, Warner joined eight other GOP secretaries of state to file a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court asking the justices to take a case challenging the order. The others were from Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Wyoming. The court rebuffed a plea to take up and decide the case by the end of June, and won’t consider it for the first time until the justices’ first private conference in early fall. In the unlikely event the court agrees to hear the case, arguments wouldn’t take place before early next year. Republicans who oppose the executive order have labeled it “Bidenbucks,” an apparent reference to the controversy that erupted after the 2020 election when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg provided more than $350 million to a nonprofit that was later distributed to election offices. Republicans have claimed the “Zuckerbucks” effort was an attempt to benefit Democrats . David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who leads the Center for Election Innovation & Research, said the timing of the ramped-up criticism — years after Biden issued the executive order and just months before the presidential election — is noteworthy. “It’s being portrayed as some deep-state power grab, when in reality it’s an effort to ensure that eligible citizens who are engaging with the federal government can easily register or have their registration updated,” Becker said. “It is as innocuous as an order gets.” He said an important benefit of the federal order is that voters already registered are provided opportunities to update their information. That ensures more accurate voter rolls, something Republicans have said is needed. “It’s good for election integrity. It’s good for participation,” Becker said. “This didn’t used to be controversial.” ___ Associated Press writer Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.

    "article_content": "Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost A lucky cat was rescued from a precarious situation at Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona on Friday afternoon. “Tree-climbing for the purr-fect panorama!” read a social media post from the park. The post included a photo of the black and white feline in an uncomfortable-looking position on a tree branch. A second photo showed a firefighter climbing a ladder toward the cat. “A huge shoutout to our firefighters and first responders who sprang into action today to rescue a furry adventurer from the heights of a tree at Grand Canyon.” The park originally asked for help from the public in finding the cat’s owners, but shared an update on Friday evening with the good news that they had been found. The cat turned out to be an approximately 2-year-old male named Archie, a park spokesperson told HuffPost in an email. The adventurous pet had “escaped from a residential area in the park” near the Mather Campground on the park’s South Rim. Archie was stuck about 15 feet high in the ponderosa pine prior to his rescue.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life We all go through ups and downs at work, but if hard days are becoming your new normal, you might be experiencing what 280 million people go through worldwide: depression . Depression is a mental health condition that can show up as visible sadness and exhaustion, but a lot of times, it can also show up in ways you would not expect. “Depression symptoms at work can sneak up on you, and it’s common to be tough on yourself about them rather than recognizing them for what they are,” said Shannon Garcia , a psychotherapist at States of Wellness Counseling based in Illinois and Wisconsin. Sustained feelings of hopelessness, diminished pleasure in activities, weight loss or gain, sleep disturbances, fatigue, feeling worthless, or difficulty with concentrating are depressive symptoms that can affect you on-and-off the clock, said Ryan Howes, psychologist based in Pasadena, California, and the author of “ Mental Health Journal for Men .” To help professionals learn the difference between a bad day and a depressive symptom, HuffPost asked different therapists about the work habits that are commonly signs of depression in disguise. See if these work behaviors resonate: Depression can look different from person to person. Some co-workers may never guess that you are coping with depression because you are still functioning as a hardworking, reliable employee. “For successful working professionals who have made a career out of achievement and getting validation from work, depression might look more active,” said Alicia Velez , a licensed clinical social worker based in Brooklyn, New York. She gave the example of an employee going through a divorce or taking care of a sick family member. “You might have someone working more hours than usual, maybe raising their hand to go on that long business trip, or wanting to be the one to tackle challenging cases or problems,” Velez said. “Validation and recognition at work tend to feel better than having to confront that a marriage may be over or that a family member may be at the end of his/her life.” How you interact with co-workers at work can help you understand if you are dealing with just a bad day or something deeper. Withdrawing from colleagues and isolating yourself are two common signs of depression, Velez said. “This may look like someone who used to actively participate in meetings is [now] quieter, sits in the back of the room, or even misses the meeting altogether,” she said. “Perhaps the employee no longer takes part in off-sites or after work happy hours. He or she might find ways to evade interactions with colleagues or managers. The worker may let their calls go to voicemail, or be slow to respond to emails or even not respond at all.” In extreme examples, a person who is exhibiting these behaviors can get in trouble at work and be at risk of losing their job, which can also result in a cycle of shame and guilt, Velez said. If handing in work on time or even showing up to work is becoming a daily struggle, it could also be a symptom of depression, Howes said. “I knew someone who enjoyed his work, was actively engaged in his projects, and had a lot of contact with his coworkers. When he became depressed, he started sleeping through his alarm and showed up late to work. He was falling behind on deadlines, stopped going to lunch with colleagues, and became highly critical of his [own] and his co-workers’ performance,” Howes said. “All of these changes were noticed by colleagues and bosses, who reached out to him and encouraged him to seek help,” Howes continued. “Fortunately, he did, and through a combination of changing diet and sleep hygiene, beginning therapy, and receiving a prescription for an antidepressant, he was feeling better within a few months.” “Depression isn’t just feeling down in the dumps ― it can make you super irritable too,” Garcia said. If every little annoyance is setting you off at work, it could be a signal to look deeper at the cause. People with depression deal with symptoms of overt or suppressed anger , and can make their colleagues the target of their ire. “At work, you may find yourself easily annoyed by everyone and everything. Your fuse is short with your co-workers, customers, and even your inbox,” Garcia said. There’s a difference between a one-time boring assignment and a worrisome pattern of apathy. Notice changes about how you feel regarding work that you used to take satisfaction in doing, Garcia said. “You might notice yourself just staring at your screen, pretending to be busy, or doing anything but tackling the big stuff,” Garcia said. “That loss of interest that depression can cause may have you thinking ‘I just don’t care’ about your work.” If these signs are resonating with your experience at work, know that you do not have to deal with depression on your own. There are steps you can take immediately to address how you are feeling and get better: If your depression shows up as you hyper-functioning at work, it helps to check in with your body. “It can be easy to miss depressive symptoms when work is tricking you into feeling competent and self-efficacious,” Velez said. That’s why Velez suggests asking yourself questions that can help you notice changes in your physical health like: Are you feeling more tired than usual? What’s your relationship with alcohol or marijuana? Are you getting too little or too much sleep? How is your relationship with exercise and movement? Are there points of nagging tension anywhere in your body? “Physical signs and signals can alert you that it may be time to acknowledge those uncomfortable feelings,” Velez said. When you are depressed, you might not want anyone to know and may feel unworthy of your friends’ support. But in fact, talking to a few trusted peers and loved ones can be just what you need to help you against withdrawing and isolation. “The best way to start managing depression is to talk with someone about it,” Howes said. He said you could open up to a friend or loved one, and let them know what you’re experiencing and how it’s impacting you. Velez said it can also help for employees experiencing depression to ask trusted colleagues to stop by their desk for a quick coffee chat a couple times a week or to check in with them via text. “Know that depression is very common and often responds well to treatment,” Howes said. “If it seems like this is depression, talking with a physician or a mental health professional is crucial. They will be able to assess your symptoms and recommend a course of treatment that may include therapy, medication or both.” With written documentation of your depression by a medical professional, you may also qualify for reasonable accommodations at your job under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Examples of these accommodations can include permission to work from home or an altered schedule. If you choose to share your condition with HR or your manager , they may be able to help you get company-sponsored resources and support. “Many workplaces offer EAPs [Employee Assistance Programs] which have counselors on staff to provide short-term therapy or can also give the employee referrals for other services that may be needed such as child care, food and housing assistance, and therapists in the community,” Velez said. Citing psychiatrist Dr. Aaron T. Beck ’s research on cognitive behavioral therapy, Velez said it is also important to learn if your job is providing you with the ability to feel pleasure, or a sense of enjoyment, and mastery, or a sense of achievement, because those are factors people need in order to combat depression. To monitor if your job is exacerbating symptoms or is the source of them, Velez said an employee can keep track of work activities for one or two weeks in a spreadsheet, with one column for “pleasure” and another column for “mastery.” “Having visual evidence can be a great way to confirm or deny our feelings,” Velez said. “Taking an inventory can let you know if you are getting pleasure and mastery from your job or if it’s time to start looking for a new job.” “Depression often pushes you to isolate, do nothing, and be unkind to yourself. Doing the opposite, even in tiny ways, can really help,” Garcia said. For instance, Garcia said that if you’re struggling to get out of bed and are showing up late to work, you can try sitting up when you wake instead of staying horizontal. And if projects feel overwhelming, Garcia recommended breaking them down into smaller steps or committing to just five minutes of focused effort. Ultimately, it helps to understand that you are more than your depression. “See depression as something separate from who you are and practice resisting its urges,” Garcia recommended. The point is to remember that depression can be a tough mental health condition that affects millions of people every day , but it is a manageable one.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Do you start at your feet and move up? Give it all a quick spray and move on? If you’ve fallen into a routine of using sunscreen each day, you may be surprised to hear that there’s a preferred method for how it should be applied. Are you doing it the right way? Here’s what the experts say. Face-first is always the way to go, experts said. “I recommend starting at the face and then working your way down the body to your feet, so that you don’t wind up with bacteria from your body on your face,” said dermatologist Dr. Corey L. Hartman . Dermatologist Dr. Teresa Song agreed with this approach, and she explained why it’s a good idea. “Generally, skin care products used on the body are more occlusive, which means they can use heavy, greasy ingredients that create a physical barrier for the skin,” she said. “That heavier body skin care should be separated from products intended for face and neck, since they could potentially cause breakouts on the face.” “One way to apply your sunscreen is to focus on the cosmetic subunits of the face,” said dermatologist Dr. DiAnne Davis . “If you follow this method, the forehead gets one dot or glob of sunscreen. Each cheek gets another, then the chin area, around the mouth, the nose and finally around the eyes.” But that’s not the only method. “Alternatively, you could take a glob of product and spread it into both hands by rubbing them together, followed by one large application to the entire face with both hands,” Davis said. “We always recommend layering products from thinnest to thickest,” said dermatologist Dr. Claire Wolinsky . “If you’re using chemical sunscreen, it should be as close to the skin as possible and preferably the first product applied before moisturizer, then makeup. If you’re using a thin serum like a vitamin C, then the serum would be applied first. But if you’re using mineral sunscreen, that should be the last step so it’s closest to the sun.” Once the sunscreen goes on, give yourself some time before doing anything else, experts said. “ Let sunscreen sit on the skin for at least 10 minutes before applying makeup, just to make sure it fully absorbs,” Hartman said. The experts said that the biggest sunscreen mistake they see is people not applying enough. “You need a full ounce of sunscreen to cover your body, which equates to a shot glass or a golf ball-sized amount,” Hartman said. He noted that while sprays are very easy to use, they need some follow-up before they can provide protection. “Spray multiple passes across each body part, usually two to three times per arm and three to four times per leg,” Hartman said. “Hold the sunscreen nozzle about 3 to 4 inches from your skin. Stop in between sprays and rub the sunscreen into the skin entirely. If you skip this step, the spray will only protect where it hits the skin.” As you’re paying attention to application, make sure you’re getting even coverage — especially in spots you might otherwise miss. “Many people realize the importance of applying sunscreen to the face, but other areas like the ears, neck and back of the hands also receive a significant amount of UV radiation and are common sites for skin cancer,” said dermatologist and Mohs surgeon Dr. Carolyn Stull . “Applying sunscreen to these areas on a regular basis is important to reduce the risk of UV damage.” “I recommend a physical or mineral sunscreen that contains zinc oxide as the active ingredient,” said dermatologist Dr. Mojgan Hosseinipour . “Tinted sunscreens contain iron oxides that protect against blue light, infrared and visible light as well. Choose a sunscreen that has an SPF of 30 or higher, is water-resistant, and provides broad-spectrum coverage, which means it protects you from UVA and UVB rays [two types of ultraviolet light].” If you’re confused about how to read all of this on a label, Song put it this way: “‘SPF’ stands for ‘sun protection factor,’ and ‘PA’ stands for ‘protection of UVA rays.’ An SPF number of 30 and up is recommended, with a PA rating of 4-plus. If you’re wearing SPF 30, it blocks 97% of UVB, whereas SPF 50 blocks 98% of UVB rays. While SPF only measures for UVB protection, PA measures for UVA protection, and more pluses means higher protection.” Finally, SPF makeup doesn’t make the grade for medical aesthetician Victoria Waked . “Makeup with SPF is not enough coverage,” she said. “People often apply makeup sparingly, focusing on achieving a desired look rather than ensuring even and thorough sun protection. This can result in an insufficient amount of SPF being applied, leading to reduced effectiveness in shielding the skin from UV rays.” Now that you know which kind of sunscreen to buy and the best way to apply it, make sure you’ve got your timing right, too. First, you need to apply it before those harsh rays hit your delicate flesh. Here’s what Hosseinipour recommended: “Apply sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes before going outdoors. It takes approximately 15 minutes for your skin to absorb the sunscreen and protect you.” And keep reapplying it as long as you’re in the sun. “If you’re outside for longer than two hours, you need to reapply sunscreen,” Hartman said. “You should also reapply immediately after swimming or sweating. There are amazing products available that make reapplication easy, so find one that you like and stick with it.” Want to shop the best sunscreens around? Shop this selection of highly rated picks.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost With more and more young people being diagnosed with colorectal cancer, it’s natural to be nervous about the disease. Rates of colorectal cancer in people under 50 have been increasing since the 1990s, according to Dr. Michael Cecchini , a co-director of the colorectal program at the Center for Gastrointestinal Cancers and medical oncologist at Yale Cancer Center. The exact reason why rates are increasing is unknown. Experts “think it’s something lifestyle and environmental, but exactly what that is, we don’t know,” Cecchini said. Researchers are investigating what could be happening. In the meantime, it’s important that you stay alert about colorectal cancer ― even if you’re young. Part of this is knowing the warning signs. And there’s one surprising symptom in particular that’s been gaining attention on social media : pencil-thin poop. As one TikTok user explained on the platform, she noticed that her stools were thinner than normal, along with other red-flag symptoms like unexplained weight loss and diarrhea. She thought that she had irritable bowel syndrome, so she didn’t go to the doctor at first. When she finally did, she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. Here’s what experts say about this particular issue: Doctors will sometimes see patients whose “stools are much thinner, or they’re pencil in thickness and size, which is a description that some patients with colorectal cancer will have,” Cecchini said. This tends to occur if tumors are present near the end of the colon or if they line the entire inside of the colon, which narrows whatever stool passes through, Cecchini explained. Healthy stool should be long and sausage-shaped, according to Medical News Today , and come out as one piece or several smaller pieces. What’s most concerning is when thin stools are a new change that’s persistent, said Dr. Jeffrey Dueker , a gastroenterologist at UPMC and an associate professor of gastroenterology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. According to Dueker, any noticeable alteration in your bowel habits could be a potential red flag (but, he stressed, is not always a sign of colon cancer). In addition to a change in stool shape or consistency, this can include going to the bathroom more or less often. Pencil-thin poop is one of the less common signs of colorectal cancer. “When it exists, it is highly concerning,” Cecchini said. “It’s just not one of the more common symptoms of the disease.” The more widespread signs are blood in the stool and abdominal pain. Unintentional weight loss is another sign. And some cases of colorectal cancer have no symptoms at all. You should never discount your symptoms, Cecchini said, if you notice blood in your stool, chronic abdominal pain, a change in bowel movements, or unexplained weight loss, it’s important that you tell your doctor. “It’s very easy in younger individuals to think, ‘Oh, it’s just hemorrhoids,’ or something like that ... and it may be, but also those things can coexist,” said Cecchini. “People certainly have hemorrhoids and cancer, or it can be something else completely.” In general, getting a colonoscopy or another colorectal cancer screening is the best way to lower your risk or catch it in the early stages. You can undergo “screening with colonoscopy or stool-based tests,” Cecchini said. Chat with your doctor to determine the best screening for you. For most people, screenings start at 45. But if you have any of the symptoms mentioned above or meet certain criteria, you may be eligible for a colonoscopy before 45 , Dueker said. “Anyone with a first-degree relative — mother, father, brother, sister, son or daughter — that has had colon cancer, especially if that person was diagnosed before the age of 50, is going to be at higher risk for colorectal cancer because of that family history, and should speak to their doctor about when they should start getting colonoscopies,” Dueker explained. If you’ve had inflammatory bowel disease or radiation treatment to the pelvic or abdominal area, or if you have certain genetic syndromes or a personal history of colon cancer, you would also want to get a colonoscopy before 45, Dueker noted. Suffice to say, it’s important to keep your doctor informed of your medical history and any potential issues you might be experiencing. But while you should take all of this seriously, you also shouldn’t panic. “All of these symptoms don’t necessarily mean ... you have colon cancer,” said Dueker. Instead, they could mean that a colonoscopy is necessary to determine what is going on. And while the cause could be colon cancer or a precancerous polyp, detecting the disease early is the best way to manage it. “It’s important to catch cancer early through screening or alerting to some of ... these symptoms so that we diagnose cancer at an earlier stage, where it’s more treatable and hopefully curable,” Cecchini said. “We still cure the majority of people with this cancer every year.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Trends Reporter Ben Affleck is still getting used to the “bananas” level of fame of his wife, Jennifer Lopez . The “Gone Girl” star sat down with Kevin Hart for an expansive interview this week amid rumors of marital strife and, despite admitting that his public “resting bitch face” might be fueling the theory, noted just how famous Lopez really is — and how difficult that can be. Affleck explained that even his kids with ex-wife Jennifer Garner are aware he’s concerned about raising them in the spotlight. He noted one of them even cheekily bugs him with titles for a hypothetical tell-all, and recalled one particularly relevant moment in New York City. “I get out with [Lopez], all the kids, through Times Square,” said Affleck in his “Hart to Heart” chat , “and the shit was fucking bananas. It was like the mayor [arrived] … and there’s this lady, she’s smoking weed, wearing a purple, skintight suit … and she sees [us].” “She starts running backwards, filming, going, ‘JLo!’” he continued. “It’s like a herald that then gets everyone else, and then they’re all [starstruck] tourists. Then I’m moving, we got our five kids, me and Jen, and it feels like hundreds of people — and they’re all screaming.” “And my daughter just turns to me and goes, ‘JLo Was My Stepmother,’” Affleck joked. While certainly famous himself, the actor saw his first engagement with Lopez in 2002 called off after relentless tabloid press . Affleck, who married Garner in 2005 but divorced her in 2018, is still learning how to navigate that fame. “I really fucking second-guess it a lot,” he told Hart about raising his kids that way. “That’s the balance, and I talk with Jennifer about that a lot as we look at what was the difference between our kids’ lives … and our lives growing up … I didn’t know any rich people.” “I’m also a little bit shy,” Affleck added. “I also don’t like a lot of attention. This is why people see me and they’re like, ‘This dude always mad!’ — because somebody has their camera and sticks it in my face and I’m … with my kids and you’re taking my picture.” The actor drew all-new media attention with his 2022 elopement with Lopez in Las Vegas . Affleck, whose mere facial expressions have gone viral , admitted Thursday that his “resting bitch face” gets him into trouble — even when he’s doing something innocuous. “People are projecting something onto me that I don’t feel about myself at all,” he told Hart. “And one thing I do think it gives off, whether it’s a certain look or role … for a long time they’d be like, ‘This guy’s a frat guy.’ I’ve never been in a fraternity one day in my life.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost It’s official: Kevin Costner will not be returning to “Yellowstone” for the show’s final episodes. Costner announced his departure Thursday in a social media video. His message came on the same day that Paramount Network said the last episodes of “Yellowstone” would start airing Nov. 10. The actor, who recorded his video standing outside in front of a hedge, began by saying he wanted to “reach out” to fans following “this long year and a half of working on ‘ Horizon ,’” his ambitious film project. Costner then addressed “Yellowstone,” calling it “that beloved series that I love, that I know you love,” and said he “just realized that I’m not going to be able to continue Season 5B or into the future.” The actor added that doing the show “ really changed me.” “I loved it and I know you loved it, and I just wanted to let you know that I won’t be returning,” he said. “I’ll see you at the movies.” A post shared by Kevin Costner (@kevincostner) Costner’s exit from the popular TV drama, which is set to conclude with Season 5, has long been rumored . Back in February 2023, Deadline reported that he only wanted to spend a single week shooting the final episodes, though Costner later disputed this account. The actor has recently been focused on “Horizon: An American Saga,” a Western epic in four parts — the first of which is set to open in theaters June 28 . A Paramount Network spokesperson told HuffPost that Costner was “a big part of ’Yellowstone’s’ success” and the network had hoped to continue working with him. “Unfortunately, we could not find a window that worked for him, all the other talent and our production needs in order to move forward together,” the spokesperson said. “We respect that Kevin has prioritized his new film series, and we wish him the best.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Trends Reporter Donald Sutherland , who died Thursday at age 88 following a long illness, has received widespread tributes from fellow actors, Oscar-winning filmmakers and President Joe Biden himself. Sutherland’s lifelong friend, actor Elliott Gould, vowed to “never forget” him. “It’s never easy, losing the caliber of a human being and actor like Donald Sutherland, but this one really profoundly hurts because Donald was like my brother, and a big part of my own career,” Gould wrote on Instagram . “Rest in peace, you, dear, dear Kind friend,” he wrote. “I love you and I will never forget you.” Kiefer Sutherland confirmed his father’s death on social media Thursday and has since thanked the public for their thoughts . His physically and artistically towering father, who earned an honorary Oscar in 2017, was perhaps most notably mourned by the sitting U.S. president. “Donald Sutherland was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and one-of-a-kind actor who inspired and entertained the world for decades,” Biden wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter . “My thoughts are with his family and all those who loved him.” Sutherland’s career spanned more than 60 years , and he’s been mourned by fans from multiple generations as a result. Some lauded him as the fine actor who delivered Oliver Stone’s exposition in “JFK,” while others pointed to his performance in the “Hunger Games” movies. Still others have argued that he cemented his legacy as the star of classic films including “Don’t Look Now” and “The Dirty Dozen.” “We asked the kindest man in the world to portray the most corrupt, ruthless dictator we’ve ever seen,” read a post on X from the official account of the “Hunger Games” franchise. “Such was the power and skill of Donald Sutherland’s acting that he created one more indelible character among many others that defined his legendary career.” Sutherland was also a lifelong political activist, protesting the Vietnam War in 1971 to counter Bob Hope’s pro-war USO tour. He was placed on the National Security Agency’s “Watch List,” which also included Muhammad Ali, until 1973. Decades later, Sutherland also joined the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations against income inequality. The actor, whose career is studded with Primetime Emmys, Critics’ Choice Awards and Golden Globes, earned heartfelt tributes from John Cusack, Elijah Wood and Rob Lowe, as well as directors Ron Howard and Matt Reeves and literary giant Stephen King. Correction: An earlier version of this article stated Donald Sutherland starred in the television series “M.A.S.H.” He starred in the 1970 film. Today we lost one of our greatest actors, Donald Sutherland. It was my honor to work with him many years ago, and I will never forget his charisma and ability. If you want a master class in acting, watch him in “Ordinary People”. My condolences to Kiefer. pic.twitter.com/qjMz69Nraq RIP to the incredible Donald Sutherland.

    "article_content": "Trends Reporter Taylor Swift had a burning problem on her hands this year — in an almost literal sense. The Grammy winner had just finished co-writing a new song with Gracie Abrams , who confirmed earlier this week that amid an all-night session involving plenty of drinks, a fire broke out in the kitchen of Swift’s New York City apartment, demanding their sleepless attention. Abrams shared some rather hilarious footage of the accident Friday on Instagram. One video showed the duo happily crafting her song “Us” together, and the other showed Swift warning “I think we’re going to die” before putting out the blaze from her fallen candle. “Our purses are ruined,” Swift said after figuring out how to use the fire extinguisher, “and our shoes — and the whole room, I think.” Abrams confirmed in her caption that working “from 2am to 6am” on the song was nonetheless “some of the most fun” she’d ever had. The singer, whose father, director J.J. Abrams , who created the “Lost” TV series and spearheaded the latest “Star Wars” film trilogy, still recalls the night vividly. “She was such a legend — I don’t know how at this hour or in our state she knew what to do,” Abrams said Tuesday in an interview with Billboard , which noted the incident occurred six months ago. “We both had an insane cough from the fire extinguisher fumes for weeks.” Writing this entire song from 2am to 6am was some of the most fun I’ve ever had in my life. @taylorswift13 now we know how to use a fire extinguisher. I love you. pic.twitter.com/aJtqSgmUdR The song itself has since become a personally coveted part of Abrams’ sophomore album, “The Secret of Us,” which hit streaming services Friday . The 24-year-old California native says she still can’t believe her Gen Z childhood hero has become a collaborator. “She texted me out of the blue like two Christmases ago,” Abrams told Rolling Stone in February about Swift’s 32nd birthday in December 2022. “Like, ‘hey, it’s my birthday.’ I was like, ‘I know.’ She’s one of the brightest lights ever, a writing genius, an artistic genius, angel from above.” The fledgling star also addressed the so-called “nepo baby” discourse at the time by acknowledging her “million visible advantages” and has since opened for Swift at several shows of her record-breaking Eras tour — and even sung onstage alongside her hero. “I blacked out the whole time,” Abrams joked on “The Tonight Show” in May .

    "article_content": "For context, Lily met David after they matched on the exclusive celebrity dating app Raya back in 2019, with Lily insisting that she had no idea who he was at the time as she had never watched his hit Netflix show Stranger Things . The following year, David moved in with Lily amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rest is history. The pair got married in a Las Vegas ceremony in September 2020, and now live in Brooklyn, New York, with Lily’s two daughters from her marriage to Sam Cooper, 12-year-old Ethel and 11-year-old Marnie. Speaking to GQ about the start of his and Lily’s relationship back in 2022, David recalled the exact moment that he fell in love with the singer during their third date. He told the publication at the time: “I was just in this phase where I was like, I’m just going to be brutally honest about everything, because why lie? And I told her something about my life, about my beliefs…” David reportedly hesitated before adding: “It would take a really extraordinary person to be accepting of the things that I said. And I remember thinking: ‘Wow, that’s somebody I want to be around.’” The star didn’t divulge any further information about the beliefs he told Lily, or what they were in relation to. “I remember googling when I was with him, when I first started dating David, like, how many dates are you meant to go on before you sleep with someone,” she told Miquita. “And there was a different answer depending on whether they’re English or American,\" Lily added. \"I think English was five and American was seven. That was the Google protocol that I read.” The conversation started because the theme of the episode was “kink,” and a listener asked her and Miquita if they had ever “kink-shamed” somebody. Lily began by saying that she is incredibly open-minded as she referenced how honest she has been about her promiscuity over the years. “I’m quite into normalizing everything that people are ashamed about in themselves,” she explained. “I was talking to David about this last night; during the breakdown of my last marriage, I was very, very promiscuous and experimental, and I had sex with female sex workers.” “I did that for two reasons,” she continued. “One, to try and reclaim a little bit of the power where that conversation was concerned, but also because I think that lots of other people have done the same thing, and I think that when they hear someone like me talk about their own experiences in a non-shameful, sort of matter-of-fact way, then it makes people feel better about themselves.” “So I'm always wanting to do that,” Lily concluded. “To me, that's what art is; that's what creativity is; helping people come to terms with their own behavior, and behavior that society sometimes looks down on, but we’re all just human, right?” “David would love this! David would love this kinky bitch!” Miquita interjected, before earnestly asking her friend: “So why do you think this kinky bitch has gone? Where did she go?” “I think the alcohol had quite a lot to do with the kink for me,” Lily confessed. “Before I got together with David, I don’t think I’d ever had sex not drunk, actually. Unless, maybe, like, morning sex, but still a bit drunk and definitely high.” And earlier this month, Lily said that she believes she subconsciously sabotaged her success in America during the early days of her singing career by admitting to US border control officers that she’d taken drugs, voiding her working visa. Lily has been sober since 2019, and previously told Glamour : “I actually don’t even know if I’d be alive, if I’m honest, if I hadn’t got sober. Sobriety has just changed my life immeasurably.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Trends Reporter, HuffPost Justin Timberlake has addressed fans for the first time since he was arrested for allegedly driving while intoxicated earlier this week. The 10-time Grammy winner took the stage in Chicago for a concert stop Friday night amid his Forget Tomorrow tour, telling the crowd at the United Center that he’s had a “tough week.” “We’ve been together through ups and downs, lefts and rights,” he said as concertgoers cheered, according to video clips posted on social media. “It’s been a tough week. But you’re here, and I’m here, and nothing can change this moment right now.” He continued: “I know sometimes I’m hard to love. But you keep on loving me, and I love you right back. Thank you so much.” Timberlake was taken into police custody just before 1 a.m. Tuesday in Sag Harbor, a village of Long Island, New York, after his BMW ran a stop sign and failed to stay in its lane, according to Sag Harbor police. An officer described the singer as having “bloodshot and glassy” eyes, “slowed speech” and “a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage” on his breath at the time of his arrest, court documents said. Timberlake refused a breath test and “performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests,” police said. Edward Burke Jr., the singer’s attorney, said in a statement to HuffPost that he looked “forward to vigorously defending Mr. Timberlake on these allegations.” “He will have a lot to say at the appropriate time,” Burke stated. Timberlake is scheduled to return to Chicago’s United Center for another performance on his world tour Saturday. His next stops are set for Tuesday and Wednesday at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

    "article_content": "Trends Reporter Taylor Swift and her record-breaking Eras Tour took London by storm Friday. The Grammy winner not only serenaded nearly 90,000 fans at Wembley Stadium, but snapped a backstage selfie with none other than Prince William and two of his children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. “Happy Bday M8!” Swift wrote Saturday alongside her photo with William, who turned 42 this week. “London shows are off to a splendid start.” Within hours, the picture had garnered millions of likes on Instagram. Though Swift’s boyfriend, Super Bowl champion Travis Kelce , was included in that photo, William also took to social media to post an alternate picture without him. Swift was given a warm welcome across London, whose transportation system shared a redesigned transit map in her honor, replacing the names of regular stops and lines with references to her music. The singer even received a tribute from Buckingham Palace, with a brass and wind band performing her 2014 hit “Shake It Off” during the Changing of the Guard ceremony. “Can’t stop, won’t stop groovin,’” the royal family wrote online alongside footage of the performance. The London Zoo marked Swift’s arrival in town as well, announcing on social media that anyone with Eras Tour tickets could receive a discount on entry passes this month. The zoo also shared three throwback photos taken during a visit from Swift years ago. “She visited us in 2012, and now she’s back in London for the biggest tour of all time,” the zoo wrote, inviting Swift to stop by again. A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) The singer’s Friday concert, the first of eight scheduled shows at Wembley in June and August, drew high-profile attendees like Labour Party leader Keir Starmer . Nicola Coughlan of “Bridgerton” fame, as well as actors Salma Hayek and Cara Delevingne, were also spotted in attendance. “What better way to spend a Friday night than in the most exhilarating city in the world?” Swift reportedly told the crowd. But the singer had to pause Friday’s performance — which followed sold-out U.K. shows in Cardiff, Liverpool and Edinburgh — at least four times as concertgoers fainted amid an ongoing heat wave. Swift previously met with William during a 2013 charity gala at Kensington Palace, where she and Jon Bon Jovi brought him onstage for a rendition of “Livin’ on a Prayer.” Another royal, Meghan Markle , attended an Eras Tour performance in Los Angeles last year.

    "article_content": "Trends Reporter Jonathan Majors , the former Marvel star who was convicted in December of assaulting his then-girlfriend Grace Jabbari earlier that year, tearfully addressed the incident Friday while accepting the so-called “Perseverance Award” at the Hollywood Unlocked Impact Awards . “I reckon folks want to know about last year,” Majors said onstage . “As a Black man in the criminal justice system, I felt anger. I felt sadness, hurt, surprise. When they snatched me up out of my apartment in handcuffs, I didn’t feel like all that. I didn’t feel like Jonathan Majors.” “I felt like a little scared, weak boy,” he added. “Despite the support and the evidence that was in my favor, I knew shit was bad. And it was bad because of who I was and what I am. And this is what happens to Black people all too often … That’s a harsh reality I learned.” The predeclared winner at the fourth annual ceremony nonetheless cried onstage in the arms of his girlfriend Meagan Good . Majors, who was destined for stardom after Marvel cast him as an “Avengers” villain in 2020, saw the offer rescinded after his conviction . “We live in a world where men, Black men in particular, are propped up as either superheroes or supervillains,” he said Friday. “But I’ve come to realize, me personally, I ain’t none of that. I’m imperfect. I have shortcomings, I acknowledge them. I love my craft.” The 34-year-old was charged in March 2023 with assault, strangulation and harassment after an altercation with Jabbari. Majors, who pleaded not guilty, was convicted in December on misdemeanor third-degree assault and second-degree harassment charges. The actor was sentenced in April to 12 months in a domestic violence intervention program. The Beverly Hilton Hotel crowd listened in silence as Majors shared that his “faith has been tested and has been strengthened by this testimony” and said that living in “pitch black” taught him how to “run as hard” as possible when “a glimpse of light” reveals itself. Majors notably thanked several Black entertainment icons in his speech, including Whoopi Goldberg, Tyler Perry and Will Smith — whose own faith was seemingly tested before he slapped Chris Rock onstage at the 2022 Oscars — and concluded with a promise. “I received this award not just as an acknowledgement that I have persevered,” said Majors, “but as a command to be there for others and to help them when and if their trials come.” Need help?

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost Growing up as the oldest sibling, author Y.L. Wolfe often felt the lines between her role and her mother’s role were blurred. “By the time my youngest brother was born when I was almost 11, I was overwhelmed with feelings of responsibility for his welfare. I used to sit by his crib and watch him sleep just to make sure he was safe,” Wolfe, the oldest of four, told HuffPost. “It wasn’t that I thought my mother wasn’t competent ― but more that I felt we were both responsible for the family by that point in my life,” she explained. “As if I was literally ‘other mom,’ rather than big sister.” In other words, Wolfe is deeply familiar with “eldest daughter syndrome.” The internet is rife with thinkpieces about the plight of oldest daughters and tweets about how we ― I might as well reveal my bias here ― need to unionize: “If you are the oldest sibling and also a girl you may be entitled to financial compensation,” one woman joked on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Though “eldest daughter syndrome” is a pop psychology term ― you won’t find it listed as an official diagnosis in the DSM-V ― a new study suggests that there may be more science to the pseudo-syndrome than previously thought. A University of California, Los Angeles-led research team found that, in certain instances, first-born daughters tend to mature earlier, enabling them to help their mother rear younger siblings. Specifically, the researchers found a correlation between early signs of adrenal puberty in first-born daughters and their mothers having experienced high levels of prenatal stress. Why does age of adrenal puberty matter? Changes in skin (acne, for instance) and body hair happen during this phase, but so do changes in brain development. Adrenal puberty processes are believed to foster social and cognitive changes; basically, superficial physical changes correlate with emotional maturity. When times are tough and mothers are stressed in pregnancy, it’s in the mother’s adaptive best interest for her daughter to socially mature at a quicker pace, said Jennifer Hahn-Holbrook, one of the co-authors of the study and an assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, Merced. “It gives mom a ‘helper-at-the-nest’ sooner, aiding the women in keeping the latter offspring alive in difficult environments,” she said. Notably, adrenal puberty does not include breast development or the onset of menstruation for girls (or testicular enlargement, in the case of boys). The study posits that girls become mentally mature enough to care for their younger siblings while not being physically capable of having their own children, which would naturally draw them away from their older daughter responsibilities. Older brothers are seemingly off the hook when it comes to this kind of parentification : The researchers did not find the same result in boys or daughters who were not first-born. “One reason that we didn’t find this effect in first-born children who are sons could be that male children help less often with direct childcare than female children do, so mothers have less of an adaptive incentive to speed their social pubertal development,” Hahn-Holbrook explained. Plus, she said, previous research suggests that female puberty timing is more malleable in response to early life experiences than males. The results of this study, published in the February issue of Psychoneuroendocrinology (say that five times fast ― or just once), were a long time coming: Researchers tracked the families for 15 years, from the pregnancy stage to the babies’ teen years. Researchers recruited women from two obstetric clinics in Southern California during routine first trimester prenatal care visits. On average, the women were 30 years of age and pregnant with one child, not twins. It was their first pregnancy for roughly half of the participants. The women were nonsmoking and not using steroid medications, tobacco, alcohol or other recreational drugs during pregnancy. They were all over 18 years of age. At five different stages of pregnancy, the women’s stress, depression and anxiety levels were measured, and then measured cumulatively. The depression assessment asked the women to rate the truth of statements such as “I felt lonely,” while the anxiety question asked how often they felt particular symptoms, such as “jittery.” Of the children born to these mothers, 48% were female and 52% were male. As the children aged, characteristics of adrenal and gonadal puberty were separately measured ― things like body hair, skin changes, growth in height or growth spurts, breast development and the onset of menstruation in females and voice changes and facial hair growth in males. The study also measured childhood adversity to account for other factors known to correlate to early maturation or signs of puberty in children, like the death of a parent or divorce before age 5 and the absence of a father and economic uncertainties at ages 7–9. Taking all that into account, it was the eldest girls who matured the fastest when their moms experienced high levels of prenatal stress. Other studies suggest that there is some later-in-life payoff for highly responsible eldest girls: A 2014 study found that eldest daughters are the most likely to succeed out of any sibling type, while a 2012 study found that those who are eldest-born are more likely to hold leadership roles . The findings ring true for Wolfe, the aforementioned author who said she felt like a second mom to her siblings growing up. “I’m not at all surprised by what the study found,” Wolfe said. “My story is slightly different — I went through true puberty, not just adrenal puberty, at 12, though I suspect I experienced an early cognitive maturation.” The study is interesting for another reason as well: The findings add to social scientists’ growing understanding of fetal programming , a fascinating area of study that explores how stress and other emotional and environmental factors women experience during pregnancy affect their children long after birth. “This is a first-of-its-kind finding and is fascinating to look at through an evolutionary lens,” Molly Fox, a UCLA anthropologist and one of the co-authors of the study, said in a press release. In an interview with HuffPost, Fox delved deeper into how fetal programming works. “One fascinating theory is that when you’re still a fetus in your mothers’ womb, you get cues about what the world is going to be like, and your body can flexibly adjust the shape of your life-cycle to be optimally suited to those conditions you expect to encounter,” she said. Fox and her co-authors are excited their work is out there for the public to read, especially after following the families along for so long. The fact that the findings were published just as a cultural conversation about eldest daughters broke out was just a cherry on top, especially for Fox, a co-oldest daughter. (She’s a twin.) “As co-oldest, I think it’s a special role in any family because of the potential for closeness with my mother and capacity to help care for my younger siblings,” she said.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Watching the new FX series “Clipped” made me nostalgic for a particular era of the internet. 2014 was a boom time for digital media and the peak of the blogging era. Lots of websites were publishing smart and snarky reporting and writing. Twitter, though not without its faults, was a place where you could actually have some robust convers ations, rather than a pit latrine of conspiracy theories and sponsored content overseen by a manchild. In the spring of 2014, the story of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling exploded onto the internet, when TMZ published leaked audio of him going on a racist rant, as secretly recorded by his assistant and girlfriend V. Stiviano. There was a lot of sharp and thoughtful writing and reporting on all angles of the story ― what it said about the NBA and professional sports as institutions, and how it also went way beyond that. The Sterling saga yielded online conversations about an abundance of big subjects. People wrote all kinds of incisive pieces about race, gender, class, celebrity, labor, activism and housing policy. For years, Sterling and his wife Shelly had been stiffing and discriminating against Black and brown tenants in Los Angeles — not unlike another famous Donald on the other coast, who would run for president a year later. In addition to the serious discourse, people also had a lot of fun with the story, circulating jokes and memes on Twitter , a hallmark of this type of news cycle. (It also made an impression on me personally: As a junior in college at the time, starting to seriously pursue a journalism career, I have a distinct memory of the Sterling saga as emblematic of that era of digital media. Each day, I loved logging on to Twitter and finding the work of so many smart writers, dreaming of being part of it myself.) The visual tapestry of “Clipped” is reminiscent of that time, such as how each episode transitions between scenes using scrolling Instagram feeds — specifically, Instagram as it looked in 2014. But the six-episode limited series, premiering Tuesday on Hulu, loses a lot of the necessary context that the internet gave the story at the time. Based on “ The Sterling Affairs ,” a 2019 podcast from ESPN’s “30 for 30” series, the show would have worked better as a docuseries (perhaps on ESPN itself). By zooming out and featuring commentary from people who were involved in or covered the story contemporaneously, a docuseries could have brought more viewers into the enormous scope of this story and reflected on it a decade later. Dramatizing the Sterling saga in a prestige limited series, despite its many excellent performances, is an approach that’s unable to give the story the context it needs. But hoo boy, do the show’s actors make a scrumptious meal out of these characters. Ed O’Neill brings the requisite amount of cartoon villain energy to Sterling. Laurence Fishburne brings both gravitas and crankiness to Clippers coach and NBA legend Doc Rivers. Cleopatra Coleman and Jacki Weaver as V. Stiviano and Shelly Sterling, respectively, are also fantastic. Coleman in particular brings welcome depth and complexity to Stiviano, who in the public narrative at the time was often flattened and reduced to “the mistress.” The cast formidably accentuates the larger-than-life qualities of the characters in this saga. But the maximalism of some of the acting and the dramatic heights of the show inadvertently distract from the bigger issues at play, which the series gives short shrift. It even left me wondering if “Clipped” is unintentionally reproducing the salaciousness of the story itself. So much of the great writing about the Sterling saga at the time was able to scrutinize the initial tabloid coverage of the story, and underscore how all of it was so much more than a spectacle. By contrast, a dramatization with an excellent cast of boldface names playing these real-life people, all of whom have big personalities, invites and inserts more spectacle. Other than a few standout moments in the middle of the series, as well as a flashback episode that feels shoehorned in, the show is too limited in its scope, never pulling back the lens far enough. I can understand not wanting to make a show that hews too closely to the format of the original source material, essentially making a visual version of the podcast. Different mediums can serve different purposes and reach different audiences. If you’re interested in the drama and spectacle of this cast of characters, a limited series might be your preferred vehicle for consuming this story. But if you’re interested in the context, you won’t get much of that here. That’s a loss for viewers. So much of the Sterling saga wasn’t just about the story — it was about how it was covered, and how each news cycle found more and more layers to it. Sadly, a lot of those pieces are lost to time and bad decisions by media CEOs, who wiped away the work of plenty of talented writers. That era of the internet is long gone. A show like “Clipped” could have honored it, not just aesthetically, but substantively too. “Clipped” airs Tuesdays on Hulu.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost As the ruthlessly ambitious Peter in Broadway’s “ Stereophonic ,” Tom Pecinka gets to live out a 1970s rock star fantasy — replete with the sex, drugs and retro fashion — onstage. Though the actor describes his Tony-nominated performance as a full-throttle, emotional purge, he’s grateful to leave that experience behind after curtain call. “There are things I get to do as Peter that I don’t get to do in my life,” Pecinka, who is making his Broadway debut, told HuffPost. “Peter allows himself to blow up, and I’d be lying if I said getting to scream at someone wasn’t cathartic. But I like to keep him at the theater. I do a ritual every night where I take off the necklace I wear and say goodbye to him, because he’s not the most fun person to live with.” Now playing at New York’s Golden Theatre, “Stereophonic” has been nominated for 13 Tony Awards — the most ever for a Broadway play. On Tuesday, the show’s run was extended through Jan. 5 after originally being slated to close next month. Written by David Adjmi and directed by Daniel Aukin , the drama follows a Laurel Canyon-era rock band in the throes of recording an album. Peter is the band’s hot-headed guitarist and is involved in a tempestuous, on-and-off relationship with singer-songwriter Diana ( Sarah Pidgeon ). Peter and Diana’s bandmates are three Brits: bassist Reg (Will Brill) and keyboardist Holly ( Juliana Canfield ), who are a married couple, and drummer Simon (Chris Stack). They’re joined in their Sausalito, California, studio by a pair of hapless engineers, Grover ( Eli Gelb ) and Charlie (Andrew R. Butler). The band’s recording sessions are, of course, a fiery clash of egos. Over the course of three hours, the characters reveal their inner turmoil in between laying down music, which includes performing original songs by musician Will Butler, formerly of the band Arcade Fire. “Artists come to the show, and they go: ‘Oh, I know the pain and the joy of that process,’” Pecinka said. “But anyone who’s done a group project in elementary school where they were paired with someone they hate, or maybe they had to do all of the work because no one else did ... can also relate.” Watch the video for “Masquerade” from Broadway’s “Stereophonic” cast recording below. Much of the buzz on “Stereophonic” has emphasized the fictional band’s many parallels to Fleetwood Mac, whose masterpiece 1977 album “Rumours” was recorded as members Christine McVie and John McVie were on the brink of divorce, while Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks had also called it quits on their relationship. Pecinka spent months in guitar lessons in preparation for his role, sending videos to the show’s creative team to keep them abreast of his weekly progress. Though he looked to Buckingham early on, his interpretation of Peter also winks at Mick Jagger, Robert Plant and James Taylor, among other ’70s music icons. “I never felt like it was the Fleetwood Mac story, because these characters are so fleshed out, they felt like their own people,” he said. Vocally, he added, “my touchstone was 1970s Billy Joel, because that was the music I grew up with from that period. So it was already sort of in me.” A Wantagh, New York, native, Pecinka auditioned for “Stereophonic” in 2020, mere days before COVID-19 shuttered theaters nationwide. The play received its premiere off-Broadway staging in fall of 2023, and the actor said the chance to work with a contemporary writer was worth the wait. “Until then, my career had mostly been Shakespeare and Chekhov and Ibsen — dead people,” he quipped. Though “Stereophonic” is billed as a “play with music” rather than a musical, Pecinka and his cast mates were able to document the show’s songs for posterity on a new cast album . It’s an achievement the actor, who was told by casting agents that his rock tilt was ill-suited for traditional musical theater, is especially proud of: “It always caused me shame and sadness that I wasn’t able to do those things, but now I’m singing in the way I want to sing on Broadway.” Most of Pecinka’s off-stage time these days is spent preparing for the June 16 Tony Awards, where he’s nominated for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play alongside Brill and Gelb. Looking beyond “Stereophonic,” he’s eager to parlay his newfound acclaim into television and film work as well as theater. As for future roles, he believes they may have yet to be written. “I used to be more like Peter when I was younger ― a person who’s chasing success and working really hard,” he said. ”[But] the thing Peter has taught me is that my dream role may not even exist yet. I don’t feel like I’ve been pigeonholed. If I can maintain that, I’ll be a very happy clam.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost When S.E. Hinton published “The Outsiders” in 1967, many were surprised to learn that an author who so deftly probed young men’s experiences with toxic masculinity and class conflict was a woman. As a female director, Danya Taymor knew she’d similarly be going against expectations in bringing the musical adaptation of “The Outsiders” to Broadway. After all, the 1983 movie version of Hinton’s story was directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Going back to the source material, however, Taymor felt an instant “kinship” with Hinton’s coming-of-age tale. “My older brother, Ari, had his friends over at our house all the time when I was growing up, and I saw them in so many facets of being,” Taymor told HuffPost. “I saw them vulnerable, I saw them aggressive. I saw them interact with girls.” Hinton “felt compelled to write about these boys who were her chosen family with a compassionate gaze,” she continued. “I tried to direct this thinking of my 15-year-old self, because the story has an ability to put you back in touch with that self, when so many formative things happened.” Featuring a score by folk-rock duo Jamestown Revival and writer Justin Levine, “The Outsiders” opened on Broadway in April. At Sunday’s Tony Awards, the show is nominated in 12 categories , including Best Musical and Best Direction of a Musical for Taymor. Like Hinton’s book, the musical is told from the perspective of 14-year-old Ponyboy Curtis (played by Brody Grant ), one of three orphaned brothers and a member of a working-class “Greasers” gang in Tulsa, Oklahoma, circa 1967. Ponyboy is thrust into the center of rising tensions between the Greasers and a rival, upper-middle-class gang called the “Socs” after bonding with Sherri “Cherry” Valance (Emma Pittman), whose boyfriend, Bob Sheldon (Kevin William Paul), is the Socs’ ringleader. When a reckless altercation between the Greasers and the Socs ends in tragedy, Ponyboy and his best friend, Johnny Cade ( Sky Lakota-Lynch ), flee town. The threat of violence still looms, however, resulting in the much-buzzed-about “rumble” sequence , which involves dirt, rain, stage blood and some of the most breathtaking choreography on Broadway. “The Outsiders” marks Taymor’s return to Broadway after directing the 2021 play “ Pass Over .” Playwright Adam Rapp approached Taymor about “The Outsiders” after catching an early “Pass Over” performance ― an experience that Taymor now views as “kismet.” “For ‘Pass Over’ to be the project that connected me to ‘The Outsiders’ just felt right, because it’s so representative of who I am as an artist,” she said. “I trusted that.” In translating “The Outsiders” to the stage, Taymor pored through photo books on rural America by Larry Clark and Richard Avedon, while she and the cast visited Hinton , now 75, in her Oklahoma home. Also critical was the involvement of Angelina Jolie , who joined the creative team as a producer following the show’s 2023 run in La Jolla, California. In fact, it was Jolie’s 15-year-old daughter, Vivienne, who convinced her mom to sign on. Praising Jolie’s “rigorous artistry,” Taymor says the Oscar winner was a “fearless” presence in rehearsals and made herself accessible to the show’s mostly young cast. As for Vivienne, she noted: “Having an actual teenager around giving us feedback on what she was seeing was so important.” Taymor’s other professional guides include her aunt, film and theater director Julie Taymor , known for the stage adaptation of Disney’s “ The Lion King ” and the 2002 Frida Kahlo biopic “ Frida ,” starring Salma Hayek. “To see a woman succeed at the level she has, and with the integrity that she has, definitely had a profound effect on me,” Taymor said of her aunt. “She’s always encouraged me not to stay trapped in the box that the industry wants to put you in.” Moving forward, Taymor would also like to try her hand at film, though she has no intention of abandoning theater. While “The Outsiders” continues to draw enthusiastic crowds on Broadway, she’s excited to see the show staged regionally and in schools across the U.S. in years to come. “One of my hopes is that people will take it and make it their own and cast it in a way that feels necessary for their communities,” she said. “It speaks to everybody as an equal.” “The Outsiders” is now playing at New York’s Jacobs Theatre.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter It used to be that consumers never really cared how they accessed their favorite entertainment just as long as they could. Bootlegged blockbusters, still raking in millions at the movie theater, often came directly to them in plastic bags for cheap at the barbershop or hair salon. The hottest music could be downloaded onto their computers, compliments of sites like Napster or Limewire. Concerts were affordable even for young people with $6-an-hour part-time jobs in the late ’90s. Well, no one cares about access until it’s taken away from them — like when a federal court ruled in 2001 that Napster had to shut down after it was found liable for copyright infringement — or until it becomes a money-devouring complication. That latter fact was a catalyst for the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit just this year against Live Nation, which owns Ticketmaster, a major ticketing site that reached its pinnacle of disaster after some Swifties tried in vain to get tickets to see their girl perform live in 2022. We’ve now reached a point when the issue at the core of all of this can’t be ignored: the bureaucratic and often racialized structure of access. That was top of mind while watching “How Music Got Free,” director Alex Stapleton’s thoughtful new docuseries that traces the humble origins and spectacular fallout of music piracy. Inspired, in part, by the 2015 New Yorker article “ The Man Who Broke the Music Business ” by Stephen Witt, who’s also a producer of “How Music Got Free,” the docuseries illuminates the messy, legal and urgent problem of music access. And the series centers the brilliant, and until recently, anonymous Black mind behind it all. “How Music Got Free” is told through both archival and new interviews with experts, pirates, law officials, artists like Rhymefest and Eminem, record exec Steve Stoute, Interscope co-founder Jimmy Iovine, journalists like Rocsi Diaz, and high-level music marketers at Universal and Interscope. They help contextualize the story as they still struggle to untangle and reconcile the two-episode series’ pressing themes. I raised its foremost issue of the bureaucracy of accessing music early in a one-hour call with Stapleton. She immediately caught my drift. “First of all,” the director began, “I think that the bureaucratic nature of the labels and just industry standards is something that we’re always at odds with as both consumers and makers.” The story at the center of “How Music Got Free” is just one example, Stapleton added. “What we’re in right now with the music industry is where so much of the money is made in touring for artists and live performances,” she said. “Wherever you see that, you’ll see the prices just go up and up and up and up.” I’ll finish that… and up. For example, premium Taylor Swift tickets can be resold for upwards of $200K, while Beyoncé’s can be at over $1K. To put things into further perspective, the average ticket price in 2000 was $40.74, according to the International Journal of Music Business Research . Even with inflation, that price would only be $74.18 today. Throughout the late ’90s and early ’00s, the era on which “How I Got Free” mostly reflects, piracy became the perfect solution for fans that just wanted to access their favorite songs at a cheaper price (or totally free), and the perfect problem for recording artists and labels alike. For context, CDs cost the consumer on average $17, yet around $1 to manufacture at the time for both complicated and “arbitrary” reasons . But this was long before Spotify and Netflix, and before most people were fluent in the internet and MP3 downloading. Pirating was in all intents and purposes illegal. The labels, working with the FBI, saw to that. With “How I Got Free,” Stapleton argues that that was to the detriment of the industry, particularly because CDs would soon be obsolete and singles were rising in demand. “What I did want to pick at was this idea of what lengths the industry, or these corporate kinds of places, will go to,” she said. “It’s wild how little they won’t do. They won’t move off the dime. If they’re making money, it’s really hard for them to accept innovation and create change.” What’s particularly interesting about that presumed threat of piracy, as well as leaks, is that practically everyone was participating in this activity at the time — including Stapleton. After growing up on Southern hip-hop in Houston, the filmmaker moved to New York City in the ’90s and meticulously selected roommates based on whoever had the best digital music library. “Because we would share music, you know,” she laughed. “That was a prerequisite.” Stapleton’s personal contribution was a gold mine. “It wasn’t just hip-hop,” she recalled. “I loved finding weird treasures, like covers of Radiohead or other bands that I really loved. In that period, I loved Luda. Like, love, love, LOVED. And definitely OutKast. ‘Bombs Over Baghdad’ was t he Holy Grail moment.” Much of that music could be heard in “How Music Got Free.” “It was a soundtrack to my life — and it was all pirated,” Stapleton said. Her love of hip-hop is part of what drew her to the docuseries. Having worked with LeBron James’ production company SpringHill on her 2018 docuseries, “Shut Up and Dribble,” she was looking to collaborate with the team again when executive Philip Byron brought Witt’s article to her attention. “I was hooked,” Stapleton remembered. “Like, instantly.” She started coming up with ideas after reading Witt’s 2016 book, which bears the same title as the docuseries, that expands on his article — a sprawling investigation of the societal, industry and personal motivations that contributed to the rise and fall of piracy. “As a Black Southerner, I loved reading a story where at the center of it was this Black guy from Shelby, North Carolina,” Stapleton said. “And it was a hip-hop story.” Indeed one of the most fascinating parts about Witt’s story, and Stapleton’s adaptation of it, is Bennie Lydell Glover, a Black, and by most means ordinary, CD plant employee from the tiny town of Shelby. In the ’90s, Glover began smuggling music out of the plant to a covert online network of pirates. He soon made more money doing that than his full-time job there, and successfully built his own film and music pirating network. But by the end of the 2000s, Glover, amid an increased crackdown on piracy, was indicted on one count of felony conspiracy to commit copyright infringement and served three months in federal prison. Navigating multiple setbacks while shooting during the pandemic in 2021, Stapleton traveled to Shelby for interviews with Glover, who appears so disarming even on camera that everyone — no matter their relationship with him — knows him as simply Dell. With the assistance of Witt, who is also interviewed in the series, the director built enough trust with Glover that he helped her land interviews with people in the area that were close to the story, including other factory workers at the time. “Dell was an open book,” Stapleton told me. With Witt’s work as the canvas, Stapleton’s “How Music Got Free” does an impressive job further illustrating the mundanity of Glover’s life and incredible hustle. “He wanted to provide, like most Americans want to provide for their families,” Stapleton said. “And he had this gift, where he saw an opportunity. That’s very American to be an entrepreneur. Then he got busted — I mean, it was the worst time to be busted with a crime like this.” Not like any era is really an ideal time to be convicted of a federal crime, but, as Stapleton said, “No one understood.” Even investigators interviewed in the series scrambled to understand the laws that were being written in real time as more information about the internet and piracy became available to them. Glover’s story is the heart of “How Music Got Free,” in large part due to Stapleton’s obvious compassion toward him and what he laid the groundwork for, and makes a compelling case for the role of racism in the justice system. This is a southern Black man with shoddy legal representation, according to his own ponderings in Witt’s article, against multimillion-dollar and mostly white-owned corporations, and alongside mostly white accomplices with often more financial privilege. Glover didn’t stand a chance. “In the IRL world, he had no access,” Stapleton said. “But on the internet, he was the king maker of access. And I think that there’s something in that.” She grappled with that a bit before she got to a more pointed question: “How is he any different from Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates or Paul Allen?” Beyond the obvious racial difference, those white guys — along with Steve Jobs, who Stapleton also mentions — are recognized as technology game changers. Glover, even knowing what we know now, is not. The Jobs comparison is a critical point for her. Yes, he was an innovator, the director acknowledges. “But what he built was a gateway drug for people,” she said. “The only reason it was successful was because of an illegal activity: piracy.” That’s a fair point. Both iTunes and the iPod launched in 2001, and most iPod users filled theirs with pirated music. “The fact that he put a ‘don’t download’ sticker on it and that made it OK is really wild to me,” she continued, adding that that is not a diss at Apple. “It’s more like, let’s look at the inverse negative part of this, which is the guys who proved that the technology worked and helped make you money all went to federal prison.” Stapleton’s valid insight there is especially striking because much of it isn’t in the docuseries. It is inferred, but there isn’t a voice that really puts this into such a sharp perspective. While the director admitted that “there were so many other worlds that I would’ve wanted to explore and to have gotten into” had she had more time with the project, the more implicit examination of the role of race and racism in “How Music Got Free” is intentional. “Some of my past work was very like, ‘I’m going to tell you what I mean,’” Stapleton explained. “Like, ‘Shut Up and Dribble’ or my film about white privilege [‘Hello, Privilege. It’s Me, Chelsea’]. Some people sit down for that. A lot of people just judge the film by the title and won’t sit for it.” Fair point. “I thought with this one — it’s very in your face, when you really look at it,” she continued. “I just wanted people to meet Dell where he was. I wanted to trust the audience.” Still, on a similar point about the role of race, “How I Got Free” does reflect that a large number of pirated music disproportionately impacted Black and/or hip-hop artists. Part of that is wrapped up in the fact that Universal and Interscope were at their height, and hip-hop, which dominated their catalogs, had a lot of crossover demand particularly from middle American young white guys. That demographic is also represented among most of the pirates. Stapleton said Witt’s book digs a bit deeper into the hip-hop part of this story and the influence of Universal and Interscope at the time, and she had hoped to do that more in the series as well. But she contextualized all of that a bit more with me. “The reason why the world got so many leaks that were hip-hop-related was because what kept the lights on at the plant, for the most part, was printing Universal CDs,” she explained. “And specifically, all of Interscope’s artists were printed there.” This was also around the time when West Coast hip-hop, Dr. Dre especially, blew up. “The rise in ’92, ’93, when Dre put out ‘The Chronic,’ that was kind of the first album that white kids started to listen to in suburbia,” she said, agreeing with my earlier point. “But it only got bigger and crazier. The numbers were insane.” While none of the artists interviewed, or even shown in archival footage, were thrilled about their music being pirated, people like 50 Cent, Eminem and Tupac were bigger than ever. “The piracy wouldn’t have worked if the demand for the music wasn’t there,” Stapleton said. Sure, but as Eminem says in the series, there are many other people beyond him that need to be paid off one record. A whole team of creatives weren’t considered in the piracy game. Timbaland, 50 Cent and Eminem all talk about going to extreme measures (Eminem mentioned that he had his team disguise his CDs while still in production, so no one would know what they were), paranoid that they might have been working or were friends with a mole. Meanwhile, the record labels were trying, and often, to counteract piracy and leaks. “I think it was a financial thing,” Stapleton said. “But I think from an artistic perspective, it definitely hurt? I can’t imagine people getting rough cuts of my films. I would be mortified. So, I can understand. I think that the debate became very two-dimensional, right?” Let’s break that down then. “In the era of Napster and [its founder] Shawn Fanning and all that stuff, it was just, artists make too much money = bad, kids downloading music = good,” she continued. “And even though I will support kids downloading music till the cows come home, it was a lot more complex than that.” She argued that that would have been the perfect time to have a more complex conversation about what was happening and what needed to happen: “Because we could have potentially figured out some new shit, but nobody really wanted to have that conversation.” “How Music Got Free,” then, ultimately vindicates the pirates and piracy. How do interviewees including Eminem, who’s also a producer on the series, feel about that? “He would have to ultimately answer that question,” Stapleton replied. “But I think that all of the artists realize, ‘Damn, if only we had known what the fuck was going on…’ Most were literally too obsessed and freaking out that it was somebody in the studio, someone close to them.” Stapleton also recognized that Eminem was one of the most leaked artists at that time, and could understand why he was upset. Each of the artists interviewed run a gamut of emotions as the story unravels in the series. “I think it’s cool and interesting for Eminem to kind of own up and not try to switch the narrative,” Stapleton said. “It was important to show how not cool he was with piracy and leaks.” That’s real. We’re still grappling with the consumer-artist-corporate entertainment relationship today as at-home technology continues to rapidly evolve. It seems like every day now there’s a new article panicking about the lack of movie theater attendance. Meanwhile, a single ticket costs on average $20, and it’s likely that the movie will be on a streamer within a month anyway. Or pirated for you to watch somewhere for free. Stapleton is sensitive to how that all folds into the conversation around consumer access. “I think the film industry is probably having a really huge reckoning, thanks to technology and everything we learned during COVID, and all the things we can do in a remote situation without having to interface,” she said. She thought about that some more before adding: “It’s not even so much the streamers right now. It’s the status quo of even other production companies. They just don’t want to change.” With “How Music Got Free,” she said she’s trying to bring home the point that change remains as inevitable as it ever was, but innovation can still be possible and beneficial. “When you come to a fork in the road where technology meets art, meets how we receive product, you can get with the program and try to figure it out, or resist and lose out,” she said. “The music industry is still in a fallout period. It’s never going to be the same as it was.” Stapleton then said this: “And I think that’s good and bad, for artists.” Sure, because no one, including the artists, wants to lose a nickel on a chance. “Yeah, absolutely,” she said. “I think what will be interesting is: Will these industries go, ‘Well, we can still be profitable. Our profits won’t be astronomical because that’s not sustainable. But how can we still create things?’” That’s the crucial question. “I think that most artists, from people who make music to people who make films to people who write — we want to be paid for what we do,” Stapleton continued. “So that we can put food on the table and support ourselves, for our families or for ourselves.” Of course. “We want people to be able to access what we make,” she added. “And I think that these are all questions that I have. How do we all enjoy art but in a way that’s economically viable and fair while still allowing artists not to fall into the trope of the starving artist their whole life?” The answer to that, even for Stapleton, remains elusive. Or perhaps overlooked, as with the untapped potential of piracy in Glover’s time. “How Music Got Free” makes you sit with that. “If we’re just having a conversation in an echo chamber with Silicon Valley and the huge corporations and the richest artists of all time,” Stapleton said, “we probably will be missing out on some really interesting and out-of-the-box solutions.” “How Music Got Free” premieres on Paramount+ June 11.

Hey, everyone! It’s Ty Cole with another edition of The Culture Catchall. Summertime is here, so the newsletter will hit your inboxes on Tuesdays for a bit. We should all be outside, touching some grass and shaking some ... margaritas by the pool on Friday evenings anyway! Let’s get into the story of the week. For all the naysayers who thought Will Smith wouldn’t and couldn’t do numbers after that incident, how are you feeling now? “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” is absolutely crushing the box office, proving that Smith and Martin Lawrence — who returned as detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett in the fourth installment of the successful, high-octane franchise — are still a dynamic duo. The film has shattered Hollywood’s expectations, reminding everyone that these actors are still box-office heavyweights. The movie earned $56 million from 3,885 theaters in its domestic debut and opened with $48.6 million internationally. That put its global total at $104.6 million, surpassing its production budget. After an interactive press tour and hyping up fans by sharing behind-the-scenes moments, you would think the world would be singing Smith’s praises. Unfortunately, that wasn’t always the case here. On social media, The Hollywood Reporter shared an article under the title “Box Office Upset: Will Smith’s ‘Bad Boys 4’ Delivers Huge Victory for Actor With $56M U.S. Debut, $104.6M Globally.” The post sparked negative reactions online, with users questioning what was so “upsetting” about the film’s impressive performance. So let me get this straight. For weeks it’s been doom and gloom for theaters and now because it’s Will Smith you’re upset the film did well? The racism is blatantly showing. https://t.co/M23Zm2360A Yall better have the same energy for when Brad Pitt next movie comes out ‘Upset’ because yall thought that the slap had upended his career. Don’t think so much next time, it doesn’t pay well. Can’t just let the man live without bringing up that slap huh - had to add in that “Huge Victory for Actor” line instead of just saying its performing well. Naturally, public figures had to weigh in, too. Stephen A. Smith shared his thoughts on his YouTube show . While conceding that he’s still a fan of Will Smith, the sports commentator went on a tangent about not wanting to see the “Hitch” actor in movies. Instead, he wants Smith to sit down for an interview and explain why he struck Chris Rock at the 2022 Academy Awards. “I’m just saying a lot of folks ain’t get over what happened,” he said in his rant. “A lot of folks find it hard to just go to the movies to watch you. I’m one of those people, and I never missed a Will Smith movie.” Well, Stephen, you and everyone else who can’t seem to move past the slap will just have to wait on that. Quite frankly, it’s 2024 — and I’m ready for this discussion to be over. It’s interesting that we can’t just celebrate the success of the “Bad Boys” franchise without diminishing its accolades by bringing up old news. Will Smith already apologized to Rock for the slap incident. His new film even makes a nod to the slap in a pitch-perfect moment during the fourth act. (Notably, the movie also nods at Lawrence’s infamous 1996 incident in which he walked into traffic and yelled at cars.) The only person who should have any sort of feelings or response to Smith is Rock himself. If you are not him, it’s OK to stay quiet. It’s time to MOVE ON! I don’t care nor want to hear it anymore.

    "article_content": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost If the polling is accurate, Rep. Jamaal Bowman is the heavy underdog in Tuesday’s Democratic primary for New York’s 16th Congressional District. The topline story of the race is, understandably, pro-Israel groups’ record-breaking spending against Bowman, a passionate pro-Palestinian advocate who has dubbed Israel’s invasion of Gaza a “genocide.” Super PACs backing Bowman’s challenger, Westchester County Executive George Latimer, have outspent pro-Bowman super PACs on the airwaves by a 9-to-1 margin, helping make it the most expensive House primary in history. The independent spending arm of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee alone has spent $14.6 million on television, digital and direct-mail advertisements. “They are so afraid of us — those who oppose the working class, multiracial, multieconomic, multicultural democracy that we are trying to build,” Bowman told volunteers getting ready to canvas the Bronx’s Co-Op City neighborhood on May 26. “They’re spending more money in this race than they have ever spent in the history of any race. That’s how afraid AIPAC is.” It is impossible to predict the results of a counterfactual scenario where Bowman did not face this kind of spending. But while he would have undoubtedly fared better if he were not up against an avalanche of super PAC money, his problems predate the lopsided advertising blitz. Bowman, 48, was trailing Latimer, 70, by 17 percentage points in early April, before advertising began, according to a poll commissioned by the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, which is supporting Latimer. The mid-April internal poll released by Bowman’s campaign, by contrast, had him up by one percentage point. The Latimer campaign’s own internal polling in January, reviewed by HuffPost, was somewhere in between those two surveys, showing the county executive ahead by 10 points. Latimer was also more popular according to their own polling, with 67% of district voters having a favorable view of him and just 12% having an unfavorable view, compared with 49% favorable and 38% unfavorable for Bowman. Bowman’s team, for its part, highlighted voter support for a cease-fire in the region as evidence that his positions remain popular. (Bowman called for a cease-fire on Oct. 16 .) Bowman’s support in the district, which includes a sliver of the northeastern Bronx and all of lower Westchester County — a mix of diverse working-class cities and leafy, affluent suburbs — has been tenuous from the moment he won in 2020. His vote against the bipartisan infrastructure bill in 2021 and his pulling of the fire alarm in Congress this past September further undermined his standing with many moderate-to-liberal Democrats . Following the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, his shift away from an even-handed posture on Israel-Palestine toward a hard left-wing stance cost him some progressive Jewish support and motivated existing Jewish detractors to get more active in politics. “I was always having to be his defender. And I could no longer defend his behavior.” “I was always having to be his defender,” said Danielle Tagger-Epstein, chair of the Rye City Democratic Committee and a Bowman donor as recently as January 2023. “And I could no longer defend his behavior.” Before Oct. 7, Tagger-Epstein had been frustrated with Bowman’s failure to follow through on her efforts to arrange conversations with her rabbi and other Jewish friends, as well as his July 2023 decision not to attend Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s speech to Congress. (Bowman cited Herzog’s failure to do more to protect Palestinian human rights; however, critics note that Herzog is a figurehead rather than a political leader.) “After October 7, I couldn’t even look him in the face,” said Tagger-Epstein, who is also active in J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group. All of those factors created an environment where Latimer, a 35-year veteran of suburban politics with a strong local base for support and a reputation as a detail-obsessed incrementalist, felt comfortable entering the race with AIPAC’s support. Before any money even hit the airwaves or mailboxes, the Latimer campaign and allied groups used a steady stream of opposition research about Bowman’s past and present views — standard fare in any campaign — to paint him as a radical activist rather than an effective lawmaker. “He’s really his own worst enemy,” added a J Street activist who requested anonymity to protect their relationship with Bowman in the event of his victory. The voter, who sees AIPAC as bad for both U.S. political integrity and Israel’s long-term interests, lost patience with Bowman’s most anti-Israel comments and stances after defending the congressman to the person’s coreligionists for so many years. “He created alliances that shouldn’t be created. I shouldn’t be allying with an AIPAC candidate,” the J Street activist said. A New York Democratic strategist supportive of Bowman’s bid had a similar assessment. “AIPAC was going to make a lot of noise regardless. He made it a lot easier. He became a bogeyman,” said the strategist, who asked for anonymity for professional reasons. “I’m upset that AIPAC is going to get wins this cycle from people who had already written their death sentences for lots of other reasons.” Bowman, who was first elected in 2020, won reelection easily in 2022. But he benefited greatly from his opponents’ inability to unite behind a single challenger: Westchester County legislators Vedat Gashi and Catherine Parker, who both ran against him, split the anti-Bowman vote. As a result, his margin of victory obscured the simmering frustration with him among registered Democrats. Bowman would only receive 54% of the total ballots cast. It’s the kind of thin majority that might have served as a warning about the precariousness of his standing in the district. But considerations of political self-interest on the topic of Israel were far from Bowman’s mind at the start of his second term. His trip to Israel in 2021 had actually made him less confident in Israeli leaders’ willingness to make the compromises necessary to create a Palestinian state, leading him to lean in to his pro-Palestinian convictions. In addition to boycotting Herzog’s speech, Bowman co-sponsored Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s (D-Mich.) resolution recognizing the “nakba,” or catastrophe, the Palestinian term for the mass expulsion Jewish forces inflicted on them during the creation of Israel. The resolution rankled some local Jewish leaders because it endorsed a right of return for Palestinian refugees to Israel’s internationally recognized borders, which would make Jews a minority in Israel and which even its proponents admit would end Israel as a specifically “Jewish” state. That was all before the current war. The Palestinian group Hamas’ deadly attack on Oct. 7 and Israel’s ferocious response in the eight months since have hardened views on either side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including for many in the United States. In Westchester County, where some 130,000 residents are Jewish — a little over one-tenth of the population, who comprise a relatively larger share of the Democratic primary electorate — the international situation has added volatility to an issue where Bowman already did not see eye to eye with many Jewish constituents. On Oct. 7, the Hamas-led attack killed 1,100 Israelis, mostly civilians, and captured 250 hostages. For the broad mainstream of pro-Israel U.S. Jews, the impact of the day has been lasting and radicalizing, conjuring memories of anti-Jewish violence and persecution from the days of the Holocaust. In response, Israel launched a military operation in Gaza, which has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians , the majority of them civilians; laid waste to the built infrastructure of the region, displacing almost all 2.1 million Gazans; and precipitated severe shortages of food and basic medical supplies. For progressives and other Americans sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, this has been a criminal war of annihilation — the capstone of decades of oppression, including ethnic cleansing in 1948, a military occupation of Palestinian lands since 1967 and a blockade of Gaza since 2007. Bowman’s response to the violence was quick. He condemned Hamas’ “horrific attacks” in a written statement on Oct. 7, blasted an Oct. 8 pro-Palestine rally where participants praised the Hamas attack, and later castigated a local chapter of the Black Lives Matter movement for lionizing the Hamas assailants. But he is decidedly among the contingent of people who have been pushed to the left by Israel’s response to Oct. 7. Unlike when he ran in 2020 and 2022, there is now virtually no daylight between Bowman and the activist left on the topic of Palestine. In late October last year, Bowman declined to vote for a nonbinding resolution condemning Hamas on the grounds it failed to address “the urgent need for de-escalation” amid growing Palestinian civilian casualties. Speaking at a pro-Palestinian rally in White Plains, New York, in November, he even called allegations of sexual assault during the Hamas attack unsubstantiated “propaganda.” Bowman repudiated those claims in late March when a video of his comments emerged, but the quote has made it into AIPAC’s digital ads . Bowman has also taken heat from some Jewish voters for what many see as a lack of emotional sensitivity. Although he attended a rally for the victims of Oct. 7 in Washington and has met with the families of Israeli hostages, Jewish constituents noticed Bowman’s absence at the numerous local community vigils for the Israeli dead and hostages following Oct. 7, even as he made impassioned appearances at pro-Palestine rallies. For Diana Lovett, a mom and small business owner from New Rochelle, New York, who voted for Bowman in 2020 and held a fundraiser for him in 2022, his absence at the various local Oct. 7 vigils — there were events all over the district — was part of the reason why she began to lose faith in him. “There were many missed moments to be in community with and in solidarity with the Jewish community,” she said. Latimer, by contrast, was a featured speaker at the first vigil and brought the house down with his characterization of the fight against Hamas as a battle of good versus evil. Many attendees came up to him in tears afterward, according to multiple people who were present. “There are many Jews like me who understand the legacy of the civil rights era and the importance of not letting AIPAC distort our democracy.” Bowman’s team, however, said he was discouraged from attending. When he reached out to the Westchester Jewish Council about attending the first and largest community-wide vigil for victims of Oct. 7 at a synagogue in White Plains, the umbrella group’s CEO, Elliot Forchheimer, discouraged Bowman from attending, according to a senior Bowman aide, who requested anonymity to speak freely. Forchheimer informed Bowman that he would likely be the only federally elected official there, that it was unclear how he would be received and that it would likely be better for him to skip the event, the aide added. Forchheimer did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the conversation. “He got beaten up by the Jewish community so much when he was trying to work in good faith,” said a progressive Jewish Democrat now supporting Latimer, who requested anonymity to protect community relationships. “Just like they were hostile to him, he was getting more and more hostile to the community.” But Bowman retains a significant core of support from progressive Jews affiliated with the left-wing group Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, which counts 500 members in the district, and Jewish Voice for Peace, a smaller group that is explicitly anti-Zionist. In early June, JFREJ’s Jews for Jamaal initiative turned out about 100 people for a bagels event in Hastings-on-Hudson, a village in Westchester County, before heading out to canvass the district. These Jews see Bowman as a tribune of their Jewish commitment to social justice, from the advancement of Black civil rights to the protection of Palestinian human rights. “There are many Jews like me who understand the legacy of the civil rights era and the importance of not letting AIPAC distort our democracy,” said Howard Horowitz, a Bowman supporter and retired marketing executive from New Rochelle who is active in Jewish Voice for Peace. “I’m concerned about the future of the Jewish community and about their values.” Iris Arno, a former school board member and climate activist from Hastings-on-Hudson who is active in Jews for Jamaal, has been frustrated with the level of rancor she’s witnessed toward Bowman from other Jews. She has seen Bowman signs around town defaced, including one where an Israeli hostage poster was pasted over his face. “Jamaal is unfairly called antisemitic. I would not support someone who is antisemitic,” she said. “He is faulted for calling for a cease-fire early on, calling for humanitarian aid and being against the Netanyahu government, which I think many Jews are, both here and in Israel.” Bowman’s challenges with the mainstream Jewish community date to his upset election win in 2020, but relations with the constituency have deteriorated since then. Then-Rep. Eliot Engel, the three-decade Jewish incumbent Bowman unseated in 2020 , was broadly popular with the district’s Jewish community. As chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Engel was both a domestic liberal and a staunch AIPAC ally who supported Israel uncritically. “Engel was terrific. And Bowman was — he was OK. He was more J Street,” said Carole Daman, a retired lawyer and AIPAC activist from New Rochelle who has never voted for Bowman but is mobilizing against him for the first time. “But then, as time has gone on, he’s gotten more affiliated with Rashida Tlaib.” Bowman took the challenge of addressing Jewish mistrust seriously both before and after his 2020 win. With the support and advice of JFREJ and its political arm, the Jewish Vote, Bowman cultivated a progressive Jewish constituency during his first campaign. JFREJ pioneered an ad-hoc group, Jews for Jamaal, and helped Bowman craft an Israel-Palestine policy platform that was at once authentic and worded to avoid inflaming passions. On his campaign website’s detailed foreign policy page , he backed “U.S. aid to help Israel confront [its] security challenges,” but also opposed subsidizing “the continued occupation of the Palestinian people.” Bowman also engaged even his more conservative pro-Israel critics. He responded to an open letter criticizing him from Avi Weiss, a prominent Modern Orthodox rabbi in a Bronx neighborhood later drawn out of the district, with an open letter of his own. In it, Bowman laid out his support for a two-state solution and his opposition to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement — which calls on Americans to divest from Israeli financial interests to pressure Israel to end its occupation and allow a right of return for Palestinian refugees — even as he connected the difficulty of Palestinian life under Israeli occupation to the racism and police brutality Black Americans experience. “I know that we both have much to learn from each other’s experiences, and I hope that you may give me the chance,” he concluded . Following Bowman’s 2020 victory, Mark Mellman, the Democratic pollster who founded the Democratic Majority for Israel, conceded to HuffPost that Bowman’s careful messaging and outreach to the Jewish community “did work to obfuscate the difference” between himself and Engel on Israel policy. Soon, Bowman would get reinforcements. J Street, which is supportive of increased U.S. pressure on the Jewish state to stop expanding settlements and violating Palestinian human rights, endorsed him ahead of the 2020 general election . In his first term, Bowman’s voting record on Israel — and willingness to defy the socialist left — burnished his reputation among even some critics. Bowman’s visit to Israel with J Street in November 2021 notably cost him the endorsement of the Democratic Socialists of America, which backs BDS and is anti-Zionist. J Street endorsed Bowman’s reelection in 2022 ; the group’s super PAC spent $100,000 on digital ads backing his bid. “Now you have people without knowledge or real understanding blaming Jewish people for what Israel is doing, which is leading to the rise of antisemitism.” J Street is not exactly a kingmaker in Westchester County. And the group, whose super PAC has invested six-figure sums for other Democrats facing AIPAC barrages, has decided not to spend in Democratic primary elections this cycle. But while J Street was supporting Bowman, its activists acted as a volunteer rapid response team for him within the Westchester Jewish Council, the county’s influential umbrella group of synagogues and mainstream Jewish organizations (JFREJ is not affiliated with the group). J Street leaders publicly commended him for supporting U.S. funding for the Iron Dome defensive technology system and helped him draft responses to attacks from local rabbis and the Westchester Jewish Council. However, two years later, things look very different. By late January 2024, J Street had had enough of Bowman and withdrew its endorsement. The last straws for the organization were Bowman embracing the term “genocide” to describe Israel’s conduct in Gaza and his praise for controversial anti-Israel scholar Norman Finkelstein at a rally in Yonkers, New York, where Finkelstein had also appeared, according to people familiar with J Street’s thinking. (Bowman subsequently expressed regret for praising Finkelstein, who initially likened the Oct. 7 attack to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising during WWII and said it “warms every fiber of my soul.”) Latimer now cites the rescinded endorsement as evidence that Bowman is outside the mainstream. “He said things like ‘genocide,’ ‘apartheid.’ That’s why J Street pulled their endorsement,” Latimer told HuffPost in late May. Bowman continues to sound less and less like Israel’s progressive supporters — the kinds of people who are favorable to tough measures like conditioning aid yet still ardently support the idea of a Jewish country. In a recent podcast interview , for example, he characterized U.S. support for Israel as a gesture of solidarity for “another settler colonial project.” Bowman has also reconciled with the Democratic Socialists of America. The group’s New York City chapter endorsed him in late May. In audio of his May 25 endorsement interview , Bowman, for the first time, expressed openness to embracing the BDS movement and promised not to vote to fund Iron Dome again, saying he had only done so originally because he didn’t want his “‘no’ vote to be misinterpreted as ‘I want Jews to be killed.’” Learning what Bowman said to the socialist group was “the absolute final straw for people who might have been in the middle,” said the Jewish Democrat who now supports Latimer. In an interview after his May 26 event in Co-Op City, HuffPost asked Bowman to make his case to progressive Jewish voters who might share his concern about Palestinian rights but are uncomfortable with his strident rhetoric. He argued that his effort to force changes in Israeli policies would actually help reduce antisemitism in the United States. “We haven’t had honest conversations about Israel being held accountable. And that’s why we are in this horrible place right now, because we’ve allowed Israel to continue to say they represent all of the Jewish people,” he said. “Now you have people without knowledge or real understanding blaming Jewish people for what Israel is doing, which is leading to the rise of antisemitism.” Latimer’s campaign literature and stump speech are plastered with the slogan “real progressive results, not rhetoric.” Bowman highlighted his disagreement with this framing during the first televised debate with Latimer on May 13, arguing against a zero-sum tradeoff. “Rhetoric creates movements in grassroots organizing that leads to American revolutions! That is what we need in this moment,” Bowman declared. “We need rhetoric and results. We have both.” But Bowman’s history of radical comments — and one controversial vote in particular — have made his revolutionary vision a tougher sell to some suburbanites. Shortly after Latimer got into the race, negative stories about Bowman began popping up in mainstream news outlets. As a middle school principal, Bowman dabbled in 9/11 conspiracy theories and honored a convicted cop killer on the walls of his school. It also emerged that Bowman had declined to condemn the inclusion of Louis Farrakhan , head of the Nation of Islam and a rabid antisemite , in a Black history mural in the district, even as he clarified that he disagrees with Farrakhan’s antisemitism. Likewise, Bowman has a reasonable explanation for his decision to vote against the bipartisan infrastructure framework bill along with five other progressives. He wanted to keep pressure on for a vote on the more ambitious Build Back Better bill. The latter bill passed the House and stalled in the Senate, but became the basis for the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act. Bowman saw the distributional impact of the BIF bill as inadequate, telling HuffPost, “91% of those BIF jobs go to white men. This is a majority minority district. Where’s our economic development program?” But the symbolic vote against the BIF bill has provided the single biggest attack line for AIPAC to hammer him on. “The things that [Bowman and other leftists] are voting against because they’re not getting everything they want, to me, sounds very much like children who are packing up their toys and going home,” said Jim Metzger, an architect and photographer from Hastings-on-Hudson who supported Bowman in 2022. Metzger, who counts himself as a progressive Zionist deeply opposed to the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was also disappointed in Bowman’s response to the Oct. 7 attack and emotionally pleaded with Latimer to run after he spoke at the Hastings-on-Hudson Oct. 7 vigil. As a chief executive obsessed with technocratic reforms, Latimer makes for a clear foil to Bowman’s left-wing idealism. He loves discussing what he calls the “real guts” of policymaking — knowing, for example, how to bring branches of government together to upgrade the county’s electric vehicle charging network or which federal Housing and Urban Development officials to prevail upon for a new affordable housing grant. Given Latimer’s focus on such details, HuffPost asked for his overarching policy vision. He argued his obsession with incrementalism and proper implementation are the answers to Donald Trump’s strongman theory of governance — the world of “I alone can fix it.” “We say to people, ‘Don’t give all the power to one person. We in democracy can still solve problems. It takes time, but we can show you how to get real results,’” Latimer said. Of course, AIPAC’s intervention has been critical to Latimer’s candidacy. While the group’s largesse has amplified a genuine grassroots revolt against Bowman in this case, there is no doubt its injection of millions of dollars into congressional primaries has helped limit the scope of debate about Israel. Any lawmaker interested in, for example, imposing stricter conditions on U.S. aid to Israel risks facing a deluge of pro-Israel money. While Bowman has shifted left on global issues, Latimer, who insists his pragmatic style is “progressive,” has shifted right over the course of the race as he seeks to hoover up every last anti-Bowman vote. He has said he opposes tax increases of any kind, a stance that could put him at odds with President Joe Biden , who wants to undo some of the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations. While speaking to HuffPost, Latimer turned defensive when pressed to answer for his alliance with AIPAC, which, as a single-issue group, also endorsed dozens of House Republicans who objected to certifying the 2020 election results. “I have what I consider a mainstream position on Israel,” he said. “Most House Democrats feel what I feel.” What are Latimer’s “mainstream” views? He holds Israel’s Arab neighbors and Palestinian negotiating partners almost entirely responsible for the Palestinian failure to obtain statehood and freedom from occupation, the issue that remains at the heart of the regional violence. “Now you have a very conservative Israel government — how shocked am I at that? The progressive Israeli governments never got enough cooperation to move forward.” “The Israeli effort to find a dance partner in the Arab world has been hard to find — ’67 war, ’73 War, intifada,” Latimer said. “Now you have a very conservative Israel government — how shocked am I at that? The progressive Israeli governments never got enough cooperation to move forward.” When HuffPost tried to interject a question about whether it might still have been inadvisable for consecutive Israeli governments to continuously build Jewish settlements on conquered land it supposedly wanted to give up in a peace deal, Latimer refused to engage with the premise. “You’re changing the argument,” he said. “To get to the two-state solution, you need confidence that you have a dance partner that will work with you. Hamas is not a dance partner.” But Hamas is not in power in the West Bank, the larger of the two Palestinian territories. The Palestinian Authority, the nominal governing body there, has largely cooperated with Israel’s security apparatus at great political expense , with no advancement toward statehood to show for its efforts. One might say the Palestinian Authority doesn’t have a dance partner. Pressed on whether he supports Biden’s decision to pause a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, Latimer repeatedly refused to say, insisting instead that House members should not weigh in on individual presidential decisions. “I support President Biden in his efforts,” Latimer said. Latimer’s defensiveness about his record has sometimes spilled over into racist fear-mongering about Bowman’s platform or base of support . In a June 10 debate hosted by the League of Women Voters, Latimer tied Bowman to Dearborn, Michigan, a hub of Arab Americans that has not been a significant source of donations to Bowman’s campaign. “Your constituency is Dearborn, Michigan. Your constituency is San Francisco, California,” he said. “It’s not Harrison. It’s not Tuckahoe. It’s not Scarsdale.” The Jewish Democrat who now supports Latimer hopes the county executive will be open to more progressive views about Israel-Palestine policy once he is in office. “He could have put some light between himself and the AIPAC crowd, and he wouldn’t have lost five votes,” the Jewish Democrat said.

During an appearance on “State of the Union” Sunday , CNN ’s Kaitlan Collins pressed the governor to explain why he thinks his political disagreements with Biden make the Democratic president a despot. “I understand you don’t like President Biden’s policies on immigration or student loans,” Collins told Burgum, a contender for Donald Trump ’s 2024 vice presidential spot. “But, respectfully, you’re calling the democratically elected president a dictator.” Citing Biden’s use of executive orders, Burgum said, “I just think that there’s again a double standard here. He is bypassing the other two branches of government to push an ideological view of — whether it’s on economics or whether it’s on climate extremism — he’s doing that without using the other branches.” Collins pushed back, telling the governor, “I don’t think anyone expects the Republican governor to agree with President Biden on that. But it’s not a dictatorship.” “Well, I think again, part of where this word has come from has been a nonstop media attack on President Trump saying that he might use executive orders when he takes office,” Burgum replied. Somehow managing to muddle his message, Burgum went on to say Biden should be using executive powers to strengthen security at the southern U.S. border. In response, Collins reminded the governor that Trump signed 220 executive orders during his tenure in office, far more than the 139 Biden has enacted “in the same timespan.” During his “State of the Union” appearance, Burgum also conveniently ignored Trump’s own remarks about flirting with a dictatorship if reelected.

He then riffed that while Swift is performing her Eras Tour, the Foo Fighters are performing an “Errors Tour” because “we’ve had more than a few eras and more than a few fucking errors as well.” “That’s because we actually play live, what?!” he said, shrugging his shoulders as the crowd applauded. “Just saying.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas) has raised questions about his own alleged drug scandal after he accused President Joe Biden of planning to take “performance-enhancing drugs” ahead of his debate against Donald Trump this week. Jackson, a former White House physician, announced he would be requesting Biden take a drug test both before and after the debate while speaking to Fox News ’ Maria Bartiromo during an interview on “Sunday Morning Futures” over the weekend. Jackson told Bartiromo he had “no choice” but to ask if the president was being medicated after witnessing his performance at March’s State of the Union address . “There was a Joe Biden that came out that was not similar at all to what we see on a day-to-day basis for the last 3 1/2 years,” he said. “And there’s surely no way to explain that other than he was on something. That they’d given him medications.” Jackson offered a detailed description of how he thought the president’s doctors would be medicating him, claiming Biden’s trip to Camp David prior to the debate would give his team an opportunity to experiment with “getting the doses just right.” This sounds like more of an admission than an accusation coming from an individual accused of running a pill mill from The White House by some pic.twitter.com/B4RK3SBxCg Asked what drugs the president could be taking, Jackson listed off a pharmacy’s worth of medications, including drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, as well as stimulants like Adderall and Provigil. Jackson’s accusations seemed a little too on the nose considering he was implicated in his own alleged drug scandal after his time as the head of the White House Medical Unit. In 2018, a report was released by the office of Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a ranking member on the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, that claimed Jackson allegedly gave a White House Military Office staffer a “large supply” of the opioid Percocet without going through the proper procedures. The report also alleged that White House staffers had nicknamed Jackson “Candyman” after witnessing his loose approach to prescribing controlled substances. Jackson was the White House’s top physician under President Barack Obama and Trump. He exited the role in 2018 and became Trump’s chief medical adviser a year later. In January, a report by the Defense Department’s inspector general found that from 2017 to 2019 of the Trump administration, White House physicians liberally prescribed controlled substances to Washington aides in violation of federal law, all while keeping subpar records of the medications being dispersed. In response to the report, which did not name Jackson directly, a spokesperson for the doctor told NBC News that he was not the director of the White House Medical Unit during the bulk of the period records cited in the report were from.

Kelce’s cameo cropped up in a skit for “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” which takes place during the “Tortured Poets Department” section of Swift’s tour. Donning a top hat and a black tailcoat, Kelce carried the Grammy-winning singer to her red velvet-colored seat where a revised version of the normal routine for this part of the set continued. Normally, two top hat and black tailcoat-wearing men get Swift all dolled up in time for her to sing “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.” But with Sunday’s rendition, Kelce powdered Swift’s face, as well as his own, and busted out a few dance moves, according to videos from social media users . Before continuing with her set, Swift then blew him a kiss as he and the two others exited. The show was the fourth of eight in London for Swift’s Eras Tour. The tour started in March 2023 and ends in December 2024. In May 2024, the show was upgraded with new additions from her April album “The Tortured Poets Department.” At a recent London show on Friday, Swift acted out a special gesture to Kelce during her song “So High School.” The singer pretended to pull back and release an arrow at him, a move Kelce has done previously during his NFL games.

On Sunday, Barbara Res told MSNBC’s Ali Velshi how she witnessed Donald Trump joke that a new hire from Germany “remembers the ovens” which were used at Nazi extermination camps during the Holocaust. “He was bragging amongst executives about how great the guy was and he was a real gentleman and so neat and clean and then he looked at a couple of our executives who happen to be Jewish, and he said, ‘Watch out for this guy, he sort of remembers the ovens’ and then smiled,” revealed Res, who left the company in 1998. “Everybody was shocked,” she said. “I cannot believe he said that. He was making a joke about the Nazi ovens and eating people.” In the months leading up to election day, Trump has tried to shame Jewish Americans who plan to vote for President Joe Biden. In March, he told his former deputy assistant to the president, Sebastian Gorka , that “any Jewish person that votes for Democrats hates their religion.” “They hate everything about Israel,” he said of Democrats. “And they should be ashamed of themselves because Israel will be destroyed.” Not long after, a Biden spokesperson condemned his comments, saying the “only person who should be ashamed here is Donald Trump.” “Trump is going to lose again this November because Americans are sick of his hateful resentment, personal attacks, and extreme agenda,” James Singer, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, said in a statement.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter It takes about 30 minutes of writer-director Andrew McCarthy’s new documentary “Brats” to realize that it’s not really about anything. Or rather, it’s about vaguely hurt feelings. That’s not to seem inconsiderate. Celebrities are human and well within their right, just as much as anyone else, to explore the difficult emotions they have about something that has impacted them — for better and worse. “Brats” is trying to have a complex conversation, though it mostly exists on vibes. The film reflects on the effects of the “Brat Pack” moniker, given to a group of young white movie stars in the ’80s, including McCarthy, by journalist David Blum in a 1985 New York magazine article . It was a nod to the “Rat Pack,” which referenced a similarly popular group of entertainers but from the ’40s and ’50s — including Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin — that was a catchy phrase to describe wildly successful superstars/friends who often partied and worked together. According to legend , it was actor Lauren Bacall who originally came up with the otherwise throwaway name when she walked in on Davis, Frank Sinatra, Martin and the others having an alcohol-fueled good time in Vegas one evening and said, “You look like a goddamn rat pack.” Then she turned on her heels and walked away, probably. OK, that last line was added there for effect. But also to highlight a phrase Bacall likely instantly forgot about. Davis, Sinatra and the others were well respected and enjoyed success throughout the end of their lives, apparently unaffected by the “Rat Pack” label. McCarthy has a different perspective of what happened to him and his group, though. Or so he aims to articulate in “Brats.” Yes, he and his peers — including Molly Ringwald, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe and Emilio Estevez — were making big money, went to clubs and often co-starred in films like 1985’s “St. Elmo’s Fire.” But they were also, as per the director’s biggest gripe, serious actors . They were in great films like 1980’s “Ordinary People,” 1982’s “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” 1983’s “The Outsiders” and “Risky Business,” and 1985’s “Back to the Future” and “The Breakfast Club.” McCarthy feels like the article and moniker that followed the actors in other interviews, which he includes in archival form in the film, didn’t capture that. For whatever it’s worth at this point, Blum’s article does a very good job of dropping the reader right into the scene, illuminating its actor subjects exactly where they’re at (a bustling scene at the Hard Rock Cafe in LA, to be exact) ― which is the mark of any great writing. It captures the point that they’re young, white-hot in Hollywood and having lots of fun with their new fame. What it doesn’t do is create a particularly flattering image of the stars. They come off a little flighty and self-involved. For instance, Estevez checks out a “Playmate of the Month” nearby. It’s also sarcastic at times, complete with a list of Brat Pack superlatives, such as “The Hottest of Them All — Tom Cruise, 23” or “The Most Gifted of Them All — Sean Penn, 24.” It’s cheeky, and gets its largest point across that a traditionally older Hollywood had seemingly suddenly birthed a previously elusive class of young actors in their 20s that were thriving. To put this into a more current perspective, consider it along the lines of how Elle magazine recently published its “ Hollywood Rising Class of 2024 ” package highlighting the new and hot young stars on the block. Blum’s article pulls off the veneer, but it accomplishes a similar thing. From a journalist perspective, the “Brat Pack” piece, which only mentions McCarthy once, by the way, is a masterful snapshot that serves as a good reminder that journalists aren’t interviewing stars to be their friends. They’re there to tell the truth about what they see and what you tell them. Nothing more. That’s a hard fact that McCarthy only kinda realizes in “Brats,” even though Estevez, who the director interviews at what appears to be a mansion in the film, is the one to raise this point for him. “Brats” follows McCarthy as he attempts to reunite with some of the actors mentioned in or associated with the “Brat Pack” article to hear their thoughts on how it affected them. In short, it didn’t seem to have as grave an impact on them as it did on McCarthy’s sense of self and his own career. Moore, who recently garnered acclaim at the Cannes International Film Festival for “The Substance,” adds crucial nuance, reminding McCarthy that they were all young and, for her in particular, juggling both ambition and excess . They were far from perfect. Lowe playfully asks McCarthy whether a certain drunken night even happened, alluding to an evening where Davis himself appeared, during a rare clashing of both worlds. Lowe’s and McCarthy’s conversation infuses the film with a hint of nostalgia while reflecting on hard-learned facts about themselves and the privilege they all had early in their careers. The interviews with actors Lea Thompson, Ally Sheedy, Jon Cryer and Timothy Hutton, who are all steadily working as the aforementioned, are versions of the same thing, and once again raise a critical question about “Brats”: What is it about, actually? We don’t really get the answer. McCarthy continues to seek a sense of justification for his feelings as he meets with “Pretty in Pink” and “St. Elmo’s Fire” producer, Lauren Shuler Donner, who rightfully tells him that “Brat Pack” was one of the best things that actually happened to his career. Because then everybody knew his name . Bingo. Not every actor gets to say that. As if finally coming to terms with what he’s projecting with the title of his film, it’s scenes that highlight McCarthy’s curiosity and humility that are far more interesting to watch yet few and far between. Like when the director sits down with Blum, who graciously appears in the film and essentially tells him that he would write the exact same article today after he’s pressed about it. It’s clear that McCarthy in this moment seeks some kind of acknowledgment of wrongdoing that he doesn’t ever really get. They have a very thoughtful conversation that may or may not have satisfied the director, but certainly crystallizes the obvious misunderstanding between journalist and subject. The recognition of privilege is something no one puts into sharper focus than Ira Madison III, a Black and queer cultural critic who is also the only non-white person in the entire documentary. Madison tells McCarthy that Black folks like him who grew up watching films with “Brat Pack” members were compelled to see themselves in their stories. And they often did so fondly. Frustratingly, McCarthy doesn’t really engage with what Madison is actually saying there. He acknowledges it as true, but it would have behooved the director, amid his own seemingly self-obsessed rant about a nearly 40-year-old moniker, to also think about the advantages he was also granted with it that eluded many others. There are several discussions that would have deepened “Brats,” which ultimately leaves the audience with the question of, well, were they brats, actually? Was the label deserved in that way? Considering the way the documentary unfolds, an even more awkward question rises to the fore: Is McCarthy still a brat? Maybe that’s his point, but that would be a bit of a cop-out. There’s a great opportunity here to truly delve into what it feels like to have to wrestle with whether you’re a good actor or just famous, young and white? Blum’s article, to McCarthy’s overarching point, leaves that unclear. But that’s how a lot of media labels function. They don’t exist to validate the actor or their talent. (That’s what their management team should be doing). They’re there to engage with their readers and audience, to help identify this person or group of people in a fun and/or truthful way so that they’re remembered at all . Many celebs are vying for the attention of audiences. Not all of them get to be part of a “Brat Pack” or be the “Sexiest Man Alive,” or certainly not a “Nepo Baby,” a phrase that merely speaks to an undeniable truth about privilege in Hollywood yet somehow still manages to confuse . These are labels that make up some semblance of truth about who they are as celebrities. By the end of “Brats,” it’s hard to tell whether McCarthy actually reconciles any of that. Actor Judd Nelson, one of several actors he spends much of the film trying in vain to connect with (Ringwald is another one), finally calls him back. Will that conversation be just another trip down memory lane to satisfy nostalgia-hungry audiences or another effort for McCarthy to validate his own conflicted feelings? Or will he actually feel challenged? We never get to see how the conversation with Nelson plays out. The movie ends there, and so does any hope that anyone learns anything from this. “Brats” premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival and will drop on Hulu June 13.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer “Who needs fresh air when there is fresh gossip?” quips Lady Danbury in the opening minutes of the second half of “Bridgerton” Season 3. It’s a sentiment to which both members of the ton ― that is, the upper stratum of society depicted in “Bridgerton” ― and fans of the show can relate, especially those who have been waiting four long weeks to hear Penelope’s answer to Colin’s post-carriage marriage proposal. It spoils nothing to reveal that Penelope (played by Nicola Coughlan) says yes, or that she shares her news with the ton in her next installment of her gossip column, Lady Whistledown’s Society Papers: “Dearest Reader, while most seasons of our fair marriage mart follow a predictable pattern, this author likes it most when there is a surprise.” Their engagement may be a shock to members of the ton, but both it and the progression of Colin (Luke Newton) and Penelope from friends to lovers will not surprise the viewer. The tension of Colin not knowing Penelope’s hidden identity, the threat her writing poses, and the implied social dangers of this revelation are predictable. Instead, the true surprise of this season’s final four episodes is not the friends-to-lovers romance but the way “Bridgerton” highlights friendships, especially those between women, and the way it follows in the tradition of spinoff “Queen Charlotte” to explore what marriage really means. While the first two seasons largely focus on why people get married (whether for love, duty or stability), this season follows in the footsteps of “Queen Charlotte” to examine what marriage means for a woman. How does it grant agency? How does it constrain it? What do you do if, like Penelope, you’ve managed to find independence and are now faced with the realities of giving it up? “Tick Tock,” the first episode of the season’s second half, opens with Colin leading Penelope into the drawing room of Bridgerton House to announce the news of their engagement to his family, including his betrothed’s former best friend, Eloise (Claudia Jessie). The news, and the fact that her brother still doesn’t know that Penelope is Whistledown, enrages Eloise. Her anger becomes even more complicated when Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel) announces a large monetary reward for anyone who can unmask the writer’s identity. In the second half of the season, the external threats posed by Queen Charlotte and Eloise (and her new friend Cressida Cowper, played by Jessica Madsen) are contrasted with the internal struggle Penelope faces. “Ladies do not have dreams. They have husbands,” Lady Featherington (Polly Walker) tells her daughter shortly after the engagement, when Penelope feels she must give up her writing to become a wife. In this context, Penelope’s desire to have both a pen in her hand and a ring on her finger is just another way of posing the age-old question: Can you, especially if you’re a woman, have it all? To answer this question for herself while navigating the external threats of her hidden identity, Penelope turns to the women in her life. The conflict between Penelope and Colin drives the romance-focused plot, but these female-driven friendships, and the larger themes they explore, are what make the second half of this season worth watching, offering proof that the character development in the show is paying off. The second half of the season shines in Penelope’s interactions, and ripples outward to touch Eloise’s relationship with Francesca (Hannah Dodd) and the Featherington family’s relationships with each other. Penelope gets a deeper understanding of her mother and the imperfect decisions she’s made, finds a way to repair her broken relationship with Eloise, and starts to show her sisters grace and opens herself up to receiving it back from them. This season’s joy is also felt in the friendships of the ton’s older set, especially among Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh), Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) and Queen Charlotte, who must all, in their own ways, reexamine the past to move forward (especially the part of the past that involves handmade birthday hats and feelings of powerlessness in the face of power). Some of the best moments occur when the older and younger women interact, especially the mothers and their daughters and Lady Danbury and Penelope. The emotion and depth of these female interactions are wonderful, but they make the second half of Colin and Penelope’s story feel shallow. Colin wants to be her knight in shining armor, but she does not want to be rescued — and he doesn’t know how to redefine his definition of “husband” or “masculinity” to accept Penelope as Whistledown, or support her when her identity is discovered. While Simon (Regé-Jean Page) and Anthony (Jonathan Bailey) had seasons that delved fully into their emotional worlds, Colin is not given the same treatment. This shortcoming turns the moments when Colin is challenged to change his stereotypical thinking or behavior into echoes of present-day masculinity crises , and ultimately makes the pair’s relationship, and the show as a whole, feel unbalanced. Colin is not given the opportunity to redefine what it means to be a husband in the same way that Penelope redefines what it means to be a wife. This shortfall is most apparent in the season’s climax, a moment at the last ball of the season that is so cheesy and over-the-top and full of on-the-nose CGI butterflies (Penelope’s transformation is complete!) that it borders on unwatchable. It undermines the depth the show has fought so hard to create — the loose threads it has woven did not need to be tied up into such a perfect bow. However, despite the overwrought ending, the female friendships of this third season’s second half won me over. While there has been criticism this year that the show is too predictable and potentially growing stale, I find ― leaving the ending aside ― that it uses the tropes and patterns of the romance genre to its advantage. In this way, the constraints of this traditionally feminine type of storytelling mirror the constraints traditionally imposed upon women. As “Bridgerton” depicts female characters finding their power in a society that constantly denies it to them, it parallels the way Shonda Rhimes and new showrunner Jess Brownell have reimagined a genre to amplify women’s voices. (They just need to remember those voices don’t always need a cheesy monologue accompanied by special effects.) Ultimately, this season proved that Penelope’s identity as Whistledown doesn’t negate her writing’s influence, and the same is true for “Bridgerton’s” classification as fun genre television. Relegating Penelope’s society paper to “just gossip” robs her words of their larger power in the same way that criticizing “Bridgerton” for its genre-defining characteristics undermines its impact. Both instances are further proof of what tends to happen when women create something commercially successful to be consumed largely by other women, especially when that something portrays sex and can be denigrated as a “guilty pleasure.” It may be two long years before the show’s next installment, but I’ll be looking forward to both the promise of another swoony, predictable romance and the voices of my favorite women in the ton. I expect the fourth season (presumably about Benedict) to follow the same patterns and tropes as the others, and I also anticipate it will use the female characters and friendships it’s developed to give those genre hallmarks greater depth. Hopefully, the next season can do the same for its leading man. “Bridgerton” Season 3 is now streaming on Netflix.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter In many ways, the release of “Black Barbie: A Documentary” was inevitable. Months after “ Barbie ” hit theaters and melted the minds of white feminists everywhere, an examination of the actually groundbreaking path of the single Black doll at the periphery of that movie seems marginally necessary. That’s partly because pop culture has been in a yearslong “representation” phase in which, for example, a film that rightfully asserts the existence of Blackness in a stereotypically white space like Barbie’s is sometimes considered essential for that alone. But is “Black Barbie” good? It occasionally feels like that should be less important than what it’s about. From writer-director Lagueria Davis, “Black Barbie” tells the doll’s origin story, in part through the testimonies of the Black women who helped bring her to fruition. One of those women is the filmmaker’s own aunt: Beulah Mae Mitchell, who in 1955 was one of the first and only Black employees at Mattel hired as a toy tester. This affectionate and personal spirit is an undercurrent of the documentary, in which Davis is also a character. Through voice-over narration, she tells the audience that she’s anti-doll or, perhaps more accurately, a Barbie skeptic who is initially unable to see why so many people, particularly Black women like her aunt, would still today be captivated by a toy. Most of “Black Barbie” — the whole first hour of its 90 minutes, to be exact — illuminates that through a long-gestating narrative around representation. Prior to 1980, all Barbies were white. It wasn’t until Mattel hired its first Black designer — Kitty Black Perkins, who is interviewed in the documentary — in 1978 that the reality of a Black Barbie was seriously considered. Before then, it was just something that Mitchell and a few others pitched to the otherwise white and noncommittal Mattel team. With Perkins leading the charge, Black Barbie was born. And subsequently, a generation of Black girls — at the risk of sounding trite, though that would mimic many of the sentiments repeated in “Black Barbie” — began to see themselves reflected in the dolls. “Crowning this doll as Barbie is telling the world that Black is beautiful, too,” actor Ashley Blaine Featherson says in the film. Former Miss Black California Isis Mckenzie Johnson gets emotional thinking about what the doll meant to her: “There was nothing that I could relate to when I watched television that I could associate with myself and find an escape from the reality that was beating me up because of the way that I looked.” Monica L. Bailey, a community coordinator and storyteller, recalls putting hair grease on her white Barbie dolls and coloring their eyes brown to connect them to her. “Having that as a standard made me and other Black girls feel inadequate,” she says. “I needed to be them.” She begins to cry during what she says next: “I just remember not feeling like I was beautiful because of my skin and my hair texture, and being around people who didn’t look like me, didn’t accept me. It was very trying.” There are several more moments like that throughout “Black Barbie,” successfully capturing the doll’s impact on Black girls in particular. But at the same time, these feel heavy-handed and don’t really challenge the narrative or move it beyond what you might expect to see in a story like this. To add to that, there are platitudes about Black Barbie from others interviewed — like “it allowed the Black girl to be the heroine of the story,” a line from Patricia A. Turner, a professor in the African American Studies Department at the University of California, Los Angeles. Or this note about white Barbie from Shonda Rhimes, an executive producer of the film: “When you’ve gone your whole life and have never seen anything made in your own image, there is damage done.” “Black Barbie” also includes interviews with various Black women who were firsts in their own right and now have Barbie dolls modeled after them. But it feels as though their accomplishments are being likened to the existence of a toy. Among them are Misty Copeland, the first Black woman to become principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre; Ibtihaj Muhammad, the first woman to wear a hijab while competing for the U.S. in the Olympics; and Rhimes, the first woman to create three hit shows with more than 100 episodes each. Davis’ apparent effort to have firsts celebrating a first, while as hackneyed as some of the earlier moments in the film, gets the point across. But “Black Barbie” highlights a far more interesting statement in its last act as the film interrogates the real-world impact of Barbie on racially diverse kids today, which finally shakes the table in this otherwise conventional story. “I think Barbie is not going to do anything that you have not done,” says Antwann Michael Simpkins, a candidate of philosophy in UCLA’s Sociology Department. “And that’s on the parent end, as well as Mattel’s end. I don’t want to place onto Barbie the work that we should be doing as a society to dismantle.” Simpkins goes on to suggest that neither Barbie nor Mattel should bear the sole responsibility of affirming children’s self-worth and identity. “The ultimate in-work of authentic diversity, equity and inclusion is to disrupt the institutions, the violent structures, the violent dolls, the doll-like worlds that exist because of the long legacy of colonialism,” Simpkins adds. “Until we are doing that work, we’re just playing with ourselves.” This is such a mic-drop moment that the documentary literally just moves on to the next scene entirely. But, thankfully, it doesn’t drift away from actual conversations in the classroom and the real world, making the last half hour of “Black Barbie” the most fulfilling part. That’s because it does what the bulk of the film isn’t bold enough to do: explore the limitations and, oftentimes, the futility of representation, as well as some of the dialogues around it. For example, “Black Barbie” re-creates Mamie and Kenneth Clark’s “ doll test ” from the 1940s, when the two psychologists showed kids a Black doll and a white doll — identical in every way except the color of their skin — and asked them which they one preferred. The results often concluded that kids across the racial spectrum were conditioned to think the white doll was better. Beyond its eye-opening roundtable of researchers and educators, led by Amirah Saafir, a professor of child and adolescent studies, “Black Barbie” follows relationship expert Yeshiva Davis, a licensed marriage and family therapist, as she duplicates the doll test today. This time, she uses dolls spanning the racial and gender spectrum. The conclusions are not much different than they were in the 1940s. At one point in the film, a young Black boy points to a white Barbie doll when asked which is prettiest, while several Black girls consider a few of the Black Barbies pretty and take pride in the fact that they affirm their own beauty. But when asked which of the Barbies is the real Barbie, they all point to the white doll. It’s a startling reflection of how far we haven’t come, in spite of the first hour of the film painstakingly ruminating on the opposite. Or maybe it’s more that representation is relative. Actor Gabourey Sidibe, for instance, chides the look of the original Black Barbie for being “light-skinned,” while others point out the lack of kinks in her Afro. “I preferred that color,” Perkins says plainly when asked about the Barbie’s skin tone. The birth of Black Barbie showed that change was possible in the toy world. But how much has it actually done in the real world, especially today when children, as highlighted in other scenes throughout “Black Barbie,” are more particular about the images they want to ingest? It’s not just about the existence of a product, the toy’s booming popularity or even the billions of dollars it makes. It’s about how kids feel about themselves, beyond the ability to play with a doll that might look like them. While their self-affirmation on account of the toy is uncertain, the success of the still largely white and male Mattel has essentially always been guaranteed. In fact, in the years after Perkins and her successor, Stacey McBride-Irby, left Mattel, a white man named Bill Greening became the designer of Black Barbie. “Black Barbie,” gratefully, doesn’t shy away from challenging why that is, including in interviews with Greening and others at Mattel that tout how far the doll has come while occasionally deflecting valid criticism. (Awkwardly, Mattel seems to have considered the issues raised in the documentary, since the film’s postscript includes a statement noting examples of progress. These include the company’s Future Leaders Innovating Play initiative, which provides internships to Black undergrads across the nation. It also explains that three participants in the program have been hired as full-time employees.) Like with last year’s “Barbie,” the question becomes whether commercialized representation is enough to satisfy underserved communities, or if we’re going to do the real-world work of demolishing societal, educational and familial conditioning that influences self-worth starting at a young age. We can talk about representation as it pertains to the art we consume or the toys that we gleefully play with all day — and we already have, exhaustively. But beyond making white corporations more money, it really does too often feel like, to borrow Simpkins’ words in “Black Barbie,” we’re just playing with ourselves. “Black Barbie: A Documentary” hits Netflix on Wednesday, June 19.

Before we dive in, I want to wish you all a Happy Juneteenth. To all the Black people out there, I hope you’re taking the day off to relax, celebrate and enjoy some well-deserved downtime. It looks like Taylor Swift is swiftly becoming known as a thief to the public — and I’m gonna break it all down for you. Let’s get into why the girls are giving Ms. Swift the bombastic side-eye. Swift has been dropping new editions of her album “The Tortured Poets Department” since it was initially released on April 19. Earlier this year, fans speculated that Billie Eilish might be shading Swift after she told Billboard it’s “wasteful” when artists release multiple versions of vinyl albums. “I find it really frustrating as someone who tries to be sustainable,” Eilish said. “Then you see some of the biggest artists in the world making 40 different vinyl packages with unique features just to get you to buy more.” Whew. In the same month, Eilish announced her new album, “Hit Me Hard and Soft,” which was set for release on May 17. But guess what? Swift dropped three new editions of “The Tortured Poets Department ″ album just one day before Eilish’s new release. Social media went wild, with one fan calling Swift “greedy.” i love you taylor, but this is just greedy. couldn’t have released this last week or next week? but now that you know there’s competition for #1 this week, you gotta go and play these stunts. it’s honestly tiring because you did this with sza too. just stop and let other people… love how billie said she’d wait till ariana released eternal sunshine to release her album & here’s taylor mass releasing to block billie...mind u she just released an album with 31 tracks...just greedy 💀 pic.twitter.com/RccoagMxJ1 https://t.co/XpD7Wx1oLZ in regards to what taylor swift has done to olivia, sza and now billie i just don’t understand the greed. you debuted with 2M+ first week, what more could you want? the greed is just otherworldly to me. https://t.co/01Q7BrpPOH Oh, but there’s more. It was projected, according to The Guardian, that Charli XCX’s album “Brat” would reach No. 1 in the U.K. during the week of June 14. But then Swift released six U.K.-only album variants around the same time, so instead she nabbed the No. 1 spot, blocking Charli XCX from the feat. Of course, fans didn’t hold their tongues about it. that's pathetic as hell i’m so over this woman. blocked. removed from spotify I’m disappointed that Taylor Swift seemingly would try to block Charli XCX and Billie Eilish from achieving the top spot on the charts. Given Swift’s immense status in the music world, it feels unnecessary and somewhat selfish to use these tactics to keep rising to the top. She has already accomplished so much and has a massive fan base that ensures her success. should’ve been #72 but anti feminist taylor swift blocked her 🤬🤬 https://t.co/uyep4D47TI In my opinion Taylor Swift has gone too far now to even be considered a girls girl. Chasing the charts is such a weird flex. But what do you think? #taylorswift #brat #ttpd #charlixcx #billieeilish #charts The way Taylor Swift preaches \"feminism\" while constantly tearing down other female artists is gross You’d think Swift would be celebrating and embracing new talent, not trying to overshadow them. Her focus should be on enjoying her well-earned success and supporting emerging artists. By doing this, she could help foster a more inclusive and supportive music industry where everyone has a fair shot at the spotlight.

    "article_content": "GOP pollster and communication strategist Frank Luntz shared his concerns over how Americans could respond to Thursday’s presidential debate, suggesting that the candidates’ interactions could prove disastrous for democracy. “I’m very nervous about the outcome of this debate,” Luntz told Martha Raddatz on Sunday’s edition of ABC’s “ This Week .” “A lot of people are going to watch. A lot of people have made up their minds about the two candidates but haven’t made up their minds whether or not our democracy still works.” Luntz warned about the candidates repeating the first 2020 presidential debate which CNN ’s Jake Tapper referred to as “ a hot mess inside a dumpster fire inside a trainwreck ” at the time. “If we have another reaction like that first 2020 debate — where the two candidates just go at each other — at some point, our system breaks. Our democracy comes undone,” Luntz said. He continued, “And so I’m going to be watching not just for the cute quip, or trying to figure out who won or lost, but I’m going to be watching American reactions and whether or not this adds to our discontent and our division, or whether it begins to heal it.” Former President Donald Trump , in the months leading up to this week’s debate, suggested that Joe Biden used cocaine ahead of his recent State of the Union address and called for the president to be drug-tested before the faceoff. The GOP pollster noted that Trump is “good at tearing apart his opponents,” adding that he’s watching out for how Biden responds to his rival’s attacks. “Because don’t forget, it was Joe Biden who said to Donald Trump , ‘ Would you just shut up? ’ And the idea that you say that to a President of the United States in a national debate — that coarseness divides and undermines this sense of democracy, being civilized and disciplined,” Luntz said. “And I just hope that both candidates remember that there actually are some things more important than an election: the next generation.” The Biden-Trump debate is set to air at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday and will be moderated by Tapper along with CNN ’s Dana Bash . Ahead of the first 2024 debate, pollster Frank Luntz tells @MarthaRaddatz : “If we have another reaction like that first 2020 debate, where the two candidates just go at each other, at some point, our system breaks.

    "article_content": "CAIRO (AP) — More than 1,300 people died during this year’s Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as the faithful faced extreme high temperatures at Islamic holy sites in the desert kingdom, Saudi authorities announced Sunday. Saudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdurrahman Al-Jalajel said that 83% of the 1,301 fatalities were unauthorized pilgrims who walked long distances in soaring temperatures to perform the Hajj rituals in and around the holy city of Mecca . Speaking with the state-owned Al Ekhbariya TV, the minister said 95 pilgrims were being treated in hospitals, some of whom were airlifted for treatment in the capital, Riyadh. He said the identification process was delayed because there were no identification documents with many of the dead pilgrims. He said the dead were buried in Mecca, without giving a breakdown. The fatalities included more than 660 Egyptians. All but 31 of them were unauthorized pilgrims, according to two officials in Cairo. Egypt has revoked the licenses of 16 travel agencies that helped unauthorized pilgrims travel to Saudi Arabia, authorities said. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief journalists, said most of the dead were reported at the Emergency Complex in Mecca’s Al-Muaisem neighborhood. Egypt sent more than 50,000 authorized pilgrims to Saudi Arabia this year. Saudi authorities cracked down on unauthorized pilgrims, expelling tens of thousands of people. But many, mostly Egyptians, managed to reach holy sites in and around Mecca, some on foot. Unlike authorized pilgrims, they had no hotels to return to to escape the scorching heat. In a statement Saturday, Egypt’s government said the 16 travel agencies failed to provide adequate services for pilgrims. It said these agencies illegally facilitated the travel of pilgrims to Saudi Arabia using visas that don’t allow holders to travel to Mecca. The government also said officials from the companies have been referred to the public prosecutor for investigation. According to the state-owned Al-Ahram daily, some travel agencies and Hajj trip operators sold Saudi tourist visas to Egyptian Hajj hopefuls, violating Saudi regulations which require exclusive visas for pilgrims. Those agencies left pilgrims in limbo in Mecca and the holy sites in scorching heat, the newspaper said. The fatalities also included 165 pilgrims from Indonesia, 98 from India and dozens more from Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria and Malaysia, according to an Associated Press tally. Two U.S. citizens were also reported dead. The AP could not independently confirm the causes of death, but some countries like Jordan and Tunisia blamed the soaring heat. AP journalists saw pilgrims fainting from the scorching heat, especially on the second and third days of the Hajj. Some vomited and collapsed. Historically, deaths are not uncommon at the Hajj, which has seen at times over 2 million people travel to Saudi Arabia for a five-day pilgrimage. The pilgrimage’s history has also seen deadly stampedes and epidemics. But this year’s tally was unusually high, suggesting exceptional circumstances. In 2015 a stampede in Mina killed over 2,400 pilgrims , the deadliest incident ever to strike the pilgrimage, according to an AP count. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca’s Grand Mosque earlier the same year killed 111. The second-deadliest incident at the Hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people. During this year’s Hajj period, daily high temperatures ranged between 46 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) and 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Meteorology. Some people fainted while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil . The Hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam, is one of the world’s largest religious gatherings. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities. Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes it difficult to ensure their safety. Climate change could make the risk even greater. A 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an “extreme danger threshold” from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086. Islam follows a lunar calendar, so the Hajj comes around 11 days earlier each year. By 2029, the Hajj will occur in April, and for several years after that it will fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder. CAIRO (AP) — More than 1,300 pilgrims died amid scorching heat during this year’s Hajj pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia’s health minister said Sunday. Speaking to state-owned television, Health Minister Fahd bin Abdurrahman Al-Jalajel said that 83% of the fatalities were among unauthorized pilgrims who walked long distances under soaring sun heat. The fatalities included more than 660 people from Egypt, according to two officials in Cairo. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. CAIRO (AP) — More than 1,000 people died during this year’s Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as the faithful faced extreme high temperatures at Islamic holy sites in the desert kingdom, officials said Sunday. More than half of the fatalities were people from Egypt, according to two officials in Cairo. Egypt revoked the licenses of 16 travel agencies that helped unauthorized pilgrims travel to Saudi Arabia, authorities said. Saudi Arabia has not commented on the deaths during the pilgrimage, which is required of every able Muslim once in their life . The Egyptian government announced the death of 31 authorized pilgrims due to chronic diseases during this year’s Hajj, but didn’t offer an official tally for other pilgrims. Egypt sent more than 50,000 authorized pilgrims to Saudi Arabia this year, the government said. However, a Cabinet official said that at least 630 other Egyptians died during the pilgrimage, with most reported at the Emergency Complex in Mecca’s Al-Muaisem neighborhood. Confirming the tally, an Egyptian diplomat said most of the dead have been buried in Saudi Arabia. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief journalists. Saudi authorities cracked down on unauthorized pilgrims, expelling tens of thousands of people. But many, mostly Egyptians, managed to reach holy sites in and around Mecca, some on foot. Unlike authorized pilgrims, they had no hotels to escape from the scorching heat. In its statement, the government said the 16 travel agencies failed to provide adequate services for pilgrims. It said these agencies illegally facilitated the travel of pilgrims to Saudi Arabia using visas that don’t allow holders to travel to Mecca. The government also said officials from the companies have been referred to the public prosecutor for investigations. According to the state-owned Al-Ahram daily, some travel agencies and Hajj trip operators sold Saudi tourist visas to Egyptian Hajj hopefuls, violating Saudi regulations which require exclusive visas for pilgrims. Those agencies left pilgrims in limbo in Mecca and the holy sites amid scorching heat, the newspaper said. The fatalities also included 165 pilgrims from Indonesia, 98 from India and dozens more from Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria and Malaysia, according to an Associated Press tally. Two U.S. pilgrims were also reported dead. The AP could not independently confirm the causes of death, but some countries like Jordan and Tunisia blamed the soaring heat. Saudi officials did not respond to questions seeking more information. Associated Press journalists saw pilgrims fainting from the scorching heat during the Hajj, especially on the second and third days. Some vomited and collapsed. Deaths are not uncommon at the Hajj, which has seen at times over 2 million people travel to Saudi Arabia for a five-day pilgrimage. The pilgrimage’s history has also seen deadly stampedes and epidemics. But this year’s tally was unusually high, suggesting exceptional circumstances. In 2015 a stampede in Mina killed over 2,400 pilgrims , the deadliest incident ever to strike the pilgrimage, according to an AP count. Saudi Arabia has never acknowledged the full toll of the stampede. A separate crane collapse at Mecca’s Grand Mosque earlier the same year killed 111. The second-deadliest incident at the Hajj was a 1990 stampede that killed 1,426 people. During this year’s Hajj period, daily high temperatures ranged between 46 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit) and 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca and sacred sites in and around the city, according to the Saudi National Center for Meteorology. Some people fainted while trying to perform the symbolic stoning of the devil . The Hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam, is one of the world’s largest religious gatherings. More than 1.83 million Muslims performed the Hajj in 2024, including more than 1.6 million from 22 countries, and around 222,000 Saudi citizens and residents, according to the Saudi Hajj authorities. Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on crowd control and safety measures for those attending the annual five-day pilgrimage, but the sheer number of participants makes it difficult to ensure their safety. Climate change could make the risk even greater. A 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an “extreme danger threshold” from 2047 to 2052, and from 2079 to 2086. Islam follows a lunar calendar, so the Hajj comes around 11 days earlier each year. By 2029, the Hajj will occur in April, and for several years after that it will fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost In 2006, Ramiro Gonzales was sentenced to death in Texas as punishment for kidnapping, raping and killing Bridget Townsend when they were both 18 years old. There were indications that Gonzales did not represent the “worst of the worst” kind of criminal that the death penalty is supposedly reserved for. Like many on death row, he endured horrific abuse and neglect as a child. He turned to drugs and alcohol as a teen to cope; he killed Townsend, his drug dealer’s girlfriend, while trying to steal drugs. After he was arrested for sexually assaulting a different woman, Gonzales confessed to the murder. He had turned 18 two months before the killing, making him barely old enough to be legally eligible for a death sentence. In Texas, jurors on death penalty cases are instructed to predict whether the defendant is likely to commit future acts of violence. A psychiatrist, Dr. Edward Gripon, was pivotal in convincing jurors that Gonzales derived pleasure from sexual assault, was unlikely to stop, and was a poor candidate for rehabilitation. Fifteen years later, Gripon visited Gonzales on death row and reevaluated him. This led Gripon to reverse his opinion, citing a prior reliance on a debunked statistic and a witness statement that has since been recanted. In his second evaluation, Gripon wrote that “it is my opinion, to a reasonable psychiatric probability, that he [Gonzales] does not pose a threat of future danger to society.” It was the only time that Gripon had ever issued a report changing his opinion in a death penalty case, the psychiatrist told The Marshall Project in 2022. Despite Gripon’s dramatic reversal, Texas plans to execute 41-year-old Gonzales on Wednesday, by lethal injection. Gonzales has expressed deep remorse for his crime. “I know my apologies cannot even begin to bring you peace of mind and healing, but I feel that I should still tell you how sorry I am for all the pain and anguish you have suffered because of my actions,” he wrote in an apology letter to the Townsend family in 2022, which was excerpted in a petition for clemency filed by Gonzales’ lawyers earlier this month. “I am sorry, deeply sorry, that I took what was so precious to you and I know there’s nothing I can do or say to make it better.” Gonzales was born in 1982 to a 17-year-old girl who struggled with drug and alcohol addiction, according to the clemency petition. His mother drank and used drugs throughout her pregnancy, and, at one point, intentionally overdosed in an unsuccessful effort to terminate the pregnancy. After his birth, his mother gave him up to her parents. He did not meet his father until he was 19, when they were both locked up at the county jail. The rejection from Gonzales’ mother was “ever-present,” according to the clemency petition, which noted that she went on to marry and have two more children whom she raised, despite never acknowledging Gonzales as her son. His grandparents worked long days, leaving him unsupervised. Gonzales was repeatedly sexually abused, including by a cousin, starting at the age of 6, the petition said. Bandera, the town Gonzales grew up in, was “hell on earth,” a cousin, identified only as Jessica, said in a video submitted in support of Gonzales’ clemency application. “There was a lot of sexual abuse in the family,” Jessica said. “That was something that, till this day, is not really talked about. And it was not talked about, it was never stopped, because that abuse continued on to the next generation, which was Ramiro and me.” The first time that Gonzales found care and affection from a family member was during elementary school, when his uncle married a woman named Loretta. She “hugged him, praised him, and showed him the love and affection he craved,” according to the clemency petition. When Gonzales was 15, Loretta was killed in a car crash with a drunk driver. Devastated, Gonzales turned to cocaine and methamphetamine to self-medicate. He dropped out of school and began stealing and forging checks to pay for drugs. Shortly after his 18th birthday, Gonzales attempted to rob his dealer’s home. Townsend was inside, and when she tried to call her boyfriend, Gonzales assaulted and killed her. Gripon testified at trial that recidivism rates among people who commit sex crimes are as high as 80% — a statistic that was widely used at the time to justify extreme punishments. Years later, when a legal scholar attempted to identify the source of the 80% claim, he found that it came from an unsubstantiated assertion in a 1986 Psychology Today article. Recent peer-reviewed studies have found recidivism rates below 20% after 25 years and that these rates are “substantially lower” among younger offenders, like Gonzales, Gripon noted in his second evaluation. In court, Gripon had also relied on written statements signed by Gonzales’ cellmate, Frederick Ozuna. The statements described Gonzales confessing to returning to the crime scene three or four times to have “sex with the body” and saying that “he would do it again” and “enjoyed it.” At trial, Ozuna tried to invoke his right to silence and then attempted to recant his statements. But the prosecutor continued to press, until Ozuna agreed to answer affirmatively to a series of leading questions about the statements. Ozuna later fully recanted in a sworn declaration, describing how an officer threatened him with a harsher sentence if he didn’t help vilify Gonzales. “Ramiro never said those things to me,” Ozuna wrote in the declaration, referring to the claims about assaulting the victim’s dead body. After Gonzales was convicted, he was appointed a lawyer named Terry McDonald to represent him in state habeas proceedings, a chance to present evidence of constitutional issues at trial. McDonald never met with Gonzales, requested funding for experts, interviewed family members and other witnesses, or conducted evaluations of Gonzales, according to Gonzales’ current lawyers. Ultimately, McDonald filed a nine-page habeas petition (such documents are often hundreds of pages long), which was dismissed by the court as “frivolous.” Gonzales was previously set to be executed in 2022. Weeks before the scheduled killing, Gripon provided Gonzales’ appellate lawyers with his reevaluation report , admitting to relying on debunked information at trial and concluding that Gonzales did not pose a future danger. Two days before the execution, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted a stay and directed the trial court to consider Gonzales’ claim that his death sentence resulted from false expert testimony. Without conducting a hearing or reviewing any additional evidence, the trial court signed verbatim the state’s “findings of fact and conclusions of law,” which recommended denying Gonzales relief. (This is common practice: A 2018 report published in the Houston Law Review found that judges adopted prosecutors’ findings in their entirety in 96% of 191 cases that the authors reviewed in Texas’ Harris County.) The Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the trial court’s recommendation, and Gonzales was given another execution date. While awaiting trial, Gonzales had become a devout Christian. “He said, ‘I can’t change the past, but I hope I can prove myself in the future,’” said Clinton Young, who was incarcerated with Gonzales on Texas death row before Young’s conviction was overturned due to a stunning revelation that the prosecutor on his case was also on the payroll of the judge. “He walked the walk.” In 2021, Gonzales tried to donate a kidney, an effort blocked by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which said the “ uncertain timeline ” of the donation could interfere with his execution. “How can I give back life? This is probably one of the closest things to doing that,” Gonzales told The Marshall Project in 2022 . Gonzales earned the equivalent of a bachelor’s degree from a Bible college and wrote sermons for the prison’s radio station. When the prison introduced “faith-based pods” in 2021, Gonzales became one of the program’s first peer coordinators. In an interview recorded for his clemency video, Gonzales described his work ministering to other people on “death watch,” who were also staring down an execution date. “The first thing we do to minister to them is make sure they got clothing, make sure they got food,” Gonzales said. “And then God comes next, in the sense where it’s like: ‘Hey man, I just want you to know, I’m Christian. I have a date. If you have doubts or if there’s any emotional struggles right now because you’re on death watch, we can talk about it. Whether you have a date or not, it doesn’t matter. You still have a life to live.’” Gonzales didn’t just help Christians, said Cantor Michael Zoosman, a co-founder of the group, L’chaim! Jews Against The Death Penalty. “I remember Jedidiah Murphy, who was executed last year, talking about how Ramiro had provided a balm of spiritual support for him,” Zoosman said in the clemency video. “Even if he [Gonzales] never sees the light of day as a free person, he can bring that inner light to others in the darkest corners of our society, just by being there and sharing the faith that he has with them.” Gonzales closes all of his letters with the words “faith,” “hope” and “love,” a reference to the 13th chapter of 1 Corinthians, which concludes, “And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.” “I’m on death row,” Gonzales said in the clemency video. “But I still have faith, I still have hope, and I can still love everybody around me.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "EUGENE, Ore. (AP) — Two steps before she reached the finish line, Sha’Carri Richardson started pounding her chest. She knew she had it won. Anyone who doesn’t see her as the sprinter to beat later this summer at the Paris Olympics should probably think again. Richardson notched the latest stop on her “I’m Not Back, I’m Better” tour with a 10.71-second sprint in the 100 meters at U.S. track trials on Saturday that makes her the fastest woman in the world this year and officially earned her a trip to France where the women start racing Aug. 2. The final marked the third time in this meet that Richardson did not get off to a stellar start. It also marked the third time in the meet she finished well in the clear. She was .09 seconds ahead of training partner Melissa Jefferson, the 2022 U.S. champion. Another sprinter in coach Dennis Mitchell’s camp, Twanisha Terry, finished third and also earned a spot on the women’s 100-meter team. “I feel honored,” Richardson said. “I feel every chapter I’ve been through in my life prepared me for this moment.” A few seconds after her line-crossing celebration, she was down on a knee, clearly caught up in emotion. “The emotion was just joy because of the hard work I put in, not just physically on the track, but mentally and emotionally to grow into the mature young lady I am today,” she said. It has been quite a ride for the 24-year-old Texan. Three years ago, she won this race, too (in 10.86 seconds), only to see the victory stripped because of a positive marijuana test that laid bare everything from her own struggles with depression to an anti-doping rulebook that hadn’t changed with the times. That’s when the hard work began. What emerged, Richardson said, was a better and more in-tune person than the one who lit up this same Hayward Field back in 2021 — her orange hair flowing, looking like this sport’s breakout star. It took nearly two years for the results to show up on the track again. But she won the national championship in 2023 and declared “I’m not back, I’m better,” then backed that up a month later with the world title. “I’d say the message I’m sending out is to believe in yourself no matter what,” Richardson said, echoing much the same thoughts from last year in Budapest. “You want to remain solid in yourself. Stay grounded in yourself and your hard work.” It’s risky business to hand her the gold medal in Paris given the competition she’ll face. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and two-time defending champion Elaine Thompson-Herah have 19 Olympic medals between them — Richardson has never been to the games — and all are slated to run at next weekend’s Jamaican trials. A recent injury to Thompson-Herah has mixed up that math. Meanwhile, Fraser-Pryce has been a rarely seen commodity in 2024 and Jackson is the two-time world champion at 200 meters — a race Richardson finished third in at worlds and is entered in next week at trials. Back in the U.S., the Americans are feeding off each other, and Mitchell, a huge name in sprinting in the 1990s, pulled off a rarity by placing all three of his best sprinters in the Olympics. “The odds of getting all three is probably a point-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-something,” Mitchell said. “But those girls didn’t care about those odds. They went out there and had a plan and they executed well and they deserve everything they got.” Given she bettered the season’s best time despite a mediocre start and after pounding her chest and pulling up before the end of the race, it’s hard to argue that Richardson is the favorite. Asked if she had a time in mind for the Olympics, she did not bite. “I just know that if I execute and run the race I’m trained to prepare for that the time will come with it,” she said. Next up, it’s Noah Lyles’ turn. Before Richardson took center stage, the reigning world champion at 100 meters ran his preliminary heat in 9.92 seconds, the fastest time in the first round of men’s qualifying. He’ll race Sunday for a spot in the Olympics. Lyles, like Richardson, dealt with depression in the COVID-fueled days of the Tokyo Olympics. He made it to the games but took a bronze medal in the 200. The last 24 months have been about adding the 100 to his repertoire. He looked in good form in his first race this week at Hayward. “It’s been ‘a long time’ for a long time,” Lyles said. “And I’m just so glad to be happy, glad to be out here, glad to be racing and feeling like myself.” Michigan State’s Health Baldwin won the decathlon to make his first Olympic team. He’ll be joined by Zack Ziemek, who is on his third team, and Harrison Williams, who is also making his debut. Jasmine Moore, Keturah Orji and Tori Franklin earned the three spots in women’s triple jump. Ryan Crouser overcame a balky elbow to win his eighth outdoor national title. He’s looking for a third straight Olympic gold medal. Joe Kovacs, who finished runner-up to Crouser at both Olympics, finished second and Payton Otterdahl came in third. Speaking to the strength of the U.S. in the event, Crouser said “if the whole world came to trials they’d get one, maybe one, spot” in the Olympics. ___ This story has been updated to correct that Zack Ziemek has qualified for his third Olympic team. ___ AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "CROMWELL, Conn. (AP) — Six climate protesters stormed the 18th green while the leaders were lining up their putts for the final hole of regulation at the PGA Tour’s Travelers Championship on Sunday, spraying smoke and powder and delaying the finish for about five minutes. The protesters waved smoke bombs that left white and red residue on the putting surface before Scottie Scheffler, Tom Kim and Akshay Bhatia finished their rounds. Some wore white T-shirts with the words “NO GOLF ON A DEAD PLANET” in black lettering on the front. “I was scared for my life,” Bhatia said. “I didn’t even really know what was happening. ... But thankfully the cops were there and kept us safe, because that’s, you know, that’s just weird stuff.” The PGA Tour issued a statement thanking the Cromwell Police Department “for their quick and decisive action” and noting that there was no damage to the 18th green that affected either the end of regulation or the playoff hole. Scheffler, who was arrested during a traffic stop at the PGA Championship , also praised the officers. “From my point of view, they got it taken care of pretty dang fast, and so we were very grateful for that,” said Scheffler, the world’s No. 1 player, who beat Kim on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff for his sixth victory of the year. “When something like that happens, you don’t really know what’s happening, so it can kind of rattle you a little bit,” Scheffler said. “That can be a stressful situation, and you would hate for the tournament to end on something weird happening because of a situation like that. I felt like Tom and I both tried to calm each other down so we could give it our best shot there on 18.” Protestors have stormed the 18 at the Travelers Championship 😳 pic.twitter.com/EAtCplCKDc Extinction Rebellion, an activist group with a history of disrupting events around the world, claimed responsibility for the protest. In a statement emailed to The Associated Press, the group blamed climate change for an electrical storm that injured two people at a home near the course on Saturday. “This was of course due to increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather conditions,” the statement said. “Golf, more than other events, is heavily reliant on good weather. Golf fans should therefore understand better than most the need for strong, immediate climate action.” After the protesters were tackled by police and taken off, Scheffler left a potential 26-foot clincher from the fringe on the right edge of the cup, then tapped in for par. Kim, who trailed by one stroke heading into the final hole, sank a 10-foot birdie putt to tie Scheffler and force the playoff. Kim said the protest took his mind off the pressure. “It kind of slowed things down,” he said. “It took the meaning of the putt away for a second. Because for the past 17 and a half holes all you’re thinking about is golf, and suddenly when that happens your mind goes into a complete — like, you’re almost not even playing golf anymore. I thought it was a dream for a second.” The crowd surrounding the 18th green heckled the protesters by yelling profanities and cheered the police who intervened. After the players putted out in regulation, workers with leaf blowers came out to clean off the remaining powder. The hole location was moved for the playoff, which was also on No. 18. Scheffler parred the first hole of sudden death to win. “They left a lot of marks on the greens, which is not right for us players — especially when two guys are trying to win a golf tournament,” Kim said. “But I’m very grateful for the tour and the tour security for handling that really well and making us players feel a lot safer.” ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "After backlash, Reed denied that he'd forced her into getting pregnant, and the two issued a joint apology to victims of reproductive coercion. This didn't seem to garner much backlash, but I've always felt like it was a kind of messed-up story. After backlash, Robbie said , \"We all established our boundaries before making this movie, because it's a movie that really pushes boundaries in a lot of ways.\" Pitt defended her by claiming he also said to himself, \"When else am I going to get a chance? So yeah, let's have this.\" After criticism and accusations of racism, Dunham apologized on Instagram , writing, \"Despite my moments of bravado, I struggle at industry events (and in life) with the sense that I don't rep a certain standard of beauty and so when I show up to the Met Ball surrounded by models and swan-like actresses it's hard not to feel like a sack of flaming garbage. This felt especially intense with a handsome athlete as my dinner companion and a bunch of women I was sure he'd rather be seated with. But I went ahead and projected these insecurities and made totally narcissistic assumptions about what he was thinking, then presented those assumptions as facts. I feel terrible about it. Because after listening to lots of valid criticism, I see how unfair it is to ascribe misogynistic thoughts to someone I don't know AT ALL. Like, we have never met, I have no idea the kind of day he's having or what his truth is. But most importantly, I would never intentionally contribute to a long and often violent history of the over-sexualization of black male bodies- as well as false accusations by white women towards black men. I'm so sorry, particularly to OBJ, who has every right to be on his cellphone. The fact is I don't know about his state of mind (I don't know a lot of things), and I shouldn't have acted like I did. Much love and thanks, Lena.\" Handler had actually made this exact joke before while making a racist remark about Madonna's adopted child. In 2006, when Handler was asked about reports Madonna had adopted a 1-year-old from Africa (her son David ), she replied, \"You know, actually, the important thing to remember, Joe, is that the baby technically — whether she raises it in London or the States, technically the baby is African-American. So my question would be: Do you think he'll talk loud in movie theaters?\" She added, \"I really hope this baby doesn't turn out like Angelina Jolie's, you know, and Brad Pitt's little Eskimo, Maddox,\" and then told the same joke about Maddox and Malibu. Cosby was convicted of sexual assault in 2018, but after a court overturned the verdict in 2021, he was released from jail. While Healy did apologize for the comments he made about Ice Spice in the same episode, and acknowledged he felt \"a bit bad\" and \"irresponsible\" after the controversy, he didn't directly address the story he told about Ghetto Gaggers. \"I think that I’ve said some things or kind of, I make a joke out of everything. That’s my thing. And I can take it too far sometimes in front of too many people,\" he said on stage. \"And I feel a bit embarrassed. So that’s the truth.” He later told the New Yorker he was baiting fans \"a little bit\" but said it \"doesn't actually matter\" because no one was genuinely upset over his comments unless they were \"lying that you are hurt, or you’re a bit mental for being hurt.\" This is apparently the full text, though the excerpt is no longer on Nerve, where it was once housed. Brie later spoke to Vulture about the piece, saying that parts were tweaked, saying, \"It’s definitely a true story but it’s embellished for comedy\" and that the intro was particularly embellished, but \"the body of the story is true, and those are the events as I remember them in terms of that escapade.\" \"To my admiration and pride, she was extremely articulate about the extent to which that word would have been painful to someone in the LGBTQ+ community regardless of how culturally normalized it was. I not only agreed with her but was thrilled at her passion, values, and desire for social justice,\" Damon continued. \"I do not use slurs of any kind. I have learned that eradicating prejudice requires active movement toward justice rather than finding passive comfort in imagining myself 'one of the good guys.' And given that open hostility against the LGBTQ+ community is still not uncommon, I understand why my statement led many to assume the worst. To be as clear as I can be, I stand with the LGBTQ+ community.\" By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the current phase of fighting against Hamas in Gaza is winding down, setting the stage for Israel to send more troops to its northern border to confront the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah . The comments threatened to further heighten the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah at a time when they appear to be moving closer to war. Netanyahu also signaled that there is no end in sight for the grinding war in Gaza. The Israeli leader said in a lengthy TV interview that while the army is close to completing its current ground offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, that would not mean the war against Hamas is over. But he said fewer troops would be needed in Gaza, freeing up forces to battle Hezbollah. “We will have the possibility of transferring some of our forces north, and we will do that,” he told Israel’s Channel 14, a pro-Netanyahu TV channel, in an interview that was frequently interrupted by applause from the studio audience. “First and foremost, for defense,” he added, but also to allow tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to return home. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah began striking Israel almost immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 cross-border attack that triggered the Gaza war. Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire nearly every day since then, but the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears of a full-blown war. Hezbollah is much stronger than Hamas, and opening a new front would raise the risk of a larger, region-wide war involving other Iranian proxies and perhaps Iran itself that could cause heavy damage and mass casualties on both sides of the border. White House envoy Amos Hochstein was in the region last week meeting with officials in Israel and Lebanon in an effort to lower tensions. But the fighting has continued. Netanyahu said he hoped a diplomatic solution to the crisis could be found but vowed to solve the problem “in a different way” if needed. ″We can fight on several fronts and we are prepared to do that,” he said. He said any deal would not just be “an agreement on paper.” He said it would require Hezbollah to be far from the border, an enforcement mechanism and the return of Israelis back to their homes. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated shortly after the fighting erupted and have not been able to go home. Hezbollah has said it will continue battling Israel until a cease-fire is reached in Gaza. The group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, warned Israel last week against launching a war, saying Hezbollah has new weapons and intelligence capabilities that could help it target more critical positions deeper inside Israel. Hezbollah already has unveiled new weapons during the low-level fighting, including hard-to-defend attack drones that strike with little warning. An Israeli soldier was badly wounded Sunday in a drone strike. But Israel says it too has shown Hezbollah only a small part of its full capabilities, and that Lebanon will be turned into a second Gaza if there is a war. Israel’s army last week said it had “approved and validated” a new plan for a Lebanon offensive. In the interview, Netanyahu said that Israel’s offensive in Gaza is winding down. The Israeli army has been operating in the southern border town of Rafah since early May. It says it has inflicted heavy damage on Hamas in Rafah, which it has identified as the last remaining Hamas stronghold after a brutal war stretching nearly nine months. But he said Israel would have to continue “mowing” operations — targeted strikes aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping. Israel launched its air and ground invasion of Gaza immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, which killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. The Israeli offensive has killed over 37,000 Palestinians, unleashed a humanitarian crisis and triggered war crimes and genocide cases at the world’s top courts in The Hague. It also has raised tensions with the United States, with President Joe Biden and Netanyahu clashing publicly over the course of the war. Earlier on Sunday, Netanyahu again repeated his claim that there has been a “dramatic drop” in arms shipments from the U.S., Israel’s closest ally, hindering the war effort. Biden has delayed delivering certain heavy bombs since May over concerns of heavy civilian casualties, but his administration fought back last week against Netanyahu’s charges that other shipments had also been affected. Although the U.S. and other mediators are pushing a cease-fire plan, Netanyahu has ruled out an end to the war until Israel releases all hostages held by Hamas and until it destroys Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. The current phase of the war “is about to end,” Netanyahu said. “That doesn’t mean the war is about to end.” Netanyahu spoke as his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, was in Washington for talks with American officials about the war and tensions with Lebanon. And next month, Netanyahu has been invited to address Congress for a speech that already is dividing Washington along partisan lines. Some Democrats , angry at Netanyahu’s public fighting with Biden, say they will not attend . American officials also have been pressing Netanyahu to spell out a clear post-war plan for Gaza. The U.S. has said it will not accept a long-term Israeli occupation of the territory. Netanyahu spelled out a very different vision. He said the only way to guarantee Israel’s security is for Israel to maintain military control over the territory. “There is no one else” capable of doing that, he said. But he said he is seeking a way to create a Palestinian “civilian administration” to manage day-to-day affairs in Gaza, hopefully with backing from moderate Arab countries. He ruled out any role for the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, which was ousted from Gaza by Hamas in a violent 2007 takeover. Netanyahu said the Israeli army several months ago looked into working with prominent Palestinian families in Gaza, but that Hamas immediately “destroyed them.” He said Israel is now looking at other options. Netanyahu ruled out one option favored by some of his ultranationalist governing partners — re-settling Israelis in Gaza. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, ending a 38-year presence. “The issue of settlement is not realistic,” he said. “I’m realistic.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Reporter With less than six months until the 2024 election and days away from the first presidential debate, former President Donald Trump has finally chosen his vice president — though he has not revealed the name yet. Ahead of his campaign rally in Philadelphia on Saturday, Trump told NBC News that he has settled on a running mate for the upcoming election but hasn’t told them yet. When asked if he had decided on who would be his vice president pick, Trump said, “In my mind, yeah,” and added that “nobody knows” who he has selected, but the person will “most likely” be at his first 2024 general election presidential debate against President Joe Biden on Thursday. Trump’s campaign is still deciding whether to announce his vice president before or after his sentencing for his conviction last month on 34 felony counts related to his hush money case, NBC News reported . His sentencing is scheduled for July 11, just a few days before the Republican National Convention, where Trump is expected to become the Republican Party’s selection for president. The former president has previously said that he would announce his running mate at or around the time of the convention in July, The New York Times reported . Earlier this month, Trump’s campaign reportedly sent out VP vetting materials to a handful of Republicans who appear to be contenders for the role. The people who received the forms were Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Reps. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Gov. Doug Burgum (R-N.D.) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson.

    "article_content": "Reporter, HuffPost Israeli forces tied a wounded Palestinian man to an armored vehicle’s hood as they drove through the occupied West Bank during a raid this weekend – an incident a United Nations expert described as an example of the military using Palestinian civilians as human shields, an accusation the U.S. and Israel have repeatedly made against Palestinian militants like Hamas. Video that went viral on Saturday showed a jeep belonging to the Israeli military driving through the streets of Jenin, a city in the northern West Bank that continues to face military raids and settler violence . Soldiers with the Israeli Defense Force tied a visibly bloodied Palestinian man on the hood of one of their armored vehicles, as shown in the video. The man has since been identified as Jenin resident Mujahed Azmi. The video was verified by Al Jazeera, Reuters and Anadolu, and later confirmed by the Israeli military itself. Israeli forces on Saturday were conducting a raid in Jenin when they wounded Azmi, the man’s family told Reuters. When the family asked for an ambulance to take Azmi to a hospital, the IDF instead took him, strapped him onto the jeep’s hood and drove off, they said. “What happened is another scene of the daily crimes committed by the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian people, particularly against those who are in custody,” Abdullah al-Zagari, director of the Palestinian Prisoners Society, told Anadolu. Israeli forces initially would not allow crews with the Palestine Red Crescent to administer first aid to Azmi or take him to a hospital, the humanitarian group said. The Israeli occupation forces prevented Palestine Red Crescent crews from providing first aid to an injured person in the Jabarat area of #Jenin . They then placed the injured person on the front of a military jeep and detained him before later allowing our crews to transfer him… pic.twitter.com/sQ9GXWGrDz “The jeep passed by, and the injured man was on the hood. One arm was tied to the windshield, and the other arm was on his abdomen,” ambulance driver Abdulraouf Mustafa said, according to an Arabic-to-English translation by Al Jazeera . “They drove past us and refused to give us the patient.” The IDF eventually transferred Azmi so that Red Crescent crews could get him medical care at a hospital. The medical group said his gunshot injury was not life-threatening and only affected his torso, according to Anadolu. A spokesperson for the IDF described the incident to HuffPost as soldiers exchanging gunfire with Palestinians they alleged were “terrorists.” It is unclear exactly how the involved Palestinians were terror suspects, given that Hamas – the armed militant group Israel has vowed to destroy – operates in Gaza, not the occupied West Bank. “During the exchange of fire, one of the suspects was injured and apprehended. In violation of orders and standard operating procedures, the suspect was taken by the forces while tied on top of a vehicle,” the spokesperson said about Azmi. “The conduct of the forces in the video of the incident does not conform to the values of the IDF.” The IDF said the incident will be investigated and “dealt with accordingly,” though the Israeli military has a lengthy record of failing to adequately investigate itself and hold members accountable for unethical behavior. According to Anadolu, witnesses suggested that Israeli forces used Azmi “as a human shield to exit the area without being exposed to explosives or gunfire from resistance fighters.” Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories who released a report earlier this year accusing Israel of committing genocide , also described the Saturday incident as “human shielding in action.” “It is flabbergasting how a state born 76 years ago has managed to turn international law literally on its head,” Albanese said in a social media post . “This risks being the end of multilateralism, which for some influential member states no longer serves any relevant purpose.” #HumanShielding in action. It is flabbergasting how a state born 76 years ago has managed to turn international law literally on its head. This risks being the end of multilateralism, which for some influential member states no longer serves any relevant purpose.… https://t.co/swwjiuJYmG The occupied West Bank has faced hostility from the IDF and Israelis living in the territory’s illegal settlements for decades , but the violence against Palestinian residents has skyrocketed since Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7 that resulted in Israel’s ongoing massive retaliation campaign. Israeli forces have killed more than 37,000 people in Gaza – where most of the military’s offensive is focused – and at least 553 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, according to health officials. The U.S. government under President Joe Biden has provided nearly unwavering public financial and diplomatic support for Israel in its military offensives, though the president has on several occasions warned the Israeli government of consequences should soldiers and settlers continue attacking Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Since Oct. 7, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on a handful of Israeli settlers in the territory. The State Department did not immediately answer HuffPost’s questions on the Saturday incident, including whether the agency would describe it as an example of human shields, and if not, would they change their answer if it were Palestinian militants tying an Israeli civilian to the hood of their vehicle. Israeli forces arrested at least 20 more Palestinians in military raids on the West Bank as of Sunday, bringing the total detained in the territory since Oct. 7 to 9,345, according to the Commission of Detainees’ Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoner Society.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Democrats were trying to “destroy” conservative members of the Supreme Court after some lawmakers recently tried to pass a bill meant to address ongoing ethics concerns surrounding several justices. Senate Republicans , Graham included, blocked legislation earlier this month that could have required Supreme Court justices to adopt a binding code of conduct and establish a means to file ethics complaints against them. The effort came amid a series of reports into Justice Clarence Thomas and his acceptance of lavish gifts from a billionaire friend, as well as recent accounts of flags affiliated with Jan. 6 protesters that were hung outside homes owned by Justice Samuel Alito. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have pointed to the twin controversies as evidence that stricter rules should be applied to the court. But Graham attacked those efforts in an interview with Fox News on Sunday and alluded Democrats were worried about several major ruling set to come down from the court, including one on former President Donald Trump ’s claims of absolute presidential immunity. WATCH: @LindseyGrahamSC on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming speech to Congress and the crisis on the border. pic.twitter.com/LrX86ESxfN “The worst thing that could happen is for the United States Senate and the House to determine what cases the Supreme Court hears,” Graham said on “Fox News Sunday.” He went on to say Democrats were attempting to “micromanage the Roberts court.” “They’re trying to destroy Alito and Thomas because they don’t like the fact they’re conservative judges,” the senator added. Graham had previously assailed the bill as an attempt to undermine the court, calling the effort an “unconstitutional overreach.” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) rejected those calls on the chamber floor earlier this month, saying it was in the country’s best interest for the court to adhere to ethics rules. “Our faith in the character and impartiality of our judges is essential to the functioning of our legal system and our constitutional form of government,” Durbin said in a speech. “But that faith requires judges, especially Supreme Court justices, to conduct themselves in a way that inspires public confidence.” On Sunday, Graham said Democrats were livid with the court and claimed Trump had changed the body for the better during his tenure in the White House. The court now holds six conservative and three liberal members. “They’re squealing like stuck pigs because the Supreme Court no longer is a political body,” Graham said. “It is actually looking at the Constitution and making constitutionally sound decisions versus political decisions. That’s the problem liberals have with the court.” Chief Justice John Roberts said the court would adopt a code of conduct last November. But critics lambasted the policy as it is not binding and the justices are responsible for enforcing it themselves. The chief justice recently rejected calls, however, to discuss the Alito flag scandal with lawmakers, citing “separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence counsel against such appearances.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

(AP) — A 4-year-old California boy who wandered away from a campground in the Sierra National Forest was found safe after spending 22 hours alone in the wilderness, authorities said. A search-and-rescue team of about 50 officers and volunteers set out around 11 a.m. Thursday after the child was reported missing from the camping site surrounded by dense forest north of Fresno . The boy, from Torrance near Los Angeles, was last seen wearing shorts and a T-shirt, the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office said. Around 8 a.m. Friday, the boy was discovered in good condition “nestled under a tree” near a lake about a quarter mile (.4 km) from the Rancheria Campground where his family was. “He was hungry and exhausted, but otherwise in good health. We got him a sandwich and then carried him out to be reunited with Mom and Dad,” the sheriff’s office said Saturday on Facebook . Officials say the boy simply wandered away and lost his sense of direction. The sheriff’s office thanked members of the public who volunteered to join the search, “kept their eyes peeled, spread the word on social media and sent prayers up.” “All of this undoubtedly helped to bring (him) home safely,” the department said.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump vowed at a rally Tuesday that if reelected, he’ll cut funding to every school with a vaccine mandate ― even though all 50 states have such laws on the books. “I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate,” he declared at his rally in Racine, Wisconsin. The crowd went wild. It’s a promise he’s made several times in recent months, repeating the same line verbatim at rallies in March and May . If he followed through on that, no school in the United States would receive federal funding. All 50 states and Washington, D.C., have laws requiring specific vaccines for students, including measles, rubella, chickenpox, tetanus, pertussis and polio. Exemptions to the rule vary by state, with California, New York and a handful of other states maintaining the strictest mandates. Public health experts credit those vaccine requirements with eradicating diseases that once killed thousands of people a year. Polio, a disease that infected, paralyzed or killed nearly 60,000 American children in 1952 alone, has been completely wiped out in the U.S. thanks to mass vaccination programs. Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to questions about which vaccines he was referring to. Months earlier, his spokespeople said he was only referring to schools’ COVID-19 vaccine mandates. But he’s declined to make that distinction during his speeches, including at Tuesday’s rally ― a decision that panders to his party’s anti-vaccine crowd. A growing faction of conservatives have begun questioning the safety of vaccines in recent years, despite the intense scientific scrutiny they undergo before the public receives them, and a dearth of evidence that they have any lasting adverse side-effects. A Politico/Morning Consult poll found last year that while vaccine skepticism was about equal among both Democrats and Republicans before 2020, more than half of Republicans now say they care more about the potential health risks of vaccines than the benefits. Though he once took credit for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, Trump has since scaled back his endorsement of them and vaccines in general. Last month, he even attacked independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., one of the most prominent voices in the anti-vaccine movement, as not being anti-vaccine enough. “Republicans, get it out of your mind that you’re going to vote for this guy because he’s conservative. He’s not. And by the way, he said the other night that vaccines are fine,” Trump said in a video posted to social media. “He said it on a show, a television show, that vaccines are fine. He’s all for them. And that’s what he said. And for those of you that want to vote because you think he’s an anti-vaxxer, he’s not really an anti-vaxxer.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Politics Reporter, HuffPost Companies are effectively raising their prices by stealthily charging the same amount of money, or even more, for ever-smaller portions ― and it’s been a big driver of inflation in many products in the past few years, according to a new study by a group of progressive economists. The phenomenon, dubbed “shrinkflation,” is gaining more notice even as conventional inflation has come down appreciably from the heights seen in 2022 and 2023. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) has a bill aimed at fighting shrinkflation , and President Joe Biden released a Super Bowl YouTube ad calling on companies to “put a stop to this.” Groundwork Collaborative, a group of left-leaning economists, issued a study Wednesday finding that shrinkflation played a substantial role in inflation between the years 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic began, and 2023, after most businesses had returned to normal. “While shrinkflation is not new, it is arguably the most deceptive pricing practice companies use and has come under renewed scrutiny as Americans face grocery prices 25% higher than prior to the pandemic,” Lindsay Owens, executive director for Groundwork and the author of the study, wrote. “We find that as much as 10% of inflation in key product categories can be attributed to shrinkflation.” Owens cited tracking by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 10% figure. The BLS checks the prices on thousands of items each month to compile its Consumer Price Index, the most widely known measure of the pace of price increases, or inflation. While most of the CPI simply consists of tracking price movements for specific items, the bureau also tracks when companies change their formulations or packaging, to ensure it does not miss the inflation that occurs when a company, for example, charges the same price for six-pack of soda but reduces the size of each can by half an ounce. Citing BLS data, the Groundwork study said that household paper products, a category that would include toilet paper and paper towels, had 10.3% of its nearly 35% price increase between 2019 and 2023 come from shrinkflation. Another category, snacks, saw 9.8% of its inflation over that period attributable to shrinkflation. The report noted other categories where shrinkflation contributed significantly to overall inflation: household cleaning products (7.3% due to shrinkflation), coffee (7.2%) and candy and chewing gum (7%). The report also included examples of companies using shrinkflation and related strategies to boost corporate bottom lines. In one instance, the CEO of a major toilet paper maker was reported to have said on a quarterly financial reporting call that consumers were unlikely to change their buying habits even if they realized they were paying more for less. “If the price goes up on bath tissue, generally doesn’t mean you’re going to use the bathroom less, right? And so, I think we do operate in essential categories that have less elasticity,” the CEO said, according to the report.

    "article_content": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed President Joe Biden’s 200th judicial nominee on Wednesday, a significant milestone both in terms of the number of lifetime federal judges he has confirmed and the unprecedented diversity he’s infused into the nation’s courts. With the Senate’s confirmation of Angela Martinez to a U.S. district court in Arizona, Biden surpassed the number of lifetime federal judges that Donald Trump had confirmed by the same point in his presidency. Trump, who made judicial confirmations a major focus of his presidency , was at 196 at this point in his presidency. It is the diversity of Biden’s judges, though, that really jumps out. He has put more women, people of color, LGBTQ+ people and professionally diverse people into lifetime federal judgeships than any of his predecessors, and in some cases, more than any of them combined. Nearly two-thirds of Biden’s judges are women (127), and nearly two-thirds are people of color (125). About 40% of Biden’s judges are women of color (79). To put this into some context: A total of 3,254 white men have served on the Supreme Court, appeals courts or district courts since the U.S. federal court system was created in 1789, according to the Federal Judicial Center. In all that time, 416 judges have been white women, and 565 have been people of color. Just 197 have been women of color. The professional diversity of Biden’s judges is also off the charts. More than 40% of them (85) have backgrounds as public defenders or civil rights lawyers ― a huge break from the centuries-long tradition of plucking people for federal judgeships from their jobs as prosecutors or corporate attorneys. “When you walk into a courtroom and your freedom and your business and your family’s interests are at stake, you’d like to look up there and see a judge that you believe really understands your way of life,” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said at a press conference with civil rights leaders after the vote. Biden has ushered in historic firsts for the federal bench, too. He appointed the first openly LGBTQ+ woman to serve on a U.S. appeals court, Judge Beth Robinson of the 2nd Court of Appeals. He appointed the first Muslim American federal judge, Zahid Quraishi, to a U.S. district court. He has appointed four Native American people to lifetime federal judgeships, which is half of all the Native American federal judges appointed in U.S. history. And, of course, Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, making her the first Black woman and former public defender to serve on the nation’s top court. “This is a major milestone,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) celebrated on the Senate floor ahead of Martinez’s vote. “Simply put, our 200 judges comprise the most diverse slate of judicial nominations under any president in American history.” Broken down, the president has confirmed a total of one Supreme Court justice, 42 appeals court judges, 155 district court judges and two Court of International Trade judges. All of these judges are serving lifetime appointments. Biden “may well be able to match” Trump’s 174 confirmed district judges by the end of the year, speculated Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow with the Brookings Institution’s governance studies program and president of the Governance Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. “If he does, he would be second only to former President Jimmy Carter” in confirming that many district judges in a single term, Wheeler said. But Biden is not likely to fill as many appeals court vacancies as Trump did. By the end of Trump’s term, he had confirmed 54 appeals court judges. There simply aren’t enough vacancies for Biden to fill to hit that number by the end of the year. Ultimately, though, the president’s goal has been to appoint “a lot of judges who were not white males,” Wheeler said. “He’s exceeded that.” “All things considered, I think he has a really impressive record,” he added. While Biden has had success with his judges, he’s facing some real challenges in the coming months, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia and a judicial nominations expert. There are still dozens of vacant district court seats, he said, and the majority of them don’t have a nominee. Many of those vacancies are in states represented by two GOP senators, meaning they have a say in who the White House picks for those seats. They can also jam the process entirely by not agreeing to any nominees — a political move that becomes increasingly likely as it gets closer to the November elections. “The Senate calendar is tough,” said Tobias, referring to the dwindling days lawmakers will be in Washington before they head back home to run for reelection. “ Democrats are defending more seats and need to campaign.” For now, Biden seems pretty pleased with his record. “Today, we reached another milestone in the effort to protect the freedoms and liberties of all Americans,” he said in a statement. “These judges are exceptionally well-qualified. They come from every walk of life, and collectively, they form the most diverse group of judicial appointees ever put forward by a President,” the president said. “And despite differences in background and experience, they are all committed to principles that are at the core of our democracy: independence, freedom, and liberty.” Biden wouldn’t have been able to get so many judges through without Senate Democratic leaders making judicial confirmations a top priority. It’s particularly notable how much they’ve been able to deliver given their razor-thin majority in the chamber. Biden was working with a Senate evenly tied at 50-50 until December 2022, when Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) won in a runoff election and gave Democrats a 51-49 majority. Warnock said Wednesday that he didn’t realize at the time how significant his victory was for confirming judges. “I didn’t appreciate, as I do now, how deeply consequential that win would be,” Warnock told HuffPost. “The people of Georgia delivered this 200th judge.” Igor Bobic contributed reporting.

    "article_content": "“ The Daily Show ” correspondent Michael Kosta joked Thursday that it’s “not that hard” for Republicans to follow the biblical Ten Commandments after Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry (R) signed a GOP-backed bill into law requiring the directives be put on display in public classrooms . Co-host Desi Lydic tossed to Kosta and asked how Republicans can justify putting “religion in public schools” with the law, which has faced criticism from several civil rights groups. “Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, the Ten Commandments aren’t religion, all right? Just because they’re in the Bible doesn’t mean they’re religious, OK,” said Kosta, who mockingly went to bat for the lawmakers. “The Ten Commandments are universal moral principles that these Louisiana Republicans want everybody to live by, just like their party does,” he added. He proceeded to break down why it isn’t difficult to follow the commandments including “thou shalt not kill.” “Pretty cut and dry, don’t kill anybody,” said Kosta before adding exceptions: “Unless you’re standing your ground, you gotta protect yourself or if a protester is blocking traffic, I got places I gotta be.” Kosta went on to read from a poster of the Ten Commandments as the show’s co-hosts checked him along the way. “Honor thy father and mother, you can’t get more moral than that,” Kosta said. “Oh, like giving parents maternity leave and universal child care?” replied co-host Ronny Chieng . “No, no, no, no, not honoring them like that. Honoring them like texting them at 11:55 p.m. on Father’s Day. You know, what, let’s forget it, there’s too much confusion,” said Kosta as he put a line through the commandment.

    "article_content": "LOWELL, Mass. (AP) — A 21-year-old man has been arrested and charged with fatally shooting a 15-year-old girl hours before she was scheduled to attend her middle school graduation in Massachusetts, authorities said. Not guilty pleas were entered in court Tuesday on behalf of Trevor Bady. He was arraigned on charges of of murder, armed home invasion, unlawful possession of a firearm, and other charges. A phone number for him could not be found and his court-appointed attorney declined to comment on the case after the hearing. The girl, Ahliana Dickey, of Lowell, was supposed to have attended her eighth grade graduation on June 14, but did not show up. Her grandmother called police after 6 p.m. to report that Dickey had been found inside the home. Police said she had suffered from apparent gunshot wounds. Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said at a news conference Monday that Bady had been a boyfriend of Dickey’s “for some period of time.” Police said they received a call earlier June 14, shortly after midnight, saying a male and a female were fighting outside. The caller reported a female screaming, “Get off me, get away from me, I don’t want to be with you anymore.” The caller also reported hearing gunshots, police said. Police responded to the scene but could not find anyone. Video recovered from the area allegedly showed a female, later identified as Dickey, yelling for help shortly before midnight, and a man, allegedly identified as Bady, leaving her home shortly after midnight. They said the man allegedly had taken an Uber to and from Dickey’s home before and after she was shot. The driver later identified the passenger.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Former President Donald Trump recently joined the popular social media platform TikTok just days after he was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records in his hush money trial in New York. Most notably, Trump now has a presence on a social media app he unsuccessfully tried to ban as president through executive order in 2020 while he was still in the White House. “We will leave no front undefended, and this represents the continued outreach to a younger audience consuming pro-Trump and anti-Biden content,” Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump’s campaign, said of Trump’s decision to join the platform. Amid his third presidential run, Trump has changed his tune on TikTok, opposing a congressional bill threatening to ban the app in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divests its stake in the platform within a year. President Joe Biden signed the bill into law in April. The legislation could ultimately end up before the U.S. Supreme Court as ByteDance and TikTok filed a lawsuit, claiming the bill violates the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans who use the platform. Trump opposed the TikTok divestiture bill even though many of his allies in Congress, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, pushed for its passage. Ahead of Biden’s signature on the law, Trump said a potential TikTok ban would be the president’s fault as he urged young Americans to hold Biden accountable over it on Election Day. “He is the one pushing it to close, and doing it to help his friends over at Facebook become richer and more dominant, and able to continue to fight, perhaps illegally, the Republican Party ,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. (Several social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, suspended Trump’s accounts over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. All three platforms have since reinstated his accounts.) Despite his previous position on TikTok, Trump now appears to recognize the site is especially popular with young adults, who also use it as one of their main sources of information. According to a survey conducted by Pew Research in the fall of 2023, about a third of U.S. adults aged 18 to 29 regularly get their news from TikTok. Thomas Gift, the director of the Centre for U.S. Politics at University College London, said polling data indicates “a dramatic swing” toward Trump among young voters compared to the past election cycle. “He’s still not getting the majority of the votes, but it’s been a dramatic improvement,” Gift told HuffPost. “I think he does see young voters as kind of a target demographic that he can reach, and so he’s gonna go after them.” Trump’s campaign had been mulling joining the platform for a while, according to The Washington Post , with some of his allies, including Kellyanne Conway, pushing Trump’s team in recent months to make the move despite the scrutiny TikTok has received. Conway, a former senior counselor for Trump during his administration, was hired by the conservative Club for Growth to lobby for TikTok in Congress, Politico reported in March. The investment company of one of the main financial backers of the group, billionaire Jeff Yass, who is also the biggest donor in this election cycle , has a 15% stake in ByteDance. While Yass previously opposed Trump, the two men have recently grown closer. Notably, Yass met Trump in Florida the week before the former president first came out against the bill that could ban TikTok. Trump told CNBC in March Yass “never mentioned TikTok” during their brief encounter. Regardless of his motivation, Trump’s move to join TikTok seems to be paying off, at least in terms of numbers. As of early Thursday, Trump’s account had garnered over 5.7 million followers. His first 13-second TikTok video, posted Saturday, has more than 93.4 million views. It shows the former president attending a UFC fight alongside UFC CEO Dana White in Newark, New Jersey. “The president is now on TikTok,” White says at the video’s opening. “It’s my honor,” Trump replies. Biden’s 2024 campaign has had an account on the platform for months, and his team has continued to use it despite his signing of the divestiture bill. Their account has way less hype than Trump’s, boasting just over 361,900 followers. Gift said TikTok is ultimately more conducive to Trump’s brand. “Trump is a consummate entertainer. And he’s very adept at using social media, as we saw in the 2016 campaign with Twitter,” Gift said. Gift added that Trump’s campaign style and unfiltered sharing of his opinions “jives more with TikTok.” People “don’t go on TikTok to assess the finer points of public policymaking,” Gift said. “They go on TikTok to be entertained. And to the extent that Trump is an entertainer, I think it’s very unsurprising that he has gained more traction through that as a medium.” Caitlin Chin-Rothmann, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, echoed Gift, telling HuffPost that many people who follow him or look at his posts may simply be curious to watch his content even if they don’t plan to back him in November, and may not even be eligible to vote in the U.S. election. “It’ll be interesting to see whether this attention continues throughout the rest of the campaign cycle, especially after his sentencing next month,” in the hush money trial, Chin-Rothmann added. Meanwhile, the right-wing has been picking up steam on TikTok, giving Trump another incentive to get on the app to stay on top of that movement. An internal TikTok analysis reported by Puck found that since November, over 1.29 million positive Trump videos or images have been posted on the platform, with 9.1 billion views, compared to 651,000 positive Biden posts, which have about 6.15 billion views. Some in Trump’s orbit have also been joining the platform, including Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who is floated as a potential member of Trump’s cabinet team if he wins in November. ( Ramaswamy recently bought 7.7% stake in Buzzfeed , the parent company of HuffPost, acquired in 2021.) Pro-Trump super PAC MAGA Inc. also launched an account on TikTok last month. Trump is no stranger to using social media as a political tool. During both the 2016 and 2020 presidential election campaigns, he used Twitter extensively to reach voters. Since then, Twitter has been renamed X and changed dramatically under Elon Musk’s ownership, losing a big chunk of its user base. That, combined with the fact that Meta’s Facebook and Instagram deprioritize news and politics, has made TikTok an attractive option to his team. Trump’s joining is “a reflection of the fact that the social media landscape really has changed, and Twitter is becoming just the less viable option for political candidates to communicate with voters and the public,” Chin-Rothmann told HuffPost. Despite TikTok’s growing popularity, U.S. lawmakers view the platform skeptically due to privacy and national security concerns, given its China ties. U.S. officials have long claimed that TikTok would be required to share its user data with the Chinese government if requested under Chinese law. TikTok has repeatedly pushed back against those concerns, pointing to the launch of its initiative to safeguard the data of American users, dubbed Project Texas. “Under Project Texas, all protected U.S. data will be stored exclusively in the U.S. and under the control of the U.S.-led security team. This eliminates the concern that some have shared that TikTok US user data could be subject to Chinese law,” the company says . The former president’s decision to join TikTok makes him one of the few Republicans with a presence on the platform. GOP lawmakers have been some of the loudest critics of the social media site’s ties to China. It also points to a stark reversal of his previous position, given that Trump famously signed an executive order in 2020 forcing the company to divest or risk a nationwide ban. The courts deemed his move unconstitutional. Even though his change of heart on TikTok could seem hypocritical, it’s unlikely to hurt him politically given that his major opponent, Biden, is also on the platform, thus muffling his ability to criticize Trump on the issue. Besides, Trump’s fellow Republicans, even those skeptical of TikTok, are unlikely to attack him over it. “There’s certainly political fissures within the Republican Party with regard to TikTok,” Gift said. “I do think, though, ultimately, Republicans are just going to fall in line with whatever Trump wants to do on any issue, and that includes TikTok.”"

    "article_content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Former Attorney General Bill Barr on Wednesday criticized Donald Trump ’s guilty verdict in the hush money trial, adding that he expects the former president’s conviction to be overturned. In an interview with “Fox Across America With Jimmy Failla,” Barr said he didn’t expect the former president would face charges in the case. Trump was indicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records for his role in a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. “When people were talking about it, I said the case was an abomination and I didn’t think it was going to be brought at the end of the day because it was so vaporous,” Barr said. “So I was surprised they went ahead with it and it met its billings — that is, it was an abomination and everyone’s talked about that but you think about how are the American people going to react in a very close election if Trump loses and this case is overturned, which it will be. This case will be overturned,” he continued. Barr also blasted the gag order on Trump, which barred the former president from commenting on potential witnesses, jurors and others involved in the case, suggesting that it created an uneven playing field for the GOP’s presumptive nominee. Trump was fined for repeatedly violating the gag order and warned he could face jail time for future infractions. “It’s unprecedented and crazy that you have a major candidate who can’t defend himself,” Barr said. Trump’s legal team on Tuesday asked Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, to lift the gag order ahead of the CNN debate between him and his main rival in the 2024 race, President Joe Biden , later this month. The former attorney general suggested there could be merit to claims that Trump’s prosecutions are motivated by an effort to help Biden get reelected in November, despite no evidence to support the allegations. “I could fathom it,” Barr said. Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly claimed he could go after his political rivals if he secures another term in office. “Look, when this election is over, based on what they’ve done, I would have every right to go after them,” Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity . While Barr has criticized Trump since resigning from his administration in December 2020, he has said he plans to support the Republican ticket in November. He also predicted Democrats would protest a potential Trump win. “I see a super resistance if Trump wins this election,” he told Fox News audio.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost The three stars of 1999′s “ The Blair Witch Project ” are speaking out against film studio Lionsgate as plans for a revival of the era-defining horror classic get underway. In a wide-ranging interview with Variety , Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams say they’ve missed out on profits from the original movie, which raked in a reported $248 million at the box office worldwide. Given the film’s then-unique faux documentary conceit, none of the three actors were able to benefit from its unexpected success, and are now seeking residuals and “meaningful consultation” on future projects that use their names and likenesses. “I’m very grateful for what I have now and how fucking hard I fought to get it. But it still impacts me,” Williams told the publication. “Giant corporations don’t care that this happens to young artists. It’s bullshit. And that’s got to change somehow. Hopefully, we will help somebody to see: Don’t do what we did.” Added Leonard: “I don’t need Lionsgate to like me. I don’t care that they know that I think their behavior has been reprehensible. I don’t want my daughter to ever feel like anything is more valuable than her self-worth.” The trio’s remarks come just months after Lionsgate honored the 25th anniversary of “The Blair Witch Project” by announcing plans for a big-screen revival. The new film will be produced by Jason Blum, whose work includes the “Paranormal Activity” and “Halloween” franchises, and is intended to “reintroduce this horror classic for a new generation,” according to Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson. Written and directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez, the original “Blair Witch Project” follows three student filmmakers (played by Donahue, Leonard and Williams) who hike into Maryland’s Black Hills with the aim of making a documentary about a local myth known as the “Blair witch.” The group goes missing without a trace, though their abandoned film equipment is discovered a year later. The big-screen film was supposed to be a compilation of that “found footage.” When Artisan Entertainment ― now a subsidiary of Lionsgate ― picked up “The Blair Witch Project” for distribution, Donahue, Leonard and Williams were barred from attending its Cannes Film Festival premiere or participating in interviews in order to maintain the illusion of the movie being a true story. None of the actors had union representation when “The Blair Witch Project” was released. Although the movie was a critical and commercial hit, they said many casting directors assumed they’d just played themselves, given that their real names were used for their on-screen characters. In her chat with Variety, Donahue says she had an epiphany when “The Blair Witch Project” passed the $100 million mark at the box office, and she and her co-stars were sent a fruit basket. “That was when it became clear that, wow, we were not going to get anything,” she recalled. “We were being cut out of something that we were intimately involved with creating.” In 2000, Donahue, Leonard and Williams collectively sued Artisan as a sequel, “ Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 ,” was being rolled out. About four years later, they were able to reach a settlement for about $300,000 that would be paid to each of them over several years. As part of the settlement, however, Artisan “can’t use our names and images to make money for themselves anymore,” Leonard told Variety. But, Donahue added: “They keep doing it anyway.” In response to the actors’ claims, the directors and producers of “The Blair Witch Project” issued a joint statement to Variety saying they were “hopeful Heather, Joshua and Mike find a satisfying conclusion to their conversations with Lionsgate.” “For us, this anniversary provides an exciting opportunity to celebrate the movie and its legacy with fans,” the statement continued.

    "article_content": "Labor Reporter, HuffPost Mercedes-Benz workers in Alabama have voted against joining the United Auto Workers , a setback for the union as it tries to organize the auto industry in the South. The vote count at the German manufacturer’s facilities in Vance, near Tuscaloosa, was 2,045 to 2,642 against the union, according to a preliminary tally from the National Labor Relations Board. More than 5,000 workers were eligible to cast ballots in the weeklong election that ended Friday. The union has a week to challenge the results. The UAW was coming off a historic victory at Volkswagen’s Tennessee plant last month, where workers had voted overwhelmingly in favor of unionization. But the loss at Mercedes could slow the union’s plans to organize more foreign-owned auto facilities in Southern states. UAW President Shawn Fain said in a press conference following the results that the union and its supporters had “left everything on the table.” “While this loss stings, I’ll tell you this: We’re gonna keep our heads up,” Fain said. “We fought the good fight and we’re going to continue forward. Ultimately, these workers here are going to win.” Mercedes thanked employees for voting in a statement following the election. “Our goal throughout this process was to ensure every eligible Team Member had the opportunity to participate in a fair election,” the company said. But Fain accused Mercedes of engaging in “egregious illegal behavior” by pressuring employees to vote against the union. “We’ve been here before. We know what we’re taking on,” he said. “This company, like most others, operated off the same playbook … fears, threats, intimidation.” The UAW has long represented auto workers at the “Big Three” of Ford, General Motors and Jeep parent company Stellantis, primarily in the Midwest. But over the years, foreign manufacturers like Mercedes, Volkswagen, Nissan and Hyundai have established factories in the South to take advantage of lower wages and “right to work” laws, reducing the UAW’s density across the industry. Organizing those plants is key to the UAW restoring its once-formidable bargaining power, and to boosting wages and benefits in Southern facilities that lag behind unionized plants. The Volkswagen and Mercedes campaigns have served as early tests of the union’s ambitious plans, with very different results. The Volkswagen workers had voted in favor of the UAW by a nearly 3-1 margin. But Volkswagen stayed mostly neutral during the campaign in Chattanooga, whereas Mercedes appeared to actively campaign against the UAW. Workers said management regularly corralled them into meetings to hear anti-union talking points, while the new chief executive of the company’s U.S. division made a direct appeal to workers to “ give [him] a chance .” “There’s a lot of power in that,” Fain said. The union also faced external political pressures. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) joined other Southern GOP leaders in denouncing the UAW and declared at the start of voting that “Alabama is not Michigan.” “The workers in Vance have spoken, and they have spoken clearly!” Ivey posted on X after the results came in Friday. The union had said its organizing committee secured a “supermajority” of support in the plant before filing for a vote, so the results suggest it lost a large share of support in the weekslong election campaign. Asked if the UAW planned to challenge the results based on the company’s conduct, Fain said he would leave that question to the union’s legal team. Organizing a large manufacturing plant often involves multiple failures before succeeding. The UAW narrowly lost two earlier elections at the Volkswagen plant, in 2014 and 2019, before winning this April. The earliest the union could file for another election at Mercedes would be in a year. “These courageous workers reached out to us because they wanted justice,” Fain said. “They led this fight. That’s what this is all about. And what happens next is up to them.”"

    "article_content": "ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. Two decades ago, an anthropology professor at the University of Utah asked the National Science Foundation to fund research on Native American ancestors to determine when the cultivations of crops like corn first became prevalent in their cultures. The studies, according to the research proposals, would involve analyzing Ancestral Pueblo remains that museums had excavated around 1900 from some of the Southwest’s most sacred sites: a deep rift that winds through Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, an ancient village near cliff dwellings in Colorado and the remnants of a settlement at Chaco Canyon in New Mexico that dates back more than a thousand years. Nearly all of the remains were held at Harvard University’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The analysis would destroy portions of the ancestral remains but yield valuable information, including a more precise date of when the individuals lived, Joan Brenner Coltrain, the Utah professor, said in the research proposals. This information could help the institutions finally return the remains to descendant tribes, she said at the time. The NSF provided $222,218 under two grants for research that spanned eight years, starting in 2002. But the studies never resulted in Harvard or the AMNH repatriating human remains to any of the tribes that trace their ancestry to sites studied by Brenner Coltrain, including the Pueblo tribes of New Mexico and the Hopi in Arizona. Instead, the work inspired even more destructive research on ancestral remains by other scientists supported by federal funding and done without the consent of tribes, many of which view such studies as a violation of their traditions and beliefs. “There’s somehow this perspective that this kind of research will enhance us or benefit us,” said Theresa Pasqual, director of the historic preservation office for the Pueblo of Acoma. “What it does is it bolsters their careers; it bolsters their professional, academic standing. Let’s be real about it.” In 1990, Congress passed the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act , anticipating that within a decade federally funded museums and universities would return tens of thousands of ancestral remains and burial items. But as ProPublica reported this year, U.S. museums continue to hold the remains of more than 100,000 Native American ancestors , almost all of which they say are “culturally unidentifiable,” meaning they are unable to determine which tribe, if any, can rightfully claim them. ProPublica found that by funding scientific studies on Native American human remains, the NSF and other federal agencies have created incentives for institutions to hold on to ancestors in ways that undermine the goals of NAGPRA. Federal agencies have awarded at least $15 million to universities and museums for such research since the law’s passage, a ProPublica review found. As a result, tribes have been not only denied opportunities to reclaim and rebury their ancestors, but also excluded from having a say over the treatment of the remains. “There’s this perverse sense of ownership, that ‘these are our samples.’ And ‘You know, we’re protecting it for the good of research,’” said Krystal Tsosie , a Navajo Nation citizen and assistant professor at Arizona State University whose research focuses on genetics and bioethics. When another group of researchers was set to publish a study that had involved damaging Native American remains — including two from Chaco Canyon used in the Brenner Coltrain research — some on the team questioned the ethics of moving forward without permission or input from tribes. But an AMNH curator, who was listed as a contributor to the study, discouraged outreach to Pueblo leaders, according to previously unreported emails. Involving them could cause researchers to lose control of the project, he wrote. The fallout from that study led the AMNH in 2020 to ban destructive research on human remains. The museum said in response to questions from ProPublica that it has not repatriated the ancestral remains used in the studies because no tribes have formally claimed them under the law. Pueblo representatives have continued to visit the AMNH and meet with staff about its collection, the statement added. Several tribal members and representatives interviewed for this story said museums’ demands that tribes initiate the repatriation process place an unfair burden on them to do the work of addressing the looting of Indigenous graves. “The museums tend to think of all these objects as their personal property, and they don’t want to turn it back over to the tribes even though much of it was unscrupulously obtained,” said Kurt Dongoske, who is a tribal historic preservation officer for Zuni Pueblo in New Mexico. The AMNH also said it is not aware of scientific research it authorized yielding enough information to allow for repatriation decisions. Harvard, which declined to comment after receiving questions from ProPublica, has prohibited research on ancestral remains and items subject to NAGPRA under a temporary policy that allows an exception for studies done with tribal consent. The university has acknowledged publicly that as a premier research institution, it long ignored the wishes of tribal communities while benefiting from collections of their ancestral remains amassed through excavations and donations. This year, the Interior Department is reviewing proposed regulations that would require institutions to halt research on Native American remains if requested by a tribe. The NSF said in response to written questions from ProPublica that it is committed to engaging more with tribes and is now beginning to standardize policies for funding research that impacts them. Under draft guidelines that could go into effect in January, the agency said, it would require all researchers to show that they have consulted with tribes on their research proposals before obtaining an NSF grant. Still, the NSF and other federal agencies have continued to fund research on Indigenous remains in recent years. Involving Indigenous groups in research can add to researchers’ understanding of ancestors’ lives and belongings, said Pasqual, of Acoma Pueblo. Without this context, scientific studies are incomplete, she said. Pasqual’s background in archeology helps her understand how science’s view of her ancestors differs from that of her tribe’s culture. Scientists and museums, she believes, have long viewed ancestors’ remains as objects, specimens or property. Pueblo people have a continuing relationship with their ancestors and an obligation to steward them. “There are a lot of folks who may see ancestors as being an open resource to do different types of DNA testing,” she said. “We recognize that there is an ethical obligation.” For nearly two centuries, museums and universities used science to justify building and keeping massive collections of Native American human remains. Harvard, which today holds the remains of 6,000 Native Americans, opened the Peabody museum in 1866 with a handful of pottery and other items, plus a small collection of Indigenous remains that were used to analyze the “anatomical characteristics” of the races, according to the museum’s first annual report, issued two years later. By 1900, an AMNH anthropologist with medical training, Aleš Hrdlička, set up a makeshift laboratory in Chaco Canyon’sPueblo Bonito, a sprawling multistory settlement with hundreds of rooms and dozens of kivas, spaces that have long been used among Pueblo tribes and the Hopi for ceremonial and social purposes. Hrdlička conducted his work as the expedition’s archaeologists cleared rooms in the “great house,” including a chamber the archaeologists labeled Room 33 where 14 people had been buried along with ceramics and thousands of pieces of turquoise. The team began taking remains and objects and sending them to New York by train, until concerns about looting at the canyon prompted a federal probe . One of the expedition’s benefactors defended the work as a scientific enterprise, not a looting one. But the investigation still halted the excavation, and the investigator recommended making Chaco Canyon a national park to protect it. Of the more than 150 ancestral remains from Chaco Canyon at the AMNH, Hrdlička helped unearth more than half, according to the museum’s inventory provided to the National Park Service under NAGPRA. David Hurst Thomas, a longtime archaeologist, said he considered the Chaco Canyon holdings to be the AMNH’s most important collection from the continent when he first stepped into his role as the museum’s curator of North American archeology in the 1970s. “There are people who want to call that looting, and certainly by 21st-century standards that’s true,” said Thomas, who’s now retired. “But by late 19th-century standards, that’s one of the best digs in the country.” Frustration that institutions had treated Native American ancestors as scientific specimens played a major role in driving Indigenous rights activists to push for federal repatriation legislation. When Congress passed NAGPRA in 1990, lawmakers anticipated repatriation would be completed within five to 10 years. As a result, the law is limited in how it addresses scientific analysis. “The whole concept of NAGPRA was to return these collections to tribes, so that they would have rights over them. They would be able to authorize or not authorize testing,” said Melanie O’Brien, manager of the National Park Service’s National NAGPRA Program. “But that didn’t happen.” Congress simply did not envision that 33 years later institutions would be where they are now — holding tens of thousands of Native American remains they have designated as “culturally unidentifiable” and allowing them to be used for research, said O’Brien. The law states that it should not be interpreted as authorizing new scientific studies to advance repatriation efforts. It also says that the only justification for halting repatriations in order to conduct research is if it is considered so important that the findings would be in the national interest. And even in such cases, institutions have three months from the study’s conclusion to return the human remains and items to tribes, according to the law. No institution has ever sought an exemption for such a study, according to O’Brien. Stewart Koyiyumptewa, the Hopi Tribe’s cultural preservation office director, believes NAGPRA should clearly acknowledge tribes’ right to have a say over studies of their ancestors, including those that involve taking and examining samples of their DNA. “But the law is so vague,” he said. In a letter commenting on the Interior Department’s proposed regulations, Koyiyumptewa said clarifying this would help prevent remains or objects in museums pending repatriation from being used for scientific or museum work. From the perspective of his culture, Koyiyumptewa said, samples extracted for DNA research and other studies still represent the remnants of a person and should be respected. “Even though the person may be deceased,” he said, “that small sample still has life.” Alyssa Bader, who is Tsimshian and an assistant professor of anthropology at McGill University in Montreal, agrees that tribes should have a say over the treatment of biological samples of ancestral remains used in research. But this work can be done ethically, Bader said. She has collaborated with Indigenous communities to examine the diets of Tsimshian ancestors and how foods have changed in the distant and recent past. As her partners, Indigenous groups help shape research questions in ways that can benefit their communities. This collaborative work requires more time and money but it is worth the investment, Bader said. “I 100% believe that it produces better research.” Soon after NAGPRA’s passage, NSF records show, some institutions began to seek grants to preserve Ancestral remains for future scientific study, even though Congress had called for museums to be “expeditious” in returning them to tribes. At the time, many museums had not yet fulfilled the law’s requirement to inventory their collections. It would take a full decade from the law’s passage — years longer than expected — for the American Museum of Natural History and Harvard to fully review their collections. The park service had extended deadlines for the institutions with vast collections to file inventories of the items and human remains that had been taken from Native American burials. In 2000, both finally reported that most of their holdings subject to the law could not be culturally affiliated, claiming they did not have enough information to make repatriation decisions. For example, the AMNH declared its entire Chaco Canyon collection to be “culturally unidentifiable.” In federal records, the museum said that people’s migrations from the canyon in the 1300s to villages in Arizona and New Mexico where their descendants now live left gaps in archaeologists’ knowledge about the region. Martha Graham, who oversaw the museum’s NAGPRA compliance in the 1990s, told ProPublica that because multiple tribes claimed ties to the canyon, institutions needed even more time than the park service had granted them to consult with the tribes. Graham, who is from New Mexico and briefly worked for the park service at Chaco Canyon, said she appreciated the connection that the tribes, including the Hopi, had to the area. She left her job in 2001. But had she stayed, she would have pressed the museum to revisit its conclusion that it could not identify which tribes could reclaim what it held from the site, she told ProPublica. “We were pretty explicit, as I recall,” about the need for that to happen, said Graham. In a statement, the museum said the work of “affiliating” collections did not end when it filed its inventory with the park service in 2000 and is ongoing. But the museum has not revised its decision, though it said it recognizes multiple Pueblo tribes’ ties to the canyon. Thomas, the retired AMNH curator of North American archaeology, believed NAGPRA gave the museum even more reason to approve scientific research because it might help identify descendant groups for repatriation. He acknowledged in an interview that it was wrong to exclude tribes from decisions about such research. Brenner Coltrain at the University of Utah pursued the first of two NSF grants in 2002 , hoping to learn more about when farming became a central part of life for Ancestral Puebloans who lived more than 2,000 years ago on the Colorado Plateau. She began by analyzing human remains formerly buried in Arizona and Colorado and now held at Harvard’s Peabody museum, saying the work would “undoubtedly influence” the institution’s final repatriation decisions. Brenner Coltrain did not grant an interview for this story. In an email, she told ProPublica that her work could help institutions make “informed decisions regarding repatriation” but “not ensure that repatriation will follow.” The museum had granted Brenner Coltrain access to its collection on the condition that she share her findings with several tribes, including the Hopi, Pueblo of Acoma and Navajo Nation, according to her NSF research proposal. Initially, the research involved having another Utah professor analyze mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA, which was becoming increasingly prevalent in anthropological studies. Extracting it required pulverizing portions of bone. The genetic material, which is inherited from mothers, could help researchers learn more about trade routes, human migration and matrilineal lineages. Brenner Coltrain and her colleague hoped to gather genetic information from more than three dozen ancestors. But they only had success with seven because the remains either were not well preserved or had lost bone mass. The process was expensive and the results were disappointing, Brenner Coltrain said in a grant report to the NSF. It showed that the people from different ancient sites shared a common ancestry, a finding she said was “perhaps not surprising,” given what was already known about Native American genetics in the region. But another form of destructive analysis that involved examining the bone chemistry of 80 ancestors led Brenner Coltrain to what she considered a more noteworthy finding: Corn had become a staple in the region by roughly 2,400 years ago. Her final reports did not say whether she shared this information with the tribes as Harvard requested. Even though no repatriation happened following the first study, she successfully proposed similar research in a second NSF proposal in 2007. This time, she studied the remains of more than 140 ancestors held at the AMNH that had been excavated around the 1900s, mostly from Grand Gulch, a winding canyon within Utah’s Bears Ears National Monument. In the course of her work, she also extracted bone samples from the remains of at least two ancestors buried within Pueblo Bonito at Chaco Canyon, according to a paper she and her co-researchers later published. Joel Janetski, a now-retired anthropology professor at Brigham Young University who worked with Brenner Coltrain on the second of the studies, said in an interview that the researchers had followed all appropriate guidelines. They did not consult with tribes, he said, because they would have had to go around the AMNH to do so and therefore jeopardize future opportunities to research its collection. “It would have been inappropriate,” he said. As Brenner Coltrain’s NSF grant ended, another researcher took an interest in the Chaco Canyon ancestors whose remains she had analyzed. Stephen Plog, a University of Virginia archaeologist, obtained samples from her and sent them to a radiocarbon-dating lab for further analysis, he said. He co-authored a paper about the research in 2010. No one raised concerns about his work, Plog said in an interview: “No reviewer, nor anyone else commented to say, ‘You know, do you think it’s really right to just do destructive analysis of human remains?’” Next, he collaborated with researchers at Penn State, Harvard and the AMNH on a paper that again focused on the ancestors from Pueblo Bonito’s Room 33. Their work was supported by NSF funding. Using mtDNA, they showed that eight individuals buried together in the room descended from a woman laid to rest among them and that the group’s lineage spanned 300 years. In late 2016, the team was prepared to report their findings in Nature, the leading scientific journal. But before publication, an anthropologist who wasn’t involved in the project urged members of the team to reach out to tribes, according to interviews and emails exchanged among the researchers. It was too late to get consent for destructive analysis that had already happened. But the team could still engage with the tribes and discuss the research ahead of publication, suggested George Perry, a professor at Penn State and co-author of the paper. Peter Whiteley, a cultural anthropologist at the AMNH, firmly opposed the idea, saying in an email to Perry and other researchers that involving tribes would result in surrendering scientific “decision-making” to them. The team should publish first and contact the tribes later, he said. Whiteley knew the region, having spent much of his career researching and writing books about the Hopi tribe. Since the 1980s he had done this work in collaboration with tribal members or with tribal authorities’ consent, he wrote in an email to ProPublica sent via an AMNH spokesperson. The team studying the ancestors of Pueblo Bonito’s Room 33 had asked Whiteley to contribute expertise on matrilineal cultures among the Pueblo tribes but did so only after the research had been completed. Whiteley called the proposal to engage with tribes pre-publication “naive.” “If they had wanted Pueblo and Hopi involvement, the time to seek it was at the beginning of the research, not its conclusion,” Whiteley told ProPublica. Despite opposition from others on the research team, Perry sent letters to Pueblo and Hopi tribal officers before the paper was published. The possibility that tribes might disapprove of the research was all the more reason to engage, he said. In retrospect, Plog said, he understands arguments against doing the type of research on Native American human remains that he and the others pursued. But he said he participated in the belief that his findings had the potential to advance public perceptions of Native Americans by showing the culture at Chaco Canyon had rivaled other great ancient civilizations. Koyiyumptewa, the Hopi cultural preservation office director, said he felt upset upon learning the research had been done without the tribe’s input. “You know, why didn’t you ask us?” Koyiyumptewa said in an interview. News headlines seized on the finding that the Ancestral Puebloans shared a matrilineal line. One read, “ Girl Power ,” another “ Moms Rule !” But that was hardly revelatory to people like Pasqual, who trace their roots through Chaco Canyon and sustain cultures that center matrilineal ties. “We could have told you that,” she said of the Pueblo of Acoma. She and others say tribes have their own ways of understanding and appreciating their past. In her youth, her father used to take her to Chaco Canyon and teach her about the people who built the great houses and how their practices extend to her and others in the present. She has since driven countless times from Acoma Pueblo to the canyon, 100 miles to the north, where she observes traces of Pueblo ancestors, their footholds embedded in the canyon walls. “If the Pueblo people identify themselves as descendants, that should be enough,” Pasqual said.

    "article_content": "Assignment Editor, HuffPost For the first time, Indigenous flags are on display alongside the two host nations’ flags at the Women’s World Cup, breaking with FIFA’s typically hard-line game day regulations. During Thursday’s opening match hosted by New Zealand, the black, white and red Maori flag, known as Tino Rangatiratanga, flew beside the national flag. In Australia, two flags accompanied the Australian flag: the red, yellow and black Aboriginal flag, and the green, blue and white Torres Strait Islander flag. FIFA, the international soccer governing body, has strict rules about what type of symbols can be displayed at games and on players’ uniforms. For this tournament, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags will be flown at all 35 games played in Australia, and Tino Rangatiratanga will appear at all 29 matches in New Zealand. “These significant flags express a spirit of mutual respect, national identity, and recognition of Indigenous cultures for our hosts,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said earlier this month of the decision, which followed a request from soccer governing bodies Football Australia and New Zealand Football that were supported by each country’s government. The Australian team, the Matildas, includes Noongar woman Lydia Williams and Anaiwan, Biripi and Kamilaroi woman Kyah Simon. The two, joined by teammates, famously posed with the Aboriginal flag before a game at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Williams spoke to the Guardian last month about the importance of increased visibility for Indigenous cultures in Australian sports, particularly for younger generations. “Hopefully that’s inspired them and made them feel really proud of their culture and who they are,” she told the outlet. Former athlete Karen Menzies, the first Indigenous person to play for the Matildas when she joined the team in the 1980s, told the Washington Post she felt “pure jubilation” and “enormous pride” seeing the recognition at the World Cup opener this week. Menzies, now a social work lecturer at the University of Newcastle, served on a cultural advisory panel of six Indigenous women appointed by FIFA last year to “recognize the unique cultures and stories of both countries and ensure they are respected throughout all aspects of next year’s tournament.” She told the Post the flag was a key issue raised by the panel. “Having the flag represents our voice at this international competition,” Menzies said. New Zealand Football CEO Andrew Pragnell said flying the Maori flag alongside the country’s national flag was a “powerful symbol,” describing it as an opportunity to shape the tournament’s evolution for future editions to better recognize Indigenous people worldwide. The opening ceremony in Auckland also paid tribute to Indigenous cultures in both host countries, with ceremonial performances by Maori and First Nations people of Australia. However, some have accused FIFA of using Indigenous culture for performative purposes without making any meaningful commitment to supporting Maori and First Nations communities. The Australian Indigenous Football Council wrote a letter to FIFA ahead of the tournament calling for more substantive recognition, such as direct funding and the development of grassroots programs.

    "article_content": "Guest Editor Examining the influence of Indigenous culture on contemporary fashion, globally, is complicated because of everything that has been both erased and appropriated. The only way to come at it is with context. And that’s how content creator Michelle Chubb broke through all the fashion influencer noise on social media. With her platform Indigenous Baddie , she has amassed almost 850,000 followers across social media by creating a unique blend of style, culture and profound calls to action. Born and raised in Winnipeg, Chubb grew up spending summers (and some winters) on her family’s isolated Bunibonibee Cree Nation reserve, home to the Swampy Cree tribe, where she developed a profound appreciation for earth-centered Indigenous traditions while camping, feasting on wild game and fishing with her family. Chubb describes, however, struggling to hold on to that connection to her heritage in her early teens for fear that she’d be teased for being “different.” Ultimately, her love of YouTube and style content inspired her to become a creator, allowing her to embrace her identity again. Through clothes and accessories, she was able to showcase the vastness of her culture. “There are so many different tribes and people within Indigenous communities, all of which have unique and various styles, designs and beliefs that we follow,” Chubb told HuffPost. Chubb ultimately took to social media to become the voice she felt was missing. She gained traction after posting a video showcasing her jingle dress , attracting a diverse audience eager to learn more about her culture. Another part of her mission to show the world how nuanced Indigenous culture is revolves around supporting artists and designers who create beautiful things that quietly combat the historic erasure of Native American expression. These designers speak to her lifestyle and customs, and can make others like her feel seen, she said. Chubb found handmade Indigenous-style earrings on Instagram, and began her collection by sourcing different artisans. Delving deeper into the platform, she discovered Indigenous-owned clothing companies like Lauren Good Day and Resist Clothing. She has also recently started incorporating ribbon skirts — important symbols of womanhood in Native culture — into her daily attire. “Wearing traditional clothing makes me feel different because not everyone is wearing [outfits] like this outside of powwows,” Chubb said. “I am making a statement about reclaiming my culture because I struggled with embracing it a long time ago.” The more Chubb immersed herself in the powerful drum beats and camaraderie of powwows, the more she felt a sense of healing and comfort — along with the surreal acknowledgment that she has a responsibility to preserve these customs for future generations. “My culture is known to be dying, especially the language . The Indian Act really colonized our people and made sure that we disconnected from our culture and identities and that’s a really big factor in our historical trauma,” Chubb said. When she was learning French in school, she told me, she realized she knew more of it than she did her own language. That’s why she began incorporating Indigenous languages online and at home — today, she’s making sure her 1-year-old daughter grows up speaking, or at least understanding, Cree language. “I’m trying to send the message to her to be proud of who she is and not hide,” Chubb said. “But also, I wanted to help others out because I knew I wasn’t the only one who was facing this challenge.” The allure of her online persona, “Indigenous Baddie,” stems from her ability to infuse her unique fashion sense with her deep-rooted advocacy for all Indigenous cultures. Alongside the jingle dresses and earring collection lie poignant and power messaging that bring attention to critical issues such as the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls . It’s this blending of personal style with unwavering advocacy that moves Chubb every day. After all, self-expression is a powerful way to reclaim power and agency. “I want non-Indigenous people to understand where we come from and the problems that we face [in order to] become loyal allies for our community,” Chubb said. “But I also want Indigenous people out there to embrace themselves, to be proud of where they come from and to reconnect with their heritage.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Contributor In February, my 6-year-old Waccamaw Siouan son was told that he must cut his long hair to continue attending a public charter school in North Carolina — and our world stopped. In that moment, every negative emotion, from depression to rage, rushed over me. Those at the school somehow considered his long hair, which he sometimes wears in a braid, to be “faddish,” and this wasn’t acceptable, according to their dress code. The only way I could justify the demand was to assume that maybe they just don’t know that my son’s hairstyle is an important expression of our culture. For over a century, the Waccamaw Siouan Tribe has been living on and caring for the land that the school currently occupies. Long hair, as a style, is traditional for boys and men. I want my son to be strong, self-possessed and proud of who he is. I’m realizing that this could require his constant effort to educate others about our culture and, subsequently, why they should respect it. I’ve had to do this my whole life, so I know that it’s exhausting. Eventually, you grow weak from having to convince people that you deserve respect. I don’t wish for that emotional labor and trauma to weigh down my son’s shoulders. Yet there we were, at a crossroads: Do we continue to educate, or simply walk away? My son loved his teachers and his friends. How could I look him in the eyes and tell him that he is not wanted at school as his most authentic self? I chose not to do this — and so we set out to educate the school’s administrators. It sounds like an oxymoron to teach educators, but that’s what was necessary. After that, we waited for a response that would allow our son to continue on there with his beautiful hair styled exactly as it was. When the pushback came, it hit us hard. Denying my beautiful boy as his authentic self — with a hairstyle that wasn’t hurting anyone — is a poignant form of cultural erasure. It disrespects the heritage that we have been trying hard to preserve for generations. Also, forcing someone to cut their hair is an assimilation effort that was used years ago at Native American boarding schools . “ Killing the Indian ” in a child changes future generations, and we have seen this story before . We must resist these attacks on our culture and call them what they are. We’re not trying to move backward here. In the moments I was processing all of this, I remember dropping to my knees and collapsing into the arms of my elders. I leaned and prayed to the creator for strength, because I knew there was a fight ahead. Most importantly, my son’s safety from the world was in jeopardy. The school gave us two weeks to cut his hair before he could return to class — and we both knew we wouldn’t touch a hair on his head. So, I called on every person of influence I knew in North Carolina. I reached out to anyone who I believed could help me navigate this situation and get my son back into school with his teachers and friends. Finally after many calls, emails, interviews and letters, my son was able to return to class and finish the school year strong. Administrators conveniently decided to push off any “discussions” about changing their policy until the very end of the school year. They altered one word in another area of the rules and passed this as a “policy change” to combat the negative press the school had received. (HuffPost reached out to Classical Charter School for comment but did not receive an immediate response.) When the next school year began, so did the looming cloud of another attack on our culture. This will be an ongoing battle, not just for me but for all Native Americans who face similar attempts at cultural erasure. So how do we fight back? Resilience comes from the wounds and battle scars of these events. It takes an intentional resistance to t hose who wish to remove and assimilate our existence without even understanding why they want us and our customs gone in the first place. We all process this trauma differently. Just as it’s in my DNA to fight back against oppression, it is in others’ DNA to uphold it. The first thing to remember, especially if you want to be an ally, is that rules for rules’ sake are oppressive. There should always be a why. Some people don’t want to find meaning behind rules, further solidifying their core values as oppressors of Indigenous people. It takes courage to speak out against a society that was designed to destroy your existence. If we continue to let Native children be robbed of their customs, we reinforce the narrative that our people do not deserve to exist. So, educating young people on Native sovereignty is crucial. The trauma can end with this generation. We can end the continued and failed attempts of colonized minds, by basking in the clarity that comes from appreciating and celebrating another person’s culture.

    "article_content": "Politics Reporter, HuffPost Because I grew up close to where Hulu’s “Reservation Dogs” has been filmed in Eastern Oklahoma, it’s been fun to watch the coming-of-age comedy and point out the church where my brother got married or the theater I’ve been to. But the main joy has been seeing how co-creators Sterlin Harjo and Taika Waititi, as well as an all-Native writers’ room, have managed to capture the atmosphere of the place as well as provide cultural context for the plotlines. And on the eve of the Season 3 premiere, it feels only right to revisit some examples of these authentically Native moments in the series so far. Before launching into some of these, one obvious caveat: Just as “The Sopranos” should not be held up as representative of the Italian Experience In America, neither can “Rez Dogs” be said to speak for All The Indigenous. But some things, I suspect, may feel very familiar. Going to an Indian Health Service clinic is no longer, at least back home, a thing to be dreaded. But back in the day, IHS was known for low budgets, low morale and being the last-ditch place to go if you couldn’t afford to go to a doctor. In Season 1’s second episode, “Rez Dogs” tackles this by having Bear, the leader of a teenage gang of smart-but-bored Native kids, meet Bev, the gum-smacking gatekeeper receptionist played with perfect pitch by Jana Schmieding. When Bear asks Bev not to tell his mother he was in a fight because of “patient-doctor protocol or whatever it’s called,” she just stares at him. “I’m not a doctor.” “How long is the wait?” “You’ve been here a thousand times. You should know.” Bear sighs, says “Damn,” and turns to the waiting room, jammed with others ahead of him. “Hate this place.” We all did, or still do, dude. In the third episode when Elora Danan, the organized one in the group, takes Bear to see her Uncle Brownie, she describes him as “my cousin/uncle.” “He grew up with my mom, like her cousins, but he was raised by my grandma for a while,” she says. Brownie doesn’t remember her until she reminds him she’s the daughter of a woman he grew up with. “Oh! Nephew. Cousin. Niece,” he says. It’s a three-part formula that recurs throughout the series when characters greet each other but can’t recall their exact relationship. Any Native who’s been at a Christmas party or stomp dance and had to be told “Oh, that’s your cousin’s wife’s daughter, whose kids go to school with...” will understand. The exact relationship doesn’t matter, or even blood ties. All that matters, we’re reminded, is there is or was a connection, and that is all that’s required to be family. Willie Jack, who is unofficially gender nonbinary and yet also the most traditional member of the group, goes deer hunting with her dad in the sixth episode. While they wait, talk turns to the fact they’re poaching on land that used to belong to the family but now is owned by “Texas ranchers.” “Don’t we own this land?” she asks. “No. We’re Indian,” her dad laughs. “We don’t own land.” The line is funny on its face — but also in a “because it’s true” sense. In Oklahoma, members of the Five Tribes removed from the Southeast were given land allotments . The idea was to turn them into farmers, whether they wanted to be or not. Of course, that land often ended back up in white hands through debt, trickery or other means. While steps were taken to fix this, those steps also made it harder to sell land intentionally. So, through the years, smaller pieces of land kept being divided among more descendants, a process called fractionalization. A relative of mine “owns” a piece of land with close to 30 co-owners, for example. “We’re Indians. We don’t own land,” indeed. The series’ best episode is “Mabel,” the fourth episode in Season 2. As Elora Danan’s grandmother, who raised her, is dying, family and friends from all over the community come for the vigil. The episode captures so much — the feel of the gathering, the foods cooked (sofkee, a corn mash drink — ugh), and the eternal “city” Natives vs “country” Natives rivalry. One of the people to show up is Jackie, a girl from the rival gang who has become acquainted with Elora. Willie Jack asks Elora what Jackie’s doing there and why hasn’t she offered to help. “Probably just needs to be invited,” Elora says hopefully. “Shouldn’t have to ask her,” Willie Jack says bitterly. “Make yourself useful” was a silent mantra growing up around my grandmother (who enjoyed sofkee, by the way), and it remains stuck in my head today. My 83-year-old mother, a survivor of Native boarding schools, automatically looks for things to fix or clean when visiting because, again, if you are somewhere, you should ensure you are helping. For many of us, presence equals intentionality. “I am here and I choose to be here and I assume you will respect that choice.” But we will not say that aloud because to do so sounds entitled and runs afoul of another cardinal rule: Don’t make a fuss. If you haven’t asked to help, you’re actively not helping. To be Native is to spend a not-small amount of time wondering if you are Native “enough.” Though not a unique problem among minority groups, the ways it manifests can be hilarious. In the sixth episode of the second season, “Decolonativization,” the gang is forced to attend a “youth summit” at the IHS clinic, where they’re made to do cringey team-building exercises with two young facilitators, one of whom is a Native influencer named “Miss M8riarch” (“the other spelling was taken”), played by Amber Midthunder of last year’s “Prey” film. She begins with a land acknowledgment of current and past tribes in the area. But then she keeps going back further into the past, acknowledging “our Neanderthal relatives.” “And before that, even, the Dinosaur Nation, Dinosaur oyate, you know?” she says, using a word for “people” or “nation” as the kids stare quizzically. Then on to the “Star People” and, well, so on. “Also, our reptilian relatives, above and below Earth,” she intones earnestly. The Overly Native is someone we’re all familiar with: someone who thinks, as Miss M8riarch does, that in pre-contact life, “mostly we just made love, ate berries” and “sometimes the deer would even eat out of our palms.” Classic. In the next-to-last episode of Season 2, “Offerings,” Willie Jack goes to visit Hokti, the mother of the gang’s friend Daniel, in prison. Hokti doesn’t want to talk at first. But Willie Jack is persistent and asks Hokti to instruct her in “medicine,” a catch-all term that can mean anything from spiritual rituals to witchcraft. In an incredibly intense scene, Hokti, played by a luminous Lily Gladstone, prays with Willie Jack to remind her of who she is. “Remember the stories I told you when you were growing up, about the people we come from,” Hokti says. “Generations of medicine people. Caretakers. These are the ones who held us together as we arrived from our homelands.” As they pray, ghosts of Trail of Tears-era tribal members appear behind Willie Jack, and a Creek song — low, sonorous, and mournful — rises. “You don’t need me. You have them,” Hokti says. “When you really pray, they’re all around you. All the time.” This scene always puts a lump in my throat. As a Native person, it’s one thing to know, not just rationally but intuitively, that still being here with any degree of our culture surviving is itself a brazen act of historical defiance. But in the tradition of “don’t make a fuss,” it is not to be dwelt on. But the scene brought the entire concept to life in a way I haven’t felt in a long time. “We are still here,” as the saying goes, yes, but we are here because some specific people, who looked like that, dressed like that, sang like that, are no longer here. And there are obligations resulting from that. “Reservation Dogs” has been a great, bittersweet song to a place and people I grew up in and around and still love. But it’s also great because it succeeded in its very ambitious goal — to capture a slice of Native life, the good and bad, the petty and the mythic, the funny and the sad, and to gently lift the cover so others may see it. Not to make a fuss, but I can’t wait for Season 3. Jonathan Nicholson is a member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation who grew up south of Tulsa, Oklahoma.

    "article_content": "KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Renowned Sherpa mountain guide Kami Rita scaled Mount Everest for a record 30th time Wednesday, completing his second climb this month to the top of the world. Rita reached the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) summit at 7:49 a.m., according to Khim Lal Gautam, a government official at the base camp. His first ascent of this year’s climbing season was on May 12 guiding foreign clients. “He is in good health and happy to have achieved this record,” said Mingma Sherpa of the expedition Seven Summits Treks, which organized the expedition. They were able to briefly speak to him while he was on the summit and was in good health condition, Mingma said. Rita was still descending to the lower camps on the mountain, and Mingma confirmed Rita would not be climbing again this season and likely would travel home in the next few days. He also climbed Mount Everest twice last year , setting the record for most climbs of the world’s highest mountain on the first and extending it less than a week later. His closest competitor for the most climbs of Mount Everest is fellow Sherpa guide Pasang Dawa, who has 27 successful ascents of the mountain. Rita first climbed Everest in 1994 and has been making the trip nearly every year since. He is one of many Sherpa guides whose expertise and skills are vital to the safety and success each year of foreign climbers who seek to stand on top of the mountain. His father was among the first Sherpa guides. In addition to his Everest climbs, Kami Rita has scaled several other peaks that are among the world’s highest, including K2, Cho Oyu, Manaslu and Lhotse. Officials said more than 450 climbers have already scaled Mount Everest from the Nepali side of the peak in the south this climbing season, which ends in a few days. Most climbing of Everest and nearby Himalayan peaks is done in April and May when weather conditions are most favorable. Nepalese authorities issued hundreds of climbing permits to foreign climbers this season, and at least as many local Sherpa guides were accompanying them. The mountain can also be climbed from China. The official Xinhua news agency reported 70-year-old Wang Jian reached the summit Tuesday, becoming the oldest Chinese person to do so. Everest was first climbed in 1953 by New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepali Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer Ever since she was a little kid, comedian Youngmi Mayer knew she was funny. As the “quintessential class clown,” she remembers not being able to sit still but always being able to make people laugh. As an adult, Mayer began to wonder whether she could turn her sense of humor into something bigger. “I just did not think that I had the right to tell anybody that I had dreams of pursuing something like comedy or writing, ” Mayer, 39, says. “Because I thought that that was reserved for people who were just way better than me.” Mayer — who was born and raised in South Korea and later moved to Saipan, one of the Northern Mariana Islands — had long thought comedy was a luxurious and indulgent pursuit, a feeling she largely attributed to both being Asian and being a woman. She described not feeling worthy of that type of fulfillment and happiness — that is, until, at 33, she told her therapist that she wanted to pursue comedy. The very next day, Mayer signed up for an open mic at a dingy bar in New York City’s East Village. As she worked on her craft, that feeling of inadequacy crept back up. But Mayer kept reminding herself that regardless of which field we choose, imposter syndrome is a reality for many of us. So she leaned into the emotion — and found that the audience laughed with her, not at her. Today, she speaks through the lens of her identity: as a woman, as a Korean, as a biracial person, as someone who immigrated to America when she was 20 and realized that life wasn’t all like ” Saved By The Bell ,” and as the author of her upcoming memoir, “I’m Laughing Because I’m Crying .” Mayer’s approach to comedy is a refreshing, triumphant example of how comedy made by and about Asian people has evolved. In 2005, the year she moved to America, comedy was a space barren of the Asian diaspora, aside from a few famed comedians like Russell Peters, Margaret Cho and Ken Jeong. It was also a time when stand-up from Asian Americans was designed to be palatable to white audiences at the expense of those in the community. Sometimes, this was more obvious, like when it manifested in reductive mockery of our accents, our -isms and our identities. At the end of the day, it didn’t matter whether you, as an audience member, were Asian or not. You were going to laugh with everyone else at every crude accent, every comment about brown girls’ hairy arms , and every joke about ever-disappointed parents and about not getting into Harvard — all of which came from both people who looked like us and people who didn’t. ( White people were really on one .) Asian people in the West were typecast as “forever foreigners” and members of a model minority, because America’s white gaze didn’t have tolerance for nuance. Raj Belani , 38, a comedian who also works in T.V. production, believes that that era of comedy was a matter of circumstance and not individual willpower, which ultimately led Asian comedians to where they are today. “We’re better than [those stereotypes],” he says. “But at the time, I think they needed to do what they had to do to open that door for comics today. It’s a double-edged sword.” The white gaze in comedy was first disrupted by Black comedians such as Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy in the 70s and 80s. “Black people and culture did this first. Audiences essentially were given permission to laugh,” says comedian Kareem Rahma , 39. “And I think that’s what’s happening now, with the rest of us.” Rahma was born in Cairo, Egypt and moved to America when he was 6. Though he doesn’t identify as Asian himself, his Arab upbringing means that he resonates with facets of the Asian experience as a brown person himself. You might have seen him asking for strangers’ out-of-pocket takes on the New York City subway , or asking taxi cab drivers to take him to their favorite spots while they keep the meter running . More recently, he hosted one of six shows put on by Asian Comedy Fest , a NYC-based festival amplifying diverse comedians who are of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage. Asian Comedy Fest’s existence is the product of the change that’s come since the Somebody-Gonna-Get-A-Hurt-Real-Bad era. Spaces for Asian comedians to connect with audiences with similar backgrounds (and those who just get it) began cropping up, while social media democratized comedy and began connecting the right audiences to the right comedians. Harmful tropes around perceived Asianness ceased becoming the punchlines to jokes. Rather, the Asian experience, whatever that looks like to comedians, has become something to punch up, to pepper into more nuanced material, more incisive jokes and reclaimed stereotypes — and something that puts online and offline audiences in stitches. Mayer, who also performed at this year’s festival, has subverted many tropes and stereotypes around the model minority myth by finding humor in it. “Asian American creatives and comedians are forced into this very rigid box of saying exactly what people want us to say,” she says. “In that rigidity, there’s so much freedom because I can be like, ‘Oh, you thought I was going to say this? I’m not.’ I think for me, it’s one of the places where I find a lot of joy because it’s just so ridiculous.” Finding hilarity in these tropes is something that has bonded Asian diasporic cultures, across languages, customs, and circumstance: Mayer, for instance, finds that delivering some of her jokes in Korean both enhances the storytelling and delights a spectrum of audiences. But these comedians aren’t just making fun of white people; they’re redefining who’s the “other,” which is revolutionary on its own. To be clear, there are still many comedians today who rely on those tired tropes — about small penises, about being nerds, about not liking math. On one hand, comedian Alex Kim , one-half of the Boba Gays duo, thinks relying on these stereotypes in sets makes for uninventive hack jokes, and they stick out to him even more as someone who came to the U.S. for college after living in Abu Dhabi for most of his childhood and adolescence. “Unless you’re making an actual commentary on it, or you’re actually trying to expand the joke, you’re just regurgitating an old joke,” Kim, 29, says. On the other hand, he can see how this stereotype-heavy comedy is rooted in insecurity, and how those comedians may feel that they need to address their Asianness on stage. (Though maybe it’s the Virgo empath in him.) Kim himself feels a similar pressure around being a gay man. “I always have to address it somehow, you know? I have to come out every set just because, in order to get the jokes I need to tell,” he says. “It’s something I haven’t even done with my parents.” The sensation Kim describes conjures the gravitas of a single person being vulnerable to an audience of fleeting strangers who dole their laughter, recognition, and validation to a select few. But like Mayer, Kim tries to subvert and reclaim all of those misconceptions. “Even though I’m given the parameters of a performance, the fact that I’m able to take full control of it has enabled me to be more comfortable in coming out to people and being casual about it,” he says. Belani, too, is trying to subvert those same tropes. The comedian spent the first half of his career performing in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which has a tiny Asian population. “In Lancaster, the kind of comedy that I would kind of tend to focus on was more dumbed down comedy for the general audience — so nothing super specific about my culture or growing up Indian,” he says. But in these settings, the shock factor of the punchline is where his most revolutionary work occurs. “One thing I try to do is to spread progressiveness with my comedy, but in a way that sounds ‘backwards’ up top.” Belani explains. “And then when they hear the punchline, people are like, ‘Whoa, where did that come from?’” His set at the comedy festival did exactly that, throwing his audience for a loop while still delighting them, and finding nuance and normalcy in topics such as queerness and divorce that have traditionally been swept under the rug in many Asian households. Nonetheless, there’s a common thread in my conversations with Mayer, Belani, Rahma and Kim. Sharing their lived experiences with their audiences and calling them their own is actually where a lot of genuine connection happens. “I am living an Asian queer life. Yet the more specific I get, the more universal I connect with people,” Kim says. And inversely, as more and more comedians do the same, Asian American comics may feel less pressure to focus so intensely on their identities on stage. “It doesn’t have to be specifically in those stories about that identity. The fact that I’m talking — that a gay Korean is talking — and just the fact that I’m saying it, already makes it” about identity, Kim says. It’s when lived experiences become broad generalizations that we fill gaps with disingenuous tropes and lose sight of each other’s humanity. “Our brains are made to find patterns, and that’s how we understand the world,” Mayer says. “And then once you get that, that’s the reality in your head. It’s when we subvert those ideas that a lot of beautiful art and creativity lies, but it’s also what a lot of people hate and are afraid of.” Comedians — then and now — have always been expert observers, and comedy as an art form has its roots in responses to political and social events. We saw it in the way that Hari Kondabolu developed the incredible documentary ” The Problem with Apu ” (and how ” The Simpsons” took the bait ). We’re seeing it in the way so many comedians of Asian descent have used their shows to fund humanitarian efforts in Gaza . Comedy has always been a vehicle for social change and activism, and those who perform it are acutely aware of their place in the world. “I want people to feel seen, but at the same time, I want to feel seen,” Mayer says of her comedy. “And that alone is so rewarding.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer Kelly, Melissa, Rachel, Jennifer — oh, I longed to have one of these names as my own. I would’ve even settled for Grace or Esther, which were common Korean American names in the ’90s. By the time I was in fifth grade, I was used to teachers calling me Kim, even though Kimberly wasn’t my name and Kim was my last name. Many stopped asking how to pronounce my real name, Kyunghee, and shamelessly asked if I had a nickname they could use or just assigned me one without asking if it was OK. I wish I could go back and give the young Kyunghee a big, warm hug for how much she endured. I now understand why I stayed quiet and let people treat me the way they did. Most kids, whether they’re from Korea or America or anywhere else, just want to be accepted — even if that means not speaking up about something as important as their name. While my teachers and classmates were calling me whatever was easiest for them, I was busy practicing and trying to remember their names. The only times I heard my real name being used were at home and at church. What was once a name I loved because it was given to me by my grandfather soon became a symbol of shame and otherness. When I got to high school, some friends called me Kyung, which seemed to be a step in the right direction, so I accepted it. Still, I felt trapped between two worlds and two people — Kim or Kyung at school, and Kyunghee at home and at church. I found every bit of myself in a constant tug of war, and on any given day I wondered which part would win — the Korean in me, or the American in me? Because I was constantly grappling with the question of “who should I be?” there was never a chance to consider “who do I want to be?” I went to Michigan State University for college and, for the first time in my life, I was surrounded by so many Asians, many of them Korean and Korean American, who could pronounce my name perfectly. However, I quickly realized that finding a group of people who would accept me as Kyunghee didn’t make the struggles of being Korean in America disappear. Suddenly I felt too American around my Asian peers and not American enough around my American friends. This kind of constant redefining of an identity isn’t visible, but it’s something that many Asian Americans experience. After I graduated college and began my teaching career, I decided to finally give myself an American name when some colleagues asked if I went by a different name. I was already experiencing being othered. I noticed my colleagues called each other by their first names, but some of them called me Ms. Kim. They may have believed that they were being polite, but they were referring to me in the same way that my students did, and I knew it was because they didn’t want to deal with my name. It was hurtful. So I changed my name to Faith, and for 16 of the 19 years that I was a teacher, I went by that name (though I did not legally change it). I told all of my friends — even my Asian friends — and everyone I knew personally and professionally to call me that instead of Kyunghee. I could now introduce myself to people with confidence. My parents knew I was going by a different name outside of our home and, because it was common for many second-generation kids to have both a Korean name and an American name, they didn’t wonder why. Holding two identities — playing two roles — is normal for many Asian Americans. A good friend of mine expressed her sadness over me changing my name. To her, she said, I would always be Kyunghee. While I appreciated that, struggling with so many people mispronouncing my name, or assigning me a nickname I didn’t ask for, had taken a toll. Even though I became used to answering to my new American name and referring to myself by it, I never identified with it. Faith was a name I kept — but at arm’s length. I would catch myself looking at it written on a notebook or my school ID badge and wondering, “Who is that?” Despite living as Faith for almost two decades, she never felt like home. Being her made it easer to talk to people and make friends, but no matter how many years went by, I wasn’t her. She was a person I created out of shame and obligation — someone I thought was an improved version of Kyunghee. Faith was supposed to be the Kyunghee who is confident, smart, witty, outspoken and more American. But as appealing as she appeared, she just wasn’t me. When the COVID-19 pandemic happened in 2020, lots of people made big changes to their lives — some because they were forced to make them, and some because they felt like they suddenly had the opportunity to do so. As I watched the hatred toward Asians and Asian Americans increase dramatically — including in violent attacks — I felt compelled to reflect on my own life. I wanted to stand with my brothers and sisters and tell them that they are loved and they belong, but I wondered if I could honestly say that I loved myself or that I loved being Asian American. I realized that maybe I don’t have to be a different version of myself. Maybe, no matter what anyone else wants, I have to do what’s right for me. I decided to change my name back to Kyunghee. Reclaiming my given name was a fairly no-nonsense event. I told my friends and colleagues that I am Kyunghee Kim and that’s what I wanted to be called from then on. I let them know that if they needed help pronouncing my name, it wouldn’t be a problem, but asking me if I had a nickname or another name I go by would be. I’m surprised by how easy the transition has been for me. The second that I decided to go by my real name — and committed to being myself — the weight I’d been carrying lifted, and my body and mind felt lighter. It’s been almost four years since I became Kyunghee again. Now every time someone calls me by my name, I am reminded that I am Korean. I am reminded of my grandfather. And I am also reminded of all those years of being unsure of who I was. I think of Faith from time to time and know she did her best. I continue to live in the in-between spaces of being Korean and American, but it no longer feels like walking on a tightrope and trying to maintain perfect balance so that everyone around me is pleased. The path that many Asian Americans like myself walk should not be narrow and confining. Instead, I see it as wide road where one day we may be more Asian, another we may feel more in touch with our American identity, and sometimes it’s both or neither. Standing together and standing out by proudly displaying our uniqueness means fully being ourselves — our ever evolving selves.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer It’s break time during my weeklong psychodrama retreat, where 11 (mostly) strangers from all over the country are gathered in a mansion underneath the northern lights of Fairbanks, Alaska, reenacting and healing our complex traumas. I feel seen, understood and accepted in this container we created to keep us resourced, regulated, connected and safe as we confront some of our deepest, darkest memories. In between sessions, I sneak a peek at my work phone and immediately wish I hadn’t because reading an anonymous eight-word text message immediately undoes all of that. “You look very Asian with your single eyelids.” I don’t recognize the number. My heart sinks all the way down to my feet. Instantly, I feel the same survival responses as if my life were in danger: freeze, fight, flee or fawn. I am a target. I’m othered. I don’t belong. They don’t want me here. I am unwelcome. I’m not safe. Immediately, I remember the embarrassment I felt every time a kid at school made jokes about my eyes. “Can you even see?” “Do Asians see in wide-screen?” I think of all the times people have made the slanty eye gesture to me. I think of all the times I’ve had to laugh it off or sit there frozen and silent. The words alone may seem innocuous, but they trigger years of traumatic memories buried deep within my nervous system. I block them and put my phone away, but all it took was this one random text message from a complete stranger to send me back in time to when I felt ugly and defective. Why are my eyes like this? It’s not fair. I take a breath, stand back up, regain my composure, and walk back down the stairs and rejoin this group that, minutes ago, represented safety and connection. Now, my body is full of fear and anger because of a message from someone who isn’t here, as I take my seat again and pretend like nothing happened — just like I always do. I wish the message at home had been different, but unfortunately it wasn’t, at least not in my Korean American family. One of the most defining differences between those of Asian and those of Western descent is the presence of the upper-eyelid crease, or double eyelid. About 50% of Asians do not have this double eyelid. Blepharoplasty, the surgery to create this extra crease, is the most common cosmetic procedure requested in Asia and the third most common procedure requested by Asian Americans . I grew up bracing myself for this surgery. It was a rite of passage. My mom got it, her sisters got it, and my Korean girlfriends got it. Before I was old enough for surgery, I would wear double eyelid tape. Nowadays you can buy mass-produced double eyelid tape at Walmart and Amazon, but back in the day, I had to cut them up myself. When I got tired of putting tape on my eyes every day, I did what a lot of Korean girls do over the summer. At 14 years old, I went under the knife and got plastic surgery to try to look more Western and less Asian. I lay on the operating table — anxious, alone and very awake. The Korean surgeon spoke with a calming voice, explaining the process to me in Korean as I struggled to understand surgical jargon. He jabbed me with local anesthetic and made the first incision in my eyelid. He cut a line above my eye and then sewed it closed, creating a crease that didn’t exist before. I was awake, eyes wide open, for the entire hour. I felt a mix of feelings: fear, shame, sadness, and also hope. I got braces around the same time and I rationalized that the double eyelid surgery was similar. It’s painful and unpleasant but you’ll get a prettier smile, or, in this case, prettier eyes. Afterward, while I recovered, my eyes were bruised, swollen and tender for the rest of the summer. I rarely left my house and if I did, I wore sunglasses everywhere. I told my friends I was out of town. My parents encouraged it. They had been wanting me to do this since I was born. They would have been relieved if I had been part of the 50% that was born with a double eyelid because that would have saved them thousands of dollars they barely had at the time. I come from an entire country that has adopted the belief that an extra line above your eyes adds value to your life. But the sad truth is that, in my case, the rest of the world can’t even tell the difference post-surgery. This crease is so subtle, it’s almost invisible. My non-Asian friends don’t even notice until I point it out. I’m still bullied by anonymous trolls who can’t even tell that I cut my eyelids to conform to their beauty standards. And now, as I am confronted by these childhood memories in my adult body, I can’t help but question — who decided this is beautiful? This pressure to assimilate to Western beauty ideals hits home extra hard for Korean women because the surgery was first developed in the Korean War by an American military plastic surgeon for Korean war brides to look more appealing to American soldiers. Whenever I watch Korean dramas or listen to K-pop, I quickly notice that every Korean on the screen has double eyelids. For most of my life, I’d been so conditioned to believe my Asian eyes were ugly that I couldn’t even accept compliments about them. When I heard, “Your eyes are beautiful,” I immediately assumed that I was being fetishized or made fun of. They can’t possibly actually think that. I thought I would feel that way forever, but 11 years ago, when I was a senior in college, I was run over by a taxi while waiting to cross the street in Chicago. I was in the ICU for weeks, couldn’t walk, and had gashes and stitches all over my body, including on my face. I broke the bone under my eye and had to have surgery to replace it. The doctor said I should be grateful because, if it wasn’t for this bone, I would likely have lost my eyeball. I almost lost the very eyes that I was conditioned to feel were “broken.” I almost lost my ability to see. This time, when I lay on an operating table, I felt scared and resentful yet also grateful as the anesthesia slipped me into unconsciousness. I left the hospital after a few weeks and my mother flew in from Los Angeles and lived with my roommates and me for a month to take care of me — bathing me, cooking for me, and coming with me to many follow-up appointments. After a couple of months, I was walking again, back at school, and back to life as usual — except now I have a scar across my forehead, one that I’ve grown to love and appreciate as one of my many battle wounds. And I can still see. I can still see the sky, sun, mountains and trees. I can see what’s in front of me and behind me. I can see the world in all its beauty and grief. The day after I read the text message, I chose connection over isolation and shared what was bothering me at my psychodrama retreat. They held me close in a group hug as we let out collective screams of anger and frustration at the world and the systems designed to keep us separated. I felt seen, understood, and supported by this group of both Asian and white bodies. I noticed a shift within me. I didn’t want to give this stranger the satisfaction of making me feel inferior. When I look in the mirror these days, I can see my grandparents, born in Japan-occupied Korea, who got their first taste of freedom and globalization after World War II. I can see my parents, born just after the Korean war in a time when our little country became trapped in an endless battle between communism and capitalism. I see my ancestors, family, friends and a country full of people like me. I see our shared humanity and longing to belong and to feel valued and worthy. I see our stories and I’m inspired to give them life. I can see myself — a Korean American immigrant — and I feel gratitude and pride. This is what these eyes are made for: to see the world, ourselves and each other. Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

    "article_content": "Producer From the moment she stepped onto the stage of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” Plastique Tiara became a fan favorite — and she’s now the most followed drag star on TikTok . But the person behind the persona, Duc Tran Nguyen, had to navigate the complexities of her identity as a first-generation Vietnamese American immigrant before becoming a star . (Watch the video above.) “I moved from Vietnam to the United States when I was 11 years old. And prior to that, I really didn’t have any experience with drag queens,” Tiara told HuffPost. “During that time in Vietnam, it was very scary to be gay.” After moving to the U.S., Tiara watched “RuPaul’s Drag Race” for the first time. “I was like, ‘I’m scared. But I kind of like it. I don’t know what this is. But I see myself in this show,’” she said. Tiara made her dazzling debut on Season 11 of the MTV show. During her time on the series, she opened up about her journey as a Vietnamese drag queen and her family’s cultural differences toward accepting her identity. Her captivating performances garnered widespread attention, notably during the season finale, as she proudly appeared in a traditional Vietnamese ao dai dress. “I think that made a huge impact everywhere, and especially in Vietnam,” she said. “And I still get comments about it to this day, like, ‘That was the first time I saw an ao dai worn by a drag queen. And it meant so much to me.’” While drag in Vietnam is mostly performed underground, there has been progress in the country’s acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights. The first official Viet Pride celebration took place in 2012; it has continued to be an annual celebration in cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam’s more relaxed internet regulations have empowered queer and transgender individuals, fostering online communities that offer support and connection — with figures like Tiara playing a pivotal role within these spaces. “I just want to inspire the little boys out there in Vietnam who never knew that they could do something like this,” Tiara said. “There’s no bounds to drag. ...

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Throughout its run, the FX series “ Reservation Dogs ” has often been my go-to recommendation when anyone asks if there’s a show they absolutely should be watching. I’ve described it as one of a kind, and as a show that’s pushing the entire medium of TV forward on several fronts. There’s its groundbreaking representation in front of and behind the camera, as the rare show led by an all-Native main cast, writers and directors. And shot on location on Muscogee Nation land in Oklahoma, it’s infused with a sense of place, authenticity and specificity. Visually and stylistically too, each episode feels like a uniquely transformative experience, wryly funny one minute and beautifully poignant the next. The show seamlessly moves between tones and genres, defying classification and expectations. Giving a pithy little description of it — the adventures and misadventures of four teens growing up on a Native reservation in Oklahoma — doesn’t quite do the show justice or fully capture the care and detail that has so clearly gone into every single episode. (TV and film writers and actors, including those who worked on “Reservation Dogs,” are currently on strike over more equitable pay and working conditions in the streaming era.) Sometimes, it’s easier to just say: “Watch this show. Trust me, it’s great.” In its third season, which begins Wednesday on Hulu, “Reservation Dogs” continues to soar and bring out the very best of what has made it great. Creator Sterlin Harjo recently announced his decision to end the show this season . While it’s crushing to say goodbye, the sadness is lessened by the fact that it’s nice when a show gets to end on its own terms, rather than getting unceremoniously canceled. The chance to go out on a high note is even rarer for shows created by people of color and other people from historically underrepresented communities. Watching the first few episodes of Season 3, it makes sense why the show has reached a logical endpoint. All of the Rez Dogs — Bear (D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai), Elora Danan ( Devery Jacobs ), Willie Jack (Paulina Alexis) and Cheese (Lane Factor) — are now on the cusp of adulthood and in a moment of transition. At the end of Season 2, they traveled to Los Angeles and saw the ocean for the first time, fulfilling a dream of their late friend Daniel, and getting a taste of what being far away from home is like. As Season 3 begins, they all seem to be grappling with what’s next, and what adulthood might look like for each of them. It feels like a natural place for a show to end. From the start, the show signals to us that things for the Rez Dogs are starting to shift. Recurring spirit William Knifeman (uproariously played by Dallas Goldtooth, also one of the show’s writers) often appears in Bear’s imagination to give him comically cryptic advice. In the season’s opening scene, he breaks the fourth wall. As always, “Reservation Dogs” continues to not shy away from the darkness by confronting the history of Native trauma. There’s unfortunately no shortage of subject matter: colonialism, exploitation, displacement, dispossession; and Native communities today being perpetually underfunded, under-resourced and neglected by the federal government. That continues in this season’s third episode, which flashes back to the shameful history of federal Indian boarding schools , responsible for abusing generations of Native children. The show centers Native people in that history, while also allowing them to not solely be defined by their traumas — and does it all with warmth and humor. As this wonderful gift of a show comes to a close, will Hollywood executives learn the right lessons from it? If history is any indication, probably not. Right now, with two major Hollywood strikes exposing the depths of corporate greed and a broken system, it can be hard not to feel angry. Artists are fighting to preserve their livelihoods and fighting for their tiny sliver of the pie. Meanwhile, Hollywood executives reap the benefits, while claiming the people who make all of the work they profit from are asking for too much (instead of, say, knocking off a zero or two from their salaries). And in times of corporate “cost-cutting,” historically underrepresented voices are often the first to go . Will more shows like “Reservation Dogs” get made? In an ideal world, the answer would be a resounding yes. But we know Hollywood and the powers that be do not often work that way. The fact that the answer isn’t an obvious certainty is itself an indictment of Hollywood’s broken system and how far we have yet to come. To be crystal clear, there’s no shortage of Native talent out there, and the work will get made, regardless of whether Hollywood comes calling. Native artists, and artists from all kinds of underrepresented communities, are all too accustomed to finding ways to make their own work, creating community on their own and uplifting each other. Many of the people behind “Reservation Dogs” have exciting projects ahead. Jacobs, a star and writer on the show, has several shows and movies in the works, both in front of and behind the camera. Among them is starring in the new Marvel series, “Echo,” directed by “Reservation Dogs” director Sydney Freeland , and featuring a largely Native cast and crew. Writer-director Erica Tremblay recently made her feature directorial debut with her acclaimed Sundance film “Fancy Dance,” starring Lily Gladstone — just to name a few. So the question isn’t necessarily will the next “Reservation Dogs” get made, but more precisely: Will it get the infrastructure to thrive? Will it get the institutional support afforded to predominantly white shows, like major promotional and awards campaigns — all the things that are supposed to happen with a universally beloved show? Case in point: For two years in a row, the Emmys have virtually shut out “Reservation Dogs,” despite the show consistently being on many TV critics’ “best of” lists. And last year, Peacock canceled the celebrated Native sitcom “Rutherford Falls” after only two seasons. Describing “Reservation Dogs” as one of a kind is meant to be the highest of compliments. But in a different sense, I don’t want it to be one of a kind, or one of just a handful. I want it to be one of an abundance of shows like it — but also uniquely their own, too.

    "article_content": "As a Cree woman from Northern Alberta, I was truly shook to witness “Reservation Dogs” bring our Native humor to the mainstream. Hearing our rezy-isms like “skoden” is a small but mighty win against America’s relentless attempt to erase our accents and colloquial slang. We’ve had to code-switch for our whole lives, but through the characters in this series, the phrases we spoke only to each other were exposed for the world to see. It’s a moment both vulnerable and empowering. “Reservation Dogs” will end after only its third season, but the show has already been revolutionary for the culture — largely because it was written and led by actual Indigenous people, setting new precedents for Indigenous content moving forward. For years, we’ve had to endure violent stereotypes of Native people drawn crudely through a cloudy white lens. For so long, we were seen as a monolith of victimhood. The “Rez Dog” writers dismantled all of that swiftly, portraying us as who we actually are: vibrant contemporary NDN s with all different skin tones, lengths of hair, and ways of being. And so the show is a legacy, and an eversick example of Natives thriving in all areas of television and filmmaking. D’Pharoah Woon-A-Tai, who plays Bear Smallhill in the series, pointed out that even before pen hit paper, there was intentionality to the show. “The casting directors are the biggest part of making sure our stories are told right,” he tells me. “If a non-Indigenous casting director is going to cast a major project and is not familiar at all with our communities or culture, they will resort to stereotypes.” Stereotypes aren’t the only issue; we’re still combating a long history of non-Natives assuming a fake Indigenous identity for profit — when we have been here the whole time to fill those roles — or simply from a place of fetishizing our cultures . To be in a space where your cultural identity is protected, Woon-A-Tai says, is sacred. After working with an Indigenous-led team, he adds, “I will never do another project that’s not Indigenous-led that has as much Indigenous content that ‘Reservation Dogs’ has.” To provide a more intimate glimpse into how it all came together, photographer Jonathan Blaustein captured moments from behind the scenes of Season 3. Through this unique access granted to him, we’re able to see the authenticity behind the genius of the show. After more poignant and challenging scenes (like when the characters discover their friend Daniel’s body) many members of the cast and writing team came together to heal, by smudging, praying and singing songs — ensuring the well-being of the cast during those triggering moments. All of the storylines in the series are based on events that have actually happened to cast members, and NDNs all over Turtle Island . The writing and dialogue on the show reflect these shared experiences. “There was just such a shorthand and common understanding and collective experience that ties us all together,” Devery Jacobs, who plays Elora Danan, tells me. “There’s such an indescribable experience that roots you to your community and culture when we all come together.” This connectedness that Jacobs describes has resulted in a series that educates the masses without being didactic, and reinforces the sanctity of cultures that have battled attempted erasure for centuries. We, as young Natives, no longer exist in the margin. Below, see photos from the set and locations of “Reservations Dogs” by photographer Jonathan Blaustein. Jacobs’ voice resonated both on-screen and behind the scenes. “When I’ve worked on any other projects in the industry, oftentimes I’m the only Native person — and I’m the only queer person,” she tells me. “It puts me in a situation where I have to educate a lot more, where I have to fight for storylines, or I have to fight to make sure it makes sense.” On “Reservation Dogs,” she had the opposite experience. When Indigenous people get together, there is so much security in gathering together. “[This] kinship feels like family — we have this bond,” Jacobs says about her “Reservation Dogs” colleagues. “It’s wild to now be talking about this being the last season. Even though the show might be ending, our bonds are forever. I’ve been fighting for over a decade for more Native representation, fighting to have our stories heard and told. Same thing with everyone else on ‘Rez Dogs,’ all of our producers, writers, all of the directors — for us to be able to celebrate this together is just so meaningful.” “Everything either has happened to one of the cast members, one of the writers, directors — everything you see in that episode, Cheese being taken away into foster care, is true,” Woon-A-Tai says, referring to the Season 2 episode “Stay Gold Cheesy Boy.” “That happened to one of the writers. Everything in between, from suicide to the happy parts to the stealing — that’s all real. All these writers threw their real life situations into all of it.”"

    "article_content": "National Reporter, HuffPost OUTSIDE BROWNING, Blackfeet Nation — On a warm morning in June, Brandon Boyce watched as a bison bull stepped away from its herd. The 16-year-old hunter, his face nearly covered in reddish-brown paint, fired, striking the bull behind the ear — a challenging shot, but one that kills instantly when well-executed and wastes almost no meat. “Everything went right that day,” said Shane Little Bear, who helped prepare Boyce for the hunt. “He was blessed.” Boyce’s hunting party loaded the massive animal onto the flatbed of their truck and drove it over Buffalo Spirit Hill Ranch’s rolling hills and into a field in front of a barn where a group had gathered, many of them standing beside coolers. Several children ran up to the animal, oohing and aahing, while running their fingers through the thick tufts of fur around his neck. “His eyes are still open,” one said. “I want to help!” said another. Five people of all ages and genders began to butcher the bison, first slicing and twisting the head from the spine, then cutting through the sternum with a jigsaw, thickening the air with the iron-laden smell of warm blood and fresh meat. Termaine Edmo, a 35-year-old social worker who learned traditional butchery growing up in a family of ranchers, called out explanations to the crowd in a booming voice as the butchers worked their knives through the abdominal wall and diaphragm, then yanked the esophagus down the length of the bison’s body to hoist out the guts. The tribe historically prized organs, especially the heart and liver, Edmo said, as a man walked around the crowd offering fresh slices of raw kidney. Under no circumstances, however, should they let bile spill onto the meat from the gallbladder. Edmo passed off the stomach and intestines to a group of young girls, her daughters among them, who went to work emptying them. They searched the half-digested grasses and herbs in the stomach for invasive species, and dragged their fingers down the length of the intestine to squish out the excrement. After the gutting, a rotating group of at least a dozen people broke down the bull into hulking chunks, calling out the cuts as they went to see who wanted to take them home, serving elders first: “Who wants flank? Rib meat? Leg roast?” A generation ago, this scene would have been hard to imagine. Two centuries of pillaging by European settlers left bison nearly extinct by the 1880s. Private ranches fenced in almost all the survivors, transforming the buffalo from America’s most iconic wild ungulate into an afterthought for the livestock industry. The Blackfeet Nation has spent more than a decade trying to change that, spearheading one of the most successful efforts to free wild buffalo back on their historical lands. Now, the hunt and collective butchering mark the climax of Iinnii Days, a three-day festival celebrating all things “iinnii,” the Blackfoot term for the animal known in English as “bison” or “buffalo.” The celebration draws people from the four tribes of the Blackfoot Confederacy, as well non-Indigenous conservationists and curious tourists who straggle in from nearby Glacier National Park in northwest Montana. It’s the rare place a visitor might help build a medicine wheel, attend workshops on the benefits of regenerative grazing, and try their hand at fleshing the meat scraps and subcutaneous fat off of a fresh bison hide. And perhaps most important, this year the festival acted as the rallying cry for one of the most unique conservation efforts in recent years. On June 24, three weeks after Iinnii Days, the Blackfeet tribe took the historic step of freeing four dozen of the wild bison from Buffalo Spirit Hills Ranch onto a stretch of tribal land that borders Glacier National Park. The move sets the stage for the first large-scale, free-ranging bison restoration in decades. It’s hard to overstate how much of an accomplishment that is. The bison may be America’s national mammal, but it’s also one of the country’s biggest conservation failures. Somewhere between 30 million and 60 million wild buffalo roamed across North America at the dawn of the colonial era. Today, fewer than 450,000 bison remain, with livestock accounting for the vast majority. Only about 20,000 wild buffalo are left in a smattering of conservation herds ― fewer than a tenth of a percent of even the most low-balled estimate of their historic numbers. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is currently reviewing whether the wild herd at Yellowstone ― by far the largest in North America, at about 5,000 animals ― merits federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. And unlike other wildlife, only a tiny fraction of wild bison freely roam the landscape. Not even the grizzly bear, a 500-pound carnivore, faces such strict policing of its movements. Buffalo find themselves in this unusual position for two main reasons, one biological and the other political. Being large and migratory, they need big stretches of land. Human settlement and agriculture, however, have swallowed up or fragmented the animals’ best habitat. “Those buffalo were at the center of how a people viewed themselves. That being was everything. So what happens to a people or a person when that ‘everything’ is gone?” The political problem is that ranchers use most of the best remaining bison habitat to graze cattle — and most ranchers don’t want their cattle anywhere near wild bison. Not only do the two species compete for the same forage, but wild buffalo have a bad reputation for brucellosis infection. Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that causes weight loss and spontaneous abortion. Outbreaks can devastate ranchers’ bottom lines and jeopardize their entire state’s access to export markets for beef. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has spent billions over the last three decades to rid the livestock industry of the disease, and for the most part has succeeded. But herds of elk and bison in the Yellowstone area, contaminated long ago by livestock, still carry the disease and threaten to spread it to cattle anywhere they might mix . The result is that most of the few remaining wild buffalo in North America live behind fences. Critics view this caging of bison as a double standard that doesn’t apply to elk, which is true. Many insist that bison can’t even infect cattle with brucellosis, which is false. But double standard or not, where ranchers hold political sway, proposals to let buffalo run free inevitably butt against opposition. Conservationists dating back to Theodore Roosevelt have lamented the loss of America’s wild bison herds. Ecologists view them as a keystone species, whose selective grazing and wallowing maximized biodiversity and shielded grasslands from eroding into dust bowls. But few have suffered the loss of wild bison more acutely than Plains tribes of bison hunters like the Blackfeet. Before European colonization, buffalo provided the Blackfeet’s most plentiful source of meat and most reliable source of fat — a precious nutrient for nomadic hunter-gatherers. The animal’s hides covered their bodies as clothes and their lodges as roofs. They made cups from the horns, bags from the sun-dried bladders, and bowstrings out of the sinew. As the animals roamed from their summer range in high country basins to their winter range on the plains, the tribe followed. That transcendent role meant the Blackfeet lost more than food and tools when white settlers nearly annihilated the bison, partly as a military strategy to conquer the Plains tribes that depended on them. The foundation stories, rites of passage, sights, smells and rhythms of life built around the perpetual chase after buffalo all added up to an identity that suddenly lived in a vacuum. “Those buffalo were at the center of how a people viewed themselves,” said Cristina Mormorunni, founder of Indigenous Led, a key supporter of the restoration. “That being was everything. So what happens to a people or a person when that ‘everything’ is gone?” That bleak situation has changed radically over the last decade, as bison returned to Blackfoot life, sometimes in novel ways. With more hunting opportunities both on and off the reservation, far more people have buffalo meat in their freezers. Some ranchers are swapping their cattle for buffalo, looking to harness the ecological benefits of an animal with whom they share a much longer history. Teenagers like Boyce barely remember a time without bison. That shift has created a unique movement combining social justice, wildlife conservation and the assertion of cultural rights and traditional knowledge that is now beginning to reshape the larger landscape. “This is basically the same thing as healing generational trauma,” Boyce said. “The buffalo is a part of our community again. It’s just awesome. You drive out of Browning and you see buffalo next to the road. It’s just a beautiful sight to see.” A thick-framed man with a soft-spoken demeanor, Ervin Carlson brushes off credit for the Blackfoot buffalo restoration. When asked, he says the animals themselves made them do it. Few people, however, have worked on the issue longer or more effectively. The Blackfeet first started bringing buffalo back to tribal land some time in the 1970s, Carlson said. The animals weren’t popular. The tribe managed them as livestock, but struggled to control them. They busted easily through fences, angering landowners who had to chase them off. Contractors managed them at first, followed by the Fish and Wildlife Department. “There was a lot of controversy, even from our own people,” Carlson said. “Buffalo had been gone so long, people weren’t used to them.” In 1996, the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council handed off the unruly animals to Carlson. The same year, they appointed him as the Blackfoot representative to the Inter-Tribal Bison Cooperative, an organization dedicated to restoring buffalo to tribal lands across the country. (The organization renamed itself the Inter-Tribal Buffalo Council in 2009.) Back then, Carlson served as the tribe’s agricultural director, charged with building its cattle herds. He knew pretty much nothing about bison. But the years of hands-on experience and exposure to the ITBC’s mission-driven work fueled a passion for the animals and a desire to see them back on the landscape not as livestock, but as wildlife. He found a partner in Keith Aune, a fellow buffalo enthusiast then working for the Wildlife Conservation Society, a well-funded nonprofit. By the time the two met a little more than a decade ago, WCS had already mapped out some of the most favorable areas in the United States to restore wild bison. Glacier National Park — which borders the Blackfeet Nation and is part of the tribe’s historic homeland — emerged as one of the most obvious choices. With more than 1 million acres, it offered a lot of space and quality bison habitat. Canada’s Waterton Lakes National Park to the north tacked on another 125,000 acres. Both parks have long supported the idea, but cumbersome federal regulations and the contentiousness of bison politics in Montana made the National Park Service unlikely to lead the charge. Tribal governments, on the other hand, face fewer restrictions. Though composed of U.S. citizens, federally recognized reservations have a hybrid form of government somewhere between a state and a nation. Tribal sovereignty dictates that if they want to release wild bison onto their own land, neither the federal government nor the state of Montana can stop them. By that time, Carlson had spent years nurturing the dream of bringing wild bison back, while wondering whether the tribe really wanted them. When he and Aune approached the tribe’s elders with the idea, they found wholehearted support. But it came with a condition — they would have to get the whole community involved, especially the youth. The reason behind that request was that a successful buffalo restoration revolved around more than the animal. Colonialism severed some of the most cherished ties to the past for many Blackfeet. Archeologists and thieves made off with countless families’ bundles, ceremonial objects passed down by inheritance. As with other tribes, the federal government stripped generations of Blackfeet children from their families and forced them into boarding schools, where they were punished for speaking their native language and forbidden from dressing how they would at home. Bison restoration, tribal leaders hoped, could bridge the chasm separating the youth from the “old ways” that many lost touch with over the century-long federal policy of forced assimilation. “In an effort to reclaim what was taken, I think a huge piece of the story is that spiritual connection to the buffalo,” said Kim Paul, the executive director of the Piikani Lodge Health Institute, an Indigenous-led nonprofit that supports the bison restoration as part of its mission to promote well-being in Blackfeet country. “It’s really our umbilical cord to knowing that our children and generations are going to continue. If we can figure out how to turn around all the assimilation efforts that happened, the buffalo is key.” More than 100 community meetings across the Blackfoot Confederacy followed for what came to be called the “Iinnii Initiative.” Cattle ranchers shared their worries. The organizers held public feasts. They worked with students and professors at community colleges and universities. Resistance softened and enthusiasm grew. “It became real,” Carlson said. “They realized how important these animals were to us. It changed everything.” Many here refer to the restoration as “bringing the buffalo home.” It’s not just a metaphor. In 2016, the Blackfeet Nation received 87 wild buffalo calves from the Canadian government, in a transfer funded by the Wildlife Conservation Society. (The state of Montana objected to sending adult bison, Carlson said.) As wild bison neared extinction in the 1870s, a man by the name of Whist a Sinchilape, or Samuel Walking Coyote, trapped four bison calves and later sold them to Michel Pablo and Charles Allard. The two ranchers, both of mixed indigenous-European heritage, used the animals to help build up a conservation herd over the following decades, letting them range freely across the lands of the Flathead Reservation in northwest Montana. By the turn of the century, the Pablo-Allard herd numbered more than 700, making it North America’s largest. Congress destroyed their accomplishment with the Dawes Act. Passed in 1887, the legislation broke up tribal holdings, allotting parcels out to individuals and families, in an attempt to transform cultures of semi-nomadic hunters into farmers and ranchers. The Bitterroot Salish, Upper Pend d’Oreille, and the Kootenai Tribes refused to give up their lands until 1904, when President Theodore Roosevelt forced them to by signing the Flathead Allotment Act into law . Allotment broke apart the tribal land the Pablo-Allard herd had roamed . They tried to sell the herd to the federal government, but couldn’t agree on a price. In 1907, the Canadian government bought the herd, settling them in what is today Elk Island National Park in Alberta. “This is basically the same thing as healing generational trauma. The buffalo is a part of our community again. It’s just awesome.” The Dawes Act remains the single greatest obstacle facing any tribe working to restore wild bison herds to their land. The Blackfeet Nation’s unique advantage was that a jagged strip of tribal land running along the eastern edge of Glacier National Park was reserved from allotment, making it analogous to federal public land. Still, finding a spot to turn out buffalo remained a challenge for years. Several cattle leases remained active on the ideal choice, a patch of land next to towering Chief Mountain, a spiritual landmark for the tribe. The breakthrough moment came during the pandemic, according to Blackfeet Tribal Business Council Member Lauren Munroe Jr. Under the economic strain, some ranchers could no longer afford their leases. Conservation groups stepped in to buy out others. After three years of rest, the Blackfeet business council voted unanimously to begin releasing wild bison there. “I got butterflies,” Munroe Jr. said. “It was like, ‘Oh my god, we’re really doing this, aren’t we?’” If youth engagement is the standard, then the restoration has become a runaway success. Children of all ages ran across the grounds of Buffalo Spirit Hills Ranch on the second day of Iinnii Days this year. Some wore buffalo masks made from white paper. Others designed leather bags from a tanned bison hide. In the afternoon, Latrice Tatsey divided some of those youngsters into groups of “iinnii” and “hunters” to reenact a buffalo jump, a traditional method of hunting by setting bison stampeding over a cliff. The iinnii group lined up single file inside a ring of birch trees that acted as the festival’s main gathering point. Above their heads, they stretched a buffalo hide. At Latrice’s command, they sprinted off, followed by the hunters, with one young man struggling to stay mounted on top of a speeding pony as they chased the iinnii past three towering tipis and off toward the hills. “Tomorrow we’ll have a modern hunt with a gun, but this is how our ancestors did it,” Tatsey called after them. “There was a time when we didn’t have buffalo, and our people were pitiful!” The youth’s exposure to buffalo now stretches beyond the annual festival. Edmo, who announced the butchering session, leads outdoor butchery classes two or three times a month, spearheading a movement to use traditional animal harvest as a climate-change-fighting method to enrich soil. “You’re seeing more interest in the youth,” Edmo said. “Every time I do a harvest and have a school there, I could have 100 to 200 kids. Their eyes are wide and they want to touch everything.” It’s possible that one day in the future, some of them will have the opportunity to hunt wild bison on tribal land once again — though for now, the herd remains too small to support more than occasional hunts. In the meantime, the buffalo continues to permeate all aspects of Blackfoot society. Unlike cattle, buffalo co-evolved with Montana’s grasslands. Historically, they tended to congregate over a patch of land and graze it down to stubble, then move on, letting it rest for years. That pattern appears to send roots deeper, helping them sequester more carbon, enrich soils and foster biodiversity. Regenerative ranchers like Tatsey, who is also a soil scientist, try to emulate that pattern by rotating their animals across a series of paddocks for shorter periods of more intense feeding. “We understand bison aren’t going to be able to fully be on the landscape like they historically were,” Tatsey said. “If I can’t get bison everywhere, how can I get their practices back on the land, so those ecological relationships are restored?” The tribe maintains a growing commercial herd, whose meat finds its way to both local grocery stores and restaurants serving visitors to Glacier National Park. The Fish and Game office issues a limited number of tags for individuals to harvest them, but for most Blackfeet, hunting outside Yellowstone National Park , where the state of Montana honors historic treaty rights to hunt off tribal land, remains the most reliable way of filling the freezer. But in the near future, hunting wild buffalo on tribal land at the foot of Chief Mountain will again become possible. “I’m really glad that they show all the younger generations how to do it,” said Boyce, the young hunter. “If the younger generation doesn’t know how, there’s no future.”"

    "article_content": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Two prominent Indigenous leaders this week separately pressed President Joe Biden on why he hasn’t released Leonard Peltier from prison ― and signaled that tribal leaders and Native rights advocates plan to make this a priority issue in the 2024 presidential election. Fawn Sharp, the president of the National Congress of American Indians, said in a Monday letter to Biden that he regularly talks about his commitment to strengthening the federal government’s relationship with Native communities. But lost in that commitment is doing anything about Peltier, the Indigenous rights activist the U.S. government put in prison nearly 50 years ago after a trial riddled with misconduct and lies. “Enough is enough, Mr. President,” said Sharp. “After nearly five decades of imprisonment, this is now a matter of not only justice but mercy as well. We urge you to immediately commute the sentence for Leonard Peltier or support his petition for compassionate release.” In a Wednesday interview with HuffPost, Sharp, whose organization is the largest Indigenous rights group in the country and serves as a unified voice of all tribal nations, took a sharper tone than the more diplomatic one conveyed in her letter. “It is a choice,” Sharp said flatly of Biden singularly having the power to free Peltier. “Being silent on this issue, given all the facts, given all the advocacy, given all the issues raised by Indian Country, when it is your choice and you’re the top person and you choose to ignore it, you’ve become complicit in this injustice for Indian Country.” In another letter sent to Biden on Wednesday, Suzan Harjo, a longtime Indigenous rights advocate and 2014 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, traced her professional history with the president from the 1970s through 2014. She praised him for being a strong supporter of restoring Native peoples’ rights, from his work on the Indian Child Welfare Act to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act to the Violence Against Women Act. “Mr. President, I have long admired your commitment to fighting injustice and to restorative justice,” Harjo said. “As you weigh the pleas of justice for Mr. Peltier, I call on your compassionate core and spirited record of fighting against injustice and for democratic institutions. Each and every person in this country deserves a fair trial and rectification if the institutions meant to protect them do not do so. Leonard Peltier deserves that.” The letters mark the first time that both leaders are publicly calling on Biden to free Peltier. HuffPost obtained copies of both letters, which you can read here and here . Peltier, a member of the Indigenous rights activist group American Indian Movement, has been in prison since 1977 and is easily America’s longest-serving political prisoner . The FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office made Peltier their fall guy when they couldn’t figure out who killed two FBI agents during a 1975 shootout on Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. The government never had evidence that Peltier killed anyone, and his trial was outrageous: Prosecutors hid exculpatory evidence. The FBI threatened and coerced witnesses into lying. Peltier was separated from his co-defendants, all of whom were acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. A juror admitted she was racist against Native Americans on the second day of the trial but was allowed to stay on. Nonetheless, Peltier was convicted and sentenced to prison for two consecutive life terms. Peltier, now 78, has maintained his innocence for all of these years, even as it has almost certainly prevented him from being paroled. His decades-long parole process has been so problematic that United Nations legal experts last year made the unusual decision to revisit his case. Last summer, they called on Biden to release Peltier immediately. “Mr. Peltier continues to be detained because he is Native American,” they concluded in their damning 17-page legal opinion. Peltier remains in a Florida maximum security prison despite all of these problems; despite pleas for his freedom by international human rights leaders including Pope Francis, Nelson Mandela and Coretta Scott King; despite nearly 50 years of concerts and letter-writing campaigns and petitions circulated by thousands of supporters , politicians , Indigenous leaders and celebrities . He uses a walker to get around now. He is blind in one eye from a partial stroke. He has serious health concerns related to diabetes and an aortic aneurysm. “When it is your choice and you’re the top person and you choose to ignore it, you’ve become complicit in this injustice for Indian Country.” Sharp told HuffPost that Peltier has become a symbol of something much bigger and more personal for many Indigenous people: The entirety of injustices that Native people have endured, for centuries, by the U.S. government. That’s why Peltier’s freedom has only become a bigger priority over time, she said, and why her organization is “absolutely” planning to ramp up pressure on Biden to release him as he eyes reelection. “When I’m talking to tribal leaders … whether it’s about freeing Leonard Peltier or addressing the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people or the legacy of boarding schools, there’s a lens of justice that is very, very prominent in Indian Country,” Sharp said. “If ever there was a time going into an election [to free Peltier], the time is now.” Indigenous voters certainly delivered for Biden in 2020, and the president is clearly proud of all he’s done to lift up Native communities and tribes since taking office. (He should be, it’s a lot.) But his silence on Peltier, now more than two and a half years into his presidency, is a glaring contradiction to his vows to restore justice to Native communities. From a purely political perspective, Biden’s action (or inaction) on Peltier could be a real factor in driving Native voters to the polls in 2024, said one prominent Indigenous rights lobbyist who requested anonymity in order to speak freely. “Where there are any soft spots in Indian Country, where people may not agree with President Biden, this will be something that will unilaterally motivate Indian Country,” said this lobbyist. “Everyone simply says, ‘It’s time. It’s time.’ I don’t know that there’s anything more that might motivate folks to turn out, you know? ‘What, you finally freed Leonard?’ Yes, this would be a motivator.” This lobbyist added that Native rights advocates are “absolutely teeing up events to coincide with the election” to demand Peltier’s freedom. It’s unclear if Biden has even considered granting clemency to Peltier ― something HuffPost has been pressing the White House on for nearly two years and gotten nowhere. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about whether the president is weighing clemency or has seen the new letters about Peltier. Time is running out for Peltier, added Sharp, before noting it is entirely on Biden to decide whether to free an innocent man before it’s too late. She said, “It’s simply a choice we fully expect him to make.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer Desecrating Native American land, culture and practices has been an ugly U.S. tradition for centuries. A study published earlier this summer, however, has illuminated just how destructive modern agricultural and industrial practices are toward Indigenous communities all over the world. Although Indigenous people make up only about 6% of the world’s population, they are negatively impacted by at least one-third of all industrial development projects globally, according to researchers from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona in Spain and nine other universities around the world that was published in the journal Science Advances. The international study analyzed hundreds of Indigenous communities to see how land grabs — or large-scale land acquisitions by investors for agriculture and other industries — affected them. They found that many industrial projects around the world negatively impacted Indigenous communities , including through the loss of land and livelihoods, with the biggest culprits being mining, fossil fuels, agriculture and livestock. “ Our results provide large-scale evidence of the magnitude of environmental burdens faced by numerous Indigenous Peoples worldwide and bring into focus the Indigenous rights violations associated with these burdens,” the multi-author study reads. The unfortunate reality here is that governments across the board aren’t doing enough to protect Indigenous communities from displacement. While many countries have areas of land set aside for Native people, they are also often willing to swiftly seize that land once they “need it” for industrial purposes. “Governments should apply a zero-tolerance policy towards violations of indigenous rights and seek trade agreements that are conditional on compliance with the responsibilities of the UN Declaration [on Indigenous rights] by the companies involved,” said Álvaro Fernández-Llamazares, scientist and co-author of the study, in a report about the research. Forcing Indigenous communities to leave the land they’ve both lived on and stewarded for generations can impact their connection to their cultures in significant ways, but it also inevitably affects their well-being. In countries such as Indonesia , rampant deforestation forces Indigenous people to move to cities in often less-than-ideal conditions. In Brazil , violence, including kidnapping or even killing Indigenous people, can be used as tactics to seize Indigenous land and make way for industry. The U.S., of course, is also notorious for screwing over Indigenous people and their land — even in the face of long-standing treaties — for the sake of extracting resources or building vanity projects. During his administration, former President Donald Trump tried several times to turn over sacred Indigenous land to mining companies , and the wall he wanted to build between Mexico and the U.S. would cut through hundreds of miles of Native American land. Indigenous communities deserve autonomy, and governments should not be able to roll back their protections whenever they decide they need more land. Efforts to protect Indigenous land should be taken seriously and be led by the Indigenous communities that are going to be impacted by them the most.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer The Maui wildfires have been some of the deadliest in U.S. history: As of Wednesday, at least 106 people have been confirmed dead , per CNN . That hasn’t stopped some tourists on the island from acting like nothing has happened at all — and their behavior exposes a horrible pattern among some American and European tourists who completely disregard communities of color in the places they visit. Lahaina, the region of Maui where much of the devastation has occurred, is a sacred cultural place for Native Hawaiians ; in the early 19th century, it was the royal residence of King Kamehameha, who unified all the Hawaiian islands. According to some reports , tourists were swimming at nearby beaches just days after the fires tore through Lahaina. “That says a lot about where their hearts and minds are throughout all of this,” a resident told the BBC . “You don’t see our people swimming, snorkeling, surfing. Nobody is having fun in tragedy.” What’s happening on Maui now reflects the historical disregard that many tourists have for “vacation destinations” where people of color live. Places like Maui are just playgrounds to them, as opposed to places where real people live, work and love. Hawaiians have actually been asking tourists not to come to their islands for a while, citing concerns about overcrowding , environmental degradation and even water supply issues . Despite locals’ pleas, tourism in Hawaii actually increased this year. While Hawaiians go through one of the most traumatic events in their recent history, some visitors to the island seem to remain untouched, unaware and unbothered. One local councilwoman told of tourists showing up to neighborhoods in affected areas looking to check in for their reservations. If you’re a person of color, this behavior is probably not surprising to you at all, since certain Americans seem to live in an impenetrable bubble where they don’t even seem to register the suffering of people who don’t look or live like them. Puerto Ricans have, at some points, also asked mainland Americans not to visit their island , citing rude behavior and infrastructure concerns. Could they use the extra tourism money? Yes. But apparently, some tourists clearly don’t know how to conduct themselves in someone else’s house. Whether it’s Thai beaches being trashed or tourists swimming off Maui days after deadly wildfires, it’s time to come to terms with the truth of how some Americans treat people of color in other parts of the world. If it wasn’t clear before, I think it should be abundantly clear now: Hawaii was never our playground.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer It’s no secret that the church played a major role in imposing colonial rule in North America. But if you grew up under the American education system like me, you might’ve never learned about the Christian-run boarding schools that forcibly enrolled Native American children and then attempted to wipe out their culture. In the past few years, thankfully, the ugly truth about these schools has been coming to light — mostly in Canada, but now in the U.S., too. Recently, the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, or NABS, said it will digitize 20,000 archival pages related to Quaker-run boarding schools, according to The Associated Press . Much like Canada’s now-infamous residential schools , the Quakers — or members of the Religious Society of Friends — separated Native American children from their families to teach them Christianity and force them to participate in Western education. The documents, set to be published next spring, will include boarding school records from Kansas, New York, Pennsylvania and four other states, per the AP . Such schools weren’t just a Quaker thing. (The Quaker movement, it should be noted, has also included positive activism , especially during slavery.) Other schools that attempted to “assimilate” Native children were run by Episcopalians, Methodists and Catholics. The Native-led NABS is working with libraries at Swarthmore College and Haverford College in Pennsylvania to make the files available to everyone, the AP reports . Although it’s been neglected for entirely too long, making this type of historical knowledge accessible sets a positive example for what can happen when institutions are willing to admit their wrongs and provide a more accurate depiction of the past. Having more information about the Quaker-run boarding schools will help us understand what happened in them and how they were organized — history that has largely been out of public view. It will also allow us to comprehend the full extent of the impact that these schools had on Native American children and to honor their experiences. “Those records can be really important for truth-telling processes and acknowledging and supporting the repair of past harms,” Celia Caust-Ellenbogen, an associate curator for Swarthmore’s Friends Historical Library, told the AP. “By making these archival records available, by digitizing these records, we can help restore access to communities that were impacted.” Still, we have to remain critical of what we find, since many of the documents were produced through the lens of boarding school leaders, rather than the children who essentially endured brainwashing , abuse or worse . These records will require a deep understanding of colonialism as a system that has been constantly reinforced throughout history, including with the invasion of land and extermination of entire populations. But it also operates by teaching children that Christopher Columbus “discovered” America, and that the customs they grew up with are uncivilized or wrong — thereby erasing the humanity of the Indigenous people who lived here far before a European person ever arrived. While the Quaker community can never reverse the trauma and pain that it caused for so many Native American communities, it can start the healing process by being honest about its history and build from there with more clarity.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost The construction of former President Donald Trump’s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border desecrated Indigenous cultural sites, hurt wildlife, destroyed vegetation, dried up key water resources, exacerbated the risk of flooding and triggered erosion that has left mountain slopes “unstable and at risk of collapse,” according to a new report. The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan government watchdog, reviewed federal data and interviewed government officials, Native American tribes and stakeholders over the course of two years. The result is a comprehensive look at the widespread cultural and environmental harm — much of which experts had predicted — that came from Trump’s relentless pursuit of what he called a “big, beautiful wall” along the southern U.S. border. The Trump administration spent an estimated $15 billion constructing more than 400 miles of border wall, much of which replaced smaller existing barriers. It waived numerous environmental laws along the way. Trump had insisted during his campaign that Mexico would foot the bill for the construction, but Mexico never paid a dime. Laiken Jordahl, a conservation advocate at the left-leaning Center for Biological Diversity who documents environmental damage in the borderlands, told HuffPost the report “confirms all our worst fears about the damage wall construction has inflicted” on wildlife, public lands and cultural resources. Among other things, construction of the wall fragmented wildlife habitats, cut off species’ migration routes and destroyed ancient cacti and other native vegetation. “These border walls haven’t done a thing to address immigration or smuggling, but they did drive endangered species closer to extinction, butcher thousands of iconic saguaro cacti and dynamite Indigenous sacred sites and burial grounds,” Jordahl said. “This is a clear warning that any attempt to build additional miles of border walls would be a horrifically destructive and useless folly.” The federal audit notably follows a federal judge ordering Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) on Wednesday to remove floating buoys from the Rio Grande — a barrier that, like Trump’s wall, was meant to deter migrants from crossing the border and that has raised strikingly similar environmental and humanitarian concerns. Citing information gathered from numerous unidentified federal and tribal officials, the GAO concluded that Trump’s wall negatively impacted cultural and natural resources alike. “From the start, President Trump’s border wall was nothing more than a symbolic message of hate, aimed at vilifying migrants and bolstering extreme MAGA rhetoric,” Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who in 2021 requested the GAO look into the wall’s environmental impacts, said in a statement responding to the report. “This racist political stunt has been an ineffective waste of billions of American taxpayers’ dollars — and now we know it has caused immeasurable, irreparable harm to our environment and cultural heritage as well.” In Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a UNESCO biosphere reserve in southern Arizona that is home to numerous endangered species, contractors bulldozed and blasted land in order to expand an existing patrol road. The work damaged portions of Monument Hill, which is home to cultural and burial sites sacred to the Tohono O’odham and other Native American tribes. At nearby Quitobaquito Springs, an oasis in the Sonoran Desert that is sacred to the Tohono O’odham people, tribal leaders told the GAO that contractors cleared a large area and destroyed a burial site that the tribal nation had hoped to protect. “Tribal and agency officials and four of the five stakeholders we interviewed told us that some projects caused significant damage and destruction to cultural resources, including historic sites and sites sacred to Tribes,” the report states. “Tohono O’odham Nation officials explained that damage and destruction to such sites is often irreparable because it can disrupt or end rites revered or cherished by specific cultural groups.” Construction has severely affected water resources. In San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, an artesian well “no longer naturally flows to the surface” and “now requires mechanical pumps to maintain water pressure,” the report notes, citing information gathered from a stakeholder. “Moreover, some ponds in the refuge are now void of water, which makes it difficult to maintain water levels in other ponds that have threatened and endangered fish species,” it reads. Officials with the National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management highlighted the increased risk of flooding in certain areas as newly constructed roads have blocked the natural flow of water. Perhaps the wall’s biggest environmental impact is on animals and plants along the border. As the report details, barriers have restricted the movement of numerous species, including the endangered Sonoran pronghorn and Mexican gray wolf. In Texas’s Rio Grande Valley, towering border fences have “fragmented the endangered ocelot’s habitat” and “severed the animal’s travel corridors across the border” — consequences that a joint agreement between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Customs and Border Protection found to have “substantially elevated the risks of the ocelot’s extinction in the U.S.,” the GAO report notes. One of the more dramatic scenes to play out along the border during Trump’s tenure was construction workers cutting down ancient, protected saguaro cacti — a clearing effort that the report notes allowed for invasive species to take hold. Pictures at the time showed giant, thorny cacti toppled and limbs discarded on the side of dirt roads. The Tohono O’odham Nation viewed the destruction as a cultural assault as well as an environmental one. “The Tohono O’odham Nation officials explained that the saguaro is significant to O’odham culture and livelihood, as the saguaro provides an important fruit source and is a sacred plant to be given utmost respect, as a relative,” the report reads. Then there’s “significant erosion” stemming from contractors slicing through remote mountains and building roads and construction staging areas. Steep slopes were left “unstable and at risk of collapse” and “incomplete erosion control measures along the barrier and patrol roads threatened the integrity of the barrier system itself,” according to the report. In Arizona’s Pajarito Mountains in the Coronado National Forest, clearing vegetation for one staging area caused the soil to erode. A Forest Service official told the GAO the entire mountainside is now at risk of collapse. Jordahl called the GAO’s findings “horribly devastating.” “The description of damage to sacred sites and burial grounds is jarring,” he said via email. “The description of wall construction permanently damaging the artesian well system that feeds spring habitats that sustain endangered species at the San Bernardino National Wildlife [R]efuge is horrifying. This could ultimately lead to the extinction of the endemic species that live there. The parts about severe erosion concerns are also sobering.” The report, he said, “ shows the dire need for mitigation and restoration, and ultimately, the need to tear down the wall where it blocks important migration routes for endangered species like jaguars, ocelots and Sonoran pronghorn.” In interviews with the GAO, officials at CBP and other agencies blamed some of the negative impacts on President Joe Biden’s proclamation in 2021 that halted border wall construction, which they said prevented work to install road culverts and revegetate cleared areas. The report notes that CBP and the Interior Department have agreed to GAO’s recommendations, including working collaboratively on a strategy for mitigating border wall impacts. The Interior Department declined to comment on the findings. CBP pointed HuffPost to the report, which includes the agency’s response that it concurs with the GAO’s recommendations.

    "article_content": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― Maxine was 4 years old when the bullet whizzed by her face. She remembers feeling a burning sensation on her forehead. And then the blood. Her uncle grabbed her, and they ran. “I have a scar,” she said, motioning to a faint line above her right eyebrow. “Just a lot of people hollering. That’s all I remember.” Maxine is in her 50s now. Her entire life has been shaped by that near-miss, and it’s not just because she could have died that day. It’s because of the person who has been in prison ever since that chaotic 1975 shootout between FBI agents and Native American rights activists on Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. And that person — Leonard Peltier, a leader in the Indigenous rights movement — has been on Maxine’s mind every day since. “Every day. Every day we pray for him,” Maxine, who requested to only use her first name, said of her tribal community on Pine Ridge Reservation. About 19,000 people live here. “He should have been released a long time ago,” she said. “But they needed somebody to blame.” Maxine was one of hundreds of activists and Indigenous leaders at a rally outside the White House on Tuesday, urging President Joe Biden to grant clemency to Peltier. Tuesday was Peltier’s 79th birthday. He’s spent 48 of those years in prison, or nearly two-thirds of his life. Peltier’s imprisonment has been rehashed for decades . But if time has made anything more clear, it’s that his imprisonment is bookended by obvious, infuriating injustice: The U.S. government put Peltier in prison based on lies and misconduct, with no evidence that he committed a crime . Today, Peltier is an ailing, 79-year-old man deteriorating in a maximum security federal prison in Florida. He uses a walker. He is blind in one eye from a partial stroke. He has serious health problems related to diabetes and an aortic aneurysm. His life is mostly confined to a cell with 18 inches for him and 18 inches for his cellmate. “I am still here,” he wrote Tuesday in an open letter to supporters. Peltier has maintained his innocence the entire time he’s been in prison, which has almost certainly prevented him from being paroled. Last year, United Nations legal experts made the unusual decision to review Peltier’s parole process and concluded that it was so problematic that Biden should release him immediately. “Mr. Peltier continues to be detained because he is Native American,” they wrote in a damning 17-page legal opinion . Biden has the authority to release Peltier at any time. Indigenous rights leaders made it clear Tuesday that they want him to do it now, before it’s too late and Peltier dies. For hours, they shouted it at the White House. They held up dozens of “Free Peltier” signs and unfurled a massive banner with the same message that took at least 10 people to hold it up. They chanted, burned sage sticks and banged drums in between speeches and tribal dances. Their voices should certainly matter to Biden, who is proud of being a strong ally to Native communities and tribes. He should be. His administration has made historic investments in Indian Country , from infrastructure to housing to climate change. He respects tribal sovereignty . He talks about the need for justice in Native communities, particularly when it comes to stopping violence against women. He’s put several Indigenous people into senior positions in his administration, not the least of whom is Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who passionately urged Peltier’s release in her former role as a member of Congress. Congress hasn’t weighed in on this issue in years. I’m urging the Administration to release indigenous rights activist Leonard Peltier from prison due to COVID-19 concerns. At 75 with chronic health issues, it is urgent that we #FreeLeonardPeltier . https://t.co/XSa00RfdwJ The president will be increasingly reminding Native communities and tribes of his record leading up to November 2024. Native voters were crucial to Biden’s victory in 2020 , particularly in key battleground states like Arizona and Wisconsin. But Peltier’s prolonged imprisonment hangs over all of this. For many at Tuesday’s rally, and beyond, he has become a symbol of something much bigger than himself. He represents the centuries of pain and injustice that Native communities have endured at the hands of the U.S. government. The longer Peltier remains in prison, the longer the collective wound festers. Biden hasn’t said a word about Peltier since becoming president. On the one hand, it’s weird, considering that this is a president willing to address past wrongs against Indigenous peoples. His administration is very publicly reviewing the country’s painful legacy of Indian boarding schools, for example, and taking concrete steps to combat the long-ignored crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women. On the other hand, Biden’s silence puts him in line with his presidential predecessors. The FBI has made it clear, for decades, that it never wants Peltier released. And Biden, so far, appears to be letting the FBI dictate how this goes. “Biden doesn’t want to piss off the FBI because they want somebody locked up, even if it’s not the right person. That’s a political prisoner.” But pleas to Biden for mercy for Peltier aren’t going away, and are likely only going to get louder as election season picks up. The Democratic National Committee last year unanimously passed a resolution calling on Biden to grant clemency to Peltier. Seven Democratic senators did too , along with a separate group of House Democrats . “Mr. Peltier meets appropriate criteria for commutation: (1) his old age and critical illness, (2) the amount of time he has already served, and (3) the unavailability of other remedies,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, wrote in his own letter to Biden last year. “Mr. Peltier should be granted a commutation of his sentence.” During Tuesday’s rally, 35 people got arrested, including Fawn Sharp, the president of the National Congress of American Indians, the largest and most powerful Indigenous rights group in the country. Sharp told HuffPost last month that Peltier’s freedom is a top priority for her organization and its membership heading into 2024. Paul O’Brien, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, also got arrested Tuesday. The massive international human rights organization recently launched a new campaign aimed squarely at urging Biden to release Peltier. Maxine got arrested, too. These were planned arrests to make a statement, and everyone was released soon afterward. The protest, organized by NDN Collective and Amnesty International USA, was peaceful the entire time. Perhaps most remarkable about the gathering was its diversity: People of all races and ages, from teenagers to people in their 70s, felt a connection to Peltier’s story. Many could talk in detail about his imprisonment. Peggy Mainor, who is in her 60s, said she organized a march for Peltier in 1978 in Berkeley, California. She said she was deeply disappointed that President Barack Obama didn’t release Peltier, and isn’t surprised that Biden hasn’t done so. “He probably feels like he doesn’t have to do anything because he does have a strong record” with tribes and Native communities, said Mainor, who is the executive director of MICA Group, a Native-led organization in Baltimore that works with Indigenous communities to protect their lands and cultures. “Biden doesn’t want to piss off the FBI because they want somebody locked up, even if it’s not the right person,” she added. “That’s a political prisoner.” Tyler Star Comes Out, a 20-year-old Indigenous woman from Pine Ridge Reservation, said she feels tied to Peltier because he was arrested on her grandparents’ land. “For my entire life, I’ve heard stories of Leonard Peltier and AIM,” she said, referring to the American Indian Movement. “I’ve been hearing my grandparents advocate for him, and so, considering that I’m the younger generation, I’m continuing on their work.” Star Comes Out, whose father is the president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, will be old enough to vote in her first presidential election in 2024. She said she’ll “most likely” be voting for Biden, but if he doesn’t release Peltier before then, “I wouldn’t be happy about it.” Asked if she had a message for Biden on Peltier, she replied, “Respect our elders.” At least two of Peltier’s children were at the protest, Kathy and Chauncey Peltier. So was Norman Patrick Brown, who was with Peltier during that 1975 shootout. He was only 15 at the time, the youngest AIM member there that day. Brown said it was “really emotional” being at the gathering for Peltier, whose freedom he’s been advocating for his entire life. “I feel like people will never understand the stand he took,” said Brown, tearing up. “They don’t realize how much love there was by the Lakota people, the Navajo people. The elders thought of him as their son. ... He stood up against the federal government. The man was fearless, his heart was pure, his love for his people.” Standing a few feet away, Chauncey Peltier said he knew what he would say to Biden if he had five minutes alone with him. “I would ask him to please release my father from prison and let him go home. That would help the healing of my people [that they] have been going through for 500 years,” he said. “That would be a start.” “He’s completely failing us on this issue of justice for Leonard Peltier.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment about Tuesday’s protest or about whether Biden is considering clemency for Peltier. HuffPost has asked the White House about Peltier several times over the last two years. The last time it provided a comment was in February 2022, with this statement from a Biden spokesperson : “We are aware of Mr. Peltier’s request for a pardon and the outreach in support of his request. As many of you know, President Biden has a process for considering all requests for pardon or commutation, which is run through our White House Counsel’s Office. I don’t have more to share on Mr. Peltier’s request at this time.” Peltier’s attorney filed a clemency petition in July 2021, which begins the process for the Office of the Pardon Attorney to review his case for being released from prison. Asked what movement there’s been, if any, on Peltier’s clemency petition in the last two years, Justice Department spokesperson Dena Iverson pointed HuffPost to a searchable database on its website for those details on Wednesday. Its status here remains the same as it has been for two years: “Pending.” The FBI, which appears to be the only real obstacle to Peltier’s release, provided a statement Wednesday on why it still wants him in prison: The FBI remains resolute against the commutation of Leonard Peltier’s sentence for murdering FBI Special Agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams at South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in 1975. We must never forget or put aside that Peltier intentionally and mercilessly murdered these two young men and has never expressed remorse for his ruthless actions. Peltier’s conviction, rightly and fairly obtained, still stands, and has withstood numerous appeals to multiple courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. No amount of prison time changes the facts surrounding Coler and Williams’ deaths and commuting Peltier’s sentence now would only serve to diminish the brutality of his crime and the suffering of their surviving families and the FBI family.” But this is the exact same statement the FBI provided to HuffPost a year and a half ago , and every sentence of it is outdated, misleading or flat-out wrong. HuffPost asked the FBI in a follow-up email to explain all the discrepancies in its statement . There was never evidence that Peltier murdered anyone, and the prosecutors themselves later admitted they didn’t know who did it. Peltier was never convicted of murder; he was convicted of “aiding and abetting” by virtue of being present that day. The statement also doesn’t address the FBI’s and U.S. Attorney’s Office’s now-known egregious misconduct in Peltier’s case. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded in 2003 that the U.S. government’s behavior in Peltier’s case “is to be condemned. The government withheld evidence. It intimidated witnesses. These facts are not disputed.” Furthermore, the FBI statement doesn’t address the agency’s own role in instigating the shoot-out that day, which has been called out over the years by the 10th Circuit, the late Judge Gerald Heaney on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and former U.S. Attorney James Reynolds. An FBI spokesperson followed up to say the bureau has no further comment. Some attendees at Tuesday’s rally predicted that Biden’s inaction on Peltier will depress voter turnout in Native communities in November 2024. “Absolutely,” said Dallas Goldtooth, 40, an Indigenous rights activist and an actor on the TV series “Reservation Dogs.” “He’s completely failing us on this issue of justice for Leonard Peltier,” Goldtooth said. “All of us grew up with Peltier on our minds, our hearts, in our mouths. The fact that he’s still locked up is something that we organize around. Because we want to see him free, but also we want to see our issues acknowledged by this administration.” Maxine said people in her community regularly talk about how disappointed they are that Biden hasn’t released Peltier. “No one is going to turn out,” she speculated. “They just say that they made the wrong choice again. Somebody should have done something.” But others saw Biden in a different light. Suzan Harjo, a longtime Indigenous rights advocate and 2014 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, sat in a wheelchair amid the action. Baking in the sun on the cement, the 78-year-old poet and policy advocate said it was important to her to be there because Peltier has come to embody so much, for so many Indigenous people, for so long. “Leonard has always been a stand-in for us, for all Native peoples,” said Harjo, who had addressed the crowd earlier. “This isn’t some abstract guy,” she continued. “He was jailed as a symbol for us, for the freedom-loving Native people and the freedom-fighting Native people. He’s been in prison as long as he has been a symbol for us.” Harjo said what many people don’t understand is that all Indigenous people carry “generations of hurt and pain” caused by the U.S. government’s actions. “We don’t want to see the old days come again. We want this to be a new day, and President Biden is just the kind of person that can make that happen,” she said. “I don’t call him out; I call on him to do it. I believe in him.” Harjo brings the perspective of someone who worked with Biden on and off for decades during his time in the Senate. Last month, she wrote to him to personally appeal to him to release Peltier. She praised him for being a longtime supporter of restoring Native peoples’ rights, from his work on the Indian Child Welfare Act to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act to the Violence Against Women Act. “I think he will do it,” she said of Biden ultimately releasing Peltier. “I think that he’s a compassionate man and he’ll understand that this is our family we’re talking about.”"

    "article_content": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Nearly three dozen members of Congress on Friday urged President Joe Biden to grant clemency to Leonard Peltier, the now-ailing 79-year-old Native American rights activist who has been in prison for nearly 50 years. “As Members of Congress, we sign this letter with a deep commitment to the crucial role we play in upholding justice for all Americans — and to also hold our government accountable when we see a case of injustice, as demonstrated by the long incarceration of Leonard Peltier,” reads their letter to Biden, which was led by Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.). “We applaud your commitment to criminal justice reform and your administration’s work to address inequities in the criminal justice system and rectify the past wrongs of our government’s treatment of Native Americans,” they wrote. “We urge you to take the next step by granting Mr. Peltier executive clemency or compassionate release.” The letter is signed by 30 House members and three senators, Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.). It’s the fourth time that Democrats in Congress have publicly appealed to Biden to release Peltier since he became president. Interestingly, for the first time, a Republican congressman has added his voice to the calls for Peltier’s release: Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.). His office did not respond to a request for comment on why he decided to join their efforts. Here’s a copy of the letter, which, not coincidentally, comes in advance of Indigenous Peoples’ Day on Monday. Oct. 2023 -- Peltier Letter To Biden by jen_bendery on Scribd Peltier, a longtime Indigenous rights activist, has been in prison since 1977 and is easily America’s longest-serving political prisoner . Peltier was a leader of the American Indian Movement, or AIM, a grassroots group of activists focused on drawing attention to federal treaty rights violations, discrimination and police brutality targeting Native Americans. The FBI and U.S. attorney’s office scrambled to put him in prison when they couldn’t figure out who killed two FBI agents during a 1975 shootout on Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. They never had evidence that he killed anyone, and his trial was outrageous: Prosecutors hid exculpatory evidence. The FBI threatened witnesses into lying. Peltier was separated from his co-defendants, all of whom were acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. A juror admitted she was racist against Native Americans on the second day of the trial but was allowed to stay on. The U.S. government has since has acknowledged its egregious misconduct in the trial, with one federal judge concluding in 2003 that the government’s behavior in the case “is to be condemned.” Nonetheless, Peltier was convicted of aiding and abetting whoever did kill the FBI agents on the grounds of simply being present that day, and sentenced to prison for two consecutive life terms. The prosecutors subsequently admitted they have no idea who shot the agents at point-blank range. Peltier, who is now 79 years old, has maintained his innocence this entire time, which is certainly a factor in why he hasn’t been paroled. His decadeslong parole process has been so problematic that United Nations legal experts last year made the unusual decision to revisit his case. Last summer, they called on Biden to release him immediately. Peltier is currently deteriorating in a Florida maximum security prison, where he’s almost always confined to a cell with inches of space to move within and in a near-constant state of lockdown . He uses a walker to get around. He is blind in one eye from a partial stroke. He has severe health concerns related to diabetes and an aortic aneurysm. It’s bad. The FBI continues to oppose his release , though, so that’s why he’s still there. The bureau’s stated reason for why he should stay in prison, forever, is utter nonsense . Biden could release Peltier at any time, unilaterally. It would mean going against the FBI’s wishes. That’s where the rub is. In the meantime, the president is facing increasing pressure from within his own party to let Peltier go home. Beyond the repeated appeals from members of Congress, the Democratic National Committee last year unanimously passed a resolution calling on Biden to grant clemency to Peltier. Last month, hundreds of activists and Indigenous leaders held a rally outside the White House demanding Peltier’s freedom. Amnesty International, the prominent human rights organization usually focused on freeing political prisoners in other countries, recently launched a new campaign aimed squarely at urging Biden to release Peltier. Two prominent Indigenous leaders recently signaled that tribal leaders and Native rights advocates plan to make Peltier’s freedom a priority issue in the 2024 presidential election. “It’s simply a choice we fully expect him to make,” Fawn Sharp, president of the National Congress of American Indians, said of Biden releasing Peltier. “Being silent on this issue, given all the facts, given all the advocacy, given all the issues raised by Indian Country ― when it is your choice and you’re the top person and you choose to ignore it, you’ve become complicit in this injustice for Indian Country,” she said.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter The Navajo Police Department is the only tribal law enforcement agency in the country that trains its own officers. The department’s mandate to protect is both a covenant with their culture and an oath to the law. The task of finding young Navajo to take up the badge is explored in sharp detail in the new Max docuseries, “ Navajo Police: Class 57 ,” co-directed by Kahlil Hudson, Alex Jablonski and David Nordstrom. Navajo Nation spans 17.5 million acres, but only has 180 police officers to serve their people. Though the department estimates that the nation’s 170,000-plus residents need 500 officers, it struggles to find recruits who can fully serve the Diné, the Navajo word for their own people. While “duty” is a word often invoked by police, it takes on a different tone in Navajo territory, which is guided by the concept “k’é,” or a sense of kinship and mutual responsibility for Diné lives, culture and history. “We’re taught at a young age that everyone is your relative, and to have kinship and k’é,” activist Shandiin Yazzie explains in the series. “It’s like going up to a random stranger and being willing to help, because k’é means you have a responsibility to one another.” In practice, those deep personal connections can make policing in tribal land extremely complicated. Navajo cadets must learn how to balance being “not only a warrior, but also a marriage counselor or a therapist or a shoulder to cry on, or a sort of social worker,” Nordstrom explained to HuffPost in an exclusive interview. Often having endured the same sort of generational trauma as the people they patrol, Navajo police officers seem to feel a wedge between protecting their communities and perpetuating the kind of violence that has devastated Diné. That thorny history also means it’s not rare to find the Navajo Police Department responding to, or even arresting, members of their own family. The urge to break those patterns is what drove many recruits to the job, according to Jablonski. “You see community policing in this very real, very raw form,” he said. “A big part of the motivation for many cadets was, ’I don’t want to see my community be treated this way. I want to treat everyone as though they’re a relative.’” “Navajo Police: Class 57” was filmed during the course of the department’s 28-week training program last year. Hudson said many in the class were wary of their firearms, or any use of aggression, given their own experiences with police. “One of the young officers said multiple times, ‘I don’t want to be a typical police officer. I don’t want to be one of those police officers that’s just an alpha male kicking down doors. I want to come in with an understanding and understand what people are going through,’” Hudson recalled. While k’é guides the Diné, Navajo Nation’s dearth of officers leaves little time for a compassionate approach. In ride-along scenes, you see cops speeding from incident to incident solo, often spending as much as an hour to get to each case amid reports of people waiting as long as days to get an officer to respond. It’s under this pressure that we meet Class 57, and the 28 recruits that start the seven-month program. Week by week, a blend of brutal training, personal problems and poor judgment whittles down the roster dramatically. Those exits ended up being one of the toughest parts of filming for Nordstrom, who said he saw several cadets “poised to become really great and useful officers,” before “bad decision-making” got in their way. “To see what are very understandable and totally relatable things like making a youthful mistake have profound consequences for their career path was really sad,” he said. Hudson, who is a member of Alaska’s Tlingit and Haida tribes, said he and his co-directors aimed to balance the more sobering parts of the series with images of “joy, humor, celebration of family, tradition and culture.” Getting to know cadet Antwan Gray was especially heartening for Hudson, who said he saw Class 57’s youngest recruit turn from a timid, chubby boy to a self-assured man before his eyes. “By the end, he looks like an officer,” Hudson said. “He’s confident, but he’s still dealing with these demons like everyone else.” The Navajo Nation’s sovereignty, or legal right to self-governance, makes the reservation a unique testing ground for what a community-based approach to policing could look like. Asked if Navajo Police could provide a framework for other law enforcement, Jablonski told HuffPost it was impossible to say, given the department’s shortage of time and resources. Even still, he added, “I think if you live in the place where you police, you have an entirely different relationship and investment to the people that you’re policing.” All three parts of “Navajo Police: Class 57” are available to stream on Max now.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost In describing the development of his new film “Killers of the Flower Moon,” Martin Scorsese has said the long-gestating project went through a significant rewrite when he made a crucial choice: reframing the story to not make a white man the hero. Based on New Yorker reporter David Grann’s 2017 book of the same name, the movie was originally about how a federal investigation into a string of murders involving members of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma became a foundation for the FBI. The lead investigator was Tom White, an agent for the Bureau of Investigation, the FBI’s precursor. Frequent Scorsese collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio initially signed on to play White. But as Scorsese has recounted in recent interviews, such as one with Time magazine : “After a certain point, I realized I was making a movie about all the white guys,” he said. “Meaning I was taking the approach from the outside in, which concerned me.” The legendary director realized it should really be about the complex marriage of Ernest (now played by DiCaprio) and Mollie Burkhart (Lily Gladstone), and the crimes Ernest committed at the behest of his powerful uncle, Bill Hale (Robert De Niro). As the film depicts, Bill — a Godfather-like figure in town whom everyone calls “King” — orchestrates a yearslong scheme to extort Mollie’s family and other Osage community members in order to seize their wealth and the rights to their oil-rich land. (The character of White, played by Jesse Plemons in the final version, is now much more scaled back and appears only late in the film.) Scorsese is getting a lot of praise for focusing on the story’s brutality rather than centering a white man as the hero. It’s a better movie for it: an epic and unflinching story of racism, greed, exploitation and plunder. There’s a bone-chilling brazenness to Bill’s evil. He views everything as a transaction. As part of his long game, he encourages Ernest to marry Mollie, explaining to his nephew in no uncertain terms what marrying her will mean financially. Bill then gradually plots the murders of members of her family, and takes advantage of Mollie and her mother’s ailing health. And the cowardly Ernest is too easily persuaded into becoming his uncle’s accomplice in gradually defrauding his wife’s family, even though he seems to genuinely love her. The film’s 3-hour-and-26-minute run time is a lot. But it’s hard to imagine a shorter version. You need to see the full scope: the way the film methodically lays out Bill’s sliminess, such as how he positions himself as an ally of and benefactor to the Osage community while plotting to destroy them. Ernest carries out his uncle’s orders even though he knows he’s actively participating in the exploitation of his wife’s family. And throughout the film, many of these crimes happen in plain sight. By framing the film this way, it also spotlights Gladstone, who has deserved a major role like this ever since her breakout role in Kelly Reichardt’s “Certain Women” in 2016. Gladstone delivers the film’s most layered performance and serves as its emotional anchor. Through her resolute gaze, we can sense Mollie knows something is up. But what, if anything, can she do to stop it? If it wasn’t Ernest, it would be some other white man trying to exploit her family and community. But something has kept gnawing at me. While Scorsese warrants praise for the choices he has made here, why must it be exceedingly rare for a white filmmaker — and especially a cinema legend — to do some reflection and realize the story he’s trying to tell shouldn’t solely be about the white men? And to do the work of reframing that story, such as how Scorsese worked extensively with Osage consultants to portray their community’s history with accuracy and dignity? It would be nice if this was just a normal occurrence and not such an unusual one. And in retrospect, framing the story this way should have been more obvious from the outset. It brought to mind the conversation this summer around Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer.” That included criticisms that the movie, which depicts the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, doesn’t include the perspectives of the Native communities in New Mexico that were displaced by the Los Alamos facility and harmed by radiation, or the Japanese civilians who experienced the bomb’s devastating impact — and whose descendants continue to grapple with the effects of that history today. These questions aren’t on “Oppenheimer” or any one movie to solve. These are historic problems with framing and who gets to tell stories and decide how to tell them. For decades, Hollywood has loved to make World War II movies, and the vast majority of them are about heroic white men. That’s not to say they aren’t good movies, and some of them do complicate the conventional narrative and decline to glorify war. But it’s unusual when they deviate from the form, and there are so many more stories left to tell. One compelling variation on the World War II genre is Steven Spielberg’s 1987 epic “Empire of the Sun,” about a British boy (played by Christian Bale and based loosely on author J.G. Ballard) living in Japanese-occupied Shanghai. He becomes separated from his diplomat parents and spends several years as a prisoner of war in a Japanese concentration camp. I think it’s one of Spielberg’s more underrated movies, and in some ways, a more complex one than some of his better-known war films. But still, whenever I rewatch it, I wonder about the Chinese civilians who appear in background shots of the movie. What about their stories of death and destruction? In this story, they are both figuratively and literally relegated to the background of a far more privileged white male protagonist’s story. There’s the old adage that history is written by the victors. Perhaps a better way of looking at it: History is written by those who have power. It’s certainly a common pattern, whether in classroom textbooks or on screen. It’s especially present in stories about war and conquest, which routinely gloss over acts of evil. Just look at the ways those of us in Western societies have historically been fed stories about colonialism as tales of adventure and discovery — not of genocide and plunder. At many points, “Killers of the Flower Moon” plays around with familiar tropes and genres, like true-crime sagas and Westerns. By doing so, Scorsese reminds us of how stories like this are typically framed. It’s easy to imagine those versions of this movie: a suspenseful true-crime caper and a swashbuckling Western. It’s also easy to imagine the original iteration of this movie with a white law enforcement official as the hero, played by a giant movie star. We’ve seen that movie before so, so many times. All of these versions would be doing audiences a disservice, simply entertaining us and sugar-coating the truth. The film’s ending is both a clever framing device and an absolutely haunting coda, underscoring the ways history all too often erases the kinds of evils Mollie’s family and the Osage people faced — and pretends they never happened. Still, the film could have widened its lens even further. As I watched, I couldn’t stop thinking about the story’s parallels to the current epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women . Gladstone herself also stars in Erica Tremblay’s “Fancy Dance,” a film about a Native woman trying to investigate the disappearance of her sister while taking care of her niece, set in present-day Oklahoma. And while in “Killers of the Flower Moon,” the federal government does belatedly intervene and prosecute the crimes by Bill and Ernest, that certainly hasn’t been the norm. If anything, the federal government has been responsible for centuries of Native exploitation — and today continues to neglect and marginalize Native communities. Maybe Scorsese doesn’t need to draw the line between past and present, given the film’s already vast scale and scope. But what’s past is prologue. There’s also a version of this movie that could have centered Mollie herself, rather than opposite her white husband and his uncle. That’s an important point that one of the film’s Osage language consultants, Christopher Cote, raised when asked about his reaction to the final product. “As an Osage, I really wanted this to be from the perspective of Mollie and what her family experienced, but I think it would take an Osage to do that,” Cote told the Hollywood Reporter at the film’s Los Angeles premiere last week. “Martin Scorsese, not being Osage, I think he did a great job representing our people, but this history is being told almost from the perspective of Ernest Burkhart, and they kind of give him this conscience and kind of depict that there’s love. But when somebody conspires to murder your entire family, that’s not love. That’s not love, that’s just beyond abuse.” Once again, this is about who gets to tell stories and decide how to tell them. The cold, hard reality is that it takes the clout of a legendary filmmaker like Scorsese and mega stars like DiCaprio and De Niro to get a movie of this scale made. Cote went on to point out that it’s also about who the story is for. “I think that’s because this film isn’t made for an Osage audience, it was made for everybody, not Osage,” he said. “For those that have been disenfranchised, they can relate, but for other countries that have their acts and their history of oppression, this is an opportunity for them to ask themselves this question of morality, and that’s how I feel about this film.” Scorsese’s choice to reframe this story goes a long way toward making us consider these moral questions and sit with that dark history. But it’s going to take plenty more filmmakers at his level interrogating their choices and challenging engrained ways of telling stories in order to rewrite our existing narratives about history into something more honest.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer At height of spooky season, nothing feels more horrifying ― or more disrespectful ― than human remains that have been on display to the public for decades without the consent of any relevant parties. New York’s American Museum of Natural History, world-renowned for its comprehensive collections of cultural relics, recently lifted the veil on the troubling origins of some of its artifacts. In a letter to staff, Sean Decatur, the museum’s new president, explained that many of the human remains on display and in their collection were sourced in racist and violent ways. “We must acknowledge that, with the small exception of those who bequeathed their bodies to medical schools for continued study, no individual consented to have their remains included in a museum collection,” Decatur, who is the museum’s first Black president, wrote in the Oct. 12 letter. Under Decatur’s leadership, the institution publicly acknowledged that a significant portion of its collection of remains from 12,000 individuals consists of body parts belonging to Indigenous and enslaved Black people. Some of those remains, in fact, were taken from a sacred burial ground in New York City. According to the letter, most remains were sourced in the 19th and 20th centuries without obtaining anyone’s consent. It was common at the time for medical and scientific institutions and organizations to rob graves and steal body parts from sacred burial sites in the interest of bolstering racist, Eurocentric pseudoscience . Of course, this was seen as a valid justification for the violent abuse and exploitation of Indigenous and enslaved Black people. “I think it’s fair to say that none of these people set out or imagined that their resting place would be in the museum’s collection, and in most of the cases, there also was a clear differential in power,” Decatur wrote to employees. The museum’s board, Decatur announced, has adopted an updated collections policy and set of repatriation guidelines . The museum plans to remove unethically obtained human remains from displays and place them in storage, with the intention of learning more about the origins of its collection and returning all unethically sourced remains to their descendants. “We have to acknowledge that whose remains came into museums were largely from groups that were marginalized or exploited economically and socially, politically,” Decatur told NPR . According to the letter, the AMNH has already repatriated the remains of 1,000 Native American individuals and another 200 belonging to indigenous people from international tribes since the 1990 passing of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act . NAGPRA requires museums and universities to report any Native ancestral remains in their possession and return them to their tribes. ProPublica noted in January that “the remains of more than 110,000 Native American, Native Hawaiian and Alaska Natives’ ancestors are still held by museums, universities and federal agencies” ― and that about half of those unpatriated remains are concentrated among just 10 institutions , including the American Museum of Natural History. Some institutions defend their decision to hold on to these remains by arguing that they’re too old to accurately determine which tribes they should be repatriated to. Doesn’t it feel kind of contradictory for institutions that pride themselves on education to hold human remains without acknowledging how they were collected, whom they belong to, and whether there was consent to display them? As awareness about decolonizing institutions and museums continues to rise, these kinds of institutional shifts in attitude are crucial. All of us need to start considering how museums shape what we know of particular cultures and their people, and ask how we can begin to repair some of the damage that’s been done to these communities.

    "article_content": "The days of the disempowered staying quiet are over, but historical biases and confusing rhetoric have changed how we hold wrongdoers accountable. By Taryn Finley | Published Nov. 6, 2023 This is the first story in our weeklong series on cancel culture. Read the next story here . There was once a time when celebrities and public figures could be accused of committing a crime or wrongdoing and people might barely bat an eye. Their jobs and fandom stayed intact; their accuser was silenced, and people moved on. Take Dr. Dre, for example. In 1991, journalist Dee Barnes pressed charges against the Compton, California, rapper alleging that he brutally attacked her at a party while his bodyguard held off potential interferers at gunpoint. The next year, Dr. Dre — who pleaded no contest to battery and eventually settled a civil lawsuit with Barnes out of court — released his debut album, “The Chronic,” which went on to become praised as a classic. Meanwhile, Barnes had her story largely erased and reduced to a joke. While Dre got more famous and successful, Barnes’ career ended. “I was uniquely punished, you know, because, you know, you’re not supposed to snitch,” Barnes told NPR in May. “But at the same time, if I didn’t do something, I felt like, you know, the next victim would not be as lucky. And that’s really a horrible choice of words, because I was not lucky — maybe lucky in the sense that I didn’t die that night.” Though a rampant culture of misogyny and violence exists to this day, it’s hard to see a world where a public figure goes unchecked — at the very least from the internet — after committing a heinous act. It’s almost cyclical. Upon learning about an alleged crime, the public calls for the supposed perpetrator to be “canceled.” This public dragging usually coincides with companies and institutions severing ties with the celeb and, sometimes, an indictment or conviction. It happened earlier this year with once-rising Hollywood phenom Jonathan Majors . He was arrested over domestic violence allegations and was dropped by his management team, various film and TV projects, and brand deals. The backlash and distancing from Majors, who pleaded not guilty in the case, was swift. Though he didn’t lose all of his on-screen work, the blow was damaging enough for social media users to begin side-eyeing actor Meagan Good for dating him soon after the news broke. Aside from paparazzi pictures with family at Red Lobster and a conveniently timed video of Majors breaking up a fight between high school students, the actor has largely been out of public view. Like clockwork, the cancel culture gods came down expeditiously on Majors like a well-oiled machine. This past decade has seen different iterations of cancel culture. The concept stems from the idea of “call-out culture,” which has been a tool for those systemically disempowered to have their voices heard, especially on social media. Cancel culture takes call-out culture a step further — though some see them as one and the same — demanding that offenders face consequences in the form of losing opportunities and support. Merriam-Webster defines it as t he “practice or tendency of engaging in mass canceling” — or the public withdrawal of support — “as a way of expressing disapproval and exerting social pressure.” Though it’s impossible to trace the first instance of public outrage, in recent history the concept of canceling seems to be rooted in the civil rights movement and boycotting to achieve an equitable, safe and fair livelihood for Black Americans, as Aja Romano noted in a 2020 Vox article . The term itself stems from African American Vernacular English and was widely spread on Black Twitter in the 2010s. The topic of cancel culture peaked when the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements picked up steam. As the court of public opinion held convicted and accused wrongdoers’ feet to the fire, industries that historically protected culprits felt the pressure to cut ties with them. Many feared that they, too, would lose supporters and take a monetary hit if they didn’t take a stand. After all, to say or do nothing might suggest that they sided with perpetrators and not victims. This led to several public figures getting their comeuppance in recent years. And it started to feel like a domino effect. In 2017, The New York Times published an explosive story that detailed how Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein had been paying off sexual harassment accusers for years. The news sparked immediate public disgust and backlash against Weinstein. Within days, his own company fired him, his wife said she was leaving him, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expelled him, and he was stripped of multiple awards. Several celebrities condemned Weinstein and his actions, and some of those who didn’t were called out. After him, TV personality Matt Lauer was ousted from “Today” after being accused of committing rape at the 2014 Olympics. Lauer has denied the allegation . In 2014, comedian Hannibal Buress performed a stand-up bit in which he called Bill Cosby “a rapist,” referring to allegations against Cosby that had been hiding in plain sight. That ignited accusers and social media users to speak out, and led to several honors for Cosby being rescinded, his TV show being removed from syndication, and charges that eventually led to a conviction. The conviction was overturned about three years into his prison sentence, and Cosby was released . But he continues to face civil lawsuits from multiple women across the country who have alleged sexual misconduct. Cosby has repeatedly denied all accusations against him. In 2019, social media users called for a deeper investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against R&B singer R. Kelly. In 2017, Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye had launched the #MuteRKelly campaign to get the music industry and the public to divest from Kelly and his works. In 2018, Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora ceased promotion of his music — though it can still be found on their platforms — and the “Surviving R. Kelly” docuseries premiered the following year. After facing claims involving girls and young women for decades and being acquitted in a child pornography case in 2008, he was arrested in 2019 and later sentenced to prison on counts of child pornography, racketeering and sex trafficking. He has launched an appeal in one of his two federal cases. Those with decades-old accusations against them (whether acquitted or not charged) weren’t immune. In 2016, Nate Parker — who had previously scored praise for his performances in “The Great Debaters” and “Beyond the Lights” — had to publicly reckon with a 1999 rape case while promoting his film “The Birth of a Nation.” T he movie that once had Oscar buzz faced canceled screenings and Q&As with Parker, who had been acquitted in the case . He’s continued to direct since then, but Parker was largely shunned and isolated from Hollywood. In 2019, he apologized for how he handled the backlash. He reflected on his actions and canceling in a 2022 Washington Post interview, saying that although he maintains that he did not commit a crime, he may have committed moral wrongs. “All I see are the things I regret,” he said. Even Dr. Dre had to answer for his past behavior amid the premiere of “Straight Outta Compton” in 2015. The ramifications weren’t as severe, possibly due to an already established career and legacy, but the public pressure and renewed media interest prompted him to apologize to the “women I’ve hurt.” It’s important to note that the movement to hold wrongdoers accountable has done some good. Though internet backlash and calls for cancellation hold little to no weight in the legal process, pressure from the public can still play a role in the path toward justice for victims. Yet it is also true that cancel culture has taken different forms that don’t always align with its original intent. Cancel culture takes call-out culture a step further — though some see them as one and the same — demanding that offenders face consequences in the form of losing opportunities and support. Cancel culture, similar to the word “woke,” has evolved from Black slang to a path for empowering the disempowered to a nebulous entity that often feels like it takes on a life of its own. It’s become more of a concept that people with power argue about than the greater solution it was intended to be. Various famous people — from Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Hart to former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump — have suggested that cancel culture is unproductive and divisive. Others see it as a tool for accountability, empowerment and safety. Judging from a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2020 , however, many Americans don’t even understand what it is in the first place. When asked to define cancel culture, 49% of those who had heard about it said it involves “Actions taken to hold others accountable;” 14% described it as “Censorship of speech or history;” 9% said it’s “People canceling anyone they disagree with;” and 5% called it “An attack on traditional American society.” The confusion around cancel culture, especially from perpetrators and their supporters, has fed into its evolution. Somewhere in its expansion from holding wrongdoers accountable to blowing the whistle on celebrities using their platforms to spread hateful speech, we lost the plot. This has led to people like singer Chrisette Michele (who performed at Trump’s inauguration) facing a worse shunning from the public and entertainment industry than Ezra Miller (who was able to keep the lead role in a superhero film after being accused of physical assault and other misconduct ). The weight of what the person has done or said doesn’t always fit the punishment they’re dealt. Even with all of that, the truth is that those who actually get canceled are few and far between. The Recording Academy just named a Grammy Award in Dr. Dre’s honor this year, and comedian Louis C.K. won a Grammy last year despite previously admitting to sexual misconduct. Majors still has a few roles coming up for now, and Cosby remains out of prison. Even Chris Brown, who has a long history of assault allegations, continues to nab nomination after nomination at various award shows, the most recent being the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards. These are just a few examples showing that cancel culture is an imperfect system with inconsistent rules. The divisive views around it, combined with the culture of selective memory, leave little room for nuanced conversations about its effectiveness. Yes, cancel culture has helped hold some offenders accountable and empower those wronged. But this isn’t all it was meant to be. See the entire Cancel Culture Unraveled series here."

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Carpio Joseph Bernal is an artist, chef, contemporary and modern dancer and entrepreneur. After his sister’s unexpected death during the COVID-19 pandemic, CJ returned to his native Taos Pueblo in New Mexico, a UNESCO world heritage site that has been continuously inhabited for a thousand years, to open the first full-service espresso and juice bar located inside the ancient walls, where there is no running water or electricity. Bernal is using his family’s former art store as a space not only to serve food and drinks, but to have conversations about the challenges faced by Native Americans, and to raise money for an art center. In this edition of Voices in Food , Bernal talks about how Indigenous voices have been oppressed through generations, and how members of these communities can start healing through self-expression. In 2020, I was living in Los Angeles doing film choreography and working in restaurants. While I was visiting family in Canada during a two-week planned vacation, the borders suddenly shut down and the pandemic was declared. Since I was born in Canada, I wasn’t allowed to return to the U.S. for what turned out to be six months. My friends had to dispose of my apartment and salvage my belongings while I was taking shelter with my extended family. I was dealing with a lot mentally already, but I wasn’t quite prepared for what came next. One morning, I got a call from my dad and I just had an unexplainable feeling that something was really wrong. He was barely able to talk, and muttered: “You have to be strong for your family up there.” He told me that my 33-year old sister, Coral, had passed away unexpectedly. “We have underlying systemic trauma that is passed down through generations, and we don’t have enough funding to bring about positive change.” I immediately sought help from the tribes, and in two days I was able to get back to Taos. The funeral was intense, especially with the pandemic. My family and I not only were dealing with the death of a loved one, but had questions about her death. Speculations and rumors of what really happened did not help. Finally, it was declared “accidental health-related,” but she had been seen at an Indian Health Service clinic 24 prior to her death. The nurse practitioner analyzed her bloodwork and said that she was very sick and needed to be hospitalized, but the doctor did not admit her. We had already been fighting for health reform, and we went through a long, drawn-out process of seeking justice with all those involved ― the clinic, the sheriffs, the boyfriend and the behavioral health care system. We thought about pursuing federal court, but that would have taken many years. We decided as a family that we didn’t want to continue to re-traumatize ourselves, but to channel it in a positive way where we could help the community voice themselves. Two years later, my family and I held a press conference to talk openly about Coral’s death and about issues of sexual assault, addiction and domestic violence that Native people, especially Native women, face. Coral was a prolific poet, writer and activist. So we decided to start the Coral Dawn and Paul J. Bernal Center for Arts and Literature ― named for her and for our grandfather ― that would serve as a center for healing through artistic expression. Growing up, we didn’t have any structured after-school programs. There wasn’t funding for a recreation center, a gym or an art center for kids. So many of us turned to alcohol and drugs. But the next question was, how were we going to find the funds for this new center? “It is a lot of work to open the operation every day. I charge the batteries at my home and plug them in to run the refrigerator and coffee maker.” My skills were in the hospitality industry. I had held every job you could hold at a restaurant: dishwasher, mixologist, waiter, restaurant manager, you name it. In November 2022, I started with my own savings and opened a café in place of our art shop located at the pueblo, which has no electricity or running water. It’s impossible to have a full-service café without modern amenities. And Taos Pueblo was closed to visitors for two and a half years. But this was my new passion, and I wanted to honor my late sister. I called it the Dawn Butterfly Café , because she and I always talked about opening a coffee shop in the pueblo someday. With the help of my mom, I applied for a grant and received $8,000 from the Regional Development Corporation, a private nonprofit dedicated to improving economic development in northern New Mexico. With the seed money, I purchased solar-powered batteries, an inverter and a commercial espresso machine. It is a lot of work to open the operation every day. I charge the batteries at my home and plug them in to run the refrigerator and coffee maker. But the café is more of a social enterprise than a place to eat and drink. A percentage of profits are donated to fund the upcoming center. Cafes are designed to be social hubs where people come together and have conversations. Taos Pueblo is an international hot spot, so it’s natural that you will meet visitors from all over the world. My family and some other residents of the pueblo are happy to talk to visitors and share our stories. It’s a way for us to heal from our grief and loss, and promote the tribal voices that have been suppressed for centuries. Many of us feel that we are not empowered to say what we see or feel, because of the oppression and violence we have endured. From education and health care to food and nutrition, the Western mindset was imposed on us. We have underlying systemic trauma that is passed down through generations, and we don’t have enough funding to bring about positive change. Once the art center is open, I also plan to extend it to the Dawn Butterfly Bistro, where diners will learn about Indigenous ingredients and foods that we eat, and young Natives will have an opportunity to learn culinary skills. One of the bars I worked at in L.A. encouraged us to be ourselves and speak up. Through these establishments in Taos Pueblo, I want to teach our youth to communicate with others, express themselves and navigate complicated environments.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer Last Wednesday, Native American tribal leaders turned to Congress to seek support from the federal government regarding the fentanyl crisis in their communities. In their call to action were asks for adequate funding for addiction treatment centers, mental health resources and more authority for tribal law enforcement to help stop fentanyl-related deaths, according to Colorado Newsline . Fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid that is sometimes used as an anesthetic , is to blame a persisting surge in accidental overdoses in the U.S. over the past five or so years. The drug, which can be found in pill or powder form, is highly addictive and is believed to be 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. A drug that’s plaguing the rest of the country in this way, as you can imagine, is having even more catastrophic effects on vulnerable and disenfranchised populations. The statistics and anecdotes that were shared in last week’s hearing painted a jarring picture of the worsening opioid crisis in Indigenous communities. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) said she was disturbed at the rate in which Native Alaskans are dying of fentanyl overdoses . Over in Washington state, tribal leaders pointed out that they have asked Gov. Jay Inslee to declare the opioid crisis a public health emergency in the state. Bryce Kirk, a councilman of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes in Montana, said that he was worried about “losing a generation” to opioids after several people close to him have died, per the Medill News Service . Given how this country’s government has historically traumatized Native Americans and subsequently ignored substance abuse issues that have taken root in some communities, we should all be mobilizing to get tribal communities more support. Up to 10% of Native Americans have a substance use disorder, according to the American Addiction Centers , which lists several complex possible reasons for this, including high rates of poverty, unemployment and the purposeful breakdown of community and family structure through residential schools. There are also several current structural problems that are making the opioid crisis worse for Indigenous people. At the hearing, Tony Hillaire, chair of the Lummi Indian Business Council in Washington state, referenced an archaic Supreme Court case from the 1970s that limits the ability of Native American law enforcement to prosecute non-Natives who commit a crime on tribal land, according to the Oregon Capital Chronicle. In 2021, the Supreme Court finally relinquished more authority to tribal law enforcement, but if the nearest county doesn’t take in the person being held, tribal law enforcement has to release them, per Hillaire. This makes tribal communities especially vulnerable to more organized crime. Many tribal leaders specifically named the type of support they are seeking in order for their communities to heal : “low-barrier, culturally mindful wellness programs; access to traditional healing; medication-assisted treatment programs; sober-living housing; additional law enforcement; and stronger partnerships with local, state and federal agencies to address jurisdictional issues,” per The Seattle Times . All of this can only come to fruition with more funding. To add to the urgency of Hillaire’s call to action, he described another opioid called carfentanil that is growing in popularity within their communities. Carfentanil is not new, but it’s one of the most potent opioids and is even stronger and more deadly than fentanyl , per the National Center for Biotechnology Information . In order to stop this crisis from getting even worse, we need to pay attention to the most vulnerable communities, because they are often a signal of what’s to come.

    "article_content": "If you walk through Battery Park in lower Manhattan, you will find the Netherland Monument — a 1926 piece by the Dutch sculptor Hendrik van den Eijnde, and one of the many structures in New York that perpetuate the myth of the sale of this island. In all his glory, you can see Dutch colonial governor Peter Minuit “purchasing” the land with wampum beads, worth a staggering sum of $24, from a “Lenape Native” whose name no one seems to know. This Native man is wearing a headdress of the sort typically worn by Plains Natives hundreds of miles away. One doesn’t get the sense that van den Eijnde tormented himself trying to get the details right. The only proof of the “sale” of Manhattan is a small section in a letter written by a colonist in 1626 . T here’s no mention of beads or trinkets, and no deed of sale, only a passage cited from the Dutch National Archives that reads : “Our people are in good spirit and they live in peace. They have purchased the island of Manhattes from the savages for the value of sixty guilders.” The problem here is that Lenape peoples, along with most Indigenous peoples, are inextricably connected to the land as stewards, and did not share the concepts of money or land ownership as Europeans did. And so they were strategically displaced from their ancestral homelands, despite having shown graciousness to the Shouwunnok, otherwise known as salt water (read: white) people. This displacement of the Lenape peoples was a huge motivation for Mary Kathryn Nagle’s play “ Manahatta ,” which tells the story of Jane Snake, a Lenape woman who moves to Manahatta from Oklahoma during the 2008 financial crisis for a banking job — thus reconnecting with her ancestral homeland. “When I go back to our lands, there’s a connection there that you feel ― it’s inside you. I only feel it when I step on those lands,” Nagle tells me, about her inspiration for Jane’s character, who embodies the playwright’s connection to her own ancestral Cherokee homelands. As an Indigenous woman, there is a deep-rooted blood memory I feel when I set foot on my ancestral homelands in the Alberta Plains. There is an ancestral connection when I bend down to pick my sage from the earth and place my tobacco as offering. The connection that Indigenous people feel for our ancestral homelands is sacred, and it exists deep within our bones. For Nagle, this emerges in the way Jane moves through the world. Western Christian ideologies place humans at the center of the universe . By contrast, Lenape beliefs hold that humans grew directly from the earth itself, tethering us to the land. The earth is our original ancestor to care, love, respect and tend to. These differences of Western and Indigenous ideologies are often expressed in our traditions of storytelling. Nagle explains what these differences mean for the role of the playwright. In American theater, the playwright is placed on a pedestal. We hear about the genius of Arthur Miller , the genius of Shakespeare . But for most Indigenous writers, storytelling is about our connection to community and our ancestors. “What we’re doing here is a very communal form of storytelling,” Nagle says. “The playwright is a vessel that the story comes through — but it’s not really about the playwright.” Writing is a way for Nagle to connect with her lineage, history, and ancestors. Sometimes, she says, she doesn’t even remember writing down a scene or idea, but she feels as if it comes from ancestral memory: “I do believe the ancestors speak through us, if you allow them to, and if you’re open to that.” Communal storytelling and discourse is a multigenerational tradition because we are never severed from our lineages, even when we have been forcibly separated from our lands and families. Nagle brings this sentiment to her most recent production of “ Manahatta ,” which premieres Nov. 16 in New York . And if it takes a village to tell a story, Nagle gathered hers intentionally: Joe Baker serves as a Lenape cultural consultant; movement director Ty Defoe crafted the cultural nonverbal language; and Indigenous and non-Indigenous actors alike contributed perspectives that have created a vibrant and diverse iteration of “ Manahatta .” “ That’s how [we] learn and grow — that’s where the magic lies,” says Rainbow Dickerson, who plays Debra, Jane’s older sister. “ Yes, it’s nice having a shorthand with people who are similar to you, but to me, beauty lies in the differences.” Jane’s story emphasizes the struggle of reconciling a new city life with expectations and traditions of her Nation and family, while interweaving the tragic and very real history of the Delaware Nation’s expulsion from their ancestral lands. The story is resonant now, as the Lenape people fight for their ancestral land back and are attempting to rectify the erasure of their languages and traditions . Joe Tapper, who plays Jakob, a Dutch fur trader and liaison between Peter Munuit and the Lenape, tells me how his own understanding of Lenape and Indigenous peoples and histories have shifted since his involvement in the play. As a non-Indigenous person, he took it upon himself to do some research when he was cast. He said learning was one thing, “ but then to really be in this play... It’s really changed me.” Thanksgiving this year would feel very different to him, he says. Tapper’s sentiment represents a paradigm shift we need in order to eradicate the “us versus them” mentality that’s become prevalent in American politics. Acknowledgment and accountability for land displacements and for the injustices and violences committed against Indigenous peoples are now more important than ever. For that reason, “ Manahatta” was written intentionally for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities. “ If you’re Indigenous, you’re going to understand it in a way that non-Indigenous people will never understand,” Nagle tells me. But the play “isn’t an educational piece for non-Indigenous people — there are gonna be things non-Indigenous people don’t understand.” Nagle wants her audience, regardless of identity, to connect with Jane and her journey emotionally — whether you feel it as an Indigenous person affected by these histories, or as a European settler understanding the buried and forgotten histories, or just as a person who’s struggled with a sense of belonging in your own life. By empathizing with Jane, a deeper sense of Indigenous identity and place in this country is inevitable. The erasure of Indigenous histories has been a shameful reality throughout North America for generations. To have these histories represented in “ Manahatta ,” on the island of Manhattan, the sacred homelands of the Lenape peoples, is an act of resistance and a step toward acknowledgement and change that has been demanded for decades.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter Singer and activist Buffy Sainte-Marie has again addressed allegations that she falsely claimed to be Indigenous, saying in a Thursday statement that “I have never lied about my identity.” An October investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. had uncovered extensive evidence suggesting that Sainte-Marie, who has long claimed she was born in Canada’s Piapot First Nation, fabricated details about her heritage throughout her six-decade career. But the singer defended herself in a message shared with the media this week, saying that “I have always struggled to answer questions about who I am.” In the statement, which drew heavily from earlier remarks that followed CBC’s initial reporting, she claimed that she has “always been honest” about her family background and maintained that “I don’t know where I’m from or who my birth parents are, and I will never know.” CBC’s investigation included interviews with estranged family, as well as a birth certificate indicating that Sainte-Marie was born as Beverly Jean Santamaria to parents Albert and Winifred Santamaria in Massachusetts. The Santamarias, who Sainte-Marie previously claimed were her adoptive parents, and baby Beverly had their race listed as white in the birth records. In her statement, Sainte-Marie dismissed the inconsistencies as an “attack” on her “character,” saying she had no knowledge of the Massachusetts birth certificate. She also said that it was “common for birth certificates of Indian children to be ‘created’ by western governments after they were adopted or taken away from their families.” Sainte-Marie has repeatedly claimed that she was adopted by the Santamarias and had no information about her birth parents, other than the fact that they had Indigenous ancestry. In her 20s, she was adopted into a Cree family by Emile Piapot and Clara Starblanket Piapot. Piapot descendants defended their “Auntie Buffy” in an October statement , calling claims that she’d lied “hurtful, ignorant, colonial – and racist.” “I know who I am and I know who I love and who loves me, and I know who claims me,” Sainte-Marie said in a video last month. “And to those who question my truth, I say with love: I know who I am.” In this week’s statement, Sainte-Marie, who had previously been recognized as the first Native American to win an Academy Award, went on to say: “My Indigenous identity is rooted in a deep connection to a community which has had a profound role in shaping my life and my work. “For my entire life, I have championed Indigenous, and Native American causes when nobody else would, or had the platform to do so.” She added: “Being an ‘Indian’ has little to do with sperm tracking and colonial record keeping: It has to do with community, culture, knowledge, teachings, who claims you, who you love, who loves you, and who’s your family.” The statement comes after the documentary “Buffy Sainte-Marie: Carry It On” won an International Emmy Award in the arts programming category earlier this week. The Indigenous Women’s Collective, an advocacy group, slammed the choice in a social media post not long after, saying: “Documentaries are supposed to present factual information. An Emmy win is a slap in the face to so many Indigenous people tonight.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost In 2014, restaurateur Dana Thompson formed both a romantic and business partnership with chef Sean Sherman, aka The Sioux Chef . She became co-owner and COO of the brand, and in 2021, she and Sherman opened a decolonized Indigenous restaurant in Minneapolis called Owamni, which won a James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant in the U.S. Along with Sherman, she also co-founded the nonprofit NĀTIFS (North American Traditional Indigenous Food Systems) and Indigenous Food Lab. However, in the past year, Thompson and Sherman have parted ways, both in their personal and business lives. Thompson continues to do the work she started with Sioux Chef. She’s also writing a memoir about her traumatic childhood and developing a THC beverage line. In the latest edition of Voices in Food , Thompson talked to Garin Pirnia about the split, how she struggles with being biracial (her father is Scandinavian and her mother is part Dakota), and why women need more credit. With the work I’m passionate about, there’s really two lines. One of them is supporting women entrepreneurship, especially Indigenous female entrepreneurship. There’s been so much damage done. Historically, the matriarchy with Indigenous communities has been sort of the core of the community. Secondly, I’m really passionate about studying ancestral trauma, especially with regards to how it can be healed. I’ve been working with epigenetic scientists to understand the evidence that trauma can be passed through generations, and there’s clear evidence that it’s passed through at least three generations. But this is only 25-year-old research, and the scientists that I’ve talked to are pretty sure it’s more like seven generations. One way to block the transfer of trauma through generations is by getting culturally relevant foods into the mouths of pregnant women through their pregnancies. And so creating food access for women during the gestational period is something I want to continue to work on through my life. Chefs, especially male chefs, have become the new rock stars of the world. And by and large, we know that they struggle with chemical dependency and insecurity and imposter syndrome. Look at the show “ The Bear .” They pretty much hit the nail right on the head. I don’t want to take anything away from chefs. I love them so much, but there’s so much that goes into building a food enterprise. “It is really shitty when people are working equally to build something and only one person is getting really seen for it or acknowledged for it. Throughout history, women have supported a man ... and then as soon as they reach that pinnacle, then the woman gets left.” This is a really common story with women. I managed Sean’s career for seven years. I was flooring it 50-, 60-, 70-, 80-hour weeks. I’m really, really proud of what we accomplished together. He couldn’t have done it without me, and I couldn’t have done it without him. It was a symbiotic relationship that was really beautiful. The point was to raise the mission. The more fame he got and the more attention that we got for what we were trying to do, the more it fought white supremacy. The more funding we could get for the nonprofit, the more jobs we could create. Everything that I imagined happening literally happened. I meditated on him being on the cover of Time magazine , and then he got the Time magazine award. I’m not saying I was personally responsible for that, but I spent a lot of energy creating this amazing thing. I think building Owamni, working with the park board and creating a space for community healing is going to be part of my legacy and something that no one will ever be able to take away from me. We worked for years to get that open, and then we opened it during a pandemic and a racial uprising. I’m pretty proud of that. However, it is really shitty when people are working equally to build something and only one person is getting really seen for it or acknowledged for it. Throughout history, women have supported a man to get their degree or to build a business or to get whatever they want, and then as soon as they reach that pinnacle, then the woman gets left. And that’s not just a story about me — that’s a story about so many women, and it can get really ugly. But I really focus on the positivity of the future. I wouldn’t be able to do the things that I have in my future if I hadn’t had this experience of the last 10 years. So I don’t regret a single minute of it. One of the things I want to focus on is building other women up and raising awareness and highlighting them and showing that incredible work ethic, because women are also the ones who are taking care of the families and doing all the housework and getting groceries and doing all of these other things that they’re just expected to do. There’s also the financial aspect of it. I’m really passionate about creating pipelines for the rematriation of wealth, creating ways for indigenous women to be leaders of the economy so that they can support their families, so they can support their communities and their tribal communities so we can rebalance that feminine energy and make sure that women are at the table making these decisions, deciding what they want to do and how they can do that through a matriarchal lens. I’ve had a lot of time to process, and it was really painful at the beginning when the breakup happened. But I believe in my heart that this happened as a gift for me, that I wouldn’t have left unless it was this painful. It needed to happen this way. It’s also been a really painful issue where people will question my indigeneity or my validity in the work that I’m doing, but I have to just ignore that because I have very clear documentation of my Native line. If I let the haters take that away from me, then they’re taking away all of this amazing work that I feel like I can do in the world. And also for other people who have native blood but don’t look native, I don’t want to take their identity away from them. If I do that, then I’m taking it away from other people. So I feel really passionate about fighting for my validity. It is totally an identity crisis, and what could be more painful than someone questioning your clearly documented identity? It’s bizarre that anyone would even want to do that.

    "article_content": "Trends Reporter Lily Gladstone uses she/they pronouns — and has rather educational reasons for it. The “ Killers of the Flower Moon ” star revealed Sunday in an interview with People that her Indigenous heritage — she has Blackfeet and Nez Perce ancestry — taught her to rethink pronouns at an early age. “I remember being 9 years old and just being a little disheartened, seeing how often a lot of my boy cousins were misgendered because they wore their hair long,” Gladstone, 37, told the outlet. “It happens to a lot of kids, I think, especially Native boys … getting teased for it.” “So I remember back then being like, everybody should just be they,” she said. Gladstone added that most Indigenous languages use only “they” pronouns and that the gender of Blackfeet members “is implied” in their name. She also noted that even this isn’t binary, however, as Gladstone’s grandfather was named “Iron Woman” despite his gender. “I wouldn’t say that he was nonbinary in gender, but he was given a woman’s name because he kind of carried himself, I guess, the way that women who have that name do,” Gladstone said. “And there were lots of women historically and still now who are given men’s names,” she continued. “They fulfill more of a man’s role in society as far as being provider, warrior, those sort of things. So, yeah, my pronoun use is partly a way of decolonizing gender for myself.” Gladstone, who was raised on a Blackfeet reservation in Montana until she was 10, is already garnering Oscar buzz for her performance in “Flower Moon.” The Martin Scorsese drama chronicles the real-life murders of Osage Nation members in 1920s Oklahoma . While the actor is expected to be nominated for Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress (in September last year, Variety announced that she would campaign for the former), she told People that gendering these categories is peculiar — as there obviously aren’t “director-ess,” “producer-ess” or “cinematographer-ess” statues being handed out. Winning the Academy Award would make Gladstone the first Native American to ever snag a competitive Oscar, regardless. Nominations are set to be announced later this month.

    "article_content": "Last winter, I began to fall for a man who told me he was not human, not really. Perhaps that should have been the first warning signal — when he told me he’s not from here. Here meaning planet Earth, of course. At a conference I attended in Montreal last year, I arrived at one of the seminars and settled into one of the last vacant seats. In the beginning, I thought it was some divine happenstance, a beautiful coincidence that the only seat I could’ve sat in was right next to him. But maybe everyone else in that room was onto something I wasn’t. Perhaps that empty seat was another warning. It wasn’t long before he leaned over and asked me if I spoke French. I do not. Do you? He did not. He asked me if I was Cree and in that moment I was taken aback, feeling seen for the first time in a long time after navigating my way through white Ivy League spaces for too long. He was Smelqmix and Blackfoot. When it was time for me to leave and return to my squad of attendees, I said goodbye. It was nice to meet you. He pulled out his phone and asked me if I wanted to put my number in it and I did. He soon texted me to tell me he loved my energy. What a refreshingly different compliment from the usual man-on-the-street: Damn, shorty, you’re lookin’ fine . That night, I saw him arrive at the restaurant first. I paused outside of my Uber and watched him walk in, his long hair peeking out of his toque. His earrings dangled gently, and his jacket was vibrant and Indigenous and proud. I took in the way he moved, at the time thinking it was like the gentle glide of a gazelle. But perhaps it was always the stalk of a cougar or a lynx plotting his next kill. At dinner, he told me that when he saw me walk into the room at the conference, his spirit called mine to him as if he had been waiting lifetimes for me. The next three days were filled with tender moments, soft kisses, whispers telling me that I taste of soapberries. He spouted visions of the future, and grand proclamations about divine orchestration and the universe setting our paths in alignment. If you’ve ever been love bombed , I’ll be the first to admit how good it feels to be told every romantic thing in the book in rapid succession. There’s a reason why this tactic is so potent. But once you’re in and they feel like they have you, that’s when the cracks really start to show. Love bombers are the worst. But a love bomber who uses spirituality to manipulate a member of the same cultural community — that’s a special kind of evil. It entices in a very specific way. So many of us are longing to feel understood for all of our delicate and destructive tendencies. And for many minority groups, a huge portion of that understanding is intertwined with our cultural beliefs about the universe. As a Native woman, I have dated a handful of white men, but there have always been parts of myself that I had to hide from them because their understanding of the world has been very different from mine. It can be difficult to share with them my experiences in the sweat lodge, powwows, prayers, healing circles and what I mean when I say I feel the presence of my Kokum all the time. With the man who told me he was not human, not really — I didn’t have to keep certain walls up. I was able to tell him about the things I have seen that most of the white world does not embrace or accept. Indigenous peoples thrive on our connection to our ancestors and loved ones who have passed on, knowing we will one day join them in the spirit world. That is something I believe at my core, but it’s not an easy thing for non-spiritual (or non-Indigenous) people to accept. And so, my exchanges with the love bomber felt extra intimate and ripe with potential. He felt that and used it to his advantage. In one moment, he would fill me up with warm remarks and then be cold and distant the next. While I visited this man in his land, the Similkameen Valley, 10 days after we met, he took me to see Coyote’s Eye where we prayed and I thanked the land for welcoming me into it. We drove through the Ashnola, where I was enchanted by the way the ponderosa pines sloped gently downward, mimicking the path of the water that pushes down against the earth and down into the river. I was welcomed into the sacred pit house by his community, helped to hang cedar branches with black widows gliding down their webs. Once we were cozy in our chairs, we listened to stories of the Smelqmix. There, one of the oldest storytellers spoke about how special it was that we had some of our Cree relatives in the room tonight from over the mountains and how our collaboration and sharing of collective knowledge is essential to maintaining and preserving our languages, and I felt that in my bones. But when I was in his space and home, the red flags began to wave; I’m thankful that I have learned how to keep my eyes open for them. He began trying to convince me that I was insecure, which I didn’t agree with. He implied that I needed to heal as a person, and often insinuated that I didn’t have self-love. Those were the first instances that began to make the hairs on my body stand at attention, because for years, I had felt confident, self-assured, filled with a strong sense of self. In one moment, he would fill me up with warm remarks and then be cold and distant the next. It was no coincidence that around him I began grasping for that self-worth that was so easily ingrained in me before. In hindsight, I can see the way that he was the one who had not healed from his traumas and how he was projecting that onto me — taking out his own insecurities by trying to make me feel less secure as a woman. I am thankful for the moment he told me not to trust his best friend’s girlfriend. In my heart, I felt the opposite — that I connected with this woman—and that urged me to explore my love bomber’s warning. I spoke with her and uncovered every single lie and manipulation tactic that this man had used. Turns out, he’d tried to win back his ex-girlfriend the entire time he was making his future plans with me. Him, this man who said he was not human, not really. I am constantly making meaning of life around me, hyperspecific events that led me down the paths I believe I am meant to be on. Sometimes, lessons never truly unfold until later down the road. The gift of uncovering lies can be both challenging and beautiful. For me, the veil was lifted, the rose-hued shades were shattered, what stood before me was nothing more than a manipulative human. You see it clearly, eventually. So you say goodbye, run yourself a bath, light some sage and cleanse your space — reminding yourself to never trust a person who says they are not human, not really.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter Issa López is a bit anxious as we hop on a video call to discuss the fourth season of “True Detective.” For what it’s worth, though, it’s a pretty big deal for her. She’s the first female showrunner, writer, director and executive producer of the previously mostly white male-helmed and -centered anthology thriller usually plotted around cases of sinister, mortal horror. And with its latest outing, López turns much of that on its head by infusing the HBO series with more cosmic horror in a story that aligns two female detectives (Kali Reis and Jodie Foster) in a frigid Alaska’s monthslong period of endless night (hence the season’s subtitle, “Night Country”). When López and I finally got a chance to speak, it was just nine days before the season’s premiere this Sunday. So, she was naturally feeling the energy around that as reviews began trickling in. “I don’t wish it on the worst of my enemies,” she tells me. “The fucking instrumental waiting for the reviews is horrible.” Before I bring up the fact that reviews of “Night Country” at the time of our conversation were, actually, overwhelmingly positive , she quickly added that she was thrilled about this but it hadn’t placated her restlessness yet. As she reminded me, there were still more reviews to come. Plus, the audience had obviously not watched it yet. “I hate the idea of jinxing everything,” López continued. “You become so superstitious in this business, I’m telling you.” I believe it. To add to that, “Night Country” has been years in the making, beginning first as a stand-alone Western whodunit that López began penning in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, long before HBO came calling. What you’ll see Sunday is a sharp and fiercely feminine addition to “True Detective” that is expectedly disturbing but in a whole new way. And, as many others have pointed out, it is superb. Not just because the past two seasons of “True Detective” were subpar and the show needed this kind of a recalibration, or something , to restore confidence among viewers like me who had grown less enthusiastic about it. Rather, because López and her team were very intentional about making “True Detective” work for the kind of story she wanted to tell — and the final product proves that they tried like hell to make sure they succeeded. That included hiring consultants and producers like Cathy Tagnak Rexford and Princess Daazhraii Johnson to the already impressive roster including Foster, Barry Jenkins and Cary Joji Fukunaga to help ensure that the story, production and characters felt real and culturally authentic. And it included finding a place in Iceland that resembled the show’s snowy, quaint and shadowy Indigenous setting when the real Alaska inspiration wasn’t equipped to handle the large production, which started shooting in December 2022. This all began years prior in López’s Los Angeles apartment, well over 1,000 miles away from her native home in Mexico, where she was feverishly working on something brand new to her that would later become “Night Country”: a crackling murder mystery. “It’s terrifying to do something you’ve never done before,” she conceded. “I’ve done comedy, I’ve done horror. I love this, but I’ve never done it.” She perked up at the memory of challenging herself with this new venture. “You know what,” she said, recalling her own pep talk back then, “I was going to do it alone in my apartment, in the middle of the pandemic. So, if it was a miserable failure, nobody had to know. Right?” She was obviously poking fun at herself there, because HBO later wanted her idea. And, well, now everybody knows about it. “Night Country” manifests the series-ingrained brutality into a somehow even more disquieting murder mystery through López’s signature brand of genre folklore with a bleeding heart. If you watched “Tigers Are Not Afraid” — her chilling 2017 directorial effort that follows children in Mexico, orphaned by a cartel war, who embrace the supernatural to survive — you’re well-enough primed for the uncanny journey that is “Night Country.” Years after an already grisly case that detectives Liz Danvers (Foster) and Evangeline Navarro (Reis) worked on went horribly more awry, they are begrudgingly brought back together when a group of white male scientists suddenly vanishes. Their actual fate is even more bewildering. Their bodies are found together naked in a heap, with their faces frozen in terror in the middle of an icy tundra. Possibly related to this is a cold case that Navarro’s been agonizing over: a missing young Iñupiaq woman whose disappearance has devastated and understandably frustrated the local community. “Night Country” is at times lurid and almost impenetrably disconcerting. In addition to that ghastly image in the tundra, the two sleuths encounter a severed tongue during their investigation and faint apparitions when often they’re at their most vulnerable. A rattling watch indeed. What could have possibly happened that made the scientists wind up like that? What exactly were they working on? What, if anything, does the missing woman have to do with it? And what haunting pasts are both Navarro and Danvers hiding from each other and the audience that’s influencing how they conduct this increasingly bizarre case? These are the urgent questions that pulsate at the core of “Night Country.” But, as López emphasizes, the season is nothing without the complexities of its female characters. Those extend beyond the steely and practical Danvers, who is white, and the emotionally responsive Navarro to the locals, whose distrust in law enforcement is plenty valid as women around them end up missing or dead with no explanation. That’s even despite Navarro being part Iñupiaq as well as Dominican. (Reis is Cape Verdean and part Cherokee, Nipmuc and Seaconke Wampanoag.) These conflicts help make the show deeply human. The showrunner describes the season as “a little bit like Navarro, who’s such a badass, I think. But it has a heart, the way she has a heart.” López takes a beat before adding: “I always try to put a little bit of a soul in it at the end. Especially in that last episode, I think that it can speak to emotions.” Without spoiling the season’s conclusion, there is something to be said about the way characters throughout “Night Country” challenge and are challenged by both social and familial injustices to get closer to the truth — one that is often startling and cathartic in equal measure. And that’s all as two very different detectives find a way to work together, even with vastly separate motivations and methods that come crashing to the fore as each of the six episodes unfolds. Part of that dynamic was driven by something López learned while working on the project and specifically when she met with Inuit people. “My whole concept when I sat down with them [about] this dark season is how the darkness in all of us comes out and how we survived it,” she explained. López recalled their response to that precisely. “They very pragmatically said: ‘The one thing that is most important for you to capture about the Inuit experience and the Indigenous experience is community. That we survive, especially in an environment as harsh as this, by sticking together, by standing together,’” she said. That undercurrent of compassion is also propelled by López’s own instinct as a storyteller, one who’s just as fascinated by the macabre as she is with the ways in which we survive it. In fact, that’s exactly the space she was in as she began writing what would become “Night Country.” “I was losing my mind, as we all were, in the throes of the pandemic,” López recalled. “Fortunately, the series is so gruesome and fucked up and dark because the pandemic was informing the emotions where it came from.” As she pondered in a 2020 Vulture piece , though, she was also sorting through some pretty heavy questions about who humans will become, and how we’ll treat each other when and if we ever come out on the other side of, say, a cultural reckoning or a pandemic. She was trying, sometimes in vain, to prioritize a sense of hope. And that’s what peers through even the darkest corners of “Night Country.” “Not to be a nihilist or anything, but as an artist, you’re sometimes set up to be badass and go into very dark places,” López said. “Usually I go into stories with ’t he ending is going to be terrible and everybody will suffer .′ But this Mexican — hopeful, sweet things come in the end.” Sustaining that feeling off the page seems to be an ongoing battle. “Going through the pandemic, there were moments that it felt like we were never going to get our lives back,” López continued. “Coming on the other side, there was a little hope of having gone through something like that would teach us some lessons and we would be slightly better.” Just as quickly as she says that, though, it’s almost like the harsher reality invaded her mind once again. Have we actually learned anything? “What we’re seeing around us is concerning,” she added. That’s an understatement as we enter year five of the pandemic and the social climate being, well, what it is. “It’s getting more complicated every single year,” López said. “In which case, I think that putting into the screen stories that represent those dark times, with the idea that if you go through the darkness that you carry yourself, you might come into the light on the other side.” She noted that this sounded “a little trite.” But it’s something that she firmly believes, and that resonates deeply in her work, including in “Night Country.” This sentiment of finding goodness in even the most frightening of circumstances goes as far back as her childhood in Mexico, particularly after her mother died when she was just 8 years old. Though her mother was also a fan of horror, especially Edgar Allan Poe, she wouldn’t let López or her sister watch or read anything in the genre. But when she passed away, their father allowed them to watch whatever they wanted — as long as they discussed it with him first to prepare for it. It wasn’t just a talk about a movie, though. He acted out scenes from films like “Alien” and “The Shining,” much to López’s amazement. “He was a raconteur,” she remembered fondly. “An incredible performer. I swear to you, I saw those movies in my head before I saw them in cinema. I knew exactly what that woman in the bathtub looked like. And I was like, yeah, I want to see it.” A smile spread across her face as she shared this memory of her dad reenacting one of the most iconic moments from director Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film. Not only did that mean she wasn’t as unnerved by the scene when she finally watched it on the big screen, but it also helped ignite her interest in horror and its inspirations — a recurring one being grief, something she was sadly familiar with. “It became a drug for me and an escape from my reality, which was very sad,” López said. “I had lost my mom. I felt very different from the other kids. And I felt very isolated.” But through that devastation was a portal to a way for her to process it, one that she could create herself. “If this world was not everything that existed, if there was a wider world out there that opened more possibilities, and the idea that maybe people that were gone were not really gone and you could find them again later — that felt very warm and loving to me instead of horrible,” she said. It certainly creates a path forward, something that she was also clearly grappling with in 2020. “That’s how I became very, very close to the idea that not every explanation has to be closed,” she added. “And there’s more to what you can see.” We see that theory eerily incarnate particularly throughout Navarro’s story on “Night Country.” The detective struggles to manage her own personal losses with new ones threatening every turn and in a landscape that never seems to let up. Not to mention the stirring places that the season sends each of its characters as it reaches its shocking conclusion. Though López herself isn’t Indigenous, that sense of delving into the uncanny as a way to reflect on or avenge a more horrifying reality like death or femicide, a long-standing issue in Mexico as well, connected her to the story. Did she have any reservations about taking on this particular story as a non-Indigenous filmmaker? “Completely,” she answered right away. But she underscores that “Night Country” comes from a place of honesty, and that it returns her to a lingering theme in two of the four movies she’s directed — including “Tigers Are Not Afraid” — that deal with missing and murdered women, but in Latin America. “Number one, I’m not a believer in borders,” López said. “I think that borders are a completely artificial deceit that exist for economical and political reasons. And they are lines drawn on paper by men, usually white.” Fair points. “The violence happening to women does not care about those lines,” López continued. “That said, I completely respect the very specific and distinctive experience of how this is happening with Indigenous communities in the northern part of the continent. So, I wanted to be respectful.” But it was a screening of “Tigers Are Not Afraid” in Alberta, Canada, where more than half of the audience was Native, that solidified her decision to pursue the story of “Night Country” and work with the Indigenous community to do so. “They responded very powerfully and positively,” López said, recalling the Canada screening. “They were moved and we could see each other in that moment, which is what I care about. So, I felt that given an opportunity, I was going to talk about it, but I wanted to do it responsibly.” That entailed reaching out to Indigenous advisers to read early drafts of all the episodes. The director was very honest with me about that process. “They were like, ‘Why do you want to talk about this?’” she recalled. “I told them, and it was completely different. This connected to the loss of my mother, which was not in violent circumstances, but it was very sudden and I never had a chance to say goodbye.” With respect to the specificity of the Indigenous narrative in “Night Country,” López felt connected to it in a way she discovered particularly through the writing process. “I do understand the trauma of the sudden loss of that female center of your life,” López said. “When I told this story to the Indigenous advisers, they were moved. And they said, ‘You’re OK to tell this story.’” That’s a blessing not all filmmakers attempt to earn today, and at a time when recent stories like “ Reservation Dogs ” and “ Killers of the Flower Moon ” help necessitate the need for greater Indigenous representation in front of and behind the camera. “They could see that what I was doing was not a plot device,” López said. “To be talking about this that has been happening for centuries has nothing to do with the fact that it’s now around in media. But I believe it has to be done hand in hand with the community suffering these losses.” With “Night Country” now in the can for López, and an increasing dearth of Latine stories on screen, has it inspired her to investigate more horror rooted in Mexican experiences in an anthology series format? She’s apparently already been toying with that idea. “It could be really fun to do it with Latino and specifically Mexican folklore because men, women — there’s really fucked up, weird, beautiful imaginary there,” López said. That’s another reason why she’s been working so hard, because the process to get something done can be long and grueling. “And I have so many stories to tell,” she added. “So, this is a shoutout to everybody to give me the money and green lights so I can go and make my shit.” That’s where hope comes in handy. “True Detective: Night Country” premieres Sunday on HBO and Max.

    "article_content": "National Reporter, HuffPost On Sept. 7, 1895, two teenage boys from the Winnebago tribe entered Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. The Indian agent designated by the federal government to oversee the tribe, Capt. W.H. Beck, had forced the boys, Edward Hensley and Samuel Gilbert, into five-year terms at a boarding school that the Bureau of Indian Affairs ran on Army property. Forty-seven days later, Samuel was dead. Edward died in 1899, a year before his term would have ended. It’s not clear how either of them died, but administrators buried both boys on school grounds. No records exist to confirm whether the school sought permission from the children’s families to bury them there. It’s not clear when, or even if, school officials notified the families of Samuel’s and Edward’s deaths. Today, Samuel’s and Edward’s graves are part of an Indian cemetery featured as a stop on tours about the history of what now serves as the Carlisle barracks. Samuel’s tombstone misspells his tribe’s name as “Winnchaga.” Edward’s reads “Winnebaloo” and lacks a date of death. When Sunshine Thomas-Bear first tried to bring the boys’ remains home to the tribe three years ago, it looked like an open-and-shut case. Thomas-Bear acts as Winnebago’s representative of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act , or NAGPRA, a federal law enacted in 1990 that requires museums and state agencies that had pilfered tribal lands to return human remains and sacred objects. The law requires agencies to return human remains within 90 days of a formal request. But the U.S. Army flatly refused to recognize NAGPRA, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday , instead pushing Winnebago to use the Army’s own process and prodding them to pass a resolution through the Tribal Council before moving forward. Now Winnebago is suing the Army to force compliance with the repatriation act in a case that could have implications for other institutions that have skirted the law or slow-walked compliance. “According to Winnebago traditional beliefs, the longer that Samuel and Edward remain at Carlisle, the more harm is done to their spirits and to Winnebago,” the complaint reads. “Winnebago believes that Samuel and Edward have been in a perpetual state of unrest since their respective burials in 1895 and 1899 and that the boys have been waiting to come home since their deaths.” The Army declined to comment for this article, citing pending litigation. Carlisle Indian Industrial School was the first in what would become a sprawling system of more than 400 boarding schools devised to stamp out tribal culture. The Bureau of Indian Affairs pressed tens of thousands of children like Samuel and Edward into schools far from their families to learn English, farming and trades. Students were forced to choose an English name and cut their hair, and they were barred from speaking their native languages or observing their religions. They were punished physically for breaking those rules. The purpose of the system was to “kill the Indian, save the man,” according to the school’s founder and superintendent, Richard Henry Pratt. Administrators tried to bury the first student to die at the Carlisle school, a boy named Amos, in a nearby government plot but disinterred him when the Department of Defense determined that only whites could be buried in the graveyard, according to the complaint. The school created its on-site burial ground in response. At least 179 Native children were buried there. The school closed in 1918, and the Army converted the building into a hospital the following year. It later became a medical school. As the building expanded in the 1920s, the Army disinterred the graves and moved them to their current location at Carlisle Cemetery. The process appeared haphazard, the lawsuit says. The new gravestones had incorrectly spelled names and tribal affiliations, and some, like Edward’s, are missing death dates. The gravesite contains at least 14 graves of unidentified remains, according to the complaint. Thomas-Bear first contacted Justin Buller, an Army attorney, on July 16, 2021, with a request to bring home the remains of Samuel and Edward. Buller responded that the Office of Army Cemeteries’ Disinterment and Return Process only allows the closest living relative to start a request. That would pose a challenge, Thomas-Bear said, given that both boys died at Carlisle as teenagers and never had children. Buller said the Winnebago Tribal Council could pass a resolution naming Thomas-Bear as the closest living relative. But that wasn’t true, and neither Thomas-Bear nor the council members wanted to pass legislation that amounted to lying. Federally recognized tribes have a unique form of sovereignty, and mid-level bureaucrats do not have the authority to tell tribes what laws to pass. “When you get to the point that you have a federal agency saying, ‘Just make it up and fill out the form,’ we have a problem,” said Greg Werkheiser of Cultural Heritage Partners, one of the attorneys representing Winnebago. The most confusing part to Thomas-Bear was why the Army made its own rules and was not following NAGPRA. Still, she combed the census rolls, looking for a family member who could make the request. Unable to find one, Winnebago sent a letter in October 2023 formally asking the Army to return Samuel’s and Edward’s remains under the NAGPRA process. Buller once again said the Army would use the process the Office of Army Cemeteries had devised. When Winnebago asked why the Army would not follow federal law, Buller wrote that “this matter is highly complex and cannot be addressed with simple yes or no answers.” A month later, the Army sent the tribe a letter contending that the Carlisle graves did not amount to “collections” for the purpose of the law and that federal courts have held that NAGPRA “does not require the Army to engage in the intentional excavation or exhumation of a grave.” The letter did not note which court decisions it was referencing. “Defendants did not cite any specific court or case, likely because they cannot: no federal court has ever held or said what Defendants assert,” the Winnebago lawsuit reads. American museums, universities and government agencies have often delayed the return process mandated by NAGPRA and still hold the remains of more than 110,000 Native Americans, according to a series published by ProPublica and NBC News . After reviewing their collections in search of Native American remains and sacred objects in the 1990s, as the NAGPRA demanded, some institutions described large chunks of their holdings as “culturally unidentifiable,” which critics viewed as a way to skirt the law by asserting no tribe could claim them. Others disputed modern-day tribes’ connections to centuries-old remains. Congress has also historically declined to fully fund the law’s return process, which can slow things down. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo and the first Indigenous person to head the department, issued new departmental rules to clarify and streamline NAGPRA last month . These rules eliminate the “culturally unidentifiable” category for classifying remains. And they require institutions to defer to tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations when assessing cultural connections and to obtain their informed consent before exhibiting, displaying or researching tribal remains. Though some institutions have muddied the waters with NAGPRA compliance, the Army appears to have given clear guidance: “NAGPRA applies to all Army Commands, installations, and activities and places affirmative duties on the Army for the protection, inventory, and disposition of Native American cultural items,” reads a policy guidance memo dated July 10, 2014. But the Office of Army Cemeteries has long insisted on following its own process, a modified version of the one it uses to disinter and send home the remains of service members at the request of their families, the lawsuit says. The Northern Arapaho Tribal Historic Preservation Office pressed repeatedly, starting in 2007, for the remains of a child buried at Carlisle, objecting to the Army’s use of the gravesite as a tourist attraction for visitors to the Carlisle Barracks. The Army initially refused, only developing a process to return the remains 10 years later, after the Northern Arapaho demanded them under NAGPRA. Some tribes have retrieved remains through the Army’s existing process, but it can sometimes drag on for years. Some are shocked to find that the remains may not be the child they thought it would be or that individual graves contained the remains of more than one body. “The remains they’re turning up do not match the sex and age of the person marked on the headstones,” said Jason Searle, an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund, which is also representing Winnebago. “All this confusion and mismanagement really calls for a more transparent process where tribes can be more actively involved, where they have affirmative rights that the Army can honor.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost The Biden administration on Thursday awarded more than $120 million to dozens of Native American and Alaska Native tribes to prepare for and adapt to the mounting effects of climate change, including sea level rise, worsening droughts and wildfires and food security. The investments are part of a broader administrative effort to rectify decades of “significant and systematic underfunding for tribal communities,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland told reporters on a press call. This disinvestment in Indigenous communities, along with Native Americans’ forced displacement from their historic lands, has left these groups particularly vulnerable to the dangers of a warming climate. “As I’ve visited communities all across the country — from the Alaska village of Utqiagvik, to the Quinault Indian Nation in Washington, to the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana — I’ve seen firsthand how pressing the climate crisis is for Indigenous peoples and the urgency with which we must move to honor our obligations to tribal nations,” Haaland said. “As these communities face the increasing threat of rising seas, coastal erosion, storm surges, raging wildfires and devastation from other extreme weather events, our focus must be on bolstering climate resilience.” The money will be distributed to 102 tribes and eight tribal organizations, funding a total of 146 individual projects. It is the largest amount of annual funding ever awarded through the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ Tribal Climate Resilience Annual Awards Program, which first launched in 2011. Individual awards range from more than $4 million down to $89,000 and fund everything from relocation efforts and erosion prevention to water infrastructure and habitat restoration projects. Haaland, the first Native American person to serve as a Cabinet secretary, said the funding will “help build lasting and generational change that tribal communities need to stay resilient.” A total of 166 tribes and tribal organizations applied for funding through the program, according to a senior Biden administration official. The cash comes from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and other annual funding in the 2023 fiscal year budget. Tom Perez, the White House director of intergovernmental affairs, told reporters that President Joe Biden ’s policies have “delivered the most investment Indian Country has seen from the federal government — ever.” “As we all know, the most severe consequences of climate change fall disproportionately on communities that are least able to prepare for and recover from them, including tribal nations,” Perez said. “Our administration is making unprecedented investments to ensure tribal communities have the resources to develop effective, community driven climate resilient strategies.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "There’s a greeting ritual where Native people introduce themselves. We say who we are, the land we come from, and who our people (both our tribes and our relatives) are. These identifications are our way of showing our spiritual connections to our land and our heritage. Community is at the core of our values, as well as the way we share knowledge and pass down histories, stories and legacies. This trading of information is intrinsic to the journey that New York Times bestselling author Tommy Orange, a citizen of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes from Oklahoma, takes us on in his new book, “ Wandering Stars .” While Orange’s debut novel, “ There There ,” was a contemporary story of urban Natives filled with multiple perspectives culminating in the dramatic events at a powwow, “ Wandering Stars” dives into the history of the Bear Shield family line, serving as both a prequel and a sequel. By beginning his new novel amid 1864’s Sand Creek Massacre and then exploring the pain and displacement that haunted the Bear Shield and Red Feather families for decades afterward, Orange sheds light on how intergenerational trauma can manifest. His storytelling informs and enlightens anyone unfamiliar with the specifics of how Native families were deliberately broken down over the years. For young Natives like myself, though, it does something even more crucial: It provides context to why we introduce ourselves in the way we do, and explores the more shrouded parts of our identities that lie deeper. “Wandering Stars” shows us, through its complex characters, the different ways in which our trauma as Native people shows up. Why did you feel like it was important to give the historical prequel as part of “ Wandering Stars” ? It all started with finding out about the prison castle at Fort Marion , which I had never heard about. Southern Cheyennes made up half of the prisoners of war there, and I didn’t know that we were at the seed for this awful thing that devastated generations of people. I was doing research and was already calling the book ” Wandering Stars .” I found out that the prison castle was shaped like a star and that there was an actual prisoner, a Southern Cheyenne, named Star, and then another prisoner named Bear Shield, which is a family from ” There There .” I knew I was going to write this generational thing that reached all the way back to the Sand Creek Massacre, because it was a family story that I grew up hearing — that was the devastating part of Cheyenne history. Really going through the rest of the history had to do with reaching the present — the family line. It had more to do with creating this family line that would end up landing you in the present with all of the context and backstory. When you wrote ” There There,” you mentioned that you were driven by a sort of loneliness, since we’ve always been represented in such monolithic ways. What was the initial drive when you wrote ” Wandering Stars” ? This time, that loneliness — it wasn’t there. A lot of cool Native representations are happening right now. Also, knowing that I have an audience whether I succeeded or failed at the sophomore effort, there’s sort of a spectacle. I’ve met a lot of Native people and experienced their reactions too, so there’s a lot of different factors. I write from the inside out. I really need to know my characters, what they think about, what they’re like in the interior, before I have them doing things in the world. To make them feel real to me, I have to make the inside part real first. So that’s usually how I start. How do you tap into that internal world of each character and use it to explain history and culture in this story? I’ll use certain things that I might know or that I thought of for the character. Sometimes it’s driven by a name. For example, Star at the prison castle was a bread-maker and went on to become the chief of police. In reality, the actual person Star had that going on. So, sometimes I have real details, especially with the historical piece I write from Richard Henry Pratt’s perspective. I read up a lot about him. There was a lot of research for this [novel] that informed my character development differently than with ” There There,” and even the contemporary parts of ” Wandering Stars .” It’s a lot more that comes from knowing the community. The addiction stuff comes from personal experience and family experience. What was it like approaching this novel, given how successful ” There There” was? Did you feel a lot of pressure, from yourself or elsewhere? My agent and editor are very hands-off. I almost wish they pressured me more, sometimes. But I definitely felt the sophomore effort and wanted to write something that felt like it’ll do as good or better. Writing an actual book was the goal. It was different every day, but the same doubts were there. When I quiet everything down, I just have to face the writing room. And I haven’t gotten any better at believing — I just have to keep working until I feel it’s good enough. You just sold your third book. Is there anything you can tell us about what that will look like? So, it’s contemporary Oakland stories. There are multiple perspectives — again, surprise, surprise! One of the major themes is pretendians . A character in the book writes a parody of a book called ” The Education of Little Tree .” It was, like, the only Native book I knew about growing up. I only found out somewhat recently that it was not written by a Native person . It was written by a former KKK member named Asa Earl Carter under the pseudonym Forrest Carter, who wrote the famous line “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.” He wrote “The Education of Little Tree” and passed himself off as a Cherokee man. A lot of people argue that it’s actually white supremacist propaganda, sort of hidden in Native American coming-of-age stories — kind of crazy. So, this character, he writes this book and he becomes a Native author with success. He starts a podcast about ethnic fraud and pretendians , and how rampant it is. So there’s a lot to explore in that world, but that’s one of the areas. Wow, I can’t wait to read that. Yeah, the tone is more dark comedy. You know, ” There There” and ” Wandering Stars” are pretty heavy subject matter, and the tones are pretty dark. So it’s nice to pivot to a different tonal style.

    "article_content": "National Reporter, HuffPost WIND RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION — On a sunny August day, Jason Baldes drove a mud-caked quad with a drink holder overflowing with matted buffalo fur toward the wild herd he has overseen since 2016. The day before, the Eastern Shoshone had killed one of the bulls, and the smell of warm blood and fresh meat still hung in the air. As we bounced over dirt clods, we passed the esophagus and pair of lungs that Baldes had left as a gift to the coyotes. Every harvest from the growing herd marks a major victory for the Eastern Shoshone, whose untranslated name, Gweechoondeka, literally means “buffalo eaters.” But this one was special. For the first time in 139 years, the annual sun dance ceremony, a multiday ritual, would include buffalo meat — a key ingredient that had gone missing since European settlers all but wiped the animals off the map in the late 19th century. “You can’t have a sun dance without buffalo,” Baldes said. “You can’t use a cow.” The buffalo appeared as we approached an interior fence nearing the western end of the property. Their patchy summer coats, shed almost to the skin to keep them from baking under the summer sun, gave them a half-naked look. A few bulls grunted, gurgled and chased one another in light sprints — signs that breeding season had arrived. Most either lay bedded in the pasture or ambled along feeding. The field, speckled with yellow-flowering pineapple weed, wasn’t an ideal feeding spot for bison, who prefer grass. But for millennia the spaded hooves, concentrated grazing and wallowing of wild buffalo had shaped the ecosystem of the high plains. Baldes wanted to see whether simply setting the animals loose on the field would limit the invasives that had flourished over years of fallowing before seeding it with something else. “Buffalo are ecologically extinct,” Baldes said. “But they’re a keystone species — ecosystem engineers. They’re the best land managers if you allow them to do it.” The land that interested Baldes most, however, stretched beyond the fence. A few hundred yards away stood a white house behind a pasture and a towering irrigation system. Further out, a stand of trees marked the boundary for another neighboring piece of private land. Baldes plans to snatch up as many tracts like those as he can. “If I had $20 million right now, we could lock up 10,000 acres of fee land on the river — if not more,” Baldes said. “There’s a lot of implications to getting these lands back.” Wild buffalo once infused virtually every aspect of life for plains tribes like the Eastern Shoshone. The meat provided their most plentiful food and most reliable source of fat. They built their lodges from buffalo hides, used the bones for their utensils and dried the bladders for water vessels. Many buffalo-hunting tribes lived nomadic lives dictated by the animals’ seasonal migrations; buffalo defined what it meant to be “home.” For the last three decades, a coalition of dozens of tribes whose lives once revolved around wild bison have spearheaded a unique movement to restore the all-but-extinct animals. (The words “buffalo” and “bison” refer to the same animal, known by the scientific name Bison bison. ) Led by the InterTribal Buffalo Council (ITBC), where Baldes serves as vice president, the effort has so far shepherded about 25,000 wild bison to more than 65 herds on tribal land. That figure likely accounts for well over half of conservation bison left in North America, making Native people the most important guardians of wild buffalo genetics. But getting the animals is only half the battle. Virtually all reservations lack the land base that wild bison demand — a legacy of federal policies that have pilfered tribal holdings for a century and a half. Much of the land that tribes retained is managed to raise beef cattle rather than protect wildlife. Baldes has crafted a unique solution. With money raised from the Wind River Tribal Buffalo Initiative , a nonprofit he founded at the beginning of the year, Baldes is systematically buying up privatized land that the Wind River Indian Reservation lost more than a century ago, with the goal of reenrolling it as tribal land. The sole condition is that the parcels remain designated as wildlife habitat for buffalo. The nonprofit emerged out of a strategy that Baldes has used for years, allowing Eastern Shoshone buffalo pastures to mushroom from a 300-acre pen seven years ago to more than 2,000 acres today. This summer, Baldes scored his biggest win yet, when the reservation’s two business councils jointly voted to retire a 17,000-acre tract of tribal land from cattle grazing and turn it into wildlife habitat for bison. Once fenced, a project that the nonprofit will have to raise $2 million to accomplish, the new land will join the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho’s wild buffalo herds for the first time, placing the Wind River Indian Reservation’s buffalo enclosure among the largest found on tribal land nationwide. “Our goal is the same as Jason’s: Get as much land as possible for our buffalo,” said Dennis O’Neill, who manages the Northern Arapaho tribe’s buffalo enclosure. For the plains tribes that lived alongside wild bison for millennia, the animals’ return marks a multidimensional triumph. The meat, leaner than beef with a healthier balance of omega-3 fatty acids, promises to help assuage the high rates of diabetes that have plagued Wind River since the introduction of processed foods. The herd offers a unique opportunity to study the impacts of returning bison to their historic landscape. Ceremonies and rites of passage preserved using deer or elk as substitutes can resume in their true form. Reacquiring the land makes it all possible. Doing so at zero cost to cash-strapped tribal governments with a minimum of political conflict in a region dominated by cattle ranching is pretty much unheard of, but Baldes has managed to do just that. Some neighbors, eager to help, are waiting to sell their properties until the nonprofit can come up with the money. “We’re not in a giant rush,” said neighbor George Hellyer. “We really don’t have any desire to be in the middle of something that’s actually working.” Baldes is only getting started. Rearranging the tangle of private and tribal land has become a high-stakes puzzle that promises to create one of the most expansive migration corridors for wild bison, while striking directly at the colonial legacy that wiped them off the landscape in the first place. “I want to see thousands of buffalo and tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of acres protected for wildlife,” Baldes said. “What we do here on the reservation could set precedent for what buffalo restoration can look like.” Wind River Indian Reservation boasts abundant natural beauty and a strong conservation history. Flanked on two sides by mountain ranges, the heart of the reservation runs along a vast stretch of high desert sagebrush steppe, dotted with herds of pronghorn antelope. Nearly three decades before Congress passed the Wilderness Act of 1964, the reservation elected to shield a 187,000-acre chunk of the Wind River Mountains from development in perpetuity. Its trout fisheries and mountain vistas attract adventurers from across the country. But the reservation is a tiny fraction of its former self, carved up by the same processes that left the overwhelming majority of tribal holdings checkerboarded with private lands held by outsiders. The Eastern Shoshone’s original reservation, envisioned in the Fort Bridger Treaty of 1863, spanned nearly 45 million acres across an expanse that included parts of today’s Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah and Colorado. The second Fort Bridger treaty, signed five years later, shrank the reservation to just 2.75 million acres and moved it to its current location along the Wind River valley in Wyoming. The tribe lost another third of that land with the Brunot Cession of 1874, which handed the southern chunk of the reservation to white settlers who discovered gold there. Four years later, the U.S. Army ushered the Northern Arapaho — historic enemies of the Eastern Shoshone — onto Wind River Indian Reservation in what they described at the time as a temporary arrangement. The two tribes still share the reservation today. A few years later, they began to lose control of the land that remained within the reservation itself. Eager to transform tribes of semi-nomadic hunters into farmers and ranchers, Congress passed the Dawes Act in 1887, imposing a land-tenure system called “allotment.” Modeled on the Homestead Act, the law doled out blocks of roughly 160 acres for farmers and double that for ranchers from tribes’ communal holdings. After exhausting the supply of tribal allottees, the law opened up tribal lands to white homesteaders. Many allottees would go on to sell their holdings under duress, turning them into privatized “fee lands.” The nationwide tribal land base dwindled by about two-thirds due to allotment . “We became trespassers on our own land,” Baldes said. Wind River fared better than many, but lost massive chunks of the river valley, which became cattle ranches. The communal lands the tribes managed to retain mostly converted to cattle pastures too, at the direction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs — the same agency that spent much of its history imposing “assimilation” policies that included drafting children into boarding schools, forbidding the use of tribal languages, and criminalizing Indigenous religion . Baldes grew up with deep insight into both the reservation’s unique conservation heritage and its political battles . As a biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Baldes’ father, Dick, was among the few people employed to steward wild lands on behalf of the federal government on the reservation where he was enrolled as a tribal member. Most of the tribal wilderness area remained unsurveyed and poorly managed by the time Dick Baldes took his position; his predecessor’s main contribution was dumping rainbow and cutthroat trout into several backcountry glacial lakes, destroying a golden trout fishery in the process. Baldes’ father started bringing him along on backcountry work trips when he was a young child. Living out of horse camps for up to a month at a time, Jason Baldes learned to hunt, fish and identify wild plants around the same time he learned how to read. “That’s how Native people always were,” Baldes said. “Our health and wealth was in the biodiversity of plants and animals.” He felt the absence of buffalo from an early age. On hunting and fishing trips into the Owl Creek mountains on the reservation’s northern border, Dick Baldes pointed out the depressions left by wallowing bison before their extirpation in the 1880s. Occasionally they found buffalo skulls or bones in the washouts. Baldes’ father’s work exposed him to what successful conservation can look like. The era of unregulated hunting had left the reservation bereft of pronghorn, despite boasting perfect habitat for them. Bighorn sheep, a species that once numbered around 2 million but now struggles across its range with diseases brought by European livestock, had also been wiped out. Dick Baldes enlisted schoolchildren, including his son, to help trap pronghorn for relocation with drop nets after baiting them with hay and apples. Jason Baldes was there when his father’s team released the first bighorn sheep off a trailer into Wind River Canyon. Today, herds of pronghorn are a common sight across the plains running through the middle of the reservation. Three bighorn mounts adorn the living room wall of Dick Baldes’ home on the foothills of the Wind River mountains. Dick shot two of them, and Jason shot the third. In the Lower 48, hunters can consider themselves lucky if they get the opportunity to hunt a wild sheep, successfully or not, once in a lifetime. Dick Baldes’ job also gave his son a front-row seat to the reservation’s bitter conflict with the state of Wyoming over water. The land that outsiders took from the reservation through cession, sale or allotment wasn’t worth much without water. Legally murky water claims piled up over the years, at times spurring still more land loss. One of the most obvious reminders of that legacy lies a few miles up the road from the Eastern Shoshone buffalo enclosure, where a rusted metal bridge passes over the top of Wind River. Below it, the century-old Diversion Dam redirects part of the Wind’s flow into a concrete canal that streams off toward the north. It’s easy to distinguish the fee lands irrigated by the canal from satellite imagery — in an otherwise arid region, they appear bright green. What’s left of the stretch of the Wind River flowing east from Diversion Dam to the town of Riverton stagnates in the summer months. The drawdowns for irrigation combine with evaporation to lower the water level and heat up what remains, making it impossible for cold-water fish like trout and ling to survive. Combatting the Wind’s depletion became one of the great passions of Dick Baldes’ career. His tenure at the Fish and Wildlife Service overlapped with a decadeslong legal reckoning between the tribes and the state of Wyoming over control of the region’s water. The state courts upheld the tribes’ water rights in 1989, awarding them 500,000 acre-feet based on their treaty with the federal government, according to “Public Waters: Lessons from Wyoming for the American West,” by journalist Anne MacKinnon. Wind River’s Tribal Water Office decided to apply nearly half of its water rights to recharge groundwater and keep the Wind flowing full enough to keep its cold-water fish alive through the summer. After the state refused to enforce the tribes’ decision, a district court took the unprecedented step of handing administration of the stretch of the Wind River flowing through the reservation’s historic boundaries to the tribes. “The non-Indian were going bonkers — ‘Ah, the Indians are acting up, the Indians are going to destroy us, the Indians are going to burn us out,’” said Wes Martel, a former member of the Eastern Shoshone business council. “But at the end of that year, we had our in-stream flow and they had banner crops on the reclamation project. That showed us that in-stream flow and agriculture and the reclamation project can survive together. ’” But in 1992, when Jason Baldes was in middle school, the Wyoming Supreme Court overturned the decision, handing victory back to the state. The ruling required the tribes to follow state law if they wanted to use their water rights for anything other than agriculture and gave the job of regulating the Wind River back to the Wyoming State Engineer. The court declined to protect the tribes’ groundwater rights at all. “The water rights case always stuck with me,” Baldes said. “Like, man — how can they screw us over that bad?” The ruling dealt a heavy blow to Dick Baldes, who developed ulcers and increasingly butted heads with higher-ups at work whom he viewed as unsupportive of the tribes’ water claims. He was suspended without pay four times — three of them over fights about water, and the fourth after tangling with a regional director over the agency’s decision to shut down field offices on nearby reservations. “It’s still upsetting to me,” he said. “That battle is going to continue until we get groundwater back and we get in-stream flows whenever we want them.” The case also catalyzed Jason Baldes’ desire to find a calling, though he wasn’t sure what. “I just kind of wanted to battle against colonization,” he said. “There’s been too many atrocities for that to just happen and have no repercussions.” He played outside linebacker through high school, enjoying a light load of classes with afternoons off, but struggled to find an interest that matched his budding ambition. Noting his restlessness, his father suggested traveling to East Africa for a few months, where a friend of the family had relocated. The trip became a pivotal moment. Dick traveled with his son for the first couple of weeks, where the two visited the Serengeti to watch the start of the wildebeest migration. The sight left a major impression on the 18-year-old Jason Baldes, who panned around in circles filming the tens of thousands of animals with a monopod-mounted video camera. “That was pretty incredible,” Baldes said. “But more unfathomable to me was that it was less than 5% of the buffalo that were here less than 200 years ago. When I returned home, I had a newfound appreciation for buffalo, for my home, for my community, where I’m from. And I thought, if I were to focus my education on this, it might open some doors for buffalo restoration.” It was a fortunate time to make that decision. The organization that would become the InterTribal Buffalo Council had been founded a few years earlier, in 1992, sparking the modern tribal restoration movement. But it gained real steam in 1997, when Montana officials slaughtered hundreds of buffalo outside Yellowstone National Park — the budding restoration movement’s most important source population. Yellowstone’s wild buffalo descend from a group of two dozen stragglers that escaped the market hunting era. Congress initially created the park in part to protect the animals from poachers, revoking tribes’ historical right to hunt, fish, forage and camp there in the process. Over time, the park’s buffalo population rebounded, topping 3,000 by the late 1990s. But even Yellowstone, at 2.2 million acres, isn’t big enough to hold the bison. When snow piles up during harsh winters, bison descend into the valleys looking for feed. Because they are widely infected with brucellosis, a contagious disease that causes abortion and low birth weight, the state of Montana has taken a strict stand against allowing them to freely wander into the state’s ranch lands, where they threaten to spread the disease to cattle. Culling migrating bison was common for decades before the winter of 1997. But two years before, the state of Montana put bison management into the hands of the Department of Livestock, rather than wildlife officials. The unprecedented scale and waste of the killing that resulted brought national media scrutiny, public protests and a major lawsuit that changed buffalo management. The plan adopted in 2000, which is still in effect today , gave the ITBC a role in managing Yellowstone buffalo, and laid the basis for a new system to transfer the park’s bison to reservations after a quarantine period. Contention over the future of Yellowstone bison drove widespread interest in restoration. The nonprofit American Prairie Foundation started buying up private land for wild bison in 2001, and today owns 126,101 acres, and leases another 336,702 acres of federal and state public land. And around that time, the Wildlife Conservation Society had begun mapping out areas across the country with ideal bison habitat. One of the best they found was Wind River. Despite allotment, the reservation retained an unusually high percentage of its land, especially at higher elevations. WCS had its eye on a swath of nearly 1 million acres of tribal land up in the Owl Creek mountains. Part of the proposed restoration site encompassed the Arapaho Ranch , a chunk of several hundred thousand acres of tribal land used as a grazing site, making it one of the country’s top beef producers. “They’ve got wolves, antelope, grizzly bears, elk ― everything but the bison,” said Keith Aune, the former head of the WCS bison program. “In North America, it was clearly one of the best prospects of bison at scale I had ever seen.” WCS lined up support at Wind River to transfer about 100 of the first buffalo out of Yellowstone’s new quarantine program in the early 2000s. The Hot Springs County Commissioners, the Wyoming state vet, and leadership from both the Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone tribes seemed to support the idea. Still, some Northern Arapaho leaders worried about the possibility of introducing brucellosis to the ranch, despite the quarantine period. Others wanted to raise the buffalo like cattle and market the meat, putting them at odds with the proposal to keep them wild. When the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho held a joint public meeting to consider the proposal, it failed. The buffalo, left in the lurch, went first to a Montana ranch owned by media mogul Ted Turner, then Fort Peck Indian Reservation. “It was just kind of baffling,” Aune said. “This was a slam dunk. We thought it was already over.” Baldes watched the events unfold from Montana State University, where he had enrolled in land resources and environment science. The future of buffalo restoration at Wind River seemed to hang in the balance of that failed vote, but Baldes worked steadily toward a master’s thesis measuring how the old Owl Creek buffalo wallows he knew from his youth impacted plant biodiversity. The results were largely inconclusive, though three plants of cultural significance to the Eastern Shoshone — yarrow, arnica, and bluebells — were more likely to grow in depressions left more than a century ago by wallowing buffalo. Ahead of his graduation, Baldes approached the Eastern Shoshone business council with a more modest proposal to launch a wild buffalo program on a 300-acre parcel of tribal land. The same year he defended his thesis, he moved back home to start his career as the tribe’s buffalo representative. The Owl Creeks still offer one of the best sites for buffalo restoration in the country, as Baldes noted in his thesis. But he has little interest in resurrecting the conflict over the future of ranching there. “Both tribes come from buffalo people,” Baldes said. “I’m not a member of the Arapaho tribe. I’m a member of the Shoshone tribe. And so I work on behalf of the Shoshone tribe to expand habitat, expand our buffalo and create more opportunities. I’m focused on what’s contiguous.” Little formal opposition to buffalo restoration exists at Wind River today. The reservation’s ranchers no longer dominate the business councils, nor do they campaign against bison. Instead, the biggest problem buffalo face is inertia. The Bureau of Indian Affairs divided most of Wind River’s tribal lands into a series of 92 range units, leased out to individuals who use them to raise cattle, like the grazing allotments found on federal public land. Baldes could apply to the BIA to run buffalo on some of those units, expanding the enclosure, but the agency would classify them as livestock, which he refuses to do. “Cows are stupid as hell,” Baldes said. “They’ve been bred to be so dumb that they rely on man. We don’t need to do that to buffalo.” Somewhere between 30 million and 60 million buffalo roamed North America at the dawn of the colonial period. Only 400,000 remain, with livestock accounting for well over nine in 10 of them. Early attempts at cross-breeding buffalo with cattle, which are closely related, created viable hybrids that have made genetically pure bison rare even in the handful of wild populations that survived the 19th-century killing spree. “Buffalo belong as wildlife,” Baldes added. “If we’re talking about carbon sequestration, climate change, ecosystem integrity, biodiversity — all of those are reasons enough to restore buffalo and protect them on the landscape.” At the national level, things appear to be changing. Deb Haaland, the first Native American to head the Department of the Interior, signed two key orders to bolster the tribal buffalo restoration movement — order 3403 pledging support to tribal efforts to consolidate their land base for conservation purposes and order 3410 , which pumped $25 million of federal money into buffalo restoration. In September, Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) reintroduced the Indian Buffalo Management Act , which would set aside $14 million in annual funding for tribal buffalo restoration efforts, along with grants and technical support, if Congress were to pass it into law. The swell of activity encourages Baldes, but he’d like to see more support for the work tribes are leading. Interior order 3410, he noted, heaps the lion’s share of the $25 million on parks and refuges, while setting aside only $3.5 million for the InterTribal Buffalo Council — despite the fact that tribes now hold more wild bison than all federal public lands combined. Whether or not the federal agencies ultimately support his work, Baldes continues to sew long-severed stretches of land back together. The project currently has access to some 50,000 acres. The problem is that they don’t all share borders. While he raises the funds to buy the fee lands blocking the way, he’s also building support to convert more rangeland from cattle grazing to buffalo habitat. As he cobbles more land together, Wind River stands a chance of building a corridor connecting winter range in the valley with spring and summer green up in the high country that buffalo historically migrated across annually — perhaps the first viable migratory route reestablished for bison since European settlement carved up the landscape with roads and fences a century and a half ago. If the buffalo corridor were to stretch far enough to the northwest or the south, it would eventually touch borders with large swaths of federal public land that would make excellent buffalo habitat, but are currently used to graze cattle. Baldes dismisses any such speculation, which extends far beyond his self-imposed mandate to focus narrowly on acquiring the next chunk of contiguous land for the Eastern Shoshone buffalo herd. But he does see building Wind River’s land base as a possible avenue to win back the reservation’s water rights one day. “We can essentially challenge the state’s management of water,” Baldes said. “Prioritizing ecological integrity, keystone species restoration — it all falls in line with our history of conservation successes.” On the last day of my visit, I hopped back in Baldes’ quad with his yellow dog Willi and Mike Vanata , a filmmaker with a YouTube channel called Western AF who had spent the last three years documenting the Eastern Shoshone’s buffalo project. After gathering some footage of the buffalo, Baldes drove us along a fenceline, past his house and horse pasture, then toward the southern end of the enclosure, where the Little Wind River winds its way below a towering mesa. “We’re in wallow country now,” Baldes said as we crossed the gate. The buffalo had spent far more time there than in the pineapple-weed-laden pasture. After just a few years, they had already carved out a network of trails and wallows, some deeply dished into the dirt from repeated use. The ground had desiccated below one of the larger ones, and the pounding sun had baked the bare mud into fissured plates, like the pattern on a turtle shell. Some still held water despite the dry August heat. Baldes leaned over and picked up a tuft of buffalo fur from one of the wallows and began to shear it apart. Tribes like the Eastern Shoshone used it for all kinds of things — shoe insulation, pillow stuffing, textiles. The herd has seen 1,500 student visitors over the last two years. Baldes will often give young visitors a handful of fur to remember the place. Each gift is like a seed that he hopes may germinate over time. Though he now has his own personal laboratory to study how the wallows affect biodiversity, Baldes no longer cares to carry out experiments on them himself. Instead, he hopes to use the site as a place where young folks can pursue scientific research without having to leave the community of their birth. Besides, Baldes said — he’s always known what the wallows will do. “We know that bringing buffalo back heals the land,” Baldes said. “And as they restore that connection, they’re going to heal us.” Reporting for this story was made possible by an Indigenous Reporting Grant from the Institute for Journalism and Natural Resources."

    "article_content": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON — A couple of months ago, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) walked onto the Senate floor with an unusual plan: public shaming. Speaking to the C-SPAN cameras, Schatz began listing off the names of universities and museums with large collections of human remains and sacred funerary objects that belong to Native Americans. They were supposed to have been returned decades ago, but weren’t. “These museums and universities are everywhere,” Schatz fumed in his floor remarks . “The University of Tennessee. The University of Kentucky. The University of Alabama. The University of Arizona. The University of Florida. The University of Missouri-Columbia. The University of Oklahoma. The Center for American Archaeology in Illinois. The University of Texas at Austin. The Milwaukee Public Museum.” More than 70 institutions around the country are holding on to tens of thousands of human remains — not to mention hundreds of thousands of cultural items — that were largely taken from Native American burial sites in the late 1800s and are now parts of academic collections. The National Park Service has a public database of which colleges, museums, universities and historical groups have such items in their collections, and how many of each. As of last month, these institutions collectively held the remains of nearly 58,000 Indigenous people. They appear to be violating the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, or NAGPRA, a federal law demanding the “expeditious” return of these items. And some of the institutions with the largest collections are universities that proudly espouse progressive values, like Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley. The questions are obvious: Have all of these museums and universities really been breaking the law for more than 30 years? And why haven’t they returned human remains and other sacred items to the people and tribes they belong to? ProPublica, an investigative journalism outfit, last year did a sweeping probe into which institutions have the biggest collections of these items. Some have since returned ancestral remains and sacred objects to Indigenous groups. Many have not. Schatz, who chairs the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, has been using his position to go after these universities. He’s held hearings to figure out how Congress can better enforce the 1990 law. He’s led bipartisan letters to the institutions with the biggest collections, demanding answers to why they still haven’t given back thousands of items to Native tribes and groups. He’s also been trying to humiliate them into action. In his recent floor speech, the Hawaii senator ripped the excuses that some have given for not complying with the law, including a claim by some that Indigenous groups can’t adequately take care of the items that currently sit in institutions’ collections. “This smells of the worst kind of colonialism with a thin veneer of progressive ideology and verbiage,” Schatz charged. “University provosts and presidents can do all of the land acknowledgements that they want. They can post lengthy statements about equity on their websites and champion any number of progressive causes. “But that rings hollow when they are, at the same time, clinging onto vast collections of stolen items because of a perverse, patronizing sense of ownership,” he said. Simply put, all of these institutions could have ― should have ― returned these items decades ago. By and large, they’ve chosen not to. In a recent interview with HuffPost, Schatz emphasized the context in which this has been happening. Native people have historically had almost everything stolen from them — their land, their water, their language, their children — because of the U.S. government’s policies of termination and then assimilation . The fact that so many universities and museums are holding onto stolen human remains is yet another piece of this broader injustice. “I think what’s gotten me so irritated is that [these institutions] have acted as if this was some impossible task,” said the Hawaii senator, “either administratively or in terms of determining the lineage or providence of an item.” But the situation is more complicated. For one thing, NAGPRA didn’t even require all of these institutions to return these items until Jan. 12, 2024, when the Interior Department put new, game-changing regulations in place. For the last 30-plus years, under NAGPRA, universities and museums have been creating inventories of their human remains and funerary objects, separating out items that could be culturally affiliated with certain tribes or groups from the items that could not. The government spent decades creating regulations about what to do with items that were culturally unidentifiable. But for items that could be tied to a particular group, the onus has been on Native tribes and groups to file claims. It’s then fallen to universities and museums to work through these claims with these Indigenous groups. Some institutions have found ways to delay or avoid returning ancestral remains to Native groups, whether it’s been through insufficient consultation with tribes, disrespect for Indigenous peoples’ traditional knowledge, misidentification of items or even allegations of malfeasance. But the rules just changed. As of January, these schools and museums are required to revise their inventories again ― and to complete the process of returning these items. They have until January 2029 to report on and return everything they have. Bureaucracy isn’t the only thing that’s gummed this up, said Valerie Grussing, executive director of the National Association of Tribal Historic Preservation Officers. Sometimes tribes don’t have museums or cultural centers suited for housing these items. Sometimes tribes disagree with each other over which items are affiliated with which tribe. Sometimes one tribe may want to bring an item home and bury it, while another tribe with an overlapping claim to that item doesn’t want to do that. Sometimes a tribe may work out an agreement with a museum, where items may stay at the museum but tribal members may periodically remove them for a ceremony. “I don’t mean to downplay cases where there have been bad actors and institutional resistance,” said Grussing, “but that’s not the whole picture.” There’s also the predictable problem of money, or lack thereof. Some tribal historic preservation officers are tasked with carrying out NAGPRA, and they don’t have any dedicated federal funds for doing this. Beyond that, the new NAGPRA regulations in January require Native tribes, for the first time, to respond to excavations and discoveries on tribal lands. But tribes aren’t getting any federal funding to do that, either. Grussing’s organization estimates that the cost for tribes to comply with NAGPRA’s new requirements on excavations and discoveries is $40 million a year for the next five years. That’s in stark contrast to the Interior Department’s estimate of $12.4 million a year to cover all costs for everyone to comply, including universities and museums, along with tribes. Of that $12.4 million, the Interior Department also asked in its latest budget request that $3.7 million be set aside for its own NAGPRA compliance efforts, meaning the department would take more than one-third of that pot of money set up for all tribes and institutions. Still another problem is that there don’t appear to be any real consequences for violating NAGPRA. In its annual report to Congress last year, the National Park Service said it received 74 allegations of violations that it either hadn’t investigated or finished investigating. The last time the Park Service determined that someone failed to comply with NAGPRA was 2016. “Basically, they’re not doing civil penalties right now,” said C. Timothy McKeown, a pro bono repatriation adviser for the National Association of Tribal Historic Preservation Officers. McKeown previously worked for the National Park Service for 18 years and also assisted the Department of Justice on tribal trust cases for 10 years. He currently serves on the Interior Department’s NAGPRA advisory committee. In 2023, this committee finalized its report to Congress, asking lawmakers to direct the Government Accountability Office to investigate the lack of NAGPRA civil penalties being issued. The Interior Department still hasn’t sent this report to Congress for some reason. An Interior Department spokesperson declined to comment. National Park Service spokesperson Jordan Fifer said the agency can’t comment on active investigations. But of the 74 allegations of NAGPRA violations that the service has received, he said, all are in various stages of open investigations. “NPS is committed to thorough investigations, and there are a number of possible resolutions cases can take,” Fifer said, noting the 2021 hire of a full-time NAGPRA investigator has helped clear a backlog of investigations. Still, the National Park Service has only issued about $60,000 in civil penalties, in total, in the 30-plus years since NAGPRA became law. The new January regulations did increase the base amount of a penalty to $7,475. For the universities and museums that haven’t been working in good faith to comply with NAGPRA, the new January regulation will force them to come out from hiding behind the bureaucracy, Grussing said. “They could have worked to do what’s right before the Interior Department had to make it required,” said the tribal historic preservation executive. “Some of them were. It’s not that those discussions weren’t happening in some places. But, they weren’t happening in all places.” There are signs of a paradigm shift. The Smithsonian Institution, which has never been subject to NAGPRA, has roughly 30,000 skeletons in its collections that belong to Indigenous people from around the world. It announced this year that it will be taking a new approach to repatriation: If the Smithsonian can’t prove that it obtained human remains with voluntary consent from the deceased or their next of kin for the purpose of science or display, by 2030, it will return or rebury all of them. “The idea they’ve come forward with has switched the game around,” McKeown said. “Instead of evaluating claims that come in, they are assuming if they can’t prove they have right of possession, all must go. That is monumental.” It doesn’t hurt that, at the same time, a U.S. senator is needling individual universities and museums about needing to do better. Last April, when Schatz led bipartisan letters to the institutions with the biggest collections of Native American remains, he made those letters public . They went to the presidents of University of California at Berkeley and Harvard, as well as Illinois State Museum, Indiana University and the Ohio History Connection. Some responded with real action. The University of California at Berkeley has since reduced the number of culturally unidentifiable remains in its collection by 45%. Harvard also began returning items, and recently pledged to cover travel expenses for Native leaders to come to the school and help navigate the process of transferring items to their rightful places. Perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, institutions like the American Museum of Natural History and the Field Museum in Chicago have since announced steps to speed up their efforts to comply with the law, too. There are, of course, others that are still holding onto everything in their collections. Two of the five institutions targeted by Schatz last year, Indiana University and Ohio History Connection, haven’t returned anything to Indigenous groups, according to the NAGPRA database. Ohio History Connection currently holds the largest number of remains in the country, with its 7,167 ancestral remains. Indiana University is ranked fifth, with its 4,838 ancestral remains. Both of these institutions responded to Schatz’s letters last year with reasons for keeping these items in their collections. HuffPost obtained copies of their letters. Megan Wood, executive director and CEO of Ohio History Connection, said this museum has been “conducting active consultations” with tribes for the last 10 to 15 years to help them make claims and bury ancestors. “From communicating with our Tribal Partners, we have learned repatriation is not simply reburying the remains of the Ancestors,” Wood said. “I agree the Ancestors have waited on shelves for far too long; but now that we are proactively doing the work, we must do it correctly.” Fred Cate, who at the time was the vice president for research at Indiana University, similarly emphasized the importance of ongoing consultations with tribes. “While Indiana University is committed to repatriating as expeditiously as possible, we are also mindful of the desires of our tribal partners,” Cate said. “As Miami Tribe of Oklahoma’s legal counsel Joseph Halloran stated in the January 13, 2023, public comment session aimed at discussing the newly proposed NAGPRA regulations, ‘We don’t want speed, we want justice.’” HuffPost reached out to both of these institutions on Friday for further comment. “We’re being patient and consistent in our commitment to repatriation,” Neil Thompson, a spokesperson for Ohio History Connection, said Monday. “These relationships that we build with our tribal partners have been invaluable to conducting this work together.” On Wednesday, Indiana University spokesperson Mark Bode pointed to efforts the university has been making to comply with NAGPRA, including an upcoming summer training to teach coordinators about the law and best practices. Schatz last month sent out more bipartisan letters to the next 11 institutions with the largest collections of Native American human remains, demanding they comply with NAGPRA. The University of Kentucky, the University of Missouri at Columbia and the University of Texas at Austin are among them. “As Senators and Members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, we write to express our grave concern over recent reports that institutions of higher learning such as yours have failed their statutory mandate to ‘expeditiously return’ cultural items and ancestral remains of Native Americans pursuant to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990,” reads the March 1 letter to Jay Hartzell, president of the University of Texas at Austin. HuffPost obtained copies of these letters, and their text is the same. There is simply “no legitimate reason” for institutions to hold onto Native American remains, Schatz told HuffPost. “We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way.” “We do have subpoena power,” he added. “I don’t think anybody wants to get mixed up in a legal process.”"

    "article_content": "As I walked through Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Canada, I wondered, “How did I get here?” I was there to serve as a panelist at the Métis Nation’s “Youth Summit on Climate Change,” which was a huge honor. I couldn’t help but reflect on the path that led me to where I am now, in a position that most would consider extremely prestigious. Growing up as a young Indigenous girl with very humble beginnings and a gang-affiliated father, I know that this path could have gone in another direction. Given the opportunity, my mother would tell you stories of a fierce little girl who climbed tall trees until the tips swayed in the wind. I was ambitious and focused, yes, but it was the women around me who fostered those ideals within me. And when I think about the matriarchs who have guided me over the years, the first one who comes to mind is my kokum (the Cree word for “grandmother”) — or G Ma, as we called her. When I walked along Ottawa’s canals and stared up at the Parliament Building, I felt her presence. How could I not? She was one of the fiercest advocates for the Métis people. Thelma Chalifoux was the first Indigenous woman appointed to the Senate in Canada. She was also a Mètis woman whose contributions to the country were so enormous that the University of Alberta named a building after her, Canada commemorated her with a stamp , and Edmonton, Alberta, named a school after her. She was also just my kokum: a woman whose voice, humor, severity, wisdom, and advice forever live inside of me. It’s been seven years since you passed on to the spirit world, G Ma. In honor of her, here are seven lessons that she handed down to me and permeate my bones to this day. I hope they reach all of the women out there looking for motivation — and a little laugh when the struggle gets too heavy. Sometimes, G Ma and I would be eating bannock and sipping tea at the dining table when she would say, “That Susan is as useless as tits on a log!” And we would erupt into laughter. The phrase implies that a person or people are doing nothing to contribute to a household or community. She taught me early on that when you are a guest in someone’s home — or a member of a family unit — you earn your keep and help with whatever they need. G Ma spent her whole life devoted to activism in Indigenous organizations around fair housing, education, suicide prevention, prisons and abused women. She also helped people battle alcoholism and addiction, which plagues our communities. For better or worse, G Ma was a woman who never rested. And she changed so many lives because of her tenacity. I was a headstrong and determined child — which makes sense, as I was raised by defiant, determined women. If I had an idea in mind, I needed to make it happen. At first, my pleas involved whining. But G Ma explained to me that a strong argument is far more powerful than an emotional appeal. “Instead of whining, come up with three logical reasons for why you should get what you want,” she told me. Ten-year-old me quickly learned how to craft arguments as if our household were a court of law and I were a seasoned litigator. As a grown woman now, having defied all odds stacked against me, I’m proud that this skill was instilled in me early on. I rarely accept a no when it comes to my career aspirations. My G Ma taught me to choose my battles and learn how to fight fairly and effectively. Most importantly, I was taught not to stoop to another person’s level when they throw a low blow. I remember once, in middle school, a boy in my class made a cruel remark about my incarcerated father. It pierced my solar plexus the way that only certain words can. My first reaction was to try to hurt him physically. But instead, I ripped his glasses off his face and stomped on them. I then promptly marched myself to the principal’s office to turn myself in, eyes stinging from tears. Sitting down with G Ma after this happened and telling her about it, she shook her head: “Never get into a piss fight with a skunk.” And as an adult, I know she was right. Some people just play dirty, and it’s not worth my energy to engage. In the 23 years of having my kokum as my role model before she passed, I don’t recall seeing her shed a single tear. After she left her abusive husband in the ’50s, she then had her children taken away from her through the Sixties Scoop . She spent seven years getting all her children back. Of course, I don’t recommend tamping down grief and keeping sadness hidden, but I know that her message to me was to not let grief paralyze you for too long. You pick yourself up, and you get on with the mission. Though I allow myself to feel and process, she truly modeled resilience for me — and taught me that our trauma does not define any of us. On my 30th birthday, a friend told me how the thing she loves the most about me is that I accept people, without judgment, for who they are in all their fullness and complexity. It was a very generous compliment, and all props go to my G Ma. She taught me that the most valuable thing we can do for another person is to process their flaws with compassion. What if the mistakes we make were not maligned, but instead seen as opportunities for growth? You were not perfect, G Ma, and there were moments when your sternness made me feel small. But still, your goodness will always be the thing that shines. G Ma created a safe haven in her basement where she kept canned goods, clothing, hygiene supplies and basic materials to help women get back on their feet after fleeing abusive marriages. My Aunty Debbie used to always tell the stories of watching her chase men away from her home with cast-iron frying pans . It was her first and only line of defense, and it worked. Whenever I think of cast-iron frying pans, I think about how my kokum provided for the women in her community in more ways than one. I hope to be as supportive to any woman who needs an advocate. After I read a eulogy at my G Ma’s funeral, one of her friends from the Senate came up to me and shared a story about her. The friend remembered a meeting where a man in the House of Commons started talking over G Ma. She stood up, pounded her fists on the table and said, “You will listen to what I have to say!” The room fell silent, all eyes on her, as the story goes. One of the men there said, “By all means, Sen. Chalifoux, the floor is yours.” You left big shoes to fill, G Ma, and sometimes I hear you when I tap on my keyboard and words emerge on the page. And I can only hope that your voice lives on through me.

    "article_content": "Politics Reporter, HuffPost It took Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) only about a minute to say all he had to say about becoming the most politically powerful Native American currently in elected office, and possibly the most powerful one since the 1920s. “I care a lot about Native American history. I’m from a state that has a huge tribal presence,” Cole told reporters Monday morning, after officially taking the reins of the powerful House appropriations committee from Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas). The committee, in conjunction with its counterpart in the Senate, divides up the annual pie of federal funding that goes to keep most federal agencies and programs outside of Social Security and Medicare running. For this year, that totaled about $1.6 trillion. Appropriators are the guardians of Congress’ purse strings, and are sometimes regarded as almost an invisible third party on Capitol Hill. Spending bills must be passed by Sept. 30 each year to keep the government open, and making sure those bills get passed makes appropriators often more moderate than their colleagues. In Cole’s case, as he worked his way up the ladder, he said he’s tried to look out for Native issues, such as housing. Cole, 74, has historically also been known as an advocate for higher Indian Health Service funding. “Clearly, that’s something I know a lot about and care a lot about. Some of my colleagues, they come from districts that don’t have much Native presence. I understand why it’s not front and center to them, but it is to me,” he said Monday. Cole, a political consultant before he was elected to Congress in 2002, is a conservative, but one of the few in his party who commands respect from more moderate members as well as hard-liners. His name was mentioned in October as a potential new House speaker, but he took himself out of consideration early and often. Cole said he’ll continue Republicans ’ focus on funding defense, homeland security and veterans programs. “We’re going to get the bills done and we’re going to move them through,” he said. “And they’re going to be conservative, Republican bills.” Cole’s brevity when asked about the significance of his taking the gavel was in character — he does not shy from saying he’s a proud member of the Ada, Oklahoma-based Chickasaw Nation, but he doesn’t bring it up spontaneously very much. At the same time, his conciseness on Monday undersold the moment. In 2020, Native voters provided some of the margins in key states for President Joe Biden, including Arizona and Wisconsin. Afterward, Indigenous activists were able to parlay the recognition of that work into a successful nomination of Deb Haaland, a former U.S. representative, to become the first Native interior secretary. The Interior Department is the part of the government that most of the nation’s 574 federally recognized tribes deal with the most. And in 2022, with the election of Rep. Mary Peltola (D-Alaska), the House for the first time had members of all three major U.S. Indigenous groups — Native Americans, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians — among its membership. Historically, Cole is in rare company. He became the longest-serving Native person in House history in 2022 , surpassing another Oklahoman, Charles David Carter. And in his new role at the appropriations committee, he may be the most influential elected Native American since fellow Republican Charles Curtis , the record holder for Indigenous tenure in Congress. Curtis was elected to the House in 1893 and became an appropriator overseeing the Interior Department. He then moved to the Senate and became majority leader. He went on to serve as President Herbert Hoover’s vice president from 1929 to 1933. Curtis was affiliated with the Kaw and Osage tribes. When Cole was ratified by House Republicans to be the new chairman, Chuck Hoskin Jr., principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, said Cole “truly understands” the needs of tribes and their populations. “I have full confidence that he will continue to be a strong advocate for funding vital programs, as well as honoring the federal government’s trust responsibilities to tribal nations,” Hoskin said in a statement . And while Cole may not play up his heritage, he is mindful of it. He disagrees with the significance of “blood quantum” — a measure that several Oklahoma tribes use to decide membership, based on being able to trace one’s ancestry back to pre-statehood tribal rolls that were often inaccurate. “It’s really funny. White people will ask you, ‘How much Indian are you?’ Indians only ask you what tribe you are,” he said. “It’d be like asking somebody, ‘How much American are you?’ Really? I either am or I’m not.” Cole said his great-grandfather intentionally understated his quantum in order to avoid having a white guardian appointed to decide if he could sell his land. In one case, he said, one of his great-aunts had a white husband who sold their land and simply disappeared. “That was pretty common,” Cole said. “What happened in ‘ Killers of the Flower Moon ’ was the worst version of it, but this disappropriation of private property by marrying and exploiting Indians was pretty common, all in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "The first time I walked through the doors of Columbia University as the first Native American student to be admitted into the creative nonfiction graduate program, I felt a wave of ambivalence wash over me. I remember glancing around at all my cohort’s mostly white, eager faces — they appeared confident that they belonged there. Many of them had been prepared for this moment through the years of Ivy League degrees and decades of expectations of legacy families. On the stage of Low Library, a faculty member began the orientation address: “Columbia University School of the Arts recognizes Manhattan as part of the ancestral and traditional homeland of the Lenni-Lenape and Wappinger people.” I was glad to hear a land acknowledgment on that stage, especially because the school is named after Christopher Columbus , who is still celebrated despite colonizing, killing and enacting cultural genocide against the Indigenous people of Turtle Island. Awareness is always the first step toward bringing necessary institutional changes to combat systemic racism and barriers that prevent BIPOC students from thriving. But what exactly does a land acknowledgment do to rectify the hundreds of years of oppression? Even in the short address, the verbiage relegated the local Indigenous people to that of the past. It was as if our land was not taken from us in blood — and as if we still don’t walk among these grounds, affected. Land acknowledgments are becoming popularized in so many different spaces now, but are they simply hollow efforts from people hopping on progressive bandwagons? On the one hand, it’s absolutely necessary to vocalize the truth about the stolen land that our society and institutions are built on. But the undeniable reality is that our history still very much affects the present. So, what actions can institutions take in order to mitigate the systemic harm against Indigenous communities? Because talk is cheap unless it’s backed up by action . Some of the biggest offenders of performative land acknowledgments have been museums that house stolen Native artifacts. Earlier this year, new revisions to a federal law were implemented to require that museums have consent from lineal descendants and Native Tribes to display certain artifacts. The Museum of Natural History in New York City was one of these institutions with a land acknowledgment on its website while housing these stolen artifacts, and it has since closed two of its halls because it did not comply with the new regulations. According to the president of the museum , these exhibitions “did not respect the values, perspectives, and indeed shared humanity of Indigenous peoples.” New regulations such as these have forced important conversations between museums and Native Tribes that have been extremely beneficial. What a radical thought: that non-Native people could actually learn more about a people from members of their community directly. Real action (that would ideally come alongside every land acknowledgment) gives rights back to the communities that were stolen from and taken advantage of. Other actionable change comes from seeking knowledge about Native American history directly from the source. Almost all Native reservations have their own cultural centers and museums that can be visited, including school tours and group rates. Supporting these centers directly supports the Indigenous people and their communities. You can learn about these histories while supporting the very real communities and people that are still here. Also, Indigenous art is often exploited and appropriated — and it’s rarely supported in a meaningful way outside of the community. Take the effort to seek out projects, books and other forms of contemporary art created by Native people versus by outsiders imagining what our lives are and were like. There are Native artists and playwrights producing insightful work every day that examines the condition, struggles and joys of our lives. Another way to back up land acknowledgments is to approach inclusion in an intentional and equitable way. Since I’m often the only Indigenous person in a room, I’ll be asked to give presentations on our histories for Indigenous Peoples Month — without any kind of honorarium offered. As racial minorities, we want representation, but we also deserve to be compensated for our labor. Though land acknowledgments are a first step toward accountability for the injustices committed against the original inhabitants of this land, the next time you hear one, ask yourself: What actions are they employing to accompany these words?

    "article_content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Australia’s richest individual has reportedly demanded that an unflattering portrait of her by an Indigenous artist be removed from the country’s national gallery. Gina Rinehart, a mining heiress and multibillionaire, personally pressed the director and chair of the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra to strip the painting from its walls after it first went on display in March, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. The gallery declined the request and has reportedly since received more than a dozen complaints from Rinehart’s business associates and financial beneficiaries following her campaign efforts, according to the Herald. Attempts to reach Rinehart’s representatives and the museum for comment were not immediately successful. The painting, which depicts Rinehart with a double chin and a droopy eye, nose and lips, is one of 21 similarly styled cartoonish portraits that make up Vincent Namatjira’s collection titled “ Australia in Colour. ” Others portrayed in the collection include England’s King Charles III, his late mother Queen Elizabeth , musician Jimi Hendrix, and AC/DC guitarist Angus Young. “I paint the world as I see it,” Namatjira responded to the criticism in a statement to CNN and various other news outlets . “People don’t have to like my paintings, but I hope they take the time to look and think, ‘why has this Aboriginal bloke painted these powerful people? What is he trying to say?’” Namatjira is from Indulkana in Southern Australia and has reflected on his heritage and the ongoing impact of Australia’s colonial history in his work, which includes prior, similarly styled paintings of Rinehart. “I like to paint with a little bit of humour, humour takes away some of their power and keeps us all equal,” he said in an artist’s statement on a past portrait that depicts him as standing with Rinehart. Rinehart, according to Forbes , has an estimated net worth of $31 billion after taking over her late father’s mining company, Hancock Prospecting. That inheritance has included a dark cloud over racist comments he made in the 1980s, including him suggesting that Indigenous Australians not contributing to society should be sterilized to solve “the problem.” He also spoke out against Aboriginal land rights. Rinehart has not condemned or otherwise commented publicly on her late father’s views, according to News.com.au, though her advocates have pointed to her philanthropy with Indigenous groups as a sign of her personal stance on the matter. Some of her financial recipients have again come to her backing, this time against Namatjira’s portrayal of her. “Two portraits of our patron, Mrs Gina Rinehart AO, are of deep concern to us because they are offensive to Mrs Rinehart,” the Swimming Queensland chief executive, Kevin Hasemann, wrote in a letter to the museum’s director in April on behalf of members of the Australian swim team, according to The Guardian. “Through her philanthropy, Mrs Rinehart has proven herself to be a great Australian, and we respectfully urge you to reconsider the inclusion of these portraits in your galleries,” the letter continued. The gallery said in a statement to CNN that it welcomes public debate on its exhibitions and hopes that its art inspires people “to explore, experience and learn about art.” Namatjira’s “Australia in Colour” exhibit is scheduled to run through July 21.

    "article_content": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― After nearly 50 years in prison, Native American rights activist Leonard Peltier is about to get what may be his last chance at freedom. Peltier, 79, is up for a parole hearing on Monday. His last parole hearing was in 2009. Given his poor health and the many years he’d likely have to wait for his next hearing, it is unlikely he would survive to make another one. The U.S. government put Peltier in prison in 1977 after he was convicted for killing two FBI agents in a 1975 shoot-out on Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. But his trial was riddled with misconduct , and his prolonged imprisonment has drawn sharp condemnation from prominent human rights leaders, including Pope Francis, Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama and Nelson Mandela. Dozens of U.S. senators and members of Congress have urged his release. So have dozens of Indigenous legislators . Amnesty International, an organization typically focused on human rights violations abroad, has an entire campaign centered on Peltier’s case. “Leonard Peltier has been imprisoned for nearly 50 years, and now suffers from severe health issues,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, told HuffPost in a statement. “It’s time for him to go home and live out his remaining days with his family and his community.” There was never evidence that Peltier committed this crime. The FBI and U.S. attorney’s office never did figure out who killed those agents. But Peltier, who was one of dozens of people present at the shoot-out, was the only person left for them to go after. He had been separated from his co-defendants, all of whom had already been acquitted on grounds of self-defense. Prosecutors in his trial hid key evidence. The FBI threatened and coerced witnesses into lying. On the second day of the trial, a juror admitted she was biased against Native Americans but was kept on. Peltier has maintained his innocence the entire time he’s been in prison. He had a chance to be released in 2009 when he was up for parole, but it would have required him to say that he murdered the two FBI agents. He wouldn’t do it. His parole was denied. On Monday, a hearing officer with the U.S. Parole Commission will conduct Peltier’s hearing in a conference room at the maximum security prison in Sumterville, Florida, where he is incarcerated. The hearing is expected to last all day and is not open to the public. Peltier is limited to two witnesses speaking on his behalf and will also speak for himself, according to his lawyer. One witness is a doctor who has examined Peltier and will testify about his serious health issues, which include diabetes and an aortic aneurysm. The other is a Native American ally to Peltier who is a prominent voice in Indian Country. Beyond Peltier’s witnesses, family members of the two FBI agents who were killed will also be there. The hearing officer has 21 days to make a decision on granting parole. If it is granted, Peltier will go through a short process before being released. If it is denied, his attorney can file an appeal with a U.S. district court. Peltier’s team will make the case that he be allowed to live out his final years in home confinement. He currently spends most days confined to a cell with inches of space to move within because the prison is regularly in a state of lockdown . He needs a walker to get around. He is blind in one eye from a stroke. “I implore the Parole Commission to show justice and mercy by granting Mr. Peltier parole on humanitarian grounds,” Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee a nd a longtime supporter of Peltier’s release, told HuffPost in a statement. Remarkably, some of the same U.S. government officials who helped put Peltier in prison in the first place have since come forward and admitted how flawed his trial was , and have urged clemency for him. They include former U.S. Attorney James Reynolds and the late U.S. appeals court judge Gerald Heaney. And in 2022, legal experts with the United Nations Human Rights Council issued an unusual and damning legal opinion that Peltier’s prolonged imprisonment is “arbitrary” and only because he is Native American. They concluded he should be released immediately. “He has now spent nearly five decades locked away from his community, family, and loved ones enduring a punishment that he and hundreds of thousands of others, including the U.S. attorney who prosecuted him, know he was never due,” Grijalva said. “An injustice of that magnitude can never fully be made whole, but it is not too late to grant him the remaining years of a life that the federal government wrongfully stole from him so many years ago.” So why is Peltier still in prison? The FBI doesn’t want him released. Ever. “The FBI remains resolute in our opposition to Leonard Peltier’s latest application for parole,” FBI director Christopher Wray told HuffPost in a statement. Wray provided a lengthy statement laying out the bureau’s reasons: Peltier was convicted of the brutal murder of FBI Special Agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams at South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in 1975. We must never forget or put aside that Peltier intentionally murdered these two young men and has never expressed remorse for his ruthless actions. Over the past 45 years, no fewer than 22 federal judges have evaluated the evidence and considered Peltier’s legal arguments, with each reaching the same conclusion: Peltier’s claims are meritless, and his convictions and sentence must stand. In addition, Peltier’s crimes include a post-conviction escape from federal custody, during which he and his crew fired shots at prison employees. Granting parole for Peltier would only serve to diminish the brutality of his crime and further the suffering of the surviving families of agents Coler and Williams, as well as the larger FBI family. But even by the U.S. government’s own admission , Peltier is not in prison for “intentionally” killing anyone ― or even for killing anyone. Government officials dropped that argument decades ago, when their case fell apart , and charged him with aiding and abetting whoever did kill those agents. The claim that Peltier has “never expressed remorse for his ruthless actions” makes sense given he’s maintained his innocence the entire time he’s been in prison, even when it’s almost certainly resulted in him being denied parole. The FBI has not acknowledged the misconduct at Peltier’s trial, or the pleas for his release by the former U.S. government officials who played a direct role in putting him in prison. The FBI has also not addressed the key context of that 1975 shoot-out: the FBI was intentionally fueling tensions on that reservation as part of a covert campaign to suppress the activities of the American Indian Movement, or AIM, a grassroots group of activists focused on drawing attention to treaty rights violations, discrimination and police brutality targeting Native Americans. Peltier was a prominent AIM member and an FBI target. In a bombshell interview last year, retired FBI special agent Coleen Rowley said the bureau’s steadfast opposition to Peltier’s release is rooted in vindictiveness and misplaced loyalties. Rowley, who worked for years with prosecutors and agents directly involved in Peltier’s case, described how new FBI agents are “indoctrinated” with the bureau’s version of events surrounding the 1975 shoot-out. She has urged Peltier’s immediate release. By all appearances, the FBI simply wants Peltier to die in prison, if not for any other reason than to avoid having to admit the U.S. government lied to put him in prison in the first place. As Peltier’s attorney Kevin Sharp previously told HuffPost , “In order to get clemency, you have to get the FBI on board. They have an inherent conflict. You have to get the U.S. attorney’s office on board. They lied to get him in prison. They have an inherent conflict. They’re not going to say, ‘Oops, sorry.’” “It’s this holdover with the FBI,” added Sharp, who is a former federal judge who was appointed by President Barack Obama. “It’s this holdover with the FBI.” If Peltier’s parole is denied again on Monday, there’s really only one other way he’s got a chance at living out his final years at home in North Dakota with his family and tribe: if President Joe Biden grants him clemency. The president could do this unilaterally at any point. So far, he has chosen not to. As a political matter, the issue of Peltier’s release isn’t going away. Democrats in Congress have publicly appealed to Biden at least four times to grant clemency to Peltier. The National Congress of American Indians, the largest and most powerful Indigenous rights group in the country, has said Peltier’s freedom is a priority for the organization and its membership heading into the November elections. In 2022, the Democratic National Committee unanimously passed a resolution calling on Biden to grant clemency to Peltier. A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. In a rare interview in 2022 , Peltier told HuffPost what he would say to Biden if he had five minutes alone with him: “I’m not guilty of this shooting. I’m not guilty. I would like to go home to spend what years I have left with my great-grandkids and my people.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "This past April, the Métis Nation held the first Youth Summit on Climate Change, highlighting and celebrating just how strong Métis activism still is. I was invited there to speak on a panel about how storytelling is, and has always been, an important tool for mitigating climate change and healing nature. At the summit, I was surrounded by brilliant Métis and First Nations youth activists from across Turtle Island, also known as North America. I felt immersed in the powerful energy of young minds gathering to collaborate, learn, and tell stories that reinforce our commitment to the environment. If you live south of the Canada-U.S. border, it’s entirely possible that you have not heard of the Métis peoples . Any time I’ve spoken this term after moving from Canada to New York City, I’ve been met with confused expressions, whether I’m talking to Natives or non-Natives. There was a time when Métis were referred to as halfbreeds . In the U.S., your right to Native identity is measured in blood quantum , a hotly debated concept that the measurement of how much “Indian blood” you have dictates the authenticity of your lineage. Traditional Native communities, however, practiced from kinship systems , which establish community through mutual obligation rather than blood relations. This means that tribes would “adopt” members, so to speak, based on community involvement. In Canada, a distinct cultural group emerged from Natives and European settlers having children together and building community. However, that doesn’t mean anyone with mixed European and Native heritage qualifies. The term “ Métis ” refers to a distinctive mixed peoples who developed their own customs, language, ways of life, cultural practices and recognizable group identity. There are no blood quantum requirements, but Métis rights holders must have ancestral connections to a historic Métis community . In 1982, Métis peoples were constitutionally recognized as a distinct Indigenous group, alongside the First Nations and Inuit. Originally, Métis were going to be left out of the new constitution because they were not federally recognized as Natives in the Indian Act, a piece of legislation created to control Indigenous peoples in Canada. But Indigenous activists from around the country gathered, demonstrated, and stormed Parliament, demanding recognition. Among those activists was my great-grandmother , waving her Métis flag across the country. Those activists fought against systems of erasure that have always tried to eradicate Indigenous peoples from our lands and extinguish our very existence. The Métis lived in the land that’s now Canada before it was named as such in 1867, and they served as liaisons at the heart of the fur trade , having a foot in both the European and Native worlds. They have always played a pivotal role in land protection and land conservation, and so the work done at the summit felt like an organic space for activism. “The impacts of climate change continue to be keenly felt by the Métis Nation,” said Cassidy Caron , president of the Métis National Council. “Now, more than ever, it is vital that we work together to protect and preserve the land, water, and air, and to develop and advance strategies to deal with the environmental issues that affect us all.” Outside of organizing, the purpose of the Youth Summit was to unveil the Climate Action Strategy that Métis governments across Canada and the Métis National Council had been developing for the past few years. From all over the country, Métis artists, activists, policy workers, local government officials and more all collaborated on plans to find and nurture clean and renewable energy, and encourage international advocacy and climate leadership. One immediate action item was the transition of infrastructure and energy systems to achieve net-zero carbon emission by 2050. Among the initiatives born out of this goal is the Métis Crossing Solar Project in Alberta’s Smoky Lake County ― a collaboration between MNA, the county, and the town of Smoky Lake. While most electricity grids are powered by generators fueled with coal and natural gas, this model for community-scale solar generation reduces greenhouse gas emissions through partnership with Indigenous communities. Métis science and technology adviser Brendan Struthers , who attended the summit, described to me some of the direct effects climate change has had on his community, which led him to relocate. “When I was young, minor events may have happened once every five years,” he told me. “Now, it’s an expectation that nearly every year we will experience a severe wildfire and/or drought. In the Okanagan, it’s now too difficult to live with the smoke, and I could no longer rely on the water because lake levels would be too low or not safe to fish.” The climate strategy aims to address these kinds of disruptions to everyday life ― Struthers’ experience is only one among a sea of people navigating this crisis. It’s an ugly truth that as much displacement as our communities have faced historically, there will be even more to come if our land is robbed of resources. We all walked away with something that made us feel empowered, even amid the chaos of the constant abuse of our planet: a plan to address climate change that is actionable and focused. Its five priorities are economic development and prosperity; nature stewardship; sustainable energy and infrastructure; emergency management and climate resilience; and health and well-being. Each priority outlines long-term outcomes and proposes a list of actions to achieve those goals, to be executed in tandem between community members and government officials. The entire creation of the strategy is a celebration of Métis collaboration and agency. After the climate conversations came parties and performances by members of the community. The artwork displayed at the summit was selected based on an art competition held by the Métis National Council. “I aspire for my artwork to encapsulate the urgency of strategizing against climate change,” said artist Teagan Neufeld , who designed the cover for the climate change action strategy. “We must unite to navigate the flames and emerge on the other side before the fire engulfs us all. I hope future generations will look back on their childhood with the same fondness for nature that I do. There is an abundance we must safeguard and advocate for.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has formally apologized for the church’s role in inflicting trauma and abuse on generations of Native American children and families through its participation in Indian boarding schools. By a 181-2 vote, the conference on Friday approved a 56-page document titled “Keeping Christ’s Sacred Promise: A Pastoral Framework for Indigenous Ministry.” In it, the bishops lamented that “many Indigenous Catholics have felt a sense of abandonment” by church leaders who don’t understand “their unique cultural needs.” The bishops also acknowledged the role the church played in running Indian boarding schools. “The Church recognizes that it has played a part in traumas experienced by Native children,” the bishops said. Elsewhere in the document, they said, “We apologize for the failure to nurture, strengthen, honor, recognize, and appreciate those entrusted to our pastoral care.” For nearly a century, from 1869 through the 1960s, the U.S. government removed hundreds of thousands of Indigenous children from tribal lands and forced them into boarding schools to assimilate them into white culture. Children endured abuse and violence and even died at these schools, all the while being cut off from their families. Most of the more than 500 Indian boarding schools were run by the U.S. government, but the Catholic Church operated more than 80 of them. Pope Francis issued a historic apology to Indigenous people in 2022 for the “deplorable” abuses they suffered in Canada’s Catholic-run residential schools. But the new document from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops marks the church’s first official apology to Indigenous people in the United States. On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, key senators praised the U.S. Catholic bishops for acknowledging the church’s complicity in what was effectively an era of cultural genocide. “Through a nearly unanimous vote, the Catholic Church’s decision to issue this apology demonstrates a commitment to truth and accountability,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the top Republican on the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, said in a statement. “The trauma inflicted during the Indian Boarding School era left deep scars on Indigenous communities, including in Alaska, that are still seen today,” said Murkowski. “Those impacted by these horrific actions deserve to find healing and the acknowledgement of the wounds inflicted from these policies is but one step toward doing just that.” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who chairs the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, similarly said that the church’s apology ” can be a powerful tool in the healing process.” But, he said, there’s a lot more work to do. He specifically urged the Senate to pass pending legislation, the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies Act, which would create a federal commission to conduct a full inquiry into the assimilative polices of Indian boarding schools. Schatz and Murkowski passed the bill out of their committee unanimously last year, but it hasn’t gotten a full Senate vote. “The deep trauma inflicted on Native children by Indian Boarding Schools, including those run by the Catholic Church, is a dark stain in our history and one we, as a country, are just beginning to reckon with,” Schatz said in a statement. “ We still have more work to do to uncover the true extent of this painful history,” he said. “I will continue to work hard to quickly move the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies Act through the Senate and signed into law.” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the country’s first Indigenous Cabinet secretary, has used her role to raise awareness of what actually happened at Indian boarding schools. She has talked about the generational trauma within her own family, as her grandmother described “the pain and loneliness she endured when the trains took her away from her family.” In 2021, Haaland launched the Interior Department’s Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative to examine the legacy of Indian boarding school policies and their intergenerational impact. As part of this effort, she embarked on a project called The Road to Healing, traveling around the country to meet with survivors of the boarding school system and asking to hear their stories for a permanent oral history collection. “I want you all to know t hat I’m with you on this journey. I will listen. I will grieve with you. I will weep. And I will feel your pain,” Haaland said in November 2023, at the final stop of The Road to Healing in Bozeman, Montana. “The healing that can help our communities will not be done overnight, but it can be done,” she continued. “This is one step, among many, that we will take to strengthen and rebuild the bonds within Native communities that federal Indian boarding school policies set out to break. Those steps have the potential to alter the course of our future.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Labor Reporter, HuffPost From now on, Mickey Mouse will be carrying a union card in California. Performers at Disneyland theme park in Anaheim voted overwhelmingly in favor of unionizing in an election this week, the National Labor Relations Board announced Sunday. They will be members of the Actors’ Equity Association, the same union that represents performers and stage managers at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. The election at the theme park involved more than 1,700 employees in the character and parade departments. The vote count was 953 in favor of unionizing and 258 against it, according to a board spokesperson. Actors’ Equity said in a statement that those workers had been an “exception” among the heavily unionized workforce at Disneyland “until now.” “This is an incredible victory, and we appreciate all the support over the past several weeks,” Kate Shindle, the union’s president, said in a statement. “These cast members are both pro-union and pro-Disney, and they’re looking forward to meeting with their employer across the bargaining table.” Disney would have a week to file any challenges to the election results before the labor board certifies them as official. “While voting is complete, there are still steps in the process prior to the election being certified, so it is premature for the company to comment on the results,” the company said in a statement. “Whatever the outcome, we respect that our cast members had the opportunity to have their voices heard.” The new union includes workers who dress and act as Disney characters in shows, restaurants and throughout the park, as well as those who train them. Employees leading the union effort took on the name “Magic United” and called for higher pay, fairer scheduling and stronger safety practices on the job. When the union filed for an election in April, it said the goal was “to make ‘the happiest place on Earth’ a little happier.” “ Magic doesn’t pay our rent ,” the group said. “We must be able to live comfortably in the community where we work.” Actors’ Equity is traditionally a union for stage actors and managers but has branched out into new areas in recent years. The group successfully organized the Star Garden Topless Dive Bar in North Hollywood last year, making it the only unionized strip club in the U.S. at the time. The union also organized astronomical tour guides at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. The vote at Disney wasn’t the only big union election held this week. Workers at Mercedes-Benz in Alabama voted 2,045 to 2,642 against joining the United Auto Workers union, a setback for the group as it tries to organize foreign-owned auto plants in the South. This story has been updated with comment from Disney."

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost COVAS DO BARROSO, Portugal — For centuries, Aida Fernandes’ family has lived in this village nestled in the rugged mountains that crown the northern border with Spain, with generation after generation grazing cattle and growing grapes in lush green fields. Then, in 2010, a wildfire — one of the growing number of blazes scorching this part of Europe as the climate changes — engulfed the verdant foothills encircling Fernandes’ ancient home. The rustic stone houses and towering persimmon trees of Fernandes’ remote town of about 100 people remained intact, but there was plenty of damage to the surrounding area. With time, though, the wounded landscape healed. Dense stands of maritime pines regrew to cover the charred bare ridges. Enough Erica lusitanica , or Portuguese heath, sprouted between the skinny evergreens’ trunks to make the ground look like brushstrokes in an impressionist painting. Wild fruit trees returned, bearing juicy berries with red skin and yellow meat that locals call medronheiros and ferment into alcohol. The culture, too, showed signs of a rebound, as the region’s unique farming traditions and indigenous livestock breeds made it one of the only places in Europe to win a spot on a worldwide list of “agricultural heritage systems” worthy of conservation. But around that same time, Fernandes registered a new threat to her land — one that, while slower-moving, could change things forever. It came not from a “what” but a “whom”: an invasion, with huge ramifications for Europe’s climate goals and Portugal’s political stability. With the help of the national government, the lithium mining industry promises to transform this forgotten region into the European Union’s largest operation for digging the metal ― prized for its role in electric vehicles ― out of the earth. More prospectors were arriving by the month to bore cylindrical holes into rock and take samples. As time went on, Fernandes accused workers of trespassing on land where they had no legal rights, an allegation the mining company denied. Seemingly overnight, Fernandes, 45, became the de facto leader of the resistance, a self-described David leading a ragtag coalition of farmers, environmentalists and itinerant hippies. They were up against the twin Goliaths of an international corporation and the Portuguese state, with backing from at least a handful of villagers who believed mining would mean a financial boost for themselves and their region. One Friday in November, Fernandes’ new responsibility — an exhausting third job on top of farming and raising three kids — meant going on patrol to check whether the prospectors were advancing. Peering at the horizon through the dusty windshield of her red Toyota pickup, she spotted a single plume of white smoke. Fernandes let out something between a gasp and a sigh. “They’re here,” she said. Roughly 200 feet down the ridge, a crew of three hard-hatted workers made use of the waning daylight to dig a little deeper into the exposed rock, casting up a continuous puff of diesel exhaust and dust. Men had been showing up on lands owned collectively by the villagers for months. Fernandes and her cohort tried blocking the road when they saw them coming, but this afternoon she was too late. More workers were coming more often, with armed police not far behind — an intimidating sight for residents who lived through the fascist dictatorship that ruled Portugal from the Great Depression until the 1970s. The industry is in a Catch-22. Lithium is the main component in the power packs that propel electric vehicles and store energy from weather-dependent renewables, like wind and solar, for later use. Investors hoping to cash in on the transition from fossil fuels to batteries and electricity call it “white gold.” Consumers in rich parts of Europe and North America demand products made with metals unearthed with minimal environmental damage, but have literally stood in the way of mines in countries with some of the highest regulatory standards in the world. Even under optimistic scenarios for how much metal recycling can recirculate into the battery supply chain, analysts say both continents need to mine more raw lithium ― and officials from Washington to Brussels are dangling new incentives for companies to do so. Yet Savannah Resources, the mining company pursuing the lithium under Covas do Barroso, finds itself fending off villagers’ lawsuits in local court in Portugal. New legal cases “coupled with the increased stream of negative media coverage in the second half of the year are a cause for ongoing frustration,” Matthew King, Savannah Resources’ chairman, wrote in a year-end letter to investors in December. “However, we will continue to communicate the positive benefits of our project for the local community, Portugal and indeed Europe as a whole, and our efforts to minimise any and all negative impacts it may have.” Tensions were growing. Temperatures were surging. Fernandes was staring down the plans that some of the world’s most powerful governments and financiers had for her tiny, ancient village. And time was running out. With final mining permits still pending, the only question was: For whom? There is a lot of “white gold” in the hills around Covas do Barroso. There’s enough, according to the British mining company paying the prospectors to drill rock samples of the landscape, to manufacture nearly 600,000 electric vehicles annually — more than three times the number of new cars sold in Portugal in a good year . Someone just needs to dig the yellowish spodumene rocks out of the ground, cart them away, crush the ore, roast and chemically treat the dust, and eventually sell the resulting lithium concentrate to any of the dozens of battery factories under construction across Europe. London-based Savannah Resources wants to be that someone. This year, the company, which said it has the rights to 93 hectares of land — roughly 230 acres, sold by more than 40 local landowners — around the village already, is set to finish its permitting process. Next year, the firm is scheduled to start the real work on opening its Barroso mine, and plans to build a chemical plant next to the open pit to process the ore in-house. By the end of the decade, Savannah envisions remaking this region into a key node in the clean-energy supply chain the European Union and the United States are banking on to free their economies of both carbon emission and China, which controls the vast majority of the world’s production of metals for batteries and solar panels. “ The Barroso Lithium Project is one of the most strategically important lithium projects in Europe, and we are delighted to be progressing so well,” the company said in an email to HuffPost. The European Union currently uses 230,000 metric tons of lithium per year, but the energy consultancy Benchmark Minerals forecasts that demand will more than triple to 700,000 metric tons by 2030. The EU enacted its Critical Raw Materials Act just last month, setting ambitious targets for how much lithium the bloc aims to mine and process within its own borders. Most of the world’s lithium is currently produced in southern South America or Australia, then processed in China. As the push for electric cars drives up demand, other countries have joined the rush, with some making rules that require companies to process the ore locally, potentially limiting how much European refiners could get without mining the metal themselves. In 2022, the U.S. passed its first major climate law, unleashing a historic spending spree on everything from new nuclear reactors to electric cars. Congress reserved the most lucrative federal tax credits in the legislation for new Teslas or Chevy Bolts with batteries made with metals mined in the U.S., or in countries with which the U.S. has a free-trade agreement. In November, the European Union brokered a new deal to work with the U.S. to increase the amount of so-called critical minerals being produced on both sides of the Atlantic. Under the Critical Raw Materials Act passed four months later, the EU needs to mine 10% of its own lithium, but process at least 40% ― a requirement the bloc can meet by importing raw ore from abroad or recycling used batteries at home. “There will obviously be an effort to develop as much upstream mining capacity in Europe as possible,” said Daisy Jennings-Gray, a London-based analyst at the market research firm Benchmark Minerals. “But no one is expecting Europe to suddenly become a huge mining region. Europe will probably never have a massive mining economy unless there’s a whole change in culture.” With Europe charging ahead on going electric, and the U.S. offering its allies privileged access to a car market where, even in a slump , more new vehicles are sold each year than there are people in Portugal, the government in Lisbon saw an opening. Portugal had a history of mining metals like tungsten, and an auto manufacturing industry already employing upward of 150,000 Portuguese workers and paying more than one-fifth of the country’s tax revenues. Savannah’s project, meanwhile, would satisfy both the EU’s mining and processing targets. “Lithium is something that is so important for new technologies,” said Antóni o Costa Pinto, a research professor at the University of Lisbon and one of the country’s best-known political scientists. “ It was an economic opportunity that Portugal could not pass up.” Savannah’s proposal has attracted the most international attention, but the rush for lithium in Portugal — and the controversy surrounding it — actually began with a local company, Lusorecursos. The company won a government permit to begin prospecting for tin and tungsten in the foothills around Montalegre, but it was long plagued by allegations of fraud. Lusorecursos remained embroiled in lawsuits as recently as this year. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Both Lusorecursos and Savannah got the green light from regulators in 2023 to move forward on mining. Both companies were then dragged into the nationwide scandal that erupted in early November, when prosecutors announced an investigation into alleged corruption in the licensing process for the lithium mines and another clean-energy project, a hydrogen facility. While only his deputies were named in the probe, Prime Minister António Costa resigned in disgrace. The companies said they were cooperating with investigators. Portuguese prosecutors asked a judge to annul Savannah’s environmental permit in February, but the courts have yet to do so. In an email, Savannah said its own independent investigation in January “concluded that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the company,” and noted that its work has continued “unencumbered” since the probe was first made public. “Our teams are on the ground, our current drilling programme has produced some very positive results,” the company said in May. If all goes according to plan, Savannah will complete its final feasibility study by the end of this year and advance to the last phase of the permitting process shortly afterward. Its prospecting work has continued. I arrived in Covas do Barroso less than two weeks after the prime minister resigned, with the goal of seeing the front lines of the European Union’s biggest “lithium war,” the hyperbolic term that journalists and advocates like to use for conflicts between miners and local opponents. A giant banner calling for “no mining” fluttered in a traffic circle in Boticas roughly 20 minutes from the village. But the place seemed otherwise peaceful. An elderly farmer in a tweed cap waved as he brought his cattle to heel and let my car pass, as I questioned whether my rental could fit down the narrow cobblestone street where Fernandes lives. I parked outside her house, and hopped into the front seat of her pickup. She was on duty, and she had comrades waiting for her. For months, prospectors working for Savannah had been showing up on property that opponents say is clearly outside the bounds of the tracts the company has purchased. “They’re prospecting on my land without my permission,” said Catarina Scarrott, 46, a teacher from Covas do Barroso who now lives in London. “The limits of the land have been set up for 200 years or more, and everyone in the village knows what the limits of the land are.” Scarrott is Fernandes’ cousin, and visits the village regularly. She said she could prove the land is hers, but by the time she could get a court to intervene, Savannah “will have prospected already.” The village of Covas do Barroso has at least three active lawsuits against Savannah, the company disclosed in its latest financial report to shareholders. But all the litigation is pending, part of a drawn-out legal process. “They want to wear us down,” she said. “They know the court system is slow. They don’t care about the penalties they’ll get, because all they want to do is prospect. If they can’t prospect, they can’t prove they’ve got enough material to mine.” The company told investors its lawyers said “any discrepancies in the land borders” would result in “the land returned” to the village. Savannah said a “generous offer has been made” to buy the remaining land, threatening to “use the Portuguese legal system to secure the land” if “it is not possible to secure the remainder of the land required by mutual agreement.” At issue is the fact that a portion of the land surrounding Covas do Barroso is owned communally among the villagers. In Portugal, rural towns have traditionally exercised collective control over areas of land called “baldios,” which the communities can either manage themselves or oversee with the help of national conservation authorities. “Savannah and its contractors have been working only on land which the Company either owns or has been granted permission to enter,” the company said in its emailed statement. There was a gushing river between the village’s cobblestone street and the dirt road that leads through the communally owned lands where the Savannah workers had begun digging. Fernandes and her fellow anti-mining activists have feared that the mining will cause the underground reservoir to drop, wells to run dry, and any remaining water to become contaminated. Last year, Savannah revised its initial pitch in regulatory documents to include more water protections. The company said its mine will operate as a “closed system” with “water treatment and sediment removal systems” in place to “ensure water quality on and off site is maintained.” In all, the company said it would tap less than 1% of the area’s groundwater, and that it had committed to daily monitoring for quality and cleanliness. It also sweetened the deal for Covas do Barroso, according to João Cerejeira, an economist at the University of Minho who analyzed the Savannah project’s impacts. Savannah said its concession only covers 0.5% of the Barroso agricultural region ― and “ guaranteed ” it would backfill and rehabilitate each area it mines, “permanently” impacting “less than 0.25%” of the heritage zone. The company abandoned plans to operate 24/7, promised to impose strict time and noise limits on the mining operation, and budgeted to build a new road so its trucks don’t cause traffic. Savannah also pledged annual donations to a local charity, and vowed to fund cultural research and breeding programs for native livestock. Such benefits were “not in the other versions” of proposals Savannah put forward, Cerejeira said. “It’s an opportunity for the region,” Cerejeira said. “The region is losing population year by year. If they don’t have a project that will attract more people, more employment and more families to be living there... in the next decade the municipality will probably disappear. In terms of major services like post offices, schools and banks, you won’t have them because there won’t be enough humans.” Fernandes and her cohort don’t see it that way. And if they couldn’t stop the mine altogether, their plan was to delay it as much as possible to at least test Savannah investors’ will to keep funding a company without revenues. Locals took turns playing sentinel, parking near the entrance to the communal baldio lands and preparing to summon reinforcements to block any mining trucks driving in to work. Some days it proved effective, and Fernandes and her friends managed to keep the diesel trucks hauling prospecting equipment from reaching their destination. Other times, as I would later learn, it was a fruitless endeavor — and a distraction from necessary daily farming tasks. When Fernandes saw the smoke on the horizon, indicating that the workers had begun boring into the bedrock before anyone could spot them, she seemed crestfallen and frustrated. She drove off the paved street and onto the muddy road that ascends the pine-covered hillsides of the common lands surrounding the village. Roughly 100 feet up, she stopped the truck in front of two young people. Mariana Riquito, 26, had first come to Covas do Barroso in September 2021 to study the local pushback for her Ph.D. thesis in sociology. Beside her stood Aurik Antunes, 33, a barber and artist who was also drawn here by the conflict, but found it so peaceful they decided to stay and set up a sanctuary retreat for queer people struggling with trauma. They both hopped in the back of the pickup. Further up the road, we encountered a tall man in a fedora and long cargo shorts walking barefoot in the mud. Originally from Waterbury, Connecticut, Steven Silva Dias, 37, had returned to his parents’ native Portugal and found a sense of belonging in a local chapter of the Rainbow Gathering. The loose-knit, hippie-founded spiritual movement first cropped up in the U.S. in the 1970s to oppose the war in Vietnam. It survives today in the form of regular monthlong encampments where, for a full moon cycle, participants live off the land, bathe naked in streams, and engage in rituals of breathing and physical touch that are meant to erode ego. Covas do Barroso’s mining conflict had drawn the Rainbow Gathering, which set up its temporary camp of tents and teepees in October. Dias, too, hopped in the back of the truck. We drove another five minutes before reaching the ridge above where the workers were taking rock samples. “See what they do?” Dias sneered. The whole affair felt pretty benign. The workers made noise and cast up dust from machinery, but the operation was confined to a small area. The activists leered from the ridgetop above the work site, but did not approach or confront the crew. There seemed to be an understanding: If opponents blocked the road, the workers wouldn’t push through. But if the prospectors got started before advocates could obstruct their vehicles, no one would try to physically stop them. Fernandes planned a show of force for the next day, which she organized in a private WhatsApp chat of local activists. She would lead a march of villagers to where Savannah had been taking samples that night, and prevent any more drilling — a demonstration of solidarity ahead of a town meeting where Fernandes hoped her neighbors would vote to pursue legal action against Savannah. But first, she would make an discomfiting discovery: Her movement had a mole. My phone rang as I was finishing breakfast the next morning, about an hour before Fernandes’ march was scheduled to begin. “Come quick. Please,” Fernandes said. “The police are everywhere.” I drove fast down the twisting roads to Covas do Barroso. Two police SUVs blocked the road at the entrance to the village, but officers eventually got out of the way to let me pass. About two dozen protesters were gathered at the defunct schoolhouse in the center of the village. We drove to the start of the dirt road going through the common lands, got out, and hiked the rest of the way to where the workers had been the night before. There were no prospectors. But the police were circling the roads. The crowd stood in the mud. Some eyed the surrounding ridges with binoculars, trying to spot miners. None appeared. Two Rainbow Gathering members began arguing in English over the ethics of smoking tobacco. A third rolled a cigarette by hand. “I wonder if someone could explain why we’re here,” said a man wearing a wool poncho and carrying a large skin drum. “My brother says it’s to meet the land.” Fernandes broke in and began giving a speech describing why her cohort believed a lithium mine would ruin this ancient farming community. She explained that Savannah had won a preliminary permit last May and could receive final approvals by next spring. “We’re here to demonstrate that we have no fear, and to alert people to what’s going on,” she said. Another Rainbow Gathering member asked if the lithium was going to Big Pharma. Riquito expounded on how electric cars were driving up demand for the metal, and that digging all that out of the ground here would destroy the local environment, without even adding that much to the global supply. The poncho’d drummer asked if it was OK to read a message he was carrying from a tribe in Colombia. He read out the famous 1990 statement from the Kogi people to the world, warning humanity of nature’s wrath should industrial development continue apace. Fernandes left the gathering early to complete some farm work. Her mind was elsewhere. “Someone alerted the police,” she said. “Someone in the group.” The police later told me it received a tip about a planned demonstration, and sent reinforcements to maintain “public order and tranquility.” But the National Republican Guard, as the country’s police force is known, acknowledged it had expanded patrols in Covas do Barroso generally as protests picked up over the past year. “ The increase in police presence in the village... can be justified by the presence of a climate of tension among the population, who in general were opposed to the entry of the lithium exploration company into the vacant land in the region, a situation which generated a lot of media attention nationally and internationally,” said Ana Isabel Morais, a spokesperson for Portugal’s National Republican Guard. That night, Fernandes led a town meeting at the village hall. This was what the protest was setting the stage for, a show of force to fellow villagers that momentum was building against the mine. It seemed to work. The majority in attendance voted in favor of opposing the mine, and considered additional litigation to stop it. The vote didn’t translate into any specific legal action, making it mostly symbolic. But when Fernandes came home to find her husband, her daughter and her daughter-in-law sharing cheese, bread and wine by the fire, she was glowing with pride. From that point on, she said, the village has kept at least one guard at the worksite where the prospectors had been that Friday in November, preventing the company from collecting its equipment or continuing its sampling at that location. Not everyone was pleased. Lucillia Mó, 60, was among nearly four dozen people in the village who Savannah says have sold the company a cumulative 100 plots as of last month. She couldn’t recall exactly how much land, or how much money she earned — it was a small parcel far from the village itself — but she said it was a “fair price.” She has lived in Covas do Barroso her entire life, and can remember what it used to be like here. The schools were filled with kids. “A lot of people leave this area because there aren’t enough jobs,” Mó said. Her brother, she added, “already said if it goes ahead, he’d like to work in the mine.” She brushed off concerns about water pollution and trucks, saying she was more concerned about the social isolation she’d felt after not joining the resistance movement. “They stopped speaking to me,” Mó said. “I’m free to have my own opinion, and I have the right to decide to sell whatever land my parents left me if I need the money, so there’s no need for them to punish me.” Fernandes said she had no issue with Mó’s decision to sell her land. The problem, she said, was that Mó’s land deal initially included part of the baldio she had no legal right to sell. “We’re not against the people who sell,” Fernandes said. “We’re against the people who try to steal the baldio land.” If anyone should be mad, Mó said, it’s villagers like her who never invited all these newcomers into Covas do Barroso. “There are groups of people who come in. We don’t know who they are or what they do. It’s not that we’re against new people coming. But they were naked,” she said, referring to activists like the Rainbow Gathering group who bathed outside. “A few months ago, I found two of them in one of my fields picking my chestnuts,” she added. “I asked them, ‘Who sent you here?’ And they couldn’t respond because they don’t speak Portuguese. I don’t like that.” It’s unclear how many other villagers shared her sentiment. No patron at a crowded village bar and café one afternoon wanted to talk about the mine to an American journalist speaking through a translator, and the vote at the town meeting seemed to indicate widespread opposition. “She is a very special person,” Fernandes said sarcastically of Mó. The BBC , Reuters and Euronews had sent reporters to the remote village, and each came back with a similar David-vs.-Goliath narrative about resistance to the mine. A new documentary starring Fernandes premiered last week in France at the Cannes Film Festival. I reached out to Savannah over a month before I was scheduled to visit Portugal, and the company, through an outside publicity firm, ultimately declined to meet with me during my visit. I contacted the company again months later, asking if they would introduce me to some villagers who sold the firm their land. After weeks of going back and forth, Savannah arranged phone calls with two. Maciel Alves sold Savannah 7 acres for 150,000 euros. A granite quarryman by trade, he said he understands the risks of lithium mining and believes the opposition is exaggerating the potential tradeoffs. “The real risks are if it doesn’t go ahead,” Alves, 43, said by phone in March. “Things will stay the same and nothing will change. Our region will keep getting more and more abandoned.” The mine, he said, would bring royalty payments and money. “Everybody works for money, and it comes in handy,” he said. That’s particularly true as the seasons and land he once counted on become less reliable. Alves remembered the blaze that nearly turned the village to ash. “The wildfire took everything in Covas,” he said. “The land all burned down. The trees all burned down. My parent’s land, it all got affected.” The flames couldn’t lick the cash in his checking account, he said. On my final night in Boticas, after sharing dinner with Antunes, I drove back to the neighboring village where I was staying. The inky blackness of night was overpowering. In New York City, I rarely see that much darkness. I pulled onto the side of the road, parked the car, turned the lights off and got out. The cloudless sky was splattered with stars. I wondered how many generations of gazers had taken in this same view at this exact location. Finally craning my neck downward, I saw a blink of red light. Then another. Another. Along the horizon, on a distant ridgeline, a row of red lights flickering on and off. Wind turbines. A week later, the Spanish government finalized its plans to shut down the Iberian Peninsula’s last nuclear reactors in the next few years, leaving Portugal, which shares a power grid with its neighbor, with little choice but to build a lot more batteries if the lights are going to stay on when the wind dies down and the sky turns dark. If the speed of deliberate change didn’t hasten, nature would set the pace. That would mean more wildfires, more “ smokenados ,” and more drought, like the latest one parching Iberia . With lithium demand soaring year over year in the U.S., China and Europe, how long could this region really keep mining at bay?"

    "article_content": "Labor Reporter, HuffPost Mercedes-Benz USA hired a large team of anti-union consultants to help the company defeat an organizing effort by the United Auto Workers union earlier this month, according to new disclosures with the Labor Department. The filings show the automaker contracted with three consulting firms to bring on at least 11 “persuaders” to hold meetings with workers about the union ahead of an election. Employees at the Vance, Alabama, plant ultimately voted 2,045 to 2,642 against forming a union , a setback for the UAW as it tries to organize Southern auto facilities. Employers often spend big bucks to hire persuaders to hold what are known as “captive audience” meetings — mandatory gatherings where workers tend to hear anti-union talking points. The going rate these days is around $3,200 per day for each consultant. Mercedes did not immediately respond Tuesday when asked how much it spent. The company had said ahead of the election that it “ fully respects our Team Members’ choice whether to unionize.” It also said it was making sure that employees had “access to the information necessary to make an informed choice.” “It’s been nonstop anti-union. We’ve had to go to meetings every day.” Both employers and consultants are legally required to disclose their arrangements to the Labor Department. Mercedes won’t be required to report how much it spent on the campaign until next year. But workers at the Vance plant said consultants appeared to be holding meetings daily in the weeks ahead of the election. With such a large roster of contractors, the company easily could have spent in the hundreds of thousands of dollars on the effort. (The Labor Department filings can be seen here , here , here and here .) “It’s been nonstop anti-union. We’ve had to go to meetings every day,” Rick Webster, a worker and member of the union organizing committee, told HuffPost ahead of the vote. “They’re just blowing all kinds of money on this.” Most of the UAW’s membership is concentrated in Midwestern plants run by Ford, General Motors and Jeep parent company Stellantis. But following its strike against the “The Big Three” last year, the union has launched an ambitious campaign to organize workers at foreign-owned plants in Southern states like Alabama that are more hostile to organized labor. The UAW had a historic breakthrough last month when it won by a landslide at Volkswagen’s SUV assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Volkswagen mostly stayed out of the organizing campaign, whereas Mercedes, which bargains with unions in its home country of Germany, actively opposed the UAW through meetings, text messages and letters to employees. The UAW and Germany-based labor leaders said Mercedes was violating its own social responsibility code by taking a position against the union. Late last week the UAW filed objections to Mercedes’ conduct during the campaign, alleging the company illegally interfered in the process and tainted the vote. The National Labor Relations Board is expected to review the union’s claims and, if it finds wrongdoing by Mercedes, could call for a do-over election. “Let’s get a vote at Mercedes in Alabama where the company isn’t allowed to fire people, isn’t allowed to intimidate people, and isn’t allowed to break the law and their own corporate code, and let the workers decide,” the union said in a statement."

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost The deadly riots that broke out earlier this month in the French territory of New Caledonia are pushing up the price of nickel, a key metal needed to transition off fossil fuels that has gotten more expensive as global conflicts affect the market. The South Pacific archipelago, located roughly 1,000 miles off Australia’s east coast, was the world’s third-largest producer last year of nickel. The metal is used for everything from steelmaking to solar panels, but is particularly prized as an ingredient in batteries for large machines like electric vehicles, allowing them to last longer on a single charge. Nickel prices dipped last year as electric car sales stalled out, allowing a surplus to pile up in warehouses around the world. But prices spiked again in February, when Swiss mining behemoth Glencore announced plans to exit New Caledonia and sell its half of one of the territory’s biggest mines. Then, in April, new Western sanctions against Moscow prompted the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the London Metals Exchange ― the largest U.S. and world markets for options and futures contracts on metals, respectively ― to ban Russian-produced nickel. With projected demand for nickel already outstripping the world’s current planned supply, cutting a major producer out of the market hiked prices. Now, simmering unrest in New Caledonia, which some commentators have likened to a dawning “civil war,” has prevented any shipments or production of nickel, sending the price of the metal surging by more than 7% in recent weeks. It’s just the latest squeeze, but raises doubts over the West’s capacity to rewire supply chains and reduce dependence on geopolitical rivals such as China and Russia. Protests broke out in early May after French President Emmanuel Macron moved to pass legislation that would deflate the political power of the native Kanak people, seemingly thwarting their hopes of gaining independence from the European power that conquered their homeland 171 years ago. France retains more than a dozen overseas territories as a legacy of its empire, which crumbled after World War II. As the U.S. did with Hawaii and Alaska, France fully incorporated five of its territories in the Caribbean, South America and the Indian Ocean into its political structure. Other French colonial islands, mainly in the Caribbean and South Pacific, assumed a secondary status as “overseas collectivities,” akin to America’s relationship with Puerto Rico or Guam. After slotting New Caledonia into that latter category in 1946, France granted the Kanaks citizenship and allowed the ethnically Melanesian natives to live freely outside the tightly controlled reservations to which they were confined following colonization in 1853. Kanaks enjoyed a slight majority over non-native settlers, mostly of European descent. In the 1970s, a nickel boom spurred by U.S. demand for weapons in the Vietnam War brought an influx of roughly 25,000 migrants from Europe and across the region to New Caledonia, a territory of about 80,000 at the time. Kanaks became a minority in their homeland. In 1980, the neighboring island chain of Vanuatu declared its independence from France. Inspired by that, and by other anti-colonial struggles in formerly French-ruled Algeria and Vietnam, Kanak nationalists launched what one historian called a series of “extraordinary confrontations” in New Caledonia, “marked by hostage-taking, blockades and assassinations.” The 1998 settlement that ended the conflict laid the groundwork for three separate votes on the island’s independence, after a 20-year transition period. The results were not immediately binding. But if New Caledonians voted all three times in favor of breaking away from France, it would likely have set the stage for independence. In a concession that improved Kanaks’ odds, the deal also froze registration to keep newly-arrived voters from diluting the Indigenous vote, even as their share of the population shrank. The first two referenda, in 2018 and 2020, saw the island vote against independence overall, though most Kanaks voted in favor. The third and final referendum was scheduled for 2022, but Macron’s government moved the date up a year. The move outraged Kanaks, who said a 2021 vote put them at a disadvantage because their communities had suffered the vast majority of New Caledonia’s deaths from COVID-19 and were still racked by grief. When France rejected Kanaks’ pleas to stick to the original plan, Indigenous campaigners urged voters to boycott. Half as many eligible voters turned out for the third vote as for the first two, and almost all of them rejected independence. Kanaks called the vote invalid. Kanaks largely saw the French government as seen as a fair arbiter between themselves and the loyalists when the 1998 agreement was negotiated. Regardless of the outcome, Paris pledged to bring all sides together after the final voters were tallied to “sit down and negotiate a new territorial arrangement,” said David Chappell, a professor emeritus of Pacific history at the University of Hawaii. Instead, Macron’s government sided with the loyalists, accepting the results and promptly introducing legislation in the French Parliament to extend full voting rights to New Caledonia residents living in the territory for at least 10 years. Those new, non-Kanak residents would likely vote against independence, dimming hopes of gaining independence at some point in the future with another vote. Kanaks “ now feel left out and cheated,” Chappell said. “The spirit of the [deal] was collegial and consensual, but the Kanak now fear they will lose their voice in their own country if another 40,000 settlers can vote, without any accompanying assurances of other decolonizing reforms.” New Caledonia’s place in the nickel supply chain was slipping before the riots. The industry consists of three major producers. The largest mine, Doniambo, and the second-largest, Koniambo, each mined and smelted nickel ore into ferronickel, a metal used primarily in steelmaking. The third, called Prony Resources, makes and sells a nickel-rich mixed-metal compound known as MHP, which is used in batteries. The price of nickel soared to over $22,000 per ton in early 2023, but finished off the year just above $14,000 per ton, as electric vehicle sales slowed. “With prices falling, the producers in New Caledonia are at the wrong end of the cost curve,” said Adrian Gardner, the principal nickel analyst at the market research firm Wood Mackenzie. Unable to compete at those prices with cheap Chinese and Indonesian nickel, all three producers in the territory asked the French government this year for new subsidies to stay afloat. In February, Glencore announced plans to sell its 49% share of Koniambo and stop funding operations by May, grinding production to a halt for this year. In recent years, New Caledonia produced up to one-fifth of the world’s ferronickel supply, selling mostly to manufacturers in Asia. But as the U.S. looks to cut China out of industrial supply chains and reroute minerals and investments to friendlier countries, a major producer in a territory controlled by one of Washington’s most powerful NATO allies should, at least in theory, command some kind of premium. That’s particularly the case since one of the biggest ferronickel projects in the Western Hemisphere — a facility in Brazil, to be operated by London-based Horizonte Minerals — was canceled this year. “At the same time we lost Koniambo’s ferronickel, we’ve lost a potential new source in Brazil that would have serviced the U.S. and European stainless steel markets,” Gardner said. The battery-grade nickel coming from New Caledonia’s Prony project is unlikely to make its way to American battery factories, because there are no U.S. facilities to process MHP into the next-stage product needed for lithium-ion packs. If that material goes to battery makers in South Korea or Japan, which have free trade agreements with the U.S., it counts as though it were mined in New Mexico or New York in the eyes of the federal agencies giving out the most lucrative American tax credits for electric vehicles. But China accounts for 80% of MHP processing, Gardner said. Indonesia, which has the world’s largest known nickel reserves, is increasing production of raw ore more than any other country, giving Jakarta control over nearly 40% of the global market. China-based Tsingshan Holding Group, the world’s largest company producing nickel, is expanding its operations in Indonesia. If policymakers “want the U.S. industry to avoid Chinese investment or involvement, it’s a hard sell, because China’s control over global nickel is quite dominant,” Gardner said. “Even if you have 20 free trade agreements with countries, it still puts North America and the U.S.A. in a tight spot.” With nickel output higher than Canada or Australia last year, New Caledonia remains, via France, the West’s top domestic producer of the metal. But a new boom in the territory seems far off. No buyers have yet emerged for Glencore’s stake in Koniambo, and Gardner estimated that there’s basically no price point that would motivate the Swiss giant to reverse its decision. “This is a long term view Glencore is taking. … They want to exit New Caledonia,” Gardner said. “I don’t care if prices went up to $50,000 a ton. It’s been quite an unstable country to do business in, and it never has been a low-cost country to do business in.” After sending troops to New Caledonia quell riots, Macron visited the island last week and promised not to “force” the voting reform. The state of emergency officially ended this week, but a curfew remained in place as of Tuesday. Airports finally reopened this week, too, allowing stranded tourists to return home. The path forward remains unclear. While youth protesters are demanding independence, “my own position is that a small Pacific nation of 500,000 would not be viable, would be subject to influence from China, would lose its current very high standard of living,” but might have a more equal distribution of wealth,” said Raylene Ramsay, a professor emeritus at New Zealand’s University of Auckland and one of the leading English-language scholars of New Caledonian culture. “There is now a new group of ‘middle-class’ Kanak, politicians and thinkers, who want progress for the Kanak people through [dialogue] and do not see radicalism and violent opposition to the French State as the best way forward,” Ramsay said in an email. “But it is also difficult for many in the older generation who spent their lives as independence activists to not show solidarity with their peoples’ cause.” The inequalities are stark. Kanaks’ poverty rate is above 32%, compared to 9% for non-Kanaks. More than half of European-descended New Caledonians are university educated, and 24% of people with mixed heritage hold college degrees. But nearly half of fully Indigenous Kanaks hold no high school diploma, and just 8% graduate from university, according to 2019 census data Reuters cited. “There is looting and ransacking, but we have a population that is on the margins of society, they have no work, nothing to eat, they’re failing at school, they live in slums, and then next to that you have the rich neighborhoods,” Dominique Fochi, secretary general of the pro-independence Caledonian Union, which opposes the electoral reform but called for peaceful protest, told Reuters . “It is a people that is fighting for its dignity.” Workers in the nickel industry have weathered job cuts before, as happened at Koniambo when metal prices plunged in 2016. Glencore said it would retain all workers until August to help shut the facility down and “ aid in the transition .” The open question: To what?"

    "article_content": "Labor Reporter, HuffPost The U.S. Labor Department on Thursday filed a lawsuit against Hyundai, accusing the auto manufacturer of “oppressive child labor” in its Alabama supply chain. The complaint alleges that a 13-year-old worked up to 50-60 hours a week on the assembly line of a Hyundai supplier in the city of Luverne. The factory there produces parts, including body panels, that go onto SUVs built at Hyundai’s plant an hour away in Montgomery. Officials say an unspecified number of other minors also worked at the supplier, Smart Alabama. Hyundai announced last year that it was divesting its ownership in Smart after Reuters published an investigation into child labor at the factory. “The Labor Department says it documented 5,800 children illegally employed during the most recent fiscal year, an 88% increase since 2019.” The children who worked at the Smart plant were hired by a staffing company, according to the complaint. But the Labor Department argues that Hyundai is ultimately responsible for any violations since the Smart facility “existed at ... [Hyundai’s] discretion.” “Nearly all, if not the entirety, of the component parts that SMART manufactured during the relevant period were shipped to ... [Hyundai] in Montgomery, Alabama,” the lawsuit states. That facility produces the automaker’s Tucson and Santa Fe models. The Labor Department also sued Smart and the staffing company, Best Practice Service. Officials are asking that a judge issue an order “permanently enjoining” the companies from employing children, and requiring them to “disgorge all profits related to their use of oppressive child labor.” Hyundai released a statement through a spokesperson saying that it “worked over many months to thoroughly investigate this issue and took immediate and extensive remedial measures.” The company argued that there was “no legal basis” to hold it responsible for a supplier’s alleged violations, and said it would defend itself in court. “Unfortunately, the Labor Department is seeking to apply an unprecedented legal theory that would unfairly hold Hyundai accountable for the actions of its suppliers and set a concerning precedent for other automotive companies and manufacturers,” Hyundai said. U.S. officials have said that they are facing an increase in child labor cases, often involving migrant kids who fled Latin American countries and were hired onto the U.S. workforce. Last year, The New York Times reported a series of stories about migrant children working dangerous jobs in meatpacking and roofing. The Labor Department says it documented 5,800 children illegally employed during the most recent fiscal year, an 88% increase since 2019. The complaint against Hyundai alleges that the 13-year-old girl worked for a period of six to seven months at the factory when she should have been attending middle school. Jessica Looman, the head of the Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division, said in a statement that the case “shocks the conscience.” “As we work to stop illegal child labor where we find it, we also continue to ensure that all employers are held accountable for violating the law,” Looman said."

    "article_content": "Labor Reporter, HuffPost Waffle House plans to increase pay for servers at its restaurants across the country over the next three years, with some workers likely to see raises of a few dollars an hour. In a video viewed by HuffPost, CEO Joe Rogers III explained to employees that the pay boosts would “affect every single salesperson at Waffle House,” and would be funded by menu price increases targeted at stores in areas with high costs of living. The raises apply only to servers and will start going into effect this month. “This is a big deal, a massive additional investment,” Rogers said in the video. “And I don’t see many others in our industry doing things like this.” Most Waffle House locations are spread across the South, where restaurant workers typically earn a low “tipped minimum wage” supplemented by gratuities. Waffle House workers in Georgia, for instance, can earn less than $3 per hour directly from the company, with tips expected to push them above the standard minimum wage of $7.25. The pay plan would increase servers’ direct wages from Waffle House, with no changes in the way those workers receive gratuities. “It would be crazy if we went down the road of service charges instead of tips,” Rogers said in the video. “They're feeling the pressure. ... This is a step in the right direction.” Waffle House, which is privately owned and based in Norcross, Georgia, did not respond to requests for comment on the plan. The chain has around 2,000 locations and is iconic in the South as a sit-down diner that stays open through just about anything . The raises come at a time when some Waffle House workers have been outspoken about their struggles to cover basic expenses on such low pay. Servers from a Conyers, Georgia, store who are members of the Union of Southern Service Workers have gone on strike and delivered petitions to management demanding a living wage and 24-hour security on-site. One of those workers, Cindy Smith, said in an interview that she was happy to see the announcement and expected a pay bump of $3 per hour or more. After 30 years with the company, she currently earns $2.92 per hour before tips, she said. But even with the raise, Smith figures she will still eke by and barely cover groceries for herself and her son. “This is a win. We did this,” said Smith, 50. “It’s good, but it’s still not enough.” Rogers said in his video that most workers would fall into one of three categories depending on where they work: those whose base pay would reach $5.25 per hour in two years; $6.25 in two and a half years; or $7.25 in three years. Workers in Florida and Colorado would see their wages climb higher than that due to state minimum wage laws. The plan includes pay differentials to reward workers with long tenures. Servers would receive a 50-cents-per-hour bonus after three years, and this increases by 10 cents every year thereafter, with a maximum bonus of $3.20 per hour after 30 years. Workers could also get shift premiums of up to $1 per hour for working evenings or overnight. Diners will see higher prices to offset those pay increases, particularly in urban markets, according to the video. Waffle House assumes that customers in expensive areas like Atlanta and Houston will be more willing to accept price hikes than those in low-cost-of-living markets. “Our menu prices in a rural town are relative to competitors’ menu prices in that rural town,” Rogers said. “So we may not have as much room to increase prices as we have in a large city.” Rogers said that the pay raise plan had been brewing for over five years. But Katie Giede, who works at the Conyers location with Smith, said she doesn’t believe the increases would’ve come about without people speaking up, demanding more from the company and making headlines. “It definitely makes us see that organizing gets things done,” said Giede, 32. “We have been fighting and we have been delivering demand letters and going on strike and working hard to see some changes. And this is a step in the right direction.” “The raises come at a time when some Waffle House workers have been outspoken about their struggles to cover basic expenses on such low pay.” Giede and Smith have been urging Waffle House to drop its mandatory meal deductions . The company takes at least $3 out of workers’ pay for on-shift meals whether they eat them or not. The Union of Southern Service Workers, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, recently asked the U.S. Labor Department to investigate the practice, saying many workers don’t have the time or desire to eat meals they are paying for. Rogers felt compelled to defend the deductions in a separate video, arguing that they provide a good value for the money and that most workers like the policy. “They’re feeling the pressure; we’re just going to keep applying it,” Giede said. Many restaurants have had to increase wages just to hang on to workers since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Eating out in general has gotten more expensive for diners following a period of high inflation, though Waffle House is still known as a cheap bite. At the Conyers restaurant, two eggs with toast and hash browns cost $6.25, while a quarter-pound burger (without fries) runs the same. Rogers warned employees that diners’ expectations will change with higher prices. “You better believe our customers are going to expect more when they pay more,” he said."

    "article_content": "Labor Reporter, HuffPost Officials at the National Labor Relations Board have ordered a group of Las Vegas casinos to bargain with a union even though the union lost its election, finding that the company’s illegal behavior spoiled the vote. The decision against Station Casinos marks the first time the labor board has issued what’s known as a Cemex order, so named for a landmark case it ruled on last year. The new process makes it more likely that employers who break the law during an organizing campaign will be required to recognize the union regardless of the election’s outcome. In this case, the board found Station Casinos had committed “extensive coercive and unlawful misconduct,” part of a “carefully crafted corporate strategy intentionally designed at every step to interfere with employees’ free choice” to choose a union or not. Workers at three Station hotel-casinos ― Red Rock, Boulder Station and Palace Station ― voted 627 to 534 against joining the Culinary Workers Union in 2019. But the board, which referees private-sector labor disputes, found that the company broke the law several times by making threats, punishing union supporters and promising new benefits so that employees would reject the union. “The new process makes it more likely that employers who break the law during an organizing campaign will be required to recognize the union regardless of the election’s outcome.” Managers committed “serious pervasive unlawful misconduct” well before employees filed for a union election, and continued such misconduct at least six months after the vote had concluded, the board found. In the most colorful example, two days before the vote Station served workers hundreds of free steaks that had been branded with the words, “VOTE NO!” The board members found the company did this because food quality had become a “top employee concern,” and it wanted to show that the food would improve if the casinos stayed non-union. Employees had dined on steaks at the free employee buffet before, but only on special occasions like a casino anniversary, according to case testimony. And the steaks had never been branded. They also ordered Station Casinos to remove photos of workers from an anti-union website the company created, and to reinstate, with backpay, a union supporter who had been fired. Station Casinos can appeal the decision to federal court and challenge the order to bargain with the union. The company said in a statement that it’s reviewing the decision. “We continue to believe that the 2019 election result in favor of Red Rock and rejecting the Culinary Union was a fair outcome that reflected the wishes of a majority of the Red Rock Team Members then and reflects it now,” the company said. Under the Cemex standard, when workers demonstrate they have clear majority support for a union, the company can either voluntarily recognize the union or ask the NLRB to conduct an election to determine if it’s what workers really want. But if the company goes on to break the law in a way that warrants throwing the election results out, the board can order the company to start bargaining with the union even if the union lost the vote. In that case, a “rerun” election would not be held. The board has said it hopes this process would discourage employers from breaking the law in the first place, since by trying to suppress a union with unfair labor practices, they run the risk of having to negotiate with the union anyway. As a former board member told HuffPost last year, the Cemex standard is a “BFD” because it should lead to “ less union-busting .” The Culinary Workers Union has been battling Station Casinos for years. Known as a kingmaker in Nevada politics, the powerful local union represents casino and hotel workers throughout the Vegas Strip and downtown. Station Casinos, owned by the wealthy brothers Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, has been one of a few notable non-union holdouts. The union’s secretary-treasurer, Ted Pappageorge, said in a statement that the decision “affirms what we have been saying for years.” “Station Casinos needs to stop breaking the law and treat its workers with respect,” Pappageorge said. “This company is an outlier in the Nevada gaming industry and it will be held accountable by the federal government.” This story has been updated with comment from Station Casinos and the Culinary Workers Union."

    "article_content": "Labor Reporter, HuffPost California’s labor commissioner has fined Amazon $5.9 million for allegedly violating the state’s new warehouse safety law . Officials announced Tuesday that they had issued citations to the online retail giant for failing to disclose productivity quotas to employees at two distribution centers in Southern California. Under a law enacted in 2021, employers who operate warehouses in the state must tell workers in writing the number of tasks they’re expected to perform in an hour, as well as how they might be punished if they fail to do so. The law is meant to prevent injuries or unfair discipline. Amazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel said in an emailed statement that the company disputes the allegations and has already appealed the fines. “The truth is, we don’t have fixed quotas,” Lynch Vogel said. “At Amazon, individual performance is evaluated over a long period of time, in relation to how the entire site’s team is performing.” She added, “Employees can — and are encouraged to — review their performance whenever they wish.” For years, Amazon has faced criticism for the work pace in its logistics operation, where workers pick, pack and ship items that go out to customers. Labor groups and Democrats supported the passage of California’s warehouse safety law, which New York later mimicked with a version of its own. California Labor Commissioner Lilia García-Brower said Amazon had claimed it complied with the law because it used a “peer-to-peer evaluation system” rather than firm production quotas across the workforce. But García-Brower said the Amazon system still violates the law. “The peer-to-peer system that Amazon was using in these two warehouses is exactly the kind of system that the Warehouse Quotas law was put in place to prevent,” she said. She added that failing to disclose quotas can lead to higher injury rates and force workers to skip breaks they’re legally entitled to. Officials began their investigation of the warehouses in September 2022, eventually documenting what they said to be 59,017 violations in a nearly five-month period. The warehouse safety law allows for a $100 penalty for each violation, amounting to nearly $6 million. The California Labor Commissioner’s Office said it was assisted in its investigation by the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, a non-union group that advocates for warehouse employees in California’s Inland Empire, one of the nation’s largest logistics hubs. Mindy Acevedo, a staff attorney for the group, credited “courageous workers” for “sounding the alarm.” “We heard from workers that not only were they required to work at an unsafe pace, there was little transparency around work expectations,” Acevedo said in a statement."

    "article_content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Snapchat Inc. will pay $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by California’s civil rights agency that claimed the company discriminated against female employees, failed to prevent workplace sexual harassment and retaliated against women who complained. The settlement with Snapchat Inc., which owns the popular disappearing-message app by the same name, covers women who worked for the company in California between 2014 and 2024, the California Civil Rights Department announced Wednesday. The settlement is subject to court approval. The agreement resolves a more than three-year investigation over claims that the Santa Monica, California-based company discriminated against female employees when it came to pay and promotions, the department said in a statement. The bulk of the settlement money will go to employees who faced discrimination at Snapchat Inc., California officials said. “In California, we’re proud of the work of our state’s innovators who are a driving force of our nation’s economy,” said Kevin Kish, director of California’s civil rights agency. “This settlement with Snapchat demonstrates a shared commitment to a California where all workers have a fair chance at the American Dream. Women are entitled to equality in every job, in every workplace, and in every industry.” Snapchat Inc. said it disagrees with the agency’s claims but that it decided to settle to avoid costly and lengthy litigation. “We care deeply about our commitment to maintain a fair and inclusive environment at Snap, and do not believe we have any ongoing systemic pay equity, discrimination, harassment, or retaliation issues against women,” the company said in a statement. Snapchat Inc. grew from 250 employees in 2015 to over 5,000 in 2022. But the growth didn’t translate to advancement for female employees who “were told to wait their turn, were actively discouraged from applying for promotions, or lost promotion opportunities to less qualified male colleagues,” California officials said. In particular, women in engineering roles, which account for about 70% of Snap’s workforce, found barriers when trying to advance from entry-level positions, according to the complaint. California’s civil rights agency also said in its lawsuit that women were sexually harassed and that when they spoke up, they faced retaliation that included negative performance reviews and termination. Male managers routinely promoted male employees over more qualified women, the agency said. “Women were told, both implicitly and explicitly, that they were second-class citizens at Snap,” the agency said in its lawsuit. The settlement will require the company to hire an independent consultant to evaluate its compensation and promotion policies and retain an outside auditor of its sexual harassment, retaliation, and discrimination compliance. The company will also have to train its staff on preventing discrimination, retaliation and sexual harassment in the workplace, officials said. Snapchat Inc. also agreed to provide information to all employees about their right to report harassment or discrimination without fear of retaliation."

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Celine Dion gave a teary yet triumphant speech this week at the premiere of her new documentary, and made her first red carpet appearance since she was diagnosed with a rare neurological condition that has affected her livelihood and ability to perform shows. The five-time Grammy winner became visibly emotional after she was greeted with a standing ovation at New York’s Lincoln Center on Monday to introduce “ I Am: Celine Dion .” Directed by Irene Taylor and due out on Amazon Prime Video next week, the film offers an in-depth look at the pop superstar’s experience with stiff-person syndrome, or SPS. In her remarks, Dion praised Taylor’s work and credited her neurologist, Dr. Amanda Piquet, for having “replaced my fear with hope.” She also referenced a memorable scene from the film in which she likens herself to a tree unable to bear as many apples as it once did. “I don’t want you to wait in line anymore if I don’t have any shiny apples for you,” she explained. “A couple of days ago, I saw a message from a fan, and it said: ‘We’re not here for the apples. We’re here for the tree.’” Celine Dion tears up during the introduction to her documentary \"I Am: Celine Dion\" and says, \"I hope to see you all again very, very soon.\" pic.twitter.com/qxYp2UcOeZ “I cannot believe how fortunate I am to have my fans in my life,” Dion said. “Thank you to all of you, from the bottom of my heart, for being part of my journey. This movie is my love letter to each of you.” Dion went public with her SPS diagnosis in December 2022, noting at the time that the condition had significantly affected her personal and professional life. Since then, she’s been mostly absent from the spotlight and on social media. In February, however, she made a surprise appearance at the 2024 Grammys to present the Album of the Year award to Taylor Swift . Early reviews of “I Am: Celine Dion” have been positive . The Hollywood Reporter called it “the rare celebrity doc that fulfills its promise of intimacy.” In an interview with Variety , Taylor said she had “no agenda” while collaborating with Dion on the film. “Every day that I came, I just wanted to meet her where she was at that day,” she said. “There were a couple of days, we thought we would film, and we didn’t because [Dion] just didn’t feel up for it,” Taylor told Variety. “So every day was different ... Sometimes filming made her feel better.” In interviews ahead of the release of “I Am: Celine Dion,” Dion has pledged to return to the concert stage , but has steered clear of giving a time frame in which that might be possible. At Monday’s screening, she said she hoped to see her fans again “very, very soon.” Earlier on the red carpet, she seemingly alluded to plans for a future Las Vegas residency, but gave no further details.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Several of the 28 people who were left dangling upside down for more than 20 minutes when a thrill ride at Oregon’s Oaks Amusement Park malfunctioned are opening up about their experience. In an interview with People published Tuesday, Jordan Harding said she and her boyfriend, Daniel Allen, feel “lucky to be alive” after being rescued off the AtmosFEAR ride by emergency crews last week. “After about 15 seconds of being upside down, I realized we were stuck,” Harding, 18, told the publication. “I thought we were going to die there. My boyfriend was scared too.” Watch a report on the Oaks Amusement Park incident from Fox affiliate KPTV below. “I remember thinking that I was going to die like that and miss out on so many major things that I had hoped to experience,” she added. Many of the AtmosFEAR’s riders were younger than she was, she said, due to an eighth-grade celebration taking place at the park that day. Another rider, Hazen Hathorne, told KPTV he heard “screaming, crying, pleas for help” while aboard the stalled AtmosFEAR. “Gravity was pulling me down, but the seat was keeping me in,” he said. “So everything was pressuring me against the harness that was coming over me.” Blood vessels broke in his face while he was upside down, he said, leaving his cheeks with red freckle-like dots. Portland fire crews arrived at Oaks Amusement Park at around 3:20 p.m. Friday after the AtmosFEAR stalled at what’s been described as its “apex position,” with 28 riders stranded upside-down about 50 feet in the air. Park officials said the ride was returned safely to the ground minutes later, and that none of the riders sustained significant injuries. Billed by Oaks Amusement Park as a “showstopping extreme attraction,” the AtmosFEAR swings like a pendulum before twirling riders completely upside-down. Other versions of the ride, which opened at Oaks in 2021, can be found at other theme parks and traveling fairs across the U.S. As of Tuesday afternoon, Oaks Amusement Park’s website listed the AtmosFEAR as being closed indefinitely, while a park spokesperson told People that an investigation into the incident was “in its beginning stages.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost As Justin Timberlake weathers the ramifications of his Tuesday arrest on suspicion of driving while intoxicated, he’s found a vocal ally in Gayle King. On Wednesday’s episode of “CBS Mornings,” King came to Timberlake’s defense, calling the pop star a “really, really great guy” who happened to make a bad decision. “This is clearly a mistake,” she said. “I bet nobody knows it more than he.” Though the broadcast journalist acknowledged there’s “never any excuse” for driving while intoxicated, she noted that Timberlake was “not an irresponsible person.” “He’s not reckless, he’s not careless,” she said. “Clearly, this is not a good thing. He knows that.” Watch King discuss Timberlake’s arrest on “CBS Mornings” below. Timberlake was taken into custody just before 1 a.m. Tuesday in Sag Harbor, a village in Long Island, New York, after an officer allegedly saw his BMW SUV run a stop sign and he failed to stay in his lane. According to a statement issued by the Sag Harbor Police Department after the arrest, the officer determined Timberlake was “operating his vehicle in an intoxicated condition” after a traffic stop. In court records obtained by CNN , the officer said Timberlake had “bloodshot and glassy” eyes and a “strong odor of an alcoholic beverage” coming from his breath at the time of his arrest. Attorney Edward Burke Jr., who is representing Timberlake, told HuffPost in a statement that he plans on “vigorously defending” the artist, adding, “[Timberlake] will have a lot to say at the appropriate time.” News of Timberlake’s arrest comes amid a professional crossroads for the singer, who is currently on a world tour. “Everything I Thought It Was,” his first album in six years, was released in March to tepid reviews . Timberlake’s public image has taken a wider hit , too, as the media has reckoned with its unfair treatment of his ex-girlfriend, Britney Spears , following their breakup in 2002, and Janet Jackson , who faced the brunt of criticism that came after her controversial wardrobe malfunction during her and Timberlake’s 2004 Super Bowl halftime show.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Keiko Agena has mixed feelings about her “ Gilmore Girls ” legacy. From 2000 to 2007, Agena ― who is of Japanese descent ― endeared herself to a generation of viewers as Lane Kim, the best friend of Alexis Bledel’s Rory Gilmore, on the beloved comedy-drama series. Appearing on the “Dear Felicity” podcast this week to reflect on the experience, the actor acknowledged that playing the role was a “survival mode situation” ― though she’s grateful to have had the chance to bring some much-needed Asian representation to the small screen. “For myself, it was such a survival mode situation, and I didn’t kind of think of it that way at the time,” she said. At the time of her “Gilmore Girls” casting, Agena was 27, more than a decade older than her 16-year-old character. The Hawaiian-born actor also said she doesn’t think she’d be considered for the role of Kim, who was Korean American, if “Gilmore Girls” were being produced in 2024. “The best thing is to have a Korean American writer [and a] Korean American actor,” she said. “I don’t think that that role, cast that way, would happen today. But at that time, in 2000, it was such a different time that I definitely know I wouldn’t have said no or pulled myself out of that situation at that time.” Still, Agena said, she appreciates the love “Gilmore Girls” fans have for Lane “because I love her, too.” “When I meet someone who knows ‘Gilmore Girls’ or who loves Lane, it’s like, I recognize that love,” she added. “I see that you love that person.” “I think what [the character] was for people was different than what it was for me,” she explained. “So, in a weird way, I feel like I want to honor the experience that people had from the show, and what it meant to them, especially young Asian people, because I get that comment a lot ― about what it was like for them to see someone like that onscreen.” Since “Gilmore Girls” went off the air in 2007, Agena has gone on to appear on “Private Practice” and “Scandal.” From 2017 to 2018, she had a recurring role as Pam Bradley on Netflix ’s “ 13 Reasons Why ,” and a year later, returned to network television as Dr. Edrisa Tanaka on Fox’s “ Prodigal Son .” Listen to Keiko Agena’s ‘Dear Felicity’ interview below.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik on Thursday said new Washington Post CEO Will Lewis offered to give him an exclusive interview on his future plans for the paper in exchange for killing a story detailing allegations about the executive’s involvement in a British hacking scandal . In a piece published on the NPR website , Folkenflik alleged Lewis “repeatedly — and heatedly” pushed him to accept the offer, which he said was also confirmed by one of Lewis’ spokespeople. “At that time, the same spokesperson, who works directly for Lewis from the U.K. and has advised him since his days at the Wall Street Journal, confirmed to me that an explicit offer was on the table: drop the story, get the interview,” Folkenflik wrote. Folkenflik said he turned down the offer and published his story. In an email to a reporter at the Post , Lewis blasted Folkenflik, saying he is “an activist, not a journalist.” “I had an off the record conversation with him before I joined you at The Post and some six months later he has dusted it down, and made up some excuse to make a story of a non-story,” Lewis wrote. Folkenflik told the Post the off-the-record chat did not cover “his efforts to induce me to kill my story.” Lewis, who joined Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp in 2010, was later appointed to join a committee that would oversee the wider company’s response to a scandal involving their News of the World tabloid, over allegedly hacked the voicemails and emails of celebrities, politicians and royal family members. Lewis is now accused of approving the deletion of emails even after they had been ordered to retain records by local authorities, according to lawyers for Prince Harry and other plaintiffs in ongoing legal actions against Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers. A judge in May allowed for Lewis’ name to be added to a list of executives who were allegedly involved in a scheme to conceal evidence. He has denied wrongdoing. In another interview with The New York Times , Folkenflik said he chose to share his story now because he “thought the audacity of the offer was notable.” “And given what’s playing out right now at The Post, I thought it was worth noting in public,” he added. Folkenflik’s account follows other allegations, first reported by The New York Times , that former Post executive editor Sally Buzbee, who left the role abruptly Sunday, had clashed with Lewis over her plans for the newsroom to cover the judge’s May ruling. Lewis, according to the report, told Buzbee the ruling didn’t merit coverage, but Buzbee insisted she would run the story. The judge allowed Lewis to be named in the lawsuit, and the Post released a story on the development on May 21. Lewis did not interfere with the article’s publication. Lewis blasted the report as “inaccurate.” “I know how this works, I know the right thing to do, and what not to do. I know where the lines are, and I respect them,” he wrote in en email to a Post journalist. “The Executive Editor is free to publish when, how, and what they want to. I am fully signed up to that.” Lewis was announced as the next CEO of the Post in November, and assumed his responsibilities in early January. Lewis has pledged to make changes at the Post to better position it for the future after telling employees in a recent town hall the company shed $70 million in 2023 and has lost much of its audience.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost WNBA star Caitlin Clark on Sunday shared her reaction to being left off the women’s national team set to compete in the Olympic Games in Paris later this summer. Clark, 22, told reporters that USA Basketball called to inform her of their decision, and she offered the team her best wishes in the competition. “I know it’s the most competitive team in the world and I know it could have gone either way,” she said. “I’m excited for them. I’m going to be rooting them on to win gold. I was a kid that grew up watching the Olympics. It will be fun to watch them.” Asked if she was upset to hear the decision, the Indiana Fever guard replied: “Honestly, no disappointment.” “I think it just gives you something to work for. You know, that’s a dream. Hopefully one day I can be there,” she said. “Hopefully in four years, when four years comes back around, I can be there.” USA Basketball has not officially announced the team roster and has so far made no comment on the decision to leave Clark off the national team. In response to a question about whether she would be willing to step in to help the team if one of the players selected got injured, Clark said it would be a “great opportunity” as she has a good relationship with USA Basketball, but noted her current priority is the Indiana Fever. “The 12 they have selected are really great players so I think they’re in pretty good hands,” Clark added. The head coach of the Fever, Christie Sides, told reporters Clark was on the team’s bus when she found out she didn’t make the cut and texted her to let her know. “The thing she said was, ‘Hey, coach, they woke a monster,’” Sides recalled. Sides added that Clark is “one of the most competitive people” she knows and that this will only motivate her to keep improving. “She’s a worker and that’s what she’s going to do,” Sides said. “This just gave her another opportunity to get in the gym and do more work.” The decision to leave Clark off the team was met with mixed reactions in the sports world. USA Today’s Christine Brennan reported that two U.S. basketball veterans attributed the call in part to concern among the team’s ranks about how Clark’s fan base would react to the limited playing time she would be likely to get in the competition. The 12 players that will be representing the U.S. in Paris for the women’s basketball team, according to sources cited by The Athletic , are: A’ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart, Diana Taurasi, Brittney Griner, Alyssa Thomas, Napheesa Collier, Jewell Loyd, Kelsey Plum, Jackie Young, Sabrina Ionescu, Chelsea Gray and Kahleah Copper. Clark was named the WNBA Rookie of the Month for May. The women’s basketball team has won gold in the past seven Olympic Games and is expected to do so again this year.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Vice President Kamala Harris is sharing her opinion on former President Donald Trump ’s potential running mates less than five months out of the U.S. presidential election. Trump’s campaign has reportedly sent VP vetting materials to three Republicans : Sens. J.D. Vance (Ohio), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Gov. Doug Burgum (N.D.). The former president’s team has also requested documents from Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.), Reps. Byron Donalds (Fla.), Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. In an interview with Politico Playbook over the weekend, Harris targeted Trump’s potential running mates over their position on abortion, which has proven to be a winning issue for Democrats , noting that some of the Republicans on his list went as far as voting against a Senate bill codifying Americans’ right to contraception last week . “Everyone on that list has supported a Trump abortion ban in their state or has called for a national ban,” she said. It’s clear “Trump wants an enabler,” Harris added. “He doesn’t want a governing partner. He doesn’t want another Mike Pence, and I think that is clear,” Harris said. “The litmus test is, are they going to be absolutely loyal to Trump over country or their oath of office, or, frankly, the American people?” Trump repeatedly attacked his vice president, Pence, over his refusal to overturn the 2020 election results to reverse his defeat. Pence launched his own presidential run last year but dropped out after his candidacy failed to get traction. Harris also singled out Donalds, representative of Florida’s 19th Congressional District, over his recent comments claiming Black American families were “together” during the era of legal segregation known as Jim Crow. “It’s sadly yet another example of somebody out of Florida trying to erase or rewrite our true history,” she said. Trump has previously signaled that he will likely announce his decision at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next month. Harris has accepted an invitation by CBS News to debate Trump’s potential running mate on either July 23 or Aug. 13. “I’m ready to make the case — whoever he picks, no matter who it is,” Harris told Playbook. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R), previously considered by Trump for the vice president spot but who appears to have fallen off his team’s graces following the publication of her dog killing story in her latest book, encouraged the former president to select a woman. Noem told CNN’s “State of the Union”: “All the polls tell him in the swing states that a woman on the ticket helps him win.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Billionaire Elon Musk on Monday threatened to ban Apple devices for employees at any of his companies over a newly announced partnership between the tech giant and OpenAI, which will involve the integration of the powerful ChatGPT artificial intelligence chatbot into Apple’s operating systems later this year. “Apple shares our commitment to safety and innovation, and this partnership aligns with OpenAI’s mission to make advanced AI accessible to everyone,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. “Together with Apple, we’re making it easier for people to benefit from what AI can offer.” Musk, one of the co-founders of OpenAI who has recently turned into one of the company’s harshest critics, does not appear to share Altman’s enthusiasm as he slammed the collaboration in a series of posts on his X platform, formerly Twitter. “If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies,” he wrote. “That is an unacceptable security violation.” If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation. In a follow-up post , Musk added that any people visiting his companies will be required “to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage,” which blocks electromagnetic fields. He also replied to a post by Apple CEO Tim Cook, calling on him to “stop this creepy spyware.” Apple did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. The Cupertino-based company announced the new partnership at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, where it introduced “Apple Intelligence,” a new personal intelligence system that puts generative models at the core of iPhone, iPads and Macs. Craig Federighi, senior vice president for software engineering at Apple, said user privacy remains a top priority for the company. “The cornerstone of the personal intelligence system is on-device processing,” Federighi said. “It’s aware of your personal data without collecting your personal data,” he continued. As part of Apple Intelligence, users will have access to ChatGPT, through Siri and systemwide Writing Tools, for free and without having to create an account. Federighi noted that users will be in control over whether ChatGPT is used on their devices and will be asked before any of their information is shared. Besides, their IP addresses will be obscured and any requests won’t be stored by OpenAI. But Musk appeared skeptical of how Apple would be able to maintain its commitment to privacy through this partnership. “Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI,” he wrote in another post. “They’re selling you down the river.” Musk sued OpenAI and Altman in late February, claiming OpenAI has gone back on its original mission of benefiting humanity over its ties to Microsoft. “Under its new Board, it is not just developing but is actually refining an [artificial general intelligence] to maximize profits for Microsoft, rather than for the benefit of humanity,” the lawsuit states. Notably, Musk in November launched a competitor to ChatGPT dubbed Grok through his xAI startup. Grok is available to those who have registered for an X premium subscription. Apart from X and xAI, Musk also owns Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company."

    "article_content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Nigel Farage ’s right-wing populist Reform UK party has overtaken the governing Conservative Party in the run-up to the July 4 general election, according to a new poll released on Thursday in more bad news for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The YouGov survey conducted from June 12 to 13 on a sample of 2,211 adults projects that the Labour Party will win 37% of the vote, followed by Reform UK at 19%, which is one point ahead of the Conservatives. Farage, an ally of former President Donald Trump , had previously said he didn’t intend to run in next month’s election so he could focus on the U.S. presidential race. But he changed his mind in early June. This marks the first poll in which Farage’s party has finished ahead of the Tories, who have been in power for 14 years. The polling company, however, noted that the result is within the margin of error. “Given these considerations, it may be more fair to say at this point in time - given the results of the last few polls - that Reform UK are neck and neck with the Conservatives,” YouGov said. The Conservatives have struggled in the election campaign after Sunak made several blunders, including the highly controversial decision to leave D-Day celebrations in Normandy early to return to the U.K. to sit down for an ITV interview. Sunak, who, according to YouGov has a net approval rating of -51, apologized for the mistake. Sunak said Friday that he will continue fighting to earn the support of the British public for the remainder of the campaign. He warned that if the poll results hold on Election Day, it would be the equivalent of handing the Labour Party a “blank check.” “Ultimately a vote for anyone who is not a Conservative candidate makes it more likely that [Labour Party leader] Keir Starmer is in No. 10,” Sunak told reporters, referring to the prime minister’s offices at 10 Downing Street. Polling expert John Curtice said that while this is just one poll, it lays out a major area of concern for Sunak. In the last U.K. general election, the Brexit Party, the predecessor of Reform UK, did not put up candidates in constituencies held by the Conservatives. “This time, Reform are standing virtually everywhere in England, Scotland and Wales,” Curtice wrote for the BBC . “This means Reform is likely to take most votes away from the Conservatives in seats that Rishi Sunak’s party is trying to defend.” The Conservatives, led by Boris Johnson at the time, won 43.6% of the vote in the 2019 general election. Johnson was forced to resign in July 2022 due to public anger for flouting COVID rules and allegations of misconduct. Despite the momentum Farage’s party is showing, the U.K.’s first-past-the-post system means Reform UK could end up not winning any seats. Still, the poll has emboldened Farage, who told reporters in a Friday press conference the July 4 race is the party’s “first step towards building for 2029.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday called snap parliamentary elections following a disappointing result for his centrist pro-E.U. alliance in the European elections. Many were surprised by the announcement, given that the elections were called three years early and immediately ahead of France hosting the Olympics in Paris later this summer. Macron, who takes pride in his image as a disruptor, reportedly did not even give Prime Minister Gabriel Attal advance notice of his plan. The upcoming race is scheduled to take place incredibly fast. The first round of voting is set for June 30, followed by a second round on July 7. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right party National Rally, has managed to largely normalize the group’s image and expand its base as French voters appear disenfranchised with Macron, who, as of May 31, had an approval rating of just 34%, according to Politico Europe . “To be French, at heart, is about choosing to write history, not being driven by it,” Macron said Sunday. However, he has no allies left willing to work with him to avoid a potential National Rally win and prevent the appointment of a far-right prime minister in the country for the first time since the end of World War II. Macron has said he has no plans to step down irrespective of the result, but concern remains about what sharing power with an extreme right-wing prime minister would mean for France. Some even warn that this vote could spell Macron’s Brexit moment. “It could absolutely result in a major crisis for France’s institutions, its role in Europe,” said Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director of Eurasia Group’s analysis and advisory work on Europe. This makes Macron’s gambit all the more risky given the backdrop of the November U.S. presidential election, in which former President Donald Trump is a major candidate. Le Pen welcomed Macron’s announcement, previewing what a parliament led by her party would prioritize. “We’re ready to turn the country around, ready to defend the interests of the French, ready to put an end to mass immigration, ready to make the purchasing power of the French a priority,” she said. A good result for the party would also embolden Le Pen ahead of a likely 2027 presidential bid. (Macron won’t be able to run due to term limits.) “If she were to win the presidency in 2027 with her current policies, it really would be alarming: she is pro-Russia, against heavily arming Ukraine, and deeply skeptical of the EU even if she no longer says that she wants France to leave it,” the Economist writes . Macron seemed to benefit from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, followed by Trump’s 2016 win. French voters in 2017 appeared spooked to insert even more uncertainty into the world by putting a far-right leader in power. But many fear Macron’s decision to send the French to the polls now could become France’s Brexit moment . In 2016, then-U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron announced a referendum on the country’s E.U. membership, which he was confident he would win, to stare down the Brexiteers in the party. The result in favor of Brexit still haunts the country, as many Britons now admit they regret their vote . Unlike Cameron, “Macron is not naive; he understands exactly what he has done,” Emile Chabal, professor of contemporary history at the University of Edinburgh, writes in Foreign Policy . “He may, in time, be vindicated. But if he fails, he alone will bear the responsibility for tearing France apart,” Chabal added. There’s reason to suggest Le Pen could be much better positioned to run a successful presidential campaign in three years, even as Macron claims he does not “intend to hand the keys of power to the extreme right in 2027.” Tara Varma, a visiting fellow in the Center of the United States and Europe at Brookings, told HuffPost that many voters are no longer ashamed to proclaim their support for Le Pen, indicating that “this taboo has been broken.” The National Rally, which has tried to “sanitize” its image and appear less extremist, has managed to significantly expand its vote base over the past few years. While the party has come first in the last three European elections, it’s the first time they’ve come this far ahead, getting more than double the vote share Macron’s party secured. “The vote for the National Rally is not just a protest vote anymore,” Varma told HuffPost. Le Pen has also sought to inject new blood into the party. The European election campaign was led by her protégé, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, who could become the country’s next prime minister in the event of a National Rally win. (Current polls predict the National Rally will come first in legislative elections with a vote share of about 30% but won’t secure an absolute majority in parliament.) Sébastien Maillard, a special advisor to the Jacques Delors Institute, said the National Rally has also tried to polish its image, deploying a so-called “tie strategy,” having its candidates dress the part and appear polite and soft-spoken to disguise their far-right ideas. In another effort to become more mainstream, Le Pen has abandoned calls to exit the Eurozone and the European Union even though she continues to spew anti-E.U. propaganda. Besides, following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel, which prompted the ongoing Gaza war, Le Pen was quick to express support for Israel, seizing the opportunity to diffuse concerns about the party’s anti-semitic past. (In 2015, Le Pen expelled her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, from the party he founded, which was then called National Front after he repeated his position that the Holocaust was a “detail of history.”) Despite criticizing both the extreme left and the extreme right during a press conference Wednesday, Macron ultimately urged those who oppose the prospect of a far-right government to band together. “I hope that when the time comes, men and women of goodwill who will have been able to say no to the extremes will come together … will put themselves in a position to build a shared, sincere project that is useful to the country,” he said . But no one seems to share a desire to team up with Macron. France’s four left-wing parties on Thursday announced the creation of an electoral alliance dubbed the Popular Front, pledging to govern jointly if they win the election, a move that the French president reportedly wasn’t expecting when he called the election. Meanwhile, the mainstream right is in turmoil. Éric Ciotti, the president of France’s conservatives, which got just over 7% of the vote in the European elections, expressed his intention to form an alliance with the National Rally, effectively cutting the so-called “cordon sanitaire” that has up to now kept the conservatives distanced from the far-right. The party’s leaders voted to expel him as he pledged to take the fight to the courts. These developments mean Macron, who has for years claimed he built a strong center against the National Rally, has no allies to turn to in this crucial moment, further complicating his party’s path in the upcoming race. Maillard told HuffPost Macron pressed the “political nuclear button” in announcing the early vote, which could have far-reaching consequences, noting, however, that it would have been perhaps equally dangerous to do nothing in the face of a resounding defeat. “By the next presidential election of 2027, he would have seen his political capital devaluated more and more,” Maillard explained. He added that Macron also wanted to get ahead of the National Assembly, potentially voting down his budget in the fall and bringing down his government. Varma said, ultimately, the shock decision is consistent with Macron’s instinct for upending French politics. Macron has disrupted France’s political scene since he first came into power by winning the 2017 presidential election and also securing an absolute majority for his party in parliament that same year in a surprising result. Varma added that while Macron has succeeded in some gambles he’s taken during his time in office, things are not looking up for him this time. “In this case, he’s betting with the future of the French people, which is, I think, a fundamentally different bet,” Varma told HuffPost. In calling the far-right’s bluff by triggering legislative elections, Macron is betting that if, as polls predict, the National Rally comes first and he is forced to nominate a far-right prime minister, that would expose them for what they are and make the outcome of a 2027 Le Pen presidency less likely. But his gambit could backfire. “There’s a chance that they may figure out a formula that enables them to govern and they further normalize and legitimize themselves and build and expand their voter base, in which case, Le Pen could do very well in 2027,” Rahman told HuffPost. The timing of a potential rightward turn for France comes at a pivotal moment for Europe. “What we’re going to see is a weakened Macron, which I don’t think is going to help either France or Europe, to be honest,” Varma said. U.S. President Joe Biden ’s team anxiously watched the 2022 French presidential election, fearing that a Le Pen victory could destabilize Europe and disrupt the united front he built to support Ukraine against Russia. “There’s a domino effect in the rest of Europe if France falls” to the far-right, Varma explains. The White House is expected to watch the results of this parliamentary vote equally closely and evaluate what they mean for Europe and the U.S. as they prepare to take on Trump in November, the presumptive Republican nominee who has promised to take extreme measures, including cutting funding for allies abroad. Biden could also draw lessons from how the French people respond to Macron’s message urging the public to stand for democracy, which mirrors the case he has made to Americans against supporting Trump. While Macron would still remain in charge of foreign policy as president, a National Rally prime minister could appoint a foreign minister with a pro-Kremlin agenda. “We could really see France’s foreign policy going a fundamentally different direction, of course, much less support for multilateralism, much less support for international organizations, a true willingness to undermine the E.U. from the inside,” Varma told HuffPost. “And I think all of this, of course, wouldn’t be in the U.S. interest.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost The White House on Tuesday responded to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s allegations that the Biden administration has been withholding weapons and ammunition from his country over the past few months. “We genuinely do not know what he’s talking about,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters . “We just don’t.” In a 49-second video posted on X, formerly Twitter, Netanyahu said he’d recently had a “candid conversation” with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, thanking him for the support the U.S. has given Israel but also airing an apparent grievance. “It’s inconceivable that in the past few months, the administration has been withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel,” Netanyahu said he told Blinken. “Israel ― America’s closest ally fighting for its life, fighting against Iran and our other common enemies.” Netanyahu said Blinken provided him assurances that the Biden administration is committed to removing the “bottlenecks.” “I certainly hope that’s the case,” Netanyahu said. “It should be the case. During World War II, [U.K. Prime Minister Winston] Churchill told the United States, ‘Give us the tools, we’ll do the job.’ And I say, give us the tools and we’ll finish the job a lot faster.” Give us the tools and we'll finish the job. pic.twitter.com/eQHpyd9q0X During a joint press conference Tuesday with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, Blinken refused to confirm whether Netanyahu was telling the truth about their alleged conversation. “I’m not going to talk about what we said in diplomatic conversations,” Blinken said. He did, however, note that President Joe Biden remains committed to providing Israel with “what it needs to defend itself against a whole variety of threats.” “A big part of that, as well, is making sure that in providing that assistance to Israel, it has a strong deterrent, which is the best way to avoid more conflict, to avoid more war, to avoid what we’re already seeing in Gaza spreading other areas, to other fronts,” Blinken said. “That’s been one of our objectives from day one.” Blinken said the only shipment that remains under review pertains to 2,000-pound bombs due to the administration’s “concerns about their use in a densely populated area like Rafah” in southern Gaza. “But everything else is moving as it normally would move,” he said. Jean-Pierre echoed Blinken, telling reporters that besides that particular shipment of munitions, “there are no other pauses.” Netanyahu is expected to address a joint session of the U.S. Congress next month. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Democratic Reps. Jim Clyburn (S.C.) and Ro Khanna (Calif.), have said they plan to boycott his speech. The Israeli prime minister, earlier this week, dissolved his war Cabinet following the departure of centrist opposition leader Benny Gantz, who resigned over disagreements with the Gaza war strategy. The move means a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is unlikely to happen, as Netanyahu will now be relying on his security Cabinet, which is made up of more hard-line figures. Meanwhile, a new report presented to the United Nations’ Human Rights Council concluded that Israeli forces have carried out a campaign of “extermination” against Palestinian civilians that has killed more than 37,000 Gazans, according to local officials. The ongoing conflict was prompted by the attack of Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis and took about 250 people hostage.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Conservatives in the U.K. are projected to get wiped out in next month’s general election. The party of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, which has led the country for more than a decade, is faced with a historic defeat, as voters have grown frustrated by the state of public services and by political scandals that have plagued the Tories in recent years, among other things. While the center-left Labour Party is on track to win a huge majority, everyone seems to be focused on the Conservatives. “We’re so used to thinking about elections in terms of who’s going to win, but this one, it’s much more about actually the state of the loss and who is going to be in opposition,” Louise Thompson, a senior lecturer in politics at The University of Manchester, told HuffPost. Bad news has been piling up for Sunak. On July 4, he could become the first sitting prime minister to ever lose their seat in a general election, while his party may not even win enough seats to become the official opposition, according to a recent poll conducted by market research company Savanta for The Daily Telegraph , which forecasts the centrist Liberal Democrats winning just three fewer seats than the Tories. The findings illustrate “the risk of electoral extinction that the Conservative Party is now having to contemplate,” Savanta’s political research director wrote in an op-ed . 🚨NEW Savanta MRP for @Telegraph 📈Lab projected for 382 majority 📉Cons fighting with LDs to be Official Opposition Seat forecast 🌹Lab 516 (+316) 🌳Con 53 (-319) 🔶LD 50 (+42) 🎗️SNP 8 (-40) 🌼PC 4 (+2) ⬜️Other 0 (-1) 17,812 UK adults, changes to last GE notional results pic.twitter.com/JNfSE82XQr Meanwhile, a YouGov poll released last week showed Reform UK — the populist right party of Nigel Farage, who’s an ally of former President Donald Trump — overtaking the Conservatives for the first time, spreading even more alarm in Tory circles. “No other poll reported the same finding, though every poll has reported a fall in Conservative support and nearly all a narrowing of the Conservative lead over Reform,” polling expert John Curtice noted on the BBC . “Standing at just 20%, Conservative support is now at its lowest ever in British polling history,” Curtice added. The current projections indicate a stunning reversal of the electoral map following the 2019 general election , in which the Conservatives won nearly 44% of the vote under Boris Johnson and Labour came in second with just over 32%. At the time, the Brexit Party — Reform’s predecessor, which didn’t run candidates in constituencies held by the conservatives — c ame in sixth and didn’t win any seats. Robert Johns, a professor of politics at the University of Southampton, told HuffPost it’s not surprising that the Conservatives have become unpopular after 14 years in power, noting that in theory their party should have faced similar struggles in 2019. However, the framing of that year’s race as the “Brexit election” — in which Johnson promised to deliver on the country’s vote to leave the European Union, effectively making the Tories both the insurgents as well as the mainstream conservative option compared with Labour — gave the party a brief respite. “It was like normal politics suddenly became suspended,” Johns said. “The Conservatives became temporarily the ‘leave’ party, and that was enough to see them through.” This time around, though, it seems like nothing can interrupt the Conservatives’ fall from grace, with the Tories now appearing focused on limiting the scope of a defeat rather than hoping for a win. Sunak’s flaws, highlighted further by his poorly run campaign, have done little to change the trajectory of the race. “Clawing back to what was still a catastrophic defeat in 1997 for the Conservatives [when they lost to Labour by 12.5 percentage points] would now likely be seen as a good result,” Luke Tryl, the U.K. director of research group More in Common, told Times Radio . Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, traced the projected demise of the Tories back to 2010 when a Conservative-led government imposed austerity measures on the country, leaving public services weakened to this day. “Although it seems like a long time ago, what’s essentially happened is that the chickens have come home to roost,” Bale said. “The fundamentals really matter. The fact that public services are falling apart is crucial,” Bale continued. That, coupled with the inability to deliver on Brexit promises around reducing immigration numbers, has contributed to the frustration of voters. Conservatives’ rhetoric on immigration has had the simultaneous effect of inflaming right-wing voters, many of whom have pivoted to Farage’s party, and alienating the moderate liberal voters who are now backing Labour or the Liberal Democrats. In recent years, the Conservatives have also been through back-to-back changes in leadership, which led voters to question their competence to govern. Amid the resignation of Theresa May, Johnson won the Tory leadership race in the mid-2019 ahead of the general election in December, when he secured a landslide victory. Yet in 2022 he was forced to step down as the prime minister and leader of Conservatives, following allegations of misconduct against a top ally and growing public anger about violations of COVID-19 restrictions by his government. Liz Truss, who won the next Tory leadership race amid Johnson’s departure, went on to become the country’s shortest-serving prime minister, after her botched economic plan spooked the markets and caused the value of the pound to tumble, undermining Britain’s reputation for economic competence and leaving her no option but to resign. Enter Sunak, who after nearly two years in office has struggled to turn things around. While things were always going to be difficult for Sunak, his lack of political skill and the perception that he’s out of touch — mixed with a series of campaign blunders, including his decision to depart early from D-Day commemorations in France and travel home for an ITV interview — have worsened his position. “It would have taken a miracle to win this election for a Conservative prime minister, but he’s turned a bad situation into what looks like it could be a disaster,” Bale told HuffPost. Farage, a provocateur and one of the main architects of Brexit, had intended to stay out of U.K. general election and instead focus on the U.S. presidential race to help get Trump back in the White House. But he abandoned this plan after catching wind of the dire state of the Conservatives. In early June, Farage announced that he would run as a candidate in the Clacton constituency and become the leader of Reform UK. “The Conservatives were already on the way out, and he has ensured that the defeat will probably turn into a landslide of what looks at the moment like epic proportions,” Bale said. And Conservatives’ current messaging that a Labour majority is all but certain could backfire, making right-wing voters perceive their choice as “low risk” and pick Reform UK over Sunak’s party, warned Polly Mackenzie, who served as the director of policy for then-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg from 2010 to 2015. “That sense that there’s no jeopardy anymore may encourage people away from the Conservative Party,” Mackenzie said on the “How To Win an Election” podcast . If Farage manages to snag the Clacton seat and get into Parliament, he could end up being invited to join the Conservative Party as part of a potential merger between the Tories and Reform UK, despite the fact that many moderate conservatives would detest the prospect, Bale said. This could potentially lead to Farage becoming Conservative Party leader sometime before a 2029 general election, which would be a stunning turn of events, especially since Farage has so far failed to get elected to the House of Commons seven times. (Farage served in the European Parliament from 1999 until 2020, when the U.K. officially left the European Union.) While Farage has appeared evasive when asked about whether he would join the Conservatives, he said he “absolutely” would vie to be prime minister in 2029. Despite the momentum that Reform UK is experiencing, the country’s first-past-the-post system means it would win just a handful of seats, at best. Still, a scenario in which the Reform UK leader and a few others in his party get elected to British Parliament would be a “Farage honeymoon,” as this would give him outsize influence over the future of the Tories, a senior Conservative source told the BBC’s Chris Mason . Thompson told HuffPost that if Reform manages to win even just one seat, that would give it a “foothold in the House of Commons,” but perhaps even more crucially make it eligible to receive public funding intended for opposition parties. As Thompson explained, that would help it recruit staffers and get a more prominent role in Parliament, as opposed to just being a party on the fringes. Bale said that although Farage has garnered a lot of attention in the campaign, his presence shouldn’t distract from the main message that voters are expected to send in this year’s election, which is that they are fed up with the Conservatives. “If Labour makes a decent fist of being in government, then, you know, whatever happens to Nigel Farage and the Conservative Party probably isn’t going to make very much difference even in 2029,” Bale said. But More in Common’s research shows that while voters across the country are indeed disappointed with the Tories, this sentiment isn’t just limited to the Conservatives, pointing to a “deeper challenge,” Tryl told Times Radio. “It’s not just the usual apathy and cynicism, but something a bit deeper — this sense that after the past few years, people aren’t convinced that any politician of any stripe can make a difference,” Tryl said. Meanwhile, Johns added that some people expect Labour to win a titanic majority in July but worry that the legitimacy of the result could be questioned by antiestablishment figures like Farage, since the left and the right could get a similar amount of electoral support when adding up the vote tally of Conservatives and Reform UK, but the right would get disproportionately fewer seats due to the country’s electoral system. “If he starts questioning an election’s legitimacy in a slightly Trump-like fashion, things might get messier than they ever have before,” Johns told HuffPost.

    "article_content": "Crime fellow A Florida plastic surgeon turned himself in on Monday after authorities said he refused to call 911 while his wife was experiencing a seizure as he operated on her at his office in Pensacola last November. Benjamin Jacob Brown, 41, was booked on suspicion of second-degree felony homicide: manslaughter by culpable negligence in the death of his wife, the Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office announced . Hillary Ellington Brown, 33, died at a local hospital after having a heart attack. On the morning of Nov. 21, 2023, Brown was scheduled to undergo multiple cosmetic procedures at her husband’s business, Restore Plastic Surgery, including a miniature muscle plication/abdominal scar revision and lip injections, according to an administrative complaint filed by the Florida Department of Health and obtained by HuffPost. Staff members at Restore Plastic Surgery detailed the events leading up to Hillary Brown’s seizure in interviews with detectives, according to an unredacted arrest warrant obtained by HuffPost. They said she had ingested a “handful” of pills before her procedure. During the surgery, the anesthesia that Hillary Brown was receiving through IV bags ran out, according to staff members. Benjamin Brown then instructed employees to pour “two containers into a bowl” without diluting the contents and to inject the solution into his wife’s arms and face, the warrant states. Prosecutors identified the undiluted solution in the bowl as Xylocaine, a brand name of the local anesthetic lidocaine. According to the arrest warrant, the medical examiner determined that Hillary Brown died from complications from lidocaine toxicity, and alleged that Benjamin Brown did not document injecting undiluted lidocaine into his wife’s arm. Prosecutors also allege that Benjamin Brown allowed his wife to suture her own skin back together at one point during her surgery. According to witnesses, she “became restless and her feet began twitching,” which worsened as her husband performed liposuction on her arm. By 3:30 p.m., Benjamin Brown began operating on his wife’s face and injected her lips and eyes with what was apparently undiluted lidocaine, according to an employee’s account cited in the arrest warrant. At this point, Hillary Brown allegedly began complaining that she was seeing orange. Once her husband began injections into her right eye, she started to have a seizure, the staff member said. Another staff member told detectives that she was showing signs of overdosing and began “convulsing.” Several employees asked if they should call 911, but said Benjamin Brown told them to wait because he “wanted to try and do it himself,” according to the arrest warrant. One staff member told detectives that they did not have supplies to provide Hillary Brown with additional oxygen or an EKG to monitor her heart rate in the room. Another employee told detectives “there should have been” a crash cart in the room containing supplies and equipment for emergencies and confirmed that the room did not contain any life-saving devices. A medical assistant eventually called 911 between 10 and 20 minutes after Hillary Brown appeared to show signs of a seizure, according to the complaint. Deputies responded, and first responders attempted to save Brown’s life. Brown was taken to the emergency room, where her condition stabilized, but she was later taken to an intensive care unit at a separate hospital, according to the warrant, and never regained consciousness. She died a week later. Marty Ellington, Hillary Brown’s father, told the Pensacola News Journal that he blames his daughter’s death on his son-in-law’s carelessness. “His ego and arrogance overshadowed the need for help, prolonging oxygen deprivation to her brain and ultimately causing her death,” Ellington told the outlet. He said his daughter was unhappy in her marriage and that her husband was more concerned with his finances than her life while she was in the hospital. “Apparently his insurance was canceled on Nov. 30,” Ellington told the outlet. “He sent me a text that we need to make sure that her time of death is before the 30th because the insurance benefits go away and my grandkids wouldn’t get some of the life insurance.” Benjamin Brown’s attorney did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

    "article_content": "Crime fellow The surviving son of convicted murderer Alex Murdaugh has filed a defamation lawsuit against multiple media companies, claiming their true-crime documentaries about his prominent South Carolina family falsely linked him to a teen’s death. Richard “Buster” Murdaugh claims in the lawsuit’s complaint, which was filed Friday and obtained by HuffPost , that Investigation Discovery’s “Murdaugh Murders: Deadly Dynasty,” Max’s “Low Country: The Murdaugh Dynasty” and Netflix ’s “Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal” falsely accused him in the death of Stephen Smith, a 19-year-old gay man who was found dead in 2015. The suit names Warner Bros Discovery and Netflix, as well as the series’ production companies. It also names Gannett, the parent company of the Hampton County Guardian, a local paper that covered the case. The paper’s editor, Michael DeWitt, appeared in the Netflix series and is also a defendant in the lawsuit. The 2021 killings of 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh, Buster’s brother, and the brothers’ mother, Maggie Murdaugh, kicked off a media frenzy which only intensified when her husband, Alex Murdaugh, was arrested. Questions swirled about Alex Murdaugh’s motive, which prosecutors later described as a desire to conceal a vast web of financial crimes. Reporters also dug into other deaths allegedly connected to the family, including a 2019 boat crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach and the 2018 death of housekeeper Gloria Satterfield on a Murdaugh property. The scrutiny on the family also brought new attention to the death of Smith, who was a classmate of Paul’s. According to an incident report obtained by HuffPost , Smith was found dead in the middle of the road near the Murdaugh home with apparent signs of blunt-force trauma. Though an investigator said there was no evidence to suggest that he was struck by a vehicle, a medical examiner ruled the death a hit-and-run , which Smith’s family disputed. Last year, authorities announced they are investigating Smith’s death as a homicide and his body was exhumed for a private autopsy. The case remains under investigation. According to the lawsuit’s complaint, Buster Murdaugh “has not been notified by any law enforcement entities of any allegations against him related to Stephen Smith’s death.” Yet, the suit contends, each of the series subtly accuse him murder to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of viewers. “Low Country: The Murdaugh Dynasty,” for example, suggests “that the Plaintiff, along with others, murdered Stephen Smith by striking him with a baseball bat. A sequence in the show accused the Plaintiff of killing Stephen Smith because of his sexual identity and further insinuates that the Plaintiff killed Stephen Smith in relation to a romantic relationship between Plaintiff and Smith. These statements are untrue in their entirety.” Buster Murdaugh’s reputation has been ruined by coverage of the case, adding that he has experienced mental anguish as a result, according to the complaint. Eric Bland, the Smith family’s lawyer, told The Daily Beast that Buster Murdaugh’s lawsuit will only result in more media attention. “Buster was never asked if he had any knowledge of [Smith’s] death. He just said he didn’t kill [Smith] and didn’t have a sexual relationship with him,” Bland told the Daily Beast. Netflix declined to comment on the lawsuit. Gannet and Warner Bros did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for a comment.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Crime On a remote airstrip in the South American country of Guyana, Jackie Speier lay gravely wounded behind the wheel of a small plane. The 28-year-old legal adviser to a California congressman had been shot five times. Near her lay the bullet-riddled bodies of her boss, Rep. Leo Ryan, three journalists and a woman fleeing a cult commune known as Jonestown. When help finally came, Speier and other survivors learned the almost incomprehensible truth about what they had left behind. Six miles away, more than 900 bodies lay decomposing in the heat. One third of them were children. They were surrounded by syringes and toppled paper cups containing poison-laced punch. According to a massive research project sponsored by San Diego State University, 918 people died on Nov. 18, 1978, in what came to be known as the Jonestown Massacre, the subject of the riveting new docuseries, “Cult Massacre: One Day in Jonestown.” The three-part series, which premiered Monday on Hulu (and will air on National Geographic on Aug. 14), is deeply unsettling. It stands out from other documentaries about Peoples Temple cult leader Jim Jones by disputing the all-too-pervasive narrative that the victims were complicit in their deaths and by providing important context for the massacre. Modern-day interviews — including survivors like Speier, members of the Peoples Temple who escaped, U.S. military personnel tasked with counting and removing the bodies, and Jim Jones’ son himself — contextualize the harrowing video, photos and audio, much of it previously unaired. Even Speier, who years later was elected to Ryan’s former seat in Congress, had not seen some of the footage before she watched the docuseries. “It was almost like an out-of-body experience — like it happened to someone else, and I was just watching this horrific saga,” she told HuffPost. “And I sit back and [think], ‘God, did this really happen to me?’ “Unfortunately, it really did.” Rev. Jim Jones founded the Peoples Temple in Indianapolis in the 1950s, preaching the concept of what he called “apostolic socialism.” Jones and his followers advocated for the redistribution of wealth, free social services and racial harmony. Although Jones was white, the majority of the members of the Peoples Temple, which relocated to San Francisco in the 1970s, were Black. Despite the church’s outward appearance of racial unity and equality — in one shot in “Cult Massacre,” a “Black Is Beautiful” sign is seen in Jonestown posted above cheerful drawings from children — it was clear to observers that Black members lacked agency in the group. “Most of those in power were white, and most of the African American population were not,” Speier said about the structure of the Peoples Temple. Under Jones’ direction, church members toiled to build Jonestown — officially called the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project — from the ground up on 3,800 acres of land Jones leased in the isolated jungle. People who were lured to Guyana with the promise of being “happy and untethered” from the U.S. government instead found themselves in what survivors described as a prison camp. Whether church members were happy to be in Jonestown or not, they were unquestionably prisoners of Jones. The self-proclaimed messiah was a cruel tyrant who confiscated his followers’ passports and money in Guyana, prevented them from communicating with their loved ones back home and punished those who questioned his authority. People were prevented from leaving by armed guards and the treacherous jungle terrain surrounding their commune. Jones even deprived them of food, which Speier realized when the delegation was having breakfast in the commune the morning of the massacre. She said she is still haunted by the face of a Black woman in her late 80s who Speier saw “stuffing bacon into her dress pocket.” “And it made me realize that it was all for show — that the food they were normally providing them was much less than what they were receiving that day. Her face still pops into my head from time to time,” Speier said. Congressman Ryan’s fact-finding delegation was a response to allegations of abuse at Jonestown by a group called Concerned Relatives, who said they were “bewildered and frightened” about what Jones was doing to their families. “Their human rights are being violated and the fabric of our family life is being torn apart,” they wrote in a 1970s flyer that they hoped would attract the attention of politicians and the public. The group warned that Jones was conducting mass suicide drills — he called them Operation White Knight — “to condition his members to die for ‘the cause’ at the moment he gives the order.” Their pleas spurred Ryan, who counted the relatives and members of the cult at Jonestown among his constituents, to investigate their concerns firsthand. He flew to Guyana with Speier as well as some People Temple defectors, family members and a team of journalists. Much of the footage of their visit was captured by NBC cameraman Bob Brown and San Francisco Examiner photographer Greg Robinson. Both of them were fatally shot in the ambush on the Port Kaituma airstrip, as was NBC correspondent Don Harris. “I was expecting to die,” Speier said. “I was just waiting to die.” The fifth person killed at Port Kaituma was Patricia Parks, a member of the Peoples Temple who was trying to escape that day. She was shot in the head while sitting inside the plane she hoped would carry her to safety. When the fact-finders were allowed to visit Jonestown, the followers’ smiles, enthusiasm and praise of their leader at first seemed to persuade Ryan that all was well. “Whatever the comments are, there are some people here who believe this is the best thing that ever happened in their whole life,” he said onstage in a pavilion to rousing cheers and applause from Jones’ followers. But then people started slipping secret notes to members of the delegation, saying they wanted to leave — “confirmation,” Speier said, “that people were being held there without their will.” Speier did meet individually with church members who insisted they wanted to stay in Jonestown, but she had trouble believing them. It seemed like they had “memorized a script,” she said. “They basically all said the same thing: ‘I love it here. I have no interest in reconnecting with my family.’” The tension in the air as word spread about the defectors was palpable. In film footage shown in “Cult Massacre,” Jones’ increasing agitation is evident. His jaw is clenched while beads of sweat form on his reddening face. He repeatedly licks his lips and whispers urgently to his guards. Then someone in the pavilion tried to stab Ryan. Others intervened and he wasn’t injured, but the delegation knew they were in peril. Jones said any followers who wanted to join them were free to leave — but then sent his armed guards to ambush them on the runway. Meanwhile, Jones was ordering his followers to poison themselves and their children. “Fail to follow my advice, you’ll be sorry. You’ll be sorry,” he tells his congregation in audio that was recorded on the scene. “Die with a degree of dignity, lay down your life with dignity,” Jones said. “Don’t lay down with tears and agony.” But Jones’ followers’ deaths were agonizing. Meanwhile, he died from a gunshot wound. Whether it was self-inflicted or not is still debated, but it wasn’t painful. Speier struggled to describe the sounds in the audio clip as Jones’ followers responded to his instructions, some of them asking why the children had to die too. “It was just this hopeless — I don’t know what the word is. Cry, I guess. A hopeless cry, but they just became resolved … there’s a herd instinct going on.” That, and the threat of guards standing around with guns if they didn’t do what they were told. So they drank. It was a mixture of cyanide and grape Flavor-Aid, which was reported at the time as Kool-Aid. “Drink the Kool-Aid” became a catchphrase for blindly following authority. The phrase still infuriates Jones’ son Stephen, who opens up about his conflicted relationship with his father in “Cult Massacre.” “It so dehumanizes the people who died there, and it’s so off the mark,” Jones says in the series. “That night was murder.” For decades, what happened at Jonestown was described as mass suicide, a notion that “Cult Massacre” convincingly discredits. “From very early on, I would bristle when people said mass suicide,” Speier said, pointing out that people were injecting cyanide into infants and children. “They had gunmen standing at all of the edges of the pavilion. And they had lost control over their own minds,” she said. A member of the U.S. Special Forces who was sent to Jonestown after the massacre said he found people with syringes stuck in the back of their necks, and evidence that others had been held down and forced to drink the poison. The dead were vastly undercounted at first — initial reports had the death toll at 300 — and officials later found children “tucked underneath” the adults, the Special Forces member said on “Cult Massacre.” Jones preyed on vulnerable people, a man who left Peoples Temple says on “Cult Massacre.” “They have been victims of racism, victims of poverty. Then Jones came along and offered them something. They trusted him and they believed him. They thought they were changing the world or at least they thought they were changing their lives. But he was a crazy son of a bitch. And he was willing to see them all die. I don’t know why he needed to destroy these people.” The people who died at Jonestown were the subject of ridicule and contempt for decades. Outsiders simply didn’t understand the torment Jones’ followers endured, Speier said. “Those who weren’t caught up in Jim Jones’s lies and the emotional stranglehold he had on people have no way of being able to appreciate how difficult it was for them,” Speier said.

    "article_content": "Crime fellow Two men were arrested Thursday in connection with the death of a 12-year-old Texas girl whose body was found Monday in a creek, Houston officials announced. Jocelyn Nungaray, 12, had sneaked out of her home on Sunday night and was last seen on surveillance footage entering a 7-Eleven just after midnight, officials said at a news conference. In the video, she is seen talking to two men. Johan Jose Rangel Martinez, 21, and Franklin Jose Pena Ramos, 26, who were roommates, have been arrested under a preliminary charge of capital murder in the case, according to Houston authorities. The two had yet to be booked on any charges as of Thursday afternoon. Alexis Nungaray told Houston TV station KPRC that she last saw her daughter before 10 p.m. Sunday but noticed her missing the following day, at about 6 a.m. Jocelyn’s 13-year-old boyfriend was reportedly talking to her on the phone while she was at the store and could hear her speaking to two adults, according to KTRK-TV in Houston. Lt. Stephen Hope of the Houston Police Department told reporters on Thursday that the victim’s boyfriend and his family had been “extremely” cooperative with authorities in the investigation. Hope said the two men were seen on video speaking with Jocelyn outside the 7-Eleven for several minutes before walking into the store together. They walked toward a bridge moments later, Hope said, near where Jocelyn was found dead. “I always told her to never leave the house, never leave unattended, always be safe ― there’s people around here that are crazy. I don’t think she ever thought it would face her,” Alexis Nungaray told KPRC. UPDATE: Our homicide detectives want to speak with these two male persons of interest regarding the death of a 12-year-old female at 400 West Rankin Rd. If you recognize them, please call HPD Homicide at 713-308-3600 or @CrimeStopHOU More info at https://t.co/J5pnr9nXpc https://t.co/RpFpzjsSX7 pic.twitter.com/N9RZew2kqu The two men headed south, in the direction of the apartment shared by Martinez and Ramos, and allegedly left the girl by the bridge, Hope said. Alexis Nungaray told KPRC that she tracked her daughter’s phone to the creek the following morning and saw officers canvassing the area. She was officially notified an hour later that her daughter was dead. The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences determined that Jocelyn died of strangulation, KPRC reported. Ramos and Martinez were taken into custody at their apartment on Thursday, and officers who searched their home allegedly found evidence connected to Jocelyn’s death. Her mother told KPRC that she is still trying to come to terms with her daughter’s death. “It’s like it’s not real. I keep hearing everything and everybody tell me everything, and I hear it and it’s not registering,” she said.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Crime A convicted serial rapist was responsible for the unsolved murders of two women hikers 28 years ago in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, authorities announced Thursday. The bodies of Laura “Lollie” Winans , 26, and her girlfriend, Julianne “Julie” Williams , 24, were found at their remote campsite on June 1, 1996, by park service rangers after they were reported missing. The mysterious deaths of the women, who were experienced hikers, had long raised fears for others seeking to tackle the Appalachian Trail as well as questions about whether they were targeted because they were gay. On Thursday, federal investigators revealed the name of a suspect — and that he had already died while in custody for other crimes. DNA taken from Walter “Leo” Jackson Sr. , who died in an Ohio prison in 2018 at age 70 while serving a sentence for kidnapping and rape, was a match for “several items of evidence” collected from the crime scene, the FBI’s Richmond Field Office said Thursday in a press release . Authorities said new forensic testing also revealed evidence that the women had been sexually assaulted. A new team was assigned to reinvestigate the case in 2021 and submitted the evidence to a private DNA lab for retesting. The DNA obtained from the lab was then submitted to the national law enforcement DNA database known as CODIS, which matched a cheek swab taken from Jackson. The bodies of Winans and Williams, who were last seen May 24, were found inside their sleeping bags. They had been gagged, with their hands bound and their throats slashed. The FBI declined to answer questions from HuffPost about when Jackson’s DNA was collected, what specific items from the crime scene were tested, and whether they had been previously submitted to CODIS. Kathryn Miles, who researched the case for her book, “Trailed: One Woman’s Quest to Solve the Shenandoah Murders,” told HuffPost that investigators had mishandled the case from the start. Despite evidence to the contrary, she said, rangers initially speculated that the killings were a murder-suicide or that the women had been attacked by a bear. In 2002, prosecutors charged Darrell Rice, a 34-year-old computer programmer with four counts of capital murder . They described the killings as a hate crime, saying he targeted the women because they were gay, and said they would seek the death penalty. It was the first federal hate crime capital case in U.S. history. Rice, who had previously been found guilty of the attempted abduction of a woman in the park, wasn’t a viable suspect for the double murders and prosecutors unfairly targeted him, Miles said, “despite the fact that DNA clearly excluded him, despite the fact that he had an alibi for the day that they were killed, despite the fact that there was absolutely nothing linking to the case.” Authorities eventually dropped the charges against Rice, but said he could be tried if additional evidence came to light. “Rice lived in basically what was a de facto double jeopardy situation for the rest of his life, and it completely ruined his life,” Miles said. “It rendered him destitute, it did incredible social and emotional damage to him and to his family. And I didn’t hear an apology for that today.” A lawyer for Rice in September 2021 provided some details about the DNA collected in the case, which was excluded as belonging to Rice. “There’s male DNA on the gag in Julie’s mouth, there are hairs under the duct tape…. they weren’t Darrell Rice’s,” Deirdre Enright, the founder and director of the Innocence Project at the University of Virginia School of Law, told WUSA9 . On Thursday, the FBI’s Cavanaugh acknowledged the failure of the initial prosecution of Rice. “That case was not built on forensic evidence,” Cavanaugh said. He also said there was no evidence that the women had been targeted because of their sexuality or other characteristics. “Make no mistake, this crime was brutal. This crime was definitionally hateful. Nevertheless, we do not have any evidence that the victims were selected for or that Jackson had any knowledge of or was otherwise motivated by their membership in a protected class,” he said. FBI agent Stanley Meador added that authorities had spoken with the women’s families and recognized how hard it was for them to hear Thursday’s news. “They’ve been seeking answers for far too long,” he said.

    "article_content": "Crime fellow Three injured minors who reportedly escaped Monday from a relative’s home in Phoenix while wearing zip ties on their wrists told authorities that they had been abused and that other children were still restrained in the relative’s apartment. The victims’ relative, a 33-year-old woman, has been charged with 12 counts of child abuse and kidnapping, according to court records reviewed by HuffPost. (HuffPost is not naming the relative in order to protect the identity of the children.) A 16-year-old girl and two brothers, ages 10 and 7, said they escaped from the relative’s apartment and knocked on a neighbor’s door seeking help, according to a probable cause statement attached to a release questionnaire obtained by HuffPost. The three kids told the neighbor that they had been zip-tied and that the 10-year-old had been struck with a handgun, according to the arrest document, and that other children were being restrained in the apartment. Officers who responded to the neighbor’s 911 call conducted a “protective sweep” but did not find the woman or other children inside, according to the probable cause statement. The neighbor told police that bruises and red marks were observed on the children’s hands, wrists and shoulders, according to the probable cause statement,No other children were found in the apartment, though. One of the boys had “bruises all over his body,” the neighbor said, according to official documents. “More on his face, on the side of his face. And then he had zip ties on his hands. He could barely even walk. He was really pale. He said that he didn’t eat for days.” The three children were taken into police care and questioned in forensic interviews. They allegedly detailed the abuse suffered in their relative’s home. Each child allegedly gave police graphic descriptions of physical abuse, including being struck with a gun, shocked with a Taser and suffocated with a plastic bag. The 16-year-old reportedly told detectives that on Monday, her relative believed the brothers were “touching” her daughter and punished them, according to the probable cause statement. The woman allegedly ordered the 16-year-old to hit her brothers, but the teen said she did not hit them hard, the arrest documents say. The teenager said that on multiple occasions, her relative used a gun to instill fear by either striking them with it or pressing it to their heads, according to the probable cause statement. The youngest of the three children told detectives that their relative would tell him he was “going to die” before she assaulted him, according to the court document. A medical examination found several injuries, including older cuts and scars on the 7-year-old’s chest, that appeared to be caused by being stabbed or hit with a gun. The 10-year-old boy described the siblings’ escape in his police interview, according to the probable cause statement. He allegedly told detectives that while he and the 7-year-old were zip-tied to the bar of a bunk bed, their sister came into the room with scissors and cut them free. Police who searched the home reported that they recovered several items that matched descriptions the kids gave of objects used to abuse them, including two Tasers, a black handgun, a knife and zip ties. The relative was found later Monday in Phoenix and taken into custody along with five other children, police reported. It was unclear how she was connected with the five children. Detectives reported that she told them the children were taken in from her sister but she felt as if she should have given them up, according to the probable cause statement. It’s unclear if she was speaking only of the three children who had escaped the apartment. The woman also reportedly told detectives that she was unable to continue caring for the children but believed they would have problems if they went somewhere else, according to the probable cause statement. A man who went to the apartment Thursday told a reporter he was the father of two children who’d been staying at the woman’s apartment and that he’d been looking for her, unaware she was in custody and facing child abuse charges. The man said his two children, ages 6 and 3, had also been staying with the woman. “I’m scared for all of them, but I’m just really trying to go find my children,” he told AZ Family. He was later told by Phoenix police that his children were in the care of child protective services. According to court records, the relative who was arrested Monday is expected to appear in court on June 24.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Crime A woman’s ex-boyfriend has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of her mother in Maryland 23 years ago, authorities said. Eugene Teodor Gligor, 44, was arrested on June 18 by U.S. marshals in Washington, D.C., in connection with the May 2, 2001, killing of Leslie Preer, 49, at her Chevy Chase home, the Montgomery County Police Department announced . Gligor was linked to the crime scene through DNA evidence, the MCPD said. Leslie Preer’s daughter, Lauren Preer, and Gligor had dated for five years, she told The Washington Post . They were no longer a couple at the time of her mother’s death, when Lauren was 23, and hadn’t spoken for three years. While they were dating, she said, the couple’s families, who lived near each other, socialized together, and Gligor accompanied her on family trips. She told the Post that Gligor had never shown any signs of violence, but her father, who died in 2017, repeatedly warned her that there was “something off” about him. Her mother, however, had always been fond of Gligor, Lauren Preer said. Her father and a co-worker of her mother’s found her body in her upstairs bedroom after she didn’t show up for work, authorities said. She had been beaten to death, The Washington Post reported. “This was a pretty brutal crime scene with a lot of blood,” a Montgomery County police detective told Washington’s WTTG-TV, Fox 5, in August 2022, when authorities announced that a cold case team was investigating the case and seeking information from the public . The Texas-based forensics lab Othram said that it had teamed with the MCPD in September 2022 to build a comprehensive DNA profile for the then-unknown suspect using blood evidence from the crime scene. Genetic genealogy analysis — which uses DNA databases to construct family history profiles — identified Gligor as a potential suspect, police said. DNA evidence collected from Gligor was a positive match for DNA recovered from the crime scene, they said. Investigators did not say how they had obtained Gligor’s DNA. HuffPost reached out to the MCPD, the Montgomery County State’s Attorney’s Office and Gligor’s attorney but did not get an immediate response. Gligor is being held without bond, court records show. His next court hearing is scheduled for Monday. By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Crime fellow A Muslim advocacy group on Friday called for a hate crime investigation after a Texas woman allegedly tried to drown a 3-year-old Palestinian American girl in a swimming pool. Elizabeth Wolf, described by the Council on American-Islamic Relations as a “White American woman,” was arrested May 19 and initially charged with public intoxication, according to a press release from police in Euless. The 42-year-old was later charged with attempted capital murder and injury to a child. According to CAIR, the incident began when the 3-year-old’s mother, who wears a hijab, was at the pool with her Muslim family. Wolf approached the 32-year-old, identified only as “Mrs. H,” with “racist interrogations,” CAIR said. Wolf asked where the mother was from and if two kids playing in the pool were hers, according to police who spoke with the mother. The mother said that Wolf “made statements about her not being an American and other racial statements,” per authorities. At one point, Wolf jumped into the pool to pull Mrs. H’s daughter and 6-year-old son into the deep end, CAIR said. The boy managed to pull away, but Wolf then allegedly attempted to force the 3-year-old underwater. When Mrs. H tried to rescue her daughter, Wolf “snatched off the mother’s head scarf and used it to beat the mother as well as kicking her to keep her away while forcing her daughter’s head underwater,” CAIR said. When Wolf was finally taken into custody by officers, she allegedly shouted to a bystander who was comforting the mother, “Tell her I will kill her, and I will kill her whole family.” Witnesses told officers that Wolf appeared intoxicated at the time of the incident. Mrs. H’s two children were medically evaluated and cleared after the ordeal, police said. “We are American citizens, originally from Palestine, and I don’t know where to go to feel safe with my kids,” the mother said in a statement provided by CAIR. “My country is facing a war, and we are facing that hate here.” Mrs. H said that her daughter remains traumatized. “Whenever I open the apartment door, she runs away and hides, telling me she is afraid the lady will come and immerse her head in the water again,” Mrs. H said. Wolf was released on bail a day after her arrest last month, according to CAIR’s Shaimaa Zayan. The organization now seeks not only a hate crime probe, but a higher bail bond and a dialogue with officials about “ Islamophobia , anti-Arab, and anti-Palestinian sentiment,” Zayan said. “We are seeing a new level of bigotry here where a person deeply believes they get to decide, based on religion, spoken language, and country of origin, whose kids deserve to stay alive and whose don’t,” Zayan said. CAIR published a report earlier this year stating that it received 8,061 complaints about anti-Muslim incidents across the U.S. in 2023, citing the recent escalation of violence in Israel and Gaza as a driving force behind the figure.

    "article_content": "Stephen Colbert flew a few jokes past Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after the independent presidential candidate failed to meet the requirements to qualify for next week’s CNN debate featuring President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump . The “ Late Show ” host noted that the conspiracy theorist didn’t make the televised event, in part, due to low poll numbers amid a “ cash crunch ” for his campaign. “But he’s not giving up, this week he went on Twitter to introduce some of the new members of his team,” said Colbert, who tossed to a video of Kennedy speaking in front of two ravens on a railing. “Hey everybody, these are my two ravens, they’re not actually mine, I’m just taming them,” Kennedy said. “By feeding them every day, I’ve gotten them to come in and join me for meditations every morning on my balcony.” Colbert was quick to quip that Kennedy’s campaign isn’t “doomed.” “He’s just being followed around by a flock of black birds,” the host said.

    "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump — who complained about thousands of dead people voting — suggested that Joan Rivers voted for him in the 2016 election despite the comedian’s death in 2014, according to an audio clip. The clip — which MSNBC ’s Joy Reid aired on her program Thursday — stems from one of Trump’s interviews with Ramin Setoodeh , co-editor-in-chief at Variety and author of the recently released book “Apprentice in Wonderland,” which looks at the former president’s life after the White House. “Joan said she was a Republican, did you know that?” asked Setoodeh as the two discussed the comedian’s time on “The Celebrity Apprentice.” “I thought she might have been a Republican,” Trump replied. “I know one thing: she voted for me, according to what she said.” Reid reacted to the clip by noting “one minor problem” with Trump’s remarks. “Joan Rivers died two years before the 2016 election, a little too early for early voting,” she said. The host later pointed to another clip from the interview where Trump appears to claim he had to wrap the discussion up to deal with a foreign policy matter. “The reason I’m doing this and devoting a lot of time to it, I have to get back up because, you know, doing the whole thing with the Afghanistan,” said Trump in the recording. “Has he blown that Afghanistan.” Setoodeh told MSNBC ’s “Morning Joe” earlier this week that the presumptive GOP presidential nominee showed “ severe memory issues ,” adding that Trump “couldn’t even remember” him. Check out the Mediaite clip of Reid’s program below: Critics on social media mocked the former president over the remarks, including the Republican Voters Against Trump group, which shared a clip of Trump’s claim that people “ died and they voted .” Trump: “People died, and they voted.” https://t.co/kvukRqCtTn pic.twitter.com/XOpvJN7vvG How long before they say Joan Rivers actually died after the 2016 election? https://t.co/QvtqSPRjAX Imagine the furor from the right if Joe Biden claimed that Robin Williams, who also died in 2014, voted for him for president. https://t.co/LRHXedEoYW https://t.co/y0j0oPPp7W pic.twitter.com/WtmJljWpgr If Biden said this and had it on tape, Fox News would be popping champagne bottles, and balloons would be falling from the ceiling right now. I hope he doesn’t pick Joan Rivers as his VP choice I don’t think this is proof that he’s mentally in decline (though he totally is). It’s evidence that he will lie as easily as he exhales. He’ll say anyone said whatever he needs them to have said to make his point.

    "article_content": "Former Trump White House attorney Ty Cobb spotted a move that would spell trouble for U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon as he offered a brutal assessment of former President Donald Trump ’s appointee overseeing his classified documents case. “The worst thing that could happen to her is that she actually does rule for Trump on this because that would go to the 11th Circuit [Court of Appeals],” Cobb told CNN host Erin Burnett on Thursday’s edition of “OutFront.” He continued, “And then I think this petty, partisan prima donna would be put in her place and they would remove her.” Cobb has criticized Cannon — who has been previously rebuked by the 11th Circuit — on a number of occasions over her handling of the case. He recently knocked her for “ kicking the can further down the road ” by adding on hearings after she indefinitely postponed the trial early last month. Cobb’s remarks arrived on the same day The New York Times reported that the judge turned down calls from her peers to step aside from the case. The former Trump White House attorney said it’s way beyond the point of characterizing Cannon “merely as inexperienced” in light of her “consistent rulings” in Trump’s favor. “It’s like having a race between the tortoise and hare and saying the tortoise is not a favorite. The reality is, she is slow and she’s slow on purpose,” Cobb said of Cannon’s treatment of the case. Burnett later pointed to a request from Trump’s lawyers for an evidentiary hearing, arguing against Jack Smith ’s appointment as special counsel. Cobb said there’s “nothing really” at stake since the law requires that Cannon validates Smith’s appointment and described her decision to have a hearing — rather than denying the motion — as “silly.” “The fact she doesn’t deny most of these motions without a hearing is silly. The fact that Trump can get a hearing on the flimsiest arguments is shocking,” said Cobb, who called it “fascinating” that she’s opened the hearing to “outsiders.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "MLB great Reggie Jackson opened up about racism he experienced during his early baseball career in powerful remarks Thursday on live TV. Jackson, who played for the Kansas City Athletics and the Oakland Athletics in the 1960s and ’70s, described multiple instances in which people referred to him using the N-word decades ago. “I walked into restaurants and they would point at me and said, ‘The n****r can’t eat here,’” he told a Fox Sports panel at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama, where he played for the minor league Birmingham A’s in 1967. The baseball Hall of Famer also recalled experiencing discrimination when he tried to attend a “welcome home dinner” at the country club of then-Athletics owner Charlie Finley. “They pointed me out ... [and said,] ‘He can’t come in here.’ Finley marched the whole team out,” Jackson said. “Finally, they let me in there. He said: ‘We’re going to go to the diner and eat hamburgers. We’ll go where we’re wanted.’” Jackson’s remarks came as he attended a tribute game honoring the Negro Leagues , less than one month after Major League Baseball incorporated the leagues’ statistics into its official records . Jackson was one of a few Black players on the Birmingham squad when he played at Rickwood, the oldest professional ballpark in the U.S. “Coming back here is not easy,” Jackson told former New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez , who asked how “emotional” he felt in returning to the city. Jackson pointed to a number of his white friends in baseball — including his onetime manager John McNamara, as well as players like Rollie Fingers and Dave Duncan — who helped him get through difficult moments. He recalled crashing on a teammate’s couch before people threatened to burn down the apartment complex unless he “got out” of it. “I wouldn’t wish it on anyone,” Jackson said, adding that he might have been killed if he reacted to racism by starting a fight. “At the same time, had it not been for my white friends ... I would have never made it.” WARNING: This video contains uncensored dialogue with disturbing language.

    "article_content": "Monica Crowley , a former Fox News personality and Treasury Department official during Donald Trump ’s presidential administration, showed love to Cold War-era Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.) on Friday as she pushed a bizarre conspiracy theory that seemed straight out of the Red Scare . “By the way, Sen. Joe McCarthy was right,” Crowley said in remarks to the Faith & Freedom Coalition’s annual conference in Washington. “And he was trying to ring the bell in the 1950s about communist infiltration in our government.” Crowley, who was also Trump’s pick for a National Security Council role before she declined it in early 2017 amid a plagiarism scandal , added that the deep state “removed Richard Nixon,” “went after Ronald Reagan” and “is now going after Donald Trump .” “That deep state became very insidious, and in the 1950s smeared and attacked Joe McCarthy for speaking the truth about godless communism in [the] very halls of our government,” said Crowley, who has previously peddled a number of Barack Obama -related conspiracy theories. Her remarks arrive decades after McCarthy famously claimed there were communists and Soviet spies throughout the U.S. government. The Senate would later vote to censure him in a 67-22 vote, less than three years prior to his 1957 death. Speaking in Washington, Crowley said that communists have been “grabbing control over all of the aspects of American life and culture.” “They called it ‘the long march through the institutions,’” she said. “And now they have succeeded because they’ve been at it for so long.” Earlier this year, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon said he was “sure” that Crowley was on the short list for national security adviser in a second Trump term as he seeks to retake the White House.

    "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump backed an idea for a “ migrant league” similar to the Ultimate Fighting Championship in remarks to Christian conservatives at a Faith & Freedom Coalition conference on Saturday. “Why don’t you set up a migrant league of fighters and have your regular league of fighters, and then you have the champion of your league — these are the greatest fighters in the world — fight the champion of the migrants,” said Trump, who claimed he pitched the idea to UFC President and CEO Dana White . He continued, “I think the migrant guy might win, that’s how tough they are.” The presumptive GOP presidential candidate, who once compared asylum-seekers to UFC fighters in 2019, added that White didn’t like the concept “too much.” “But actually, it’s not the worst idea I’ve ever had,” Trump said. “These are tough people, these people are tough, and they’re nasty, mean.” White, in remarks to reporters at a UFC event, confirmed Trump shared the idea. “It was a joke, it was a joke,” said White, a friend of the former president. “I saw everybody going crazy online. But yeah, he did say it.” \"These people are tough and they're nasty, mean\" -- Trump, speaking to a Christian group, says that he encouraged Dana White to create a UFC \"migrant league\" because they're so tough pic.twitter.com/zGzVOPxjue Trump would later bring up his “ new migrant fight league ” idea again at a rally in Philadelphia . “You know, these are tough cookies coming into our country, coming with prisons and mental institutions,” he said. He added that the idea could make White, who has appeared alongside Trump at multiple UFC events , “a lot of money.” Sarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for President Joe Biden ’s reelection campaign, took aim at Trump over his “incoherent, unhinged tirade” on Saturday. “Fitting that convicted felon Donald Trump spent his time at a religious conference threatening to round up Latinos, bragging about ripping away Americans’ freedoms, and promising to be even more extreme if he regains power,” Chitika said in a statement. Trump: I said, Dana, I have an idea for you to make a lot of money. You're going to go and start a new migrant fight League, only migrants, pic.twitter.com/n6C6ZqRhuP The remarks from Trump come amid a campaign in which he’s used dehumanizing rhetoric to refer to migrants, including calling them “animals” and “not people” at an Ohio rally in March and repeatedly accusing them of “poisoning the blood of our country.” He’s pledged to conduct mass deportations of undocumented immigrants should he win November’s presidential election.

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost Years ago, writer Sara C. felt palpable chemistry with a coworker. She had been married for 14 years at the time, but her friendship with the man was flirtatious and she started to fixate on it. They communicated regularly and had coffee dates. Then they slept together. But a line was crossed even before the physical relationship began: Sara had invested in a figment of a relationship until it became a real one, to the detriment of her marriage. “My affair definitely started out as an emotional affair ,” said Sara, whose last name has been withheld to protect her privacy. “I think many people in steady relationships sometimes stagnate or get into tiffs that remain unresolved.” “Whether it’s boredom or complacency or unresolved frustration, I’m not sure,” she added. “But it makes them see other people in a different light and can elevate the human connection.” Those lingering connections are sometimes called backburner relationships . A “backburner” is “a person to whom one is not presently committed, and with whom one maintains some degree of communication, in order to keep or establish the possibility of future romantic and/or sexual involvement,” according to a 2014 study in Computers in Human Behavior . The concept has also been called “cushioning” ― as in, “ I have a Plan B ready to cushion the blow if Meg and I don’t work out .” It’s more than just a “what-if” situation, though. Backburner relationships require relatively frequent communication, Jayson Dibble, the 2014 study’s lead author and an assistant professor of communication at Hope College, told The Atlantic at the time . These affairs of the heart ― and of the imagination ― make sense from an evolutionary standpoint: If the goal is to have as many options as possible for reproduction, the occasional Instagram “like” and “wanna get coffee?” text is easy enough to maintain. At the same time, you ensure your future offspring will have someone to care for them by staying with your partner. Marriage and family therapist Elisabeth LaMotte likens cushioning to a “pre-meditated version of rebounding.” Cushioning typically indicates an inability to exist without a relationship, she said. And more often than not, our backburner fulfills (or seems to fulfill) something that’s missing in our primary relationship. “With cushioning, you’re usually cultivating a secret flirtation with someone who represents an exaggerated rebellion against challenges in one’s current relationship. For example, someone who is dating a successful but anxious partner might cushion with a relaxed partner who is unable to keep a job,” she said. “But cushioning denies both parties a chance to see if the anxiousness (or any other challenges) might be lessened through communication and effort with our primary partners.” We imagine the grass is greener on the other side ― and in the process, we short-shrift what very well may be a solid relationship. Once pursued, backburner relationships are subject to the same frustrating, everyday complications any other couple experiences. Sometimes, the relationship peters out quickly or forces you to grapple with your own unresolved issues. This was the case for comedian and writer Xaxier Toby . Six years ago, Toby pursued a relationship with a friend of a friend he’d always had “ If only I were single... ” thoughts about. “They provide a little jolt of validation that you might be missing in your relationship due to turmoil, but that’s all they’ll ever be. They’re like sugar. Instantly gratifying, addictive, but without any nutritional value.” “I’d just been dumped and instead of dealing with that, I leaped straight to the backburner,” said Toby, who has written a number of comedy books including Mining My Own Business . “It didn’t go anywhere, of course, and just delayed me dealing with the pain of a breakup, with the bonus of unfairly messing with someone and involving them in the emotional mess that was me at that time,” he added. Toby said he now understands why backburner relationships are so common. “They provide a little jolt of validation that you might be missing in your relationship due to turmoil, but that’s all they’ll ever be,” he said. “They’re like sugar. Instantly gratifying, addictive, but without any nutritional value.” Cushioning is unfair to both your current partner and the person acting as your cushion, said Samantha Burns , a dating coach and the author of Breaking Up & Bouncing Back . They’re also unhealthy for you. “Cushioning stems from a place of insecurity, or underlying feelings of dissatisfaction in your current relationship,” she said. “If you’re cushioning, ask yourself why you need the outside attention and validation. Is it making up for some needs that are not being met in your relationship? Is it distracting you from acknowledging that you’re unhappy or disconnected from your partner?” Take your time if you need it. But if you realize you want to refocus on your primary relationship, do so with intentionality. “When you’re more insightful and mindful about your thoughts and feelings, you can figure out if you want to remain in your relationship and communicate with your partner instead of going outside the boundaries of your relationship,” Burns said. “Successful couples turn inwards, not outwards.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s federal archaeology agency on Monday accused the conservative-governed city of Guanajuato of mistreating one of the country’s famous mummified 19th century bodies . The National Institute of Anthropology and History, INAH, said that during recent renovations at the museum where the mummified bodies are on permanent display, the arm of one of the mummies, well, came off. One might think the complaint is all about the dignified treatment of corpses buried around the early 1800s and dug up starting in the 1860s, because their families could no longer pay burial fees. But in fact, the mummies have been on a somewhat grisly display in glass cases in a museum in Guanajuato, the capital of the state of the same name, and toted around to tourism fairs for decades. Some were exhibited in the United States in 2009. What appears to be at the root of the latest dispute is a turf battle between the INAH, which believes it has jurisdiction over the mummies because it says they are “national patrimony,” and Guanajuato, which considers them a tourist attraction. The state and city are governed by the conservative National Action Party, which the Morena party – which holds power at the federal level – considers its arch enemy. On Monday, the institute said it would demand an accounting of what permits and procedures were followed during the museum renovations. “These events confirm that the way the museum’s collection was moved is not the correct one, and that far from applying proper corrective and conservation strategies, the actions carried out resulted in damages, not only to this body,” the institute wrote in a statement. It did not say what, if any, other bits of mummies had fallen off. “It appears that this situation is related to a lack of knowledge about proper protocols and the lack of training of the personnel in charge of carrying out these tasks,” it continued. The Guanajuato city government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The preserved corpses were unintentionally mummified when they were buried in crypts in a dry, mineral-rich soil environment in the mining state of Guanajuato. Some still have hair, leathery skin and their original clothing. The institute appeared to be miffed because personnel in Guanajuato, not the institute’s own staff, is in charge of the approximately 100 mummies. In part because they were mostly dug up before the institute was founded in 1939, they remain under local control, something that has rankled federal officials in the past. In 2023, experts from the institute complained that a traveling display of mummies could pose a health risk to the public, because one of the mummies appeared to have fungal growths. It is not the first time that the extremity of a long-dead person becomes a national political issue. In 1989, the Mexican government weathered a wave of criticism after it removed the arm of revolutionary Gen. Álvaro Obregón – severed in battle in 1915 – after being displayed in a jar of formaldehyde in a marble monument for a half-century. Visitors said it had become ‘unsightly,’ and so the arm was incinerated and buried. In 1838, Antonio López de Santa Anna, who served as president of Mexico 11 times, lost his leg in battle, and had it buried with honors. By 1844, an angry crowd that accused him of treason dragged the leg through the streets of Mexico City and apparently destroyed it. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny are back to dating after breaking up late last year. People magazine is reporting that the 28-year-old tequila mogul and 30-year-old Latin music superstar (real name Benito Martínez Ocasio) have made it official once again after being spotted together several times in the last few weeks. “It’s going well and they’re prioritizing spending time together as they figure it out,” a source close to the couple told the magazine. “There wasn’t ever any drama in their breakup and they missed each other.” Rumors that the two celebrities were coupled up first started in February 2023, but when the multiple Grammy winner was asked if he and Jenner, who rose to fame as part of the Kardashian family, were dating last June, he refused to confirm things, saying, “In the end, the only thing I have is my privacy.” The relationship became slightly more public in October when the two collaborated on an ad campaign for Gucci, but the couple announced their split in December. At the time, the split was reportedly due to the couple having “busy schedules,” not any personal issues, which the source in the People article confirmed. In fact, a few weeks after the December split, they celebrated New Year’s Eve together near Barbados, People reported at the time. Although the founder of 818 Tequila dated others during the split, the source said Bad Bunny “was not happy that Kendall was dating” and has “been wanting her back.” “It’s like they needed the break to miss each other enough to figure things out,” the insider explained. They always had this crazy attraction to each other. Things are great again.” The source said that Jenner is happy with the renewed relationship. “Kendall is happy. Benny is very charming and is always sweet to her,” the source told the publication.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer Maria Ramirez was disappointed. The 55-year old from Southern California had traveled to Istanbul, excited to live for a little while as the characters in all of her favorite Turkish dramas do. She was particularly inspired by scenes filled with delicious Turkish meals, in particular breakfast spreads that consist of feta, olives, sliced cucumbers, eggs, spreads, jams, tomatoes and bread . “Every time I watch the telenovelas, I see them take out their cheeses, their olives, and so I go to the refrigerator and I do the same.” Ramirez says. “I make my plate and a glass of wine and I eat with them.” But when she woke up in her hotel and headed down to finally experience the flavors herself, she was offered a standard American or British breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausages and potatoes. “I said ‘Aww! I was hoping for the Turkish breakfast!’” she recalls. “I didn’t get to have it until later.” It’s not a shock that Ramirez would get a breakfast that would be more at home on a Denny’s menu. Hotels often cater to British or American tourists who may fear the foreign and for some reason travel across countries to places foreign to then only eat exactly what’s available down their street. But that may be changing in the country as Turkish dramas, known as dizi, continue their ascendance in popularity globally, with demand only growing , leading travelers to seek out a more authentic Turkish experience. This is particularly true for Latinx people , who have become one of the biggest audiences of Turkish dizi since 2014 when the drama “Binbir Gece” (“1001 Nights”) became a massive hit in Chile. Even my mom, who has been talking nonstop about planning a trip to Istanbul next year, has been yapping about finding a 'novio guapo.' In Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina and other Latin American countries as well as among Latines in the U.S., Turkish dramas have become appointment viewing. Major Spanish-language networks like Univision and Telemundo air dubbed versions nightly; streamers such as Netflix, Peacock, VIX and FuboTV offer a wide library of both dubbed and subtitled series; and video platforms like YouTube, Dailymotion, and Turkish123.com keep a large supply as well. To call dizi a soap opera or telenovela would be incredibly reductive — no disrespect to both televised art forms that have gifted the culture secret twins and bouts of amnesia. These expansive dramas are 40+ episodes long and go for multiple seasons, with each episode holding a running time of two hours or even more. They feature storylines that delve into the hardships, heartaches and triumphs of the human experience, but don’t expect a fairy tale ending: Dizi often have bittersweet, melancholic endings , like in the popular drama “Kara Sevda” (“Endless Love” or “Amor Eterno”), which concluded with the gut-wrenching death of a main character. That’s all to say, audiences get deeply invested and have a never-ending supply of dramas to fill their nights. It’s easy to become fully engulfed, obsessed and entertained, as I saw with my mom, who, on a recent visit, wouldn’t put her phone down as she watched hours of Turkish dizi on YouTube. The only thing that briefly pried her from her “novelas Turcas” was a trip to TJ Maxx. “As consumers, the U.S. Hispanic audiences seek more than mere entertainment; they yearn for representation, affirmation and connectivity,” says Barbara Musa Ruiz, vice president of programming strategy at TelevisaUnivision, reflecting on the success of dizi with Latinx audiences over the past few years. “They strive to see themselves mirrored in the stories they consume — and Turkish dramas have adeptly tapped into this longing.” With dizi filmed mostly in Istanbul and other nearby locales, viewers also see parts of the world they may have never been exposed to. And now, via their phone and TV screens, they’re transported to the country’s picturesque coast, vicariously experiencing a new rich and vibrant culture. It’s only natural that some of them now want to see the real thing. “I wanted to experience something different,” Ramirez says about choosing to travel to Turkey. “And it was something I’d already seen in the telenovelas. It was so beautiful.” According to a 2023 report by the market research company Euromonitor International, Istanbul tops the list of cities around the globe with the most i nternational arrivals, followed by London. Meanwhile, the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism reported in 2022 that about 377,000 Americans traveled to Turkey in the first half of the year, an influx of just over 77% from the first half of 2019. And since 2018, travel from Latin America has increased exponentially, with Argentina and Brazil bringing the most LATAM tourists to Turkey. That those two countries are some of the biggest consumers of Turkish dizi doesn’t seem like a coincidence. Rates of travel have skyrocketed: Mexico’s rates alone increased by 103% per Turkey’s Culture and Tourism Ministry; and Chile and Venezuela’s rates rose just over 66% and 40%, respectively. While medical tourism has made Turkey a major plastic surgery destination , with thousands dipping in for a fresh set of teeth, a head of thicker hair and a snatched waist, more and more people are being inspired by Turkish dizi to experience the romance. Before Ramirez visited Turkey in August, she joked that she hoped “to see if one of the heartthrobs over there would be interested in me! They’re very attractive, but to my bad luck, I didn’t find one.” Who among us hasn’t daydreamed of a vacation fling that makes life feel like a sexy romcom, or a sweeping drama series in which a hunky god fights for your honor and loves you with a depth that can only be matched by the ocean despite all of the obstacles before you. Even my mom, who has been talking nonstop about planning a trip to Istanbul next year, has been yapping about finding a “novio guapo.” My sincerest apologies to the men of Turkey who may encounter this gray-haired, senior seductress in sensible espadrilles. Maria Teresa Figueroa from Santa Ana, California, also saw how beautiful the landscape appeared while watching her dizi at home, and didn’t realize it was Turkey until her sister-in-law told her. “I told my husband, ‘Ay! I really want to go visit there!’” she says. Over the course of our conversation, Figueroa regaled me with the entire plot of her favorite dizi “ Kadın” (“Woman,” or “Mujer” as it’s called on Univision) with the excitement of a friend sharing juicy gossip and mentioned any time she noticed a cultural custom in the characters she found fascinating, (“They always drink coffee in these little cups!”) and there were plenty. It intrigued her, and ever since she’s been yearning for a trip. And whenever she’s ready, there are options for her to get the full dizi experience. “They strive to see themselves mirrored in the stories they consume — and Turkish dramas have adeptly tapped into this longing.” Haron Yildirim runs Castle Travel , a tour company out of the coastal towns of Kusadasi and Pamukkale, and holds special tours of dizi locations. He started doing tours about five years ago after the popularity of the series “ Diriliş: Ertuğrul” (“Resurrection: Ertuğrul”) and “ Kara Para Aşk” (“Black Money Love”) led a group of American women to request a specialized tour. “They fall in love to main characters [of “Black Money Love’]. I had no idea that much love for Turkish dizi in America,” he told me while driving back from scouting Alaçatı , a beach town that served as a location for the uber-popular dizi “ Fatmagül’ün Suçu Ne?” (“ What is Fatmagül’s Fault?”) for future tours. “Can you imagine American ladies speaking Turkish with me? They learned from dizi.” “This trend underscores the significance of cultural exchange and collaboration within the media landscape,” Ruiz tells me. “By embracing international content and fostering partnerships with global producers, we can provide our audience with a broader, more diverse spectrum of programming that resonates authentically with their lives and experiences. In doing so, we not only meet the demands of our audiences but also enrich their viewing experience while nurturing a sense of inclusivity and cultural appreciation.” Yildirim believes dizi have helped people better see both the “natural beauty of the country” and also the life people lead in a predominantly Muslim country, something especially important because, as he put it, “America has seen the Muslims as terrorists.” “ In the tour, people ask many questions,” Yildirim says. “We are explaining traditions, customs, religion, geography and history.” While it may seem insignificant, there is power in bringing to screen the lives and stories of Turkish people to Latinx audiences, who perhaps see their struggles and similar traditions reflected to them. But it’s also as simple as Latinx audiences being compelled by great storytelling, regardless of where it’s from. While there can be a level of exotification and fetishization from viewers who become tourists, dizi has still been instrumental in showing many people outside of the culture what life in Turkey is like, and encourages them to travel there, join a tour and then “understand us.” “We experience our emotions and disappointments very deeply,” Yildirim says. “ We are appreciated because we reflect these emotions in our series.” This travel trend is more than just a fascinating link between the romantic and emotional values of two different cultures. It reveals the void in our programming in the U.S. Hollywood continues to ignore Latinx audiences , despite the fact that as a demographic they’re responsible for 24% of both box office sales and streaming subscriptions. That Turkey producers have been smart enough to see Latinx audiences as a viable investment, which creates real-life impact on tourism and overall cultural connection, lays bare the buying power of Latinx people. Hollywood should pay closer attention. By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "A group aiming to battle food waste planted 162 fruit trees in low-income Portland neighborhoods last year — and they’re hoping their efforts are fruitful in more ways than one. In the spring of 2023, the Portland Fruit Tree Project, funded by a $34,000 grant from the charity One Tree Planted — partnered with local organizations to find community members interested in adding fruit trees to their gardens in historically low-income neighborhoods. F ounded in 2007, the PFTP initially began as a response to food waste, connecting overwhelmed homeowners with prolific fruiting trees with neighbors and community organizations that could use the produce. The group hosted volunteer harvest parties and fruit preservation workshops and taught general fruit tree care. Today, the majority of harvests are picked and made available to local community organizations, with a portion going to harvest volunteers. “When we take care of all of these trees, they produce better fruit,” says PFTP Executive Director Heather Keisler Fornes. When Keisler Fornes started with the program in 2020, every homeowner PFTP worked with was white. Funders questioned who the group was serving. So PFTP broadened its focus to lower-income areas with fewer trees, where “climate change is felt more quickly and extremely.” “While we’re making all of these trees great in the areas that people have them, let’s also figure out who doesn’t have them,” Keisler Fornes said. The group turned to a measurement designed by the organization American Forests called the Tree Equity Score. The score uses factors like an area’s tree canopy, income and racial demographics, surface temperature and overall health to designate a number from 0 to 100. The lower the number, the more vulnerable the area is to the negative effects of climate change. In Irvington, an affluent northeast Portland neighborhood, hundred-year-old trees tower over parks and throughout idyllic neighborhoods with wide, calm streets and greenways. In these areas, the tree equity score is often 100 or close to it. In neighborhoods like Centennial, on Portland’s eastern border, the trees are sparser and old growth has been removed. It’s less common to see pedestrian- and bike-centric infrastructure, and many streets don’t have sidewalks at all. These areas, where the tree equity score can dip to the 50s, have become heat islands , according to Oregon Metro. These neighborhoods, which bear the brunt of the changing climate and are disproportionately affected by heatwaves, pollution and other environmental hazards, have also historically been home to more low-income, unhoused and immigrant residents. By focusing on adding fruit trees, in particular, to mitigate the tree canopy gap, the PFTP can create more opportunities for food sovereignty. PFTP’s collaboration with the Asian Pacific American Network of Oregon and with Growing Gardens resulted in the planting of 162 fruit trees in southeast Portland. PFTP workers do their biannual maintenance checks on fruit trees they’ve planted there — pruning, training, and giving advice as needed. A few didn’t make it through the summer, but the majority are slowly getting established. “People will talk about [how] fruit trees are small,” said Keisler Fornes. “Some of us who live out in these low-canopy neighborhoods don’t want to plant a bunch of large-form trees. ... There was a clear preference for fruit trees from communities of color and the different immigrant communities that were asked specifically in East Portland.” When community members chose their fruit trees and shrubs in the fall of 2022, the most popular picks were pineapple guavas (technically a shrub that can grow to 15 feet high) and figs, but some tried their luck with bananas and yuzu citrus. Hai Vo, who has lived in his Southeast Portland home since 2002, proudly waters his garden and checks in on the fuyu persimmon and pineapple guava he received from PFTP. His grass looks pale and brittle everywhere except around his new plantings — he’s watered his trees to get them established. Many of the homeowners who received trees are seasoned gardeners for whom planting trees wasn’t necessarily an issue of knowledge, but of access. “Part of the thing that makes you so aware of that is how well they took care of their plants,” says Sadie Wechsler, PFTP’s tree care manager. “For us, getting to work with all these communities — it felt like, ‘Oh, this is what we should have been doing all along.’”"

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost This week marks a grim milestone in Puerto Rico’s weather record: For the first time , virtually every inch of the U.S. Caribbean territory’s 311-mile coastline is roasting in temperatures that feel like 114 degrees Fahrenheit. Federal forecasters say heat exhaustion or stroke are “likely with prolonged exposure.” For Gloricela Santiago, 59, staying cool these nights means sleeping outside on her balcony, breathing in the fumes of neighbors’ generators roaring through sunrise. That’s because Santa Isabel, the seaside town where Santiago lives and works as a technician at a public housing complex, is one of three municipalities on Puerto Rico’s southern shore facing power outages that could last for seven weeks. Experts say workers can restore electricity in a matter of days, but the private utility that now controls Puerto Rico’s power system would need to use its own money rather than federal dollars. “It is horrible. The heat is terrible. People cannot sleep and no longer have the budget to buy food,” Santiago said in Spanish, speaking over text message Monday night to save battery on her phone. “This is a crisis.” America’s most populous unincorporated territory hasn’t had steady electricity since Hurricane Maria laid waste to the aging power grid in September 2017. The storm triggered an 11-month blackout ― the second-longest in modern history, leaving thousands to die without refrigerated medicine or filtered water. The territory’s government hired private companies from the U.S. to run the state-owned utility’s power plants and distribution system. But a secretive bidding process yielded a contract that virtually guaranteed profits regardless of service quality. Nearly seven years after the hurricane, blackouts plague Puerto Ricans across the territory every week, if not daily, and rates keep going up. “The bill gets higher every month,” Santiago said. Last month, it was $80, even though she said, “I’m never at home. I’m always at work or church.” It’s the kind of squeeze few Americans living in the states can imagine. Puerto Rico has worse poverty than the poorest U.S. state, yet pays some of the highest electricity rates in the entire country. LUMA Energy, the joint venture between two Texas and Canadian energy companies that took over electricity sales three years ago, has repeatedly ratcheted up rates to pay for whatever parts of the grid reconstruction the billions of federal dollars don’t already cover. But service has seen little improvement. Puerto Ricans who can afford generators, solar panels or batteries buy them, yet those units are expensive to purchase and fuel, and the routine power surges frequently destroy batteries or appliances. Thanks to a long-standing federal law that prevents Puerto Rico from importing goods from anywhere but the U.S., groceries can cost nearly a quarter more than the average in the States. The lack of cheaply available fresh produce has created a heavy reliance on processed foods, increasing the rates of diseases such as diabetes. With such unstable electricity, Puerto Ricans who try to buy more healthful, fresh foods risk wasting money when the latest outage leaves dairy or fruit to spoil in the Caribbean heat without refrigeration. If that wasn’t enough, the bankruptcy courts handling the mammoth debt Puerto Rico’s utility accrued before the storm want to add a surcharge to every ratepayer’s bill for the next three decades to pay off what critics call the Wall Street equivalent of loan sharks. A broad coalition of activists and business groups opposed the rate hike last year. Negotiations over how to restructure the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority’s outstanding $9 billion in bond debt are ongoing , with recent proposals appearing to yield some progress . In the meantime, however, system problems that might take a few hours or days to fix in the U.S. cause ongoing disasters in Puerto Rico. Last week, a transformer blew out at one of LUMA’s substations on the south coast, a region already beset by deadly pollution from the territory’s largest coal-fired power plant and water shortages linked to overuse by a nearby cluster of agrichemical industrial facilities. In response, LUMA instituted a schedule of rolling blackouts in the area, cutting off service every day for eight hours at a time in Santa Isabel and the neighboring towns of Coamo and Aibonito. With the U.S. facing a nationwide transformer shortage , LUMA said repairs could take five to seven weeks , effectively cutting off electricity for much of the day during what is forecast to be a particularly hot summer. The mayors of the towns called the wait time “unacceptable.” Before Hurricane Maria, five transmission lines connected the substation in Santa Isabel to the power system directly to the east to the industrial town of Guayama, with one serving as the primary conduit and the other four providing backup. After the storm, the area around Santa Isabel became a closed-loop system, meaning losing a transformer causes major problems. Erecting poles and stringing insulated power lines to reconnect the substation to Guayama would take five to six days, according to Rafael Machado, the retired southern regional director in charge of transmission at PREPA who happens to live in Santa Isabel. Doing so, however, would require LUMA to spend its own money now rather than wait for federal funds to come through for an already planned project nearby. “For as bad as it was, PREPA was a service agency,” Machado said of the state-owned utility that ran the electrical system until 2021. “LUMA is a business.” If LUMA “can put less money into the operations of the system, that money is going to go back to their pockets and their shareholders,” he said. “I can handle this, but there’s a lot of people who don’t have a generator in their house, and don’t have family to help them out. It is crazy. It is fucked up.” The cost of waiting for federal dollars to come through is borne by “the 80-year-olds, even 90-year-olds, and the kids 10 years and under who have been suffering this,” said Machado, who retired in 2014. “I can handle this, but there’s a lot of people who don’t have a generator in their house, and don’t have family to help them out,” he said. “It is crazy. It is fucked up.” LUMA did not respond to questions emailed Monday. An official from the bankrupt government utility whose services LUMA privatized said fixing the substation should take no longer than two weeks but admitted he has no power over the company’s operations. Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi’s office said LUMA is taking “short term works” to restore service in the southern towns, including “increasing capacity on one of the electric lines” and installing a portable generator. “The permanent works to address the cause of the issue include replacing a transformer unit are ongoing and will still take additional time to be completed as this includes a complex transportation among other specialized works,” Francisco Berríos, the governor’s assistant chief of staff for energy affairs, told HuffPost in an emailed statement. “As the works to modernize the electric system continue to accelerate, we are requiring LUMA to improve their performance during this type of emergency situations where customers suffer interruptions.” Last June, just days after LUMA celebrated its second anniversary as Puerto Rico’s new private power seller, a record-breaking heat wave sent thermometers soaring to 125 degrees Fahrenheit. The still-tattered grid heaved under demand for air conditioning, triggering a blackout that saw more than 100,000 lose power. The prolonged blackouts over the past year cast doubt over LUMA’s capacity to quickly restore power after the next major hurricane. Combined with the effects of human-caused climate change, the regular El Niño climate patterns that intensified heating in the Caribbean Sea this year are expected to drive a fierce hurricane season in the Atlantic. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted with 85% certainty that this season will be “above normal” for hurricanes, with as many as 25 storms strong enough to earn names. Santiago feels helpless ― and scared. She cannot afford a generator, so she charges her phone in her car or at the emergency room in nearby Salinas. A diabetic, she said her body reacts worse to heat than someone with naturally regulated insulin. When she gets dehydrated, she said, “It’s twice as bad.” When electricity is out, the water pumps stop working, so she’s dependent on bottled water. But “no one brings water,” so she’s on her own to purchase that, too. Her one reprieve, she said, comes from going to the shopping mall ― not to buy anything, just to cool down with the retailers’ air conditioning. “There is no word for it,” she said. “You almost feel like you are going to faint.” Hours after this article initially published, equipment exploded at a San Juan electrical facility and left as many as 186,000 without electricity, El Vocero reported, showing photos of black smoke billowing from the disabled plant. By about 9 p.m. EDT , more than 40,000 households across the densely populated capital region remained cut off from the grid. This article was updated to include details of the San Juan blackout.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer Recently, my cousin got me a ticket to a comedy show entirely in Spanish. At the Hollywood Improv, Venezuelan-born comedian Angelo Colina and Netflix organized for five stand-ups to perform for a full room of Colombians, Mexicans, Venezuelans, Salvadorans, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans. At first, I didn’t want to go. I speak Spanish, kind of. My mother was born and raised in Puerto Rico. She moved to the States at 18, met and married my white father, and raised two boys in this country. She somehow managed to preserve Spanish in the household, imprinting the language deeply for both my brother and me. But the tongue is a muscle and it requires exercise, like any other. Without regular practice, my fluency fails me. I was afraid regional accents and slang would inhibit my understanding, like an English learner being dropped in Deep Arkansas or South Boston. I nevertheless forced myself to attend. Once there, I howled with laughter. I was surprised to find I followed a good 90% of the humor. I wish that’s how it ended: Bilingual boy loses Spanish, goes to funny ha-ha show, and reclaims his identity. Unfortunately, there’s a twist. I’ve been half-this and half-that my whole life; it’s fitting, then, that I’m also half deaf. Nearly a decade ago, I lost 100% of the hearing in my right ear. It’s called idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, or ISSHL. I’m still not quite sure what sensorineural means, but idiopathic is defined as a condition that arises spontaneously, for which the cause is unknown. What’s more, it’s accompanied by severe tinnitus , which I’ve learned to kind of tune out but still affects my brain’s ability to interpret sound. I haven’t known real silence for nine years. In public places with many people talking at once, (which is just about any social situation ever), it’s difficult for me to hear. I can do one-on-one decently if I turn to “look” at people with my left ear. But at dinner parties, crowded bars, or even just walking down the street, unless the speaker is directly to my left, it all blends together. Obviously, the loss severely impacted my life. I mourned the physiological damage, but was unprepared for how it would affect my cultural identity. The first time I traveled to Puerto Rico after my disability struck is seared into my memory. My aunt picked me up from the airport in the evening, and took me to a group dinner at a fancy Italian bistro with her friends. There were about six women in a private room in the back. We were at one table, separated from the main room by large panels of glass, a material that reverberates and echoes in peculiar ways. Within 90 seconds of entering this luxury dungeon with terrible acoustics, I found I understood nothing. I used to be charming in Spanish, maybe even a little witty. But if you want to be witty, you have to listen. And you can’t listen if you can’t hear. I have to really focus when I’m speaking Spanish. Apart from the times I’ve lived in a Latin American country, my ear doesn’t receive the regular exposure necessary for passive understanding. Have you ever accidentally eavesdropped on a stranger in another conversation? Not me. At least not in Spanish. But that night, no amount of effort would save me. With what little I could hear, understand and process, I lost my confidence, and the will to even participate. I felt like a 4-year-old, unable to take part in the adult discussion. I could have been working on a coloring book, for all I was able to participate. What’s more, I blamed myself. I was so miserable, I could barely mutter my goodbyes to the cadre of nice ladies on the sidewalk as we parted ways. I felt, in that moment, that I’d lost my hearing all over again, along with a part of myself. A part of me that my parents had worked hard to instill in me, that I’d put work into maintaining. Physically, I don’t look at all Hispanic, and my connection to my language was how I flew my cultural flag. I smile and greet the workers at the Hispanic markets when I need the good beans. Back where I grew up was a Salvadoran-owned pool hall where I always spoke up early and fluently, just to let them know I was “cool.” It was my way of expressing kinship. It just feels good to belong. Polyglots will understand that a single speaker can have different personalities in different languages. My mother, a classic baby boomer, rarely is (purposefully) funny in English, although she has a silly, self-effacing streak, made more amiable by her accent. Yet, once she’s among family and the language shifts to Spanish, she’s witty, with a venomous comic timing that has left me in tears. In Spanish, my mother is hilarious. In Spanish, now, I’m kind of an asshole. Back at the Improv on Melrose, the show let out and the spectator portion of the evening was over. My cousin, Gaby, grew up with one of the comedians, and there was a healthy Puerto Rican diaspora that took over the front bar section. Everybody knew each other, and Gaby was eager to introduce me to her friends. I went prepared to not be able to talk to anyone. In truth, I almost didn’t go at all, for fear of this exact moment. There was even a director there, a friend of Gaby’s, who released a big-time feature last year. As a writer, industry contacts like this are manna from heaven. Anyone in my position would have seized the opportunity to introduce themselves and offer to buy this guy a drink. I chickened out. It wasn’t even that noisy in the room, but the stigma of my disability and its effects have ossified my cultural personality. I couldn’t bear stumbling through a conversation, asking everyone to repeat what they said three times. Or, what’s worse, giving the impression I never cared enough to practice my Spanish. I’d rather people assume that I’m shy or awkward than think I’m a lapsed Puerto Rican. I clung to the walls, checking my phone for no reason at all. When my cousin invited me to join the remaining group for dinner, I was immediately transported back to that Italian bistro in Puerto Rico, with the glass walls and the shame. I declined. It would have been easy to introduce myself to this potential professional contact, even if I didn’t join them for dinner. Instead, I outran my shame, catching my breath a few blocks later. As I made my way home, thoughts continued to swirl about my future, which is becoming the product of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Medical advances in hearing are rare, and specialists have told me this affliction is likely to last my whole life. In general, I seek out social interactions in which I’m paired with one or possibly two people. My friends are accommodating, always saving me a seat at the proper corner of the table. I’ve come to accept almost everything about my disability. Everything except this. I’m OK with being a wallflower in a noisy, all-English environment. Ironically, it allows me to be more observant. And who really misses small talk? All my conversations are that much more intimate, because they’re close-up, because they’re exclusive. The Spanish is the one part I’m still angry and depressed about. I’m thankful for the hearing I still have, although I’m anxious about the effects as I age. Hearing loss, and the social isolation it begets, have been linked to a decrease in cognitive function later in life. I’ve already had one cultural leg swept out from under me. In another 20 years, will I begin losing English the way I’m currently losing Spanish? When you’re split between two cultures, it’s like trying to walk around with only one shoe. You hobble around, constantly off-balance, hoping that no barefoot or shoed people ask you for an explanation. For now, I’m still consumed with how other people see me, rather than how I feel about myself. Had I gone to dinner or shook that director’s hand, in all likelihood no one would have noticed, or even cared, that my Spanish wasn’t equal to theirs. Culture is dynamic, even if for the moment, I feel stagnant. This time, I failed to affirm my identity, but there will be another comedy show. And even though it hasn’t yet, I assuage myself with the belief that acceptance will come. Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Biden administration on Wednesday after the White House said it would effectively shut out asylum seekers who attempt to cross the country’s southern border from Mexico. President Joe Biden unveiled the plans earlier this month, after chastising Republicans for tanking a bipartisan border deal in February. The new executive action prohibits migrants along the border from being granted asylum when the system is “overwhelmed,” as defined by the White House under the new rules. The White House had been working on the move for months, as immigration policy is sure to play a central role in the November election. The ACLU, which sued alongside other civil rights groups, compared Biden’s actions to those of his predecessor, former President Donald Trump , which were ultimately blocked in federal court. “We were left with no alternative but to sue,” Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants Rights Project, said in a statement. “The administration lacks unilateral authority to override Congress and bar asylum based on how one enters the country, a point the courts made crystal clear when the Trump administration unsuccessfully tried a near-identical ban.” BREAKING: We're suing the Biden administration over executive actions that severely restrict asylum and put thousands of lives at risk. These actions follow the approach of the Trump administration’s previous asylum entry ban, which we successfully challenged in court. The White House rejected those assertions in a statement on Wednesday night, reiterating that the president had no choice after the GOP stymied efforts to up border security and funding. “The Biden-Harris administration took these actions, within its authorities, because border encounters remain too high and after Congressional Republicans twice voted against a historic bipartisan border security agreement that would have provided critical resources, statutory changes and additional personnel to the border,” a White House spokesperson said in a statement. “The administration will continue to enforce our immigration laws — those without a legal basis to remain in the United States will be removed.” The new rules, which went into effect last week, limit the processing of new asylum applicants as soon as the number of average migrant encounters at the southern border tops 2,500 a day. At the time of the order, that figure was much higher, at about 4,000 a day, according to the Associated Press. At times, including last December, there were more than 10,000 encounters each day . The temporary bans can only be lifted two weeks after average numbers of migrant encounters drop below 1,500 a day. As The New York Times notes , many people intentionally cross the border and then turn themselves in to border agents to begin the asylum process. Doing so allows them to remain in the U.S. for years while they await their court appearances — but under Biden’s executive action, migrants can be returned to Mexico or their home countries in a matter of days or hours, and would-be asylum seekers need to prove they have reason to fear being tortured if they’re sent back. The ACLU said in its suit Wednesday the country had long “sheltered refugees seeking a haven from persecution.” “While Congress has placed some limitations on the right to seek asylum over the years, it has never permitted the Executive Branch to categorically ban asylum based on where a noncitizen enters the country,” the group wrote in the lawsuit.

    "article_content": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Luck struck twice for a Kentucky couple who thought they lost a winning Powerball ticket. The Bowling Green couple found out in November that they had won $50,000 but couldn’t find the ticket they had purchased about a week before, the Kentucky Lottery said in a news release. Mark Perdue said the owner at AM Express congratulated him when he walked into the convenience store. “I said, ‘for what?’ And she said, ‘You won the lottery.’ I said, ‘I wish.’ She said, ‘You did, I have you on video.’” He and his wife then looked but couldn’t find the ticket and thought it might have been thrown away. “I’ve been beating myself up for three months thinking I threw this ticket away,” his wife said. Then in February, Perdue, who is president of Kiriu USA, went to check out the condition of a company car and saw the ticket inside. The car, which isn’t used often, was needed because a visitor from another plant was in town and needed to use a company vehicle. “I don’t know how long it might have sat out there if I hadn’t needed the car,” Perdue said. “I was shaking a little bit.” He told his wife and the next day they went to lottery headquarters, where they received a check for $36,000 after taxes, the lottery statement said. The couple said they plan to pay off bills and may take a trip.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost In 2024, being a food influencer seems like a pretty great gig. Influencers get to sit at home and bake delicious food, take pictures and videos of it, and then eat it (or give it to their friends, who will love them extra for it). As their follower counts grow on Instagram and TikTok, their feeds and Stories become populated with ads, for which we all assume they’re getting a solid chunk of change. But how much, exactly? According to Alice, an influencer and cookbook author whose name has been changed here to protect her identity, the truth is that it varies widely. Alice has about 500,000 Instagram followers, but pay rates don’t always depend on the amount of followers someone has. “There’s a super broad range — I know influencers who have 500,000 followers and are making $150,000 a year, and I know ones with the same following who are making a million dollars a year,” she said. “It’s all about your engagement and how you monetize.” While Alice asked to remain anonymous, she was willing to get real about how much money she makes as a food influencer and recipe developer. Read on for all the juicy details, like how much she actually gets from ads, what her expenses look like, and exactly how much money she made in 2023 ― and how that stacks up against the mental health toll of being an influencer. You know that sponsored reel you just watched in your favorite influencer’s feed? They probably made a lot of money on it. “If you have 500,000 followers, you can probably expect to make about $10,000 to $20,000 on an Instagram reel, but that will depend on your engagement,” Alice said. By “engagement,” she means the number of people actually liking or commenting on posts. An influencer can have a lot of followers, but if those followers aren’t engaging with their account, a brand knows they won’t see much conversion from that. For Instagram Stories, Alice says an influencer will probably make a little bit less. “For three to five Instagram Stories, you can probably expect to get between $1,000 and $5,000, but again, there’s a range.” While influencers might make a lot of money, they’re also spending it. “Expenses are high, especially for recipe development,” Alice said. “But I think a huge expense people don’t think about is looking good on camera, so lots of influencers spend a ton on hair, makeup and clothing, and feel a lot of pressure around how they look because they’re on camera all the time. I probably spend around $1,000 a month on all of this.” She also has a team of people helping her out, and they get a chunk of her monthly revenue as well. “Your manager or agent will take 15%,” she said. “If you’re an author and have a literary agent, they take 15% of your earnings. If you pay for PR it’s $5,000 to $10,000 a month. And lawyer costs (yes, lawyers are advised) are between $10,000 and $30,000 per year.” Now, the question you’ve all been waiting for: How much did Alice make in 2023? “I made about $900,000,” she said. “But that’s before expenses and taxes. And I had a lot of expenses last year.” Alice also noted that while she has published three books over the past seven years, including one in 2023, they don’t bring in much money compared with what she makes from social media and other avenues. “Books are great brand builders, but they’re not huge moneymakers,” she said. She added that for people who are pulling in salaries like hers and higher, there’s usually more to their income stream than Instagram ads and cookbooks. “The people making the most typically have other income streams like Substack, podcasts, merch, or a company they started.” Does Alice make more money than most of us could ever dream of? Sure. But she also emphasized that there’s a mental health toll that comes from being always “on” and feeling the need to produce content for her followers 24/7 — not to mention the negative comments and messages that an influencer can expect to receive regularly. “I took zero days off last year,” she said. “I think if you’re going to talk influencer income, you also need to talk about how the vast majority of influencers are dealing with huge mental health issues from the job.” So while the world of influencing may be high-paying and glamorous, Alice is the first to admit that it comes with a price — and not the price you’re paying your lawyer or literary agent.

    "article_content": "Parenting reporter In this post-pandemic era, many employees work remotely. Logging on from home can help people manage their professional and personal responsibilities, allowing someone to pick up their children from school, for example, or squeeze in a workout during a lunch break. But remote work has also blurred the line that marks where the workplace ends and home begins, with many workers hopping back online throughout the evening and into the night to complete their assigned tasks before a deadline. The struggle to achieve that elusive work-life balance remains. An employer’s policies and workplace culture have a huge impact on how you are able to juggle work and a personal life, but the country you reside in also plays a decisive role. Laws regarding paid leave vary considerably across the globe, as does the average number of hours that workers put in. Compare the Market Australia, a company that provides comparisons of insurance rates, recently ranked 40 countries by the work-life balance they offer. Each nation’s 2024 standing was determined by eight factors: the average number of hours worked per year, minimums regarding paid annual leave and sick leave, maternity and paternity leave lengths and rates, and the country’s happiness score , based on Gallup World Poll surveys. “Each of the factors was weighted equally when producing the final score,” Hannah Norton, a spokesperson for Compare the Market, told HuffPost. Nations in Europe dominated the entire first half of the list, “which indicates that the region does a great job of supporting employees in maintaining a positive work-life balance,” Norton said. Spain clinched the No. 1 spot, offering workers 30 days of annual paid leave and six (or more) weeks of paid sick leave, while also paying parents 100% of their salaries during their leaves. Most notably, Spain extends similar leaves to both mothers (16 weeks) and fathers (12 weeks), and grants significantly more leave to dads than most other countries. The next most generous paternal leaves are found in neighboring Portugal (five weeks at 100%) and Slovenia (four weeks at 100%). The first 20 countries on the list are: All of these countries offer 20-30 paid vacation days and six or more weeks of paid sick leave annually. Bulgaria offers the most maternity leave by far: 58 weeks at 90%. Greece offers no paternity leave at all, while the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy and Romania offer only one week. People in Germany (which does not rank in the top 20 overall) work the fewest hours annually, averaging 1,340.9. Workers in Denmark are next, logging 1,371.6 hours, followed by Norwegians at 1,424.6. Denmark also achieved one of the highest scores on the happiness index, topped only by Finland . Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria were high scorers as well. South American countries (none of which appears in the top 20 overall) earned the top three slots for the most hours worked. Colombians log the most, with 2,405.5 hours a year — 1.8 times as many as German workers. Mexico (with 2,226.3 hours) and Chile (with 1,962.8 hours) are close behind. In the U.S., the average for workers falls between their South American and European counterparts, at 1,810.9 hours worked per year. But it is our dismal lack of paid leave — annual, sick and family — that earned us the very last spot on the list overall. Canada and Ireland also ranked toward the bottom, Norton said. Surprisingly, then, the U.S. “performed reasonably well when it came to happiness score — the nation was 14th out of 40 countries for this factor, with a happiness score of 6.89,” Norton said. While we may be relatively happy overall, the early years of parenthood are a time of intense pressure for many U.S. families, who struggle to care for their children and make a living without the guarantees of paid leave or subsidized child care . Sherry Leiwant , a co-founder and co-president of A Better Balance, an organization that advocates for workers, described the situation to HuffPost: “At present, only 27% of private sector workers in the U.S. have access to paid family leave, which translates to almost 100 million U.S. workers without any access to paid family leave.” Yet these numbers have improved dramatically, Leiwant explained. In 2010, only 12% of private sector workers had access to paid family leave. These battles have been won not in boardrooms but in state legislatures, with 13 states plus Washington, D.C., having passed laws guaranteeing some weeks of family leave paid at a portion of a worker’s salary. Still, the situation remains a “crisis,” Dawn Huckelbridge , the director of Paid Leave for All, an advocacy organization, told HuffPost. “As it stands, the United States is one of seven countries in the world that guarantees no form of paid leave for its people,” she said. “Only 1 in 4 of us have paid family leave through our jobs — and among the lowest-paid workers, it’s only 6%.” A mother returning to work just days after giving birth is a uniquely American phenomenon, Huckelbridge said. And the repercussions can be devastating. Families face losing their housing or food security if they are forced to take unpaid leave or quit their jobs to care for a family member. Paid leave, on the other hand, not only protects families from poverty, but keeps women connected to the workforce. “Paid leave is a tool for public health; it reduces infant and maternal mortality and postpartum depression, it improves physical and mental health for whole families and communities,” Huckelbridge said. Though critics often suggest that paid leave would be bad for business, advocates say that the opposite is true. Paid leave “enables employers to offer a benefit to their workers at very little cost to them,” Leiwant said. “The advantage for smaller or less profitable businesses is especially strong since those employers don’t have the resources to offer a strong paid family leave benefit and can’t compete on this important employee benefit with larger employers who can offer it.” Because the premiums for such programs (in the states where they have been enacted) “are spread out over all workers and employers,” they remain low and affordable for businesses, Leiwant noted. “The cost of premiums has been consistently small because it is spread out over all workers and employers in the state to pay benefits only when there is a covered need,” she continued. “Premium costs have remained low in all states (under 1%) and if premiums were spread out among all U.S. workers the costs would be similarly low for a national program.” Both Leiwant and Huckelbridge noted that the estimated economic loss of not having paid leave on a national level is around $22 billion per year. “Nearly every other country in the world has figured this out,” Huckelbridge said. “If we want to remain competitive in the world and a 21st century economy, we can’t afford not to pass paid leave.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Tax season has rolled around once again, and so has the inevitable dread that comes with it. It’s understandable that a lot of us worry we’ll make one small, accidental mistake and then get in “big trouble” with the IRS after. W hen it comes to something as complicated and serious as taxes, it’s sometimes hard to feel confident that you’re doing it right. Enter accountants. Their entire job is to make sure their clients’ taxes ― and their own taxes ― are all squared away and mistake free. That’s why we asked them to share what they personally would never do (and warn others from doing) when filing. Steal their secrets below as you work on yours: For one, this means reporting all of your income, no matter how small. “If I were to file my tax return without reporting some income that was reported to me on my tax return, the IRS would likely catch it, calculate what my taxes should have been had I reported that income — often without giving me any credit for legitimate deductions or basis against that income — and send me a CP2000 notice,” said Logan Allec , a CPA and the owner of tax relief company Choice Tax Relief. He added that CP2000 notices are a pain to deal with and “might even propose to assess a substantial understatement penalty, which can be quite large.” Documentation regards more than just income, too. To figure out what documents you specifically need to file, check out an individualized tax document checklist . For example, you may have extra documentation if you have dependents, student loans and more. Additionally, Allec suggested the following: Alternatively, another approach is to pull the wage and income transcript for the year directly from the IRS, he said, which shows all the tax documents that were issued to you that year. “However, since wage and income transcripts for last year typically aren’t ready until late spring or summer of the current year, I would have to file an extension of time to file and also ensure that I had paid in all the taxes I owe for last year (or my best estimate of this amount) by the original deadline,” he continued. It’s indeed OK to ask for an extension if needed, according to Victoria Rothbauer , a CPA and member experience manager at Collective , a back office platform for entrepreneurs. “An extension is just a tool to help relieve stress and ensure taxes are accurate,” she said. “They are free to file and, contrary to popular belief, it doesn’t raise red flags if you file an extension.” (You can file for an extension on the IRS website .) Further, rushing increases the risk of making a mistake, she continued, and extra time can be used to research tax deductions and make retirement contributions, which lower your taxable income. “Just keep in mind an extension gives you more time to file your taxes, not pay them,” she said. Paying late can result in extra fees . Don’t write off items without doing your due diligence. “There’s a lot of bad advice out there promoting overly aggressive tax strategies without fully explaining the rules or requirements to take advantage of these deductions,” Allec said. “A common one is using bonus depreciation to write off the majority of the cost of a new car against your business income this year,” he continued. That’s not automatically illegitimate, he said, just one to be careful about since the rules and requirements are complex. “If you don’t want to spend the time researching the rules yourself, hire a tax professional to do your taxes for you,” he recommended. “The cost of doing so will be much less than the cost of hiring a professional to defend you in an IRS audit.” Rothbauer also stressed that it’s best to understand what counts (and doesn’t count) as a tax deduction. “There are several deductions available to people who work for themselves, but the IRS maintains that anything deducted needs to be exclusively used for business,” she said. The rules around that are fairly strict, too. She recalled clients asking about emotional support animals, exercise bikes in the home office, event tickets for wooing new clients, home office space used to entertain guests, and wedding or event costs for content creators — all of which can’t be deducted, she said, since they aren’t used exclusively for business purposes (as helpful as they may be). But all is not lost. “I would familiarize myself with what is deductive instead,” she said. She listed potential examples that can save you a lot of money, such as retirement plans for the self-employed, charitable donations, portions of a home office and certain mileage. For those who don’t know, Schedule C , aka Form 1040, is where you “report income or loss from a business you operated or a profession you practiced as a sole proprietor,” according to the IRS website. “The IRS loves auditing individual taxpayers who report large business losses on Schedule C, especially if the taxpayer is using this loss to offset other income, such as W-2 wage income, to lower their tax bill,” Allec said. If your business did have actual loss for the year, he recommended keeping very good books and receipts throughout the year to substantiate the loss. That way, if you are audited, he said, it will hopefully end in “no-change” audit result. For those in the creator economy , this one is especially important to note. “Running a solo business is becoming increasingly accessible, and people are realizing that they can profitably pursue their passions,” Rothbauer said. “But a lot of these business owners don’t understand what tax options are available to them, and one that is missed out on a lot is the S Corp election.” Basically, it can help with self-employment taxes. “When an LLC or C Corp owner elects ‘Subchapter S’ as their tax status, their business is considered a pass-through entity, so the owner can split their earnings between payroll and business profits, easing the burden of self-employment tax,” Rothbauer explained. “For many, it can potentially be a difference of thousands of dollars in taxes each year.” This tax status isn’t viable or the best option for everyone who’s self-employed, however. Rothbauer said it’s not available to sole proprietorships, and it only makes sense once someone is making a profit of $60,000 a year or more. Finally, don’t forget to double check your work before submitting. And remember that if this information (or just the idea of tax season) stresses you out, you’re not alone.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life From “hush trips” to “slow travel,” there’s no shortage of new travel trends and terminology these days. But one that has taken particular hold on social media and IRL is the concept of “dupe travel” or “travel dupes.” Indeed, Instagram and TikTok are flooded with inspiration and information about this increasingly popular approach to choosing a destination. But what exactly is a dupe travel, and how does it work? Below, experts break down the benefits and downsides of this trend. “Travel dupes are a current trend where folks are seeking out cheaper, less-crowded alternatives to popular destinations, but where they can still enjoy many of the same attractions or cultural activities,” said Eric Rosen , the director of travel content at the website The Points Guy. In recent years, we’ve seen airfare, hotel rates and other travel expenses increase significantly , so it’s only natural people would pursue more cost-effective options that allow them to get a taste of the wanderlust magic that’s all over Instagram and TikTok without breaking the bank. “I define [a travel dupe] as a location with a similar aesthetic look to a famous city or tourist attraction,” said Gabby Beckford , the founder of travel site Packs Light. “Like visiting the Philippines for stunning Southeast Asian beaches instead of Thailand or the beaches of Turkiye instead of Greece.” The idea is to avoid overpriced hot spots and discover destinations that offer similar vibes without the massive crowds and high prices. Think Slovenia instead of Italy, Quebec City instead of Geneva or Liverpool instead of London. “Some examples are going to Portugal instead of Italy, Antwerp instead of Paris, or a slightly different variation is going to smaller, lesser-known islands in Greece instead of Santorini or Mykonos,” said Wendy Diep, the co-founder of group travel app Let’s Jetty . She noted that millennial and Gen Z travelers tend to be more flexible when it comes to travel, which helps them pursue their goal of exploring new places while saving money. “They’re not necessarily saying ‘Hey, I really have to go to X, Y, and Z,’ but rather looking to sightsee while experiencing local culture,” Diep said. “And they aim to visit places that are off the beaten path, so it’s also part of the appeal.” “There are multiple benefits to dupe travel,” Diep noted. “One of the biggest is obviously cost savings. You can save money on accommodations and airfare, particularly since prices at hot spots are usually set at premiums because of demand.” “And even more, when you visit destinations where the costs of living might be lower, or things aren’t marked up because of heavy tourism, you’re able to stretch your money further, which allows you to do more, or even have luxe experiences you wouldn’t necessarily be able to afford everywhere,” she added. Diep also touted the ability to have a more authentic travel experience and get a real feel for the place when you choose a less touristy destination. “Among the benefits of dupe travel are discovering exciting, under-the-radar destinations that you might not have considered otherwise ― Albania for its beaches, forest-covered mountains and fabulous wines instead of the French or Italian rivieras, or the sleepy beaches of 30A along Florida’s Gulf Coast instead of the crowded club touristy shores of Miami Beach ― all while saving money compared to more well-known hot spots,” Rosen said. In this day and age, social media is filled with travelers sharing new destination ideas and money-saving travel hacks, so you don’t even have to put in too much effort to get creative and savvy with your next vacation. Connor Smith, vice president of masterbrand strategy at IHG Hotels & Resorts noted that the #dupe hashtag on TikTok has more than 6.5 billion views, reflecting the wealth of information available to travelers and consumers looking to avoid the sticker shock of shopping and vacationing in recent years. He recommended checking out Krakow instead of Rome, Chattanooga instead of Asheville, Belfast instead of London and Memphis instead of Nashville. “These alternative destinations tend to be more budget-friendly, so your travel budget can stretch further in terms of accommodation, dining and activities,” he explained. “Dupe travel also encourages travelers to push their boundaries and explore new destinations and cultures that they might not have considered otherwise. Going off the beaten path can offer a more immersive cultural experience, as these destinations may have more opportunities to connect with locals.” “Because they might be less popular, dupe destinations might not offer as many transportation options, including flights, trains or easily available rental cars as bigger cities,” Rosen said. And although you can find great social media posts about pretty much any destination these days, you will likely have to do a bit more digging to find reliable, up-to-date information on places to stay and things to do. “Finally, once these destinations do start to permeate the consciousness of avid travelers, there’s always a danger that they can become as overrun as the places to which they were providing alternatives ― without the well-established tourism infrastructure to handle the swelling crowds,” Rosen added. Keep in mind that no two destinations are exactly alike, either. “Tourists should be realistic that it won’t be a true replacement,” Beckford said. “There’s no way to replace a country’s culture, language, experiences, or even ambience.” Be honest about your vacation goals and whether you’re gravitating toward a popular destination for specific cultural elements or if you’re just looking for a pretty beach and nice sunset. Dupe travel should really be about travel alternatives, rather than replacements. “Before you book one of these trips, be sure to ask yourself: What is my priority?” said Adam Duckworth , the president and founder of the travel agency Travelmation. “If you want to see the Eiffel Tower, then you have to go to Paris. If you want to cruise the Venice canals, there truly is no alternative. These smaller cities may also have much less to do.” If you’re avoiding Paris due to costs, he recommended going during the off-season instead. Erick Prince , a travel blogger and founder of travel site Minority Nomad, believes the travel dupe movement implicitly casts a negative light on the “dupes” in question. “It’s relegating alternative gems to second-class status, as if they’re merely backup plans instead of destinations worthy of their own spotlights,” he said. “Instead of celebrating them for the wonders they are, they’re relegated to the role of understudies.” He emphasized that popular destinations are popular for real reasons, whether it’s the amazing street food of Bangkok, breathtaking sunsets in Istanbul or incomparable energy of Carnival in Rio. “It’s downright unfair, and frankly, a bit disingenuous, to pit places like Chiang Mai, Izmir, or Salvador against these heavyweights as if they’re contestants in some sort of travel showdown,” Prince said. “Each of these destinations has its own unique allures, their own stories to tell, and their own merits for exploration.” Although the dupe destination trend doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, he challenged travelers to reframe the way they see these alternatives. “At the end of the day, travel should be about bringing people together, not drawing lines in the sand,” Prince said. “It’s about embracing the rich tapestry of cultures and experiences that this world has to offer, not picking winners and losers. So let’s ditch the exclusionary mindset and open our arms to the diversity of this beautiful planet we call home.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Here are some of the top-voted answers: We also included responses from other Reddit threads here and here . 1. “They wear very nice clothing without any brand identification.” – u/BobbyB90220 “Exactly. Gucci and Prada and all that is for absolute SUCKERS. I have a friend who’s a trust fund baby in the nine-figure range – zero logos anywhere.” – u/JuanPancake “I used to do remodeling/carpentry in a very wealthy town here in New Jersey. I never caught any of these people wearing clothes covered in LV logos or Gucci signs. If they weren’t dressed in a suit for work, they wore solid-colored T-shirts with khakis or jeans and running shoes.” – u/Jeterea 2. “They are quiet when the discussion is about cost of living pressures, and will deflect the questions from themselves and/or nudge the conversation into a different direction.” – u/hdhdhdhdzjursx “Most of the time, they will stay quiet about money, but never balk when presented with a bill.” – u/veleriphon 3. “Casually having expensive hobbies. Stuff like sailing, skiing, and golfing. Especially in areas where those activities aren’t as accessible, and if they’ve been doing it for a long time. You live in the Midwest, but you’ve been surfing since you were 10? Probably rich.” – u/belowthemask42 4. “They have a certain ease with which they move about the world that you have to see to understand.” – u/Loud-Feeling2410 5. “Minimalist homes. I don’t know why, but many rich people like the simple aesthetic, which honestly doesn’t feel homey. They’d rather live with very few things.” – u/Inevitable_snow_gal “Once you know you have money to replace things, it’s much easier to let go of them. Minimalist decor aesthetics are very rooted in this idea.” – u/kharmatika “Minimalism is for people who didn’t grow up saving all the plastic food tubs to use as Tupperware.” – u/stuck_behind_a_truck 6. “They will be very selective in those they choose to be friends with, for various legal reasons.” – u/veleriphon “I went to high school with the offspring of millionaires and billionaires, and something that I always noticed was how close sibling groups are. It’s because they exist in the same space in life, they understand what that means, and they don’t have to worry about each other’s intentions.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer Search the term “tradwife” on TikTok and you’ll find thousands of carefully curated videos from creators like 26-year-old Estee Williams from Richmond, Virginia, and Hannah Neeleman, also known as Ballerina Farm , who has amassed 7 million followers sharing cooking and homemaking videos from her Utah farmhouse. The videos feature a soft life aesthetic: modern women clad in ’50s housewife aprons, baking bread and arranging flowers in full makeup and perfectly styled hair. The content is appealing. Williams’ TikTok has 1.3 million likes across her videos touting the benefits of relying on a partner to take care of you. In that regard, I was also a tradwife throughout my 12-year marriage. Throughout my first marriage — in our early 20s — my husband and I muddled through, three young children in tow, making the best life we could. We eventually divorced, I became a single mom, and a bit more muddling ensued. I was always one step behind, stressed out, overworked and underemployed. Then I remarried. When I became pregnant with my youngest — with older kids in public school — my “advanced maternal age” and medical history made the pregnancy high risk. We agreed that I should quit my job. So I did, and immediately began nesting. I began creating the white picket fence life I thought I wanted. We even started homeschooling. If I was going to be home all day anyway, why not? I became a master of pinning craft ideas on Pinterest, meal planning and decorating my home. In 2019, I started working from home here and there, taking on ghostwriting and freelance work, but none of that money truly contributed to the household. I let my husband take care of everything related to running the home. He’s a CPA and financial adviser by trade, so why would I “worry my pretty little head” about any of that? Had I asked, he likely would have shared the details. Neither of us gave it much thought, though, and it worked well for a while. After our divorce hearing, I walked out of the local courthouse a homeowner, having been awarded the family home, but blissfully unaware of the ramifications. I was suddenly solely responsible for the home maintenance, utilities, property tax and homeowners insurance. I received a crash course on adulting. I was even hit with an HOA violation letter because my home needed a good pressure washing. Of course it did; my husband hadn’t lived there for nearly a year. A patch of lichen had taken up permanent residence on my mailbox. HOA and amenities fees were immediately due. The sprinklers needed to be programmed; with that, of course, a water bill increase. I would need to schedule and pay the lawn guy (that mulch wasn’t going to spread itself). I also quickly realized I’d better start budgeting some sinking funds for the property tax due after the holidays. My ex-husband and I just fell into traditional gender roles; it was easier than putting in the work. When he moved out, he struggled with working his air fryer, ordering delivery on his phone and navigating the grocery store. I hadn’t necessarily dug my head in the sand over the years, but I sure hadn’t been as proactive as I could have. Shari Rash is the founder and financial advisor at GWA Wealth . “I speak with women all the time, when out socially or at moms groups, that once they hear what I do for a living I get the response, ‘Oh, my husband handles all of that,’” she told HuffPost. Rash said that it’s often a significant event that prompts a person to act or become actively involved in managing their finances. Typically, this event tends to be something negative — perhaps the loss of a parent, unemployment, divorce, the death of a spouse, or even witnessing one of those events happen to someone close. According to a report by Bank of America , 94% of women believe that they will be personally responsible for their finances at some point during their lives, yet they are less involved in long-term financial decisions than their partners. Nearly half of the 3,500 women surveyed said they feel confident about their finances, but only 28% feel empowered to take action on them, the report says. Rash encourages women to take an active role in household finances, whether they work outside the home or not. “That doesn’t mean you’re tracking the stock market daily and day trading your accounts. It means you know what your household has and you’re included in the conversation,” she said. A parent’s hands-off approach to family finances has a larger effect within a family unit. “Kids are like little sponges, absorbing every detail of our behavior, especially when it comes to relationships and finances,” certified public accountant Maya Corbic said. ”They’re shaping their money mindset as they observe how we interact with money and each other. Everything they see, hear and feel becomes their perception of ‘normal.’” Corbic’s goal is to teach every child how to become a financially independent adult. “Many moms who attend my parent workshops share stories of how their upbringing influenced their views on finances,” she said. “For instance, some grew up in households where fathers solely made financial decisions, leading to the belief that only men handle investments. This perpetuates the notion that women shouldn’t be involved in financial matters and must rely on men for financial security.” Corbic advises parents to be aware of the messages they’re sending children and that they “consciously model healthy financial behaviors and empower them to develop a balanced and informed relationship with money.” One way to do this is by dedicating time each month to review the household budget, discuss spending habits and prioritize savings. “Regular ‘money dates’ serve as a cornerstone for financial harmony,” Corbic told HuffPost, adding that they promote transparency within the family and emphasize the importance of intentional discussions about family finances. Rash urges those who depend financially on their partner to immediately dig in and do the work. But this doesn’t just apply to those falling into traditional gender roles in their relationships; all adults who are sharing their lives with a partner can benefit from becoming more financially aware. Important topics to discuss with your partner include: For couples using the services of a financial adviser, Rash suggests you begin by asking yourself the following questions: “If you’re unable to answer those questions, that likely means you need to take some steps to get involved for your own protection,” Rash said. While I still have a long way to go, with each new experience, I gain the financial confidence and self-esteem that I lacked while living the tradwife lifestyle. I have an upcoming appointment with a CPA, opened an investment account, began paying more attention to my retirement accounts, and most importantly, I’m gaining skills, knowledge and wisdom that I can share with my children so that they can protect their financial futures.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life “Hi Grandma, it’s me. I need help. I’m in trouble, and I need money for bail. Please don’t tell Mom or Dad.” When your grandchild says they have an emergency, it’s normal to take their urgent request seriously, even if it seems out of character. But unfortunately, that’s just what scammers want you to do. The “grandparent scam” targeting senior victims is not new, but according to the FBI , it’s still working all too well. In late April, the FBI announced that 16 defendants had been charged in connection with a scheme to defraud older Americans. The scammers would call victims and impersonate grandchildren in a crisis. They typically claimed that they had been arrested after a car accident, and that they needed immediate funds from their grandparent for a lawyer or bail. In total, the FBI said , hundreds of Americans across the Northeast lost millions of dollars as a result. “Grandma, I love you and I trust you more than anyone,” one of the alleged scammers cries on a call with a victim, according to video found in the investigation. “Just do whatever he tells you to do.“ Mike Lemberger, Visa’s regional risk officer for North America, noted that it’s common for grandparent scammers to look up the grandparent online, in order to learn the grandchild’s name and impersonate them. “They’ll run this thing against 100 people. Maybe they got the grandchild’s name wrong on 10 of them ... The fraudster doesn’t care,” Lemberger said. “But on the 10 or 12 it got right and the one or two that fall for it, they’re making their money.” Scammers prey on heightened emotions, because when you are scared or worried, you’re less likely to listen to logic, and more likely to hand over thousands of dollars to a stranger. “That sense of urgency is what leads us to act. And that’s what you have to try to control,” said Kelly Richmond Pope, a professor of forensic accounting at DePaul University and the author of “ Fool Me Once: Scams, Stories, and Secrets from the Trillion-Dollar Fraud Industry .” “You can control your emotions and how you respond.” Here’s how: Just because the caller sounds like your grandchild does not guarantee that they are. With just a short audio clip from social media, artificial intelligence can clone a loved one’s voice, and sophisticated grandparent scams are using AI to impersonate the voices of grandkids, according to a 2023 Federal Trade Commission alert on grandparent scams. Amy Nofziger, the director of victim support for the AARP Fraud Watch Network, said the grandparent scam is effective because when a loved one is in trouble, we want to help. That’s why it’s more useful to pay attention to what the call is about than how it sounds. Nofziger said grandparents should ask themselves: “Even if it sounds like your grandson, what are they asking for?” “Don’t listen for the voice. Listen to the ask. If the ask is for money or personal information, it’s 100% a scam,” Nofziger said. Take the common bail-money demand. Nofziger said a real bail payment is unlikely to be done over the phone. In fact, bail is typically paid in court, in a jail facility or online. And be wary of anyone asking you to keep a secret from your family, because “that’s a huge red flag” of a scam, Nofziger said. She said it can also help to speak out loud and ask yourself: “Does this make sense that my grandson is calling me when he’s supposed to be at school?” Voicing aloud what’s happening to you can help you listen to common sense. Do not let your guard down even if caller ID says the call is a trusted source. Scammers can “spoof” a caller ID to make an incoming call appear like it’s coming from a familiar location. Nofziger gave the example of a caller ID saying the call is coming from your regional hospital. “So you pick up the phone and they’re like, ‘Hi, this is the ER, your grandchild’s been in an emergency, we need the insurance payment right away.’” In the scheme recently described by the FBI, the scammers used phone services to make the calls appear to be coming from the U.S., even though they originated from the Dominican Republic, according to court documents . Experts said having a secret family code word for these situations is less effective, because in stressful situations, it’s unlikely you’re going to remember the password. Or, if the code word is too easy, a scammer may be able to guess what it is. Besides, if the person sounds like your loved one, you may not realize you’re in any “kind of perceived danger,” Pope said. But what you can easily remember to do is to hang up and verify if the grandchild is OK. “Call the grandchild, call the parents of the grandchild at the phone number you have for them,” Nofziger recommended. Scammers win by isolating family members from their loved ones. That’s why one of the best prevention tools is role-playing different scenarios of what a grandparent scam can sound like. That way, grandparents can talk through what they should do if they get an emergency phone call about a supposed arrest, and they can discuss who they should call to verify an alarming story. When you care for an older loved one, you care about their health and safety. And part of that “is their financial health and safety,” Lemberger said. Prevention is the best defense, but if you or your loved one has lost money to a grandparent scam, there are still steps you can take swiftly: “The tough part about this is, once the money is gone, it’s typically gone,” Pope said about the aftermath of these fraudulent schemes. But you should still contact your bank or credit card company right away. In some limited cases, “we can get into the middle of a transaction,” Lemberger said. “And if it doesn’t look right to us, we may contact some folks and stop those transactions.” Losing thousands of dollars to fraud can wreak both emotional and financial damage on a family ― even if it didn’t happen directly to you. When a grandchild actually finds out that their grandparent lost $50,000 to help them, they often feel guilty, and “that’s a significant amount of trauma that they’re going to carry for some time,” Nofziger said. Nofziger noted that AARP has a free, facilitated peer discussion group that provides emotional support for victims of fraud and their families. In additional to reporting your situation to local law enforcement, you can call the National Elder Fraud Hotline, a Justice Department initiative, at 1-833-372-8311.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life As the summer travel season approaches, we’re once again reminded just how expensive taking a trip can be. Airline tickets continue to surge in cost, even outpacing inflation , so reaching the buzzy places where everyone somehow seems to be vacationing might not fit into even the most seasoned traveler’s budget. But before you give up on your dreams of visiting the beautiful international destinations that inundate TikTok and Instagram on a daily basis, just know that a golden opportunity could arise in the form of mistake fares. But what exactly are mistake fares and how do they work? Below, travel experts break down what you should know. “The term ‘mistake fare’ generally refers to an airline ticket price that is significantly different from historical norms and/or what an airline intended,” Nick Ewen , senior editorial director at The Points Guy, told HuffPost. He pointed to a well-publicized mistake fare from Cathay Pacific in 2018 that allowed travelers to book round-trip tickets between Vietnam and the United States for less than $700 in business class and under $1,000 in first class. “There’s not a definitive line between what makes for a ‘deal’ vs. a ‘mistake’ in this context, but usually a mistake fare is orders of magnitude lower than normal,” Ewen said. “For example, a $1,000 round-trip flight from the U.S. to Europe in business class could be a deal if it’s on a Tuesday in mid-January to Poland.” If the flight is on a peak summer travel date between the U.S. and Rome, however, that’s more likely to be a mistake. “Mistake fares happen when airlines incorrectly file the price of a given flight,” said Zach Griff , a senior reporter at The Points Guy. “One of the recent mistake fares I found was a $700 round-trip ticket in Air France first class from Algeria to New York. That ticket typically retails for over $10,000, so it’s pretty clear that something was wrong with how it was pricing. Just note that no airline website will market something as a mistake fare.” “Mistake fares can happen for many reasons, but some of the common reasons are currency conversion errors with travel agencies that incorrectly convert the fare into the local currency or vice versa, as well as fat-finger errors from revenue management analysts who potentially miss a digit when inputting a fare or file a fare for business class at the price of economy,” Griff said. Basically, an airline employee might accidentally leave off a zero or use the wrong fare code during the ticket pricing process, thus giving travelers the opportunity to snag business-class tickets for economy prices. The reason could be related to an automated system as well. “A pricing algorithm may be incorrectly calibrated to drop prices precipitously when demand drops,” Ewen said. “Or a currency conversion error may display the right number but in the wrong currency ― e.g., a flight that should be 5,000 U.S. dollars could show as 5,000 Hong Kong dollars, which is less than 650 U.S. dollars.” Although these situations do occur, the odds that you will stumble upon one of these magically low fares are low. “Mistake fares are like four-leaf clovers ― rare but not unheard of and very lucky,” said Katy Nastro, a spokesperson for the flight alert service Going . “They have become less common over the years due to better technology that rectifies the pricing before it becomes widely known.” “The benefit of a mistake fare would be scoring a great deal on airfare, but the number of mistake fares that have been honored in recent years is getting smaller and smaller,” Griff said. “Most travelers would be better off just purchasing flights when they feel that they’ve found a good deal than spending time trying to find the cheapest fare out there.” Also, just because you found a golden ticket doesn’t mean you get to use it. “Airlines have no legal requirement to honor mistake fares, which can mean that your purchased ticket might not be worth a seat on that flight,” Nastro said. “Airlines have been known not to honor mistake fares in the past, and we estimate around 10% of mistake fares don’t get honored.” This means there’s a risk that the airline might ultimately cancel your tickets before your trip. “That decision process can take days or even weeks, depending on how many people booked it,” Ewen said. “This can leave you in limbo, not knowing if the trip is happening. That’s why it is so important to hold off as long as possible on making other nonrefundable travel arrangements until you get some clarity on whether the airline will honor the ticket you booked. This may come via email or a social media post ― though we have seen examples of itineraries simply disappearing from travelers’ online accounts and a refund posting to the credit card they used.” Although the airline should theoretically reimburse you for your travel expenses, the process can be a headache, so it’s best to avoid committing to nonrefundable bookings like accommodations or tours when planning a trip with mistake fare tickets. “Typically, a mistake fare is available for booking in a very short time frame — at most, 24 hours, but more realistically, a few hours,” Nastro said. “You need to act quickly when you see them because that price will not last. And, of course, there is no way of knowing when they will pop up. There is no formula for tracking them nor best practice to give yourself the highest likelihood of them appearing.” You can keep up with mistake fares and short-lived deals by signing up for notifications from flight services like Thrifty Traveler, Secret Flying, Going, Jack’s Flight Club and The Flight Deal. “Some examples of round-trip mistake fares we’ve found at Going in recent years are Los Angeles to London for $240, Seattle to Tokyo for $316, Miami to Copenhagen for $299 and Detroit to Iceland for $299,” Nastro said. “Going will manually validate the fare before sending it out and provide an estimated timeline of how long we anticipate it to last.” There are also forums and online groups on Facebook , WhatsApp and other social media platforms where frequent flyers post their findings. The key to taking advantage of mistake fares and other deals is to book them immediately before they disappear. “Any ticket you purchase directly from an airline at least seven days in advance that starts or ends in the U.S. is eligible for either a 24-hour free price hold or a 24-hour risk-free cancellation,” Ewen said. “In other words, you can book as soon as you see the deal ― even if other travel plans, PTO requests or your partner’s availability aren’t confirmed.” If the airline decides to cancel your mistake fare booking, the company is obligated to refund your tickets and any nonrefundable expenses you made in conjunction with your plans (though, as previously noted, it often involves a lengthy process with customer service). Still, the upside of the opportunity can make the risks worth it. “If you find a mistake fare, you can get an absolute steal on a flight to a destination you’ve always wanted to go to,” Nastro said. “Or just a killer deal to an unexpected place that ends up being a memorable trip made extra sweet by how much you saved on flights.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "LONDON (AP) — The famous napkin that linked a young Lionel Messi to Barcelona sold for 762,400 pounds ($965,000) on Friday, British auction house Bonhams said. An agreement in principle to sign the-then 13-year-old Messi was written on the napkin almost 25 years ago at a Barcelona tennis club. A more formal and detailed contract with the club followed soon after. An undisclosed percentage of the sale price pays administrative fees for the online auction, in what’s called the buyer’s premium. Bonhams said the auction was on behalf of Horacio Gaggioli, an agent from Messi’s home country of Argentina who was part of the deal. The contract language, written in blue ink, was intended to reassure the teenager’s father, Jorge Messi, that the deal would go through. Jorge Messi had threatened to take his son back to Argentina because negotiations with Barcelona had stalled. The napkin, containing the date Dec. 14, 2000, bears the signatures of Gaggioli, another agent, Josep Maria Minguella and Barcelona’s then-sporting director, Carles Rexach, who met at a tennis club. Rexach had asked a waiter for paper and was given a blank napkin. The starting price was 300,000 pounds ($379,000). Messi spent nearly two decades with Barcelona after arriving from Argentina at 13 to play in its youth squads. He made his first-team debut in 2004 and played 17 seasons with the main squad. He helped the club win every major trophy including the Champions League four times and the Spanish league 10 times. Messi left Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2021. He has since joined Inter Miami. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

In addition to the grant program, QuickBooks also unveiled results from its latest survey of 1,969 U.S. small business owners. Whether you currently own a small company or you’re in the process of starting one, the findings of this survey — along with additional data about small business ownership — are helpful for understanding your business better: 1. About 6 in 10 small business owners surveyed say they’re on track to meet their earnings goals this year. However, another 19% say they’re running behind. Failure to hit earnings goals can result in decreased satisfaction for business owners that negatively impacts other aspects of their lives. 2. Small business owners reported that their businesses need to earn an average of $351,000 to be successful in 2024. At the same time, 65% of small business owners would be satisfied with less than that. 3. Small businesses with fewer than 10 employees reported cutting 58,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2024 . This suggests that small businesses face challenges that larger businesses don’t. 4. Owning a business has helped a reported 86% of small business owners meet their personal financial goals. In the survey, these goals included starting a savings account, paying off debt and improving their credit scores. 5. Just over half of the small business owners surveyed reported working with an accountant for their business. At the same time, small business owners who reported having an accountant say they have more and faster business growth than those who don’t use an accountant. 6. Of the small business owners surveyed, 92% use digital tools to manage their business. In 2024, it’s almost a requirement to use at least one digital tool. 7. Community is everything for small business owners, and 89% say they feel that consumers need to support small businesses by shopping locally. On a positive note, 73% of those surveyed feel supported by their local communities. 8. Millennial small business owners reported getting and giving the most community support. In the survey, 82% of millennial-aged business owners said they feel supported by their community. At the same time, 78% of millennial business owners agreed that it is important for consumers to support small, local businesses in their communities. 9. 84% of small business owners who have previously owned a business that closed say that their previous “failure” was motivation to try again. Of those surveyed, 62% of small business owners said they’ve previously started or owned a business. While the majority of those businesses failed, that hasn’t deterred business owners from trying again. 10. And 43% of small business owners say cash flow is a problem for their business, with 74% saying their cash flow challenges have stayed the same or worsened over the last 12 months. *All data provided by Intuit QuickBooks.

    "article_content": "McDonald’s is fighting back against viral tweets and media reports that it says have exaggerated its price increases . In a post on the company’s website Wednesday, McDonald’s U.S. President Joe Erlinger said reports suggesting the price of the average Big Mac has doubled since 2019 were false. McDonald’s said the average U.S. Big Mac was $4.39 in 2019 and now costs $5.29, a 20.5% increase. “For a brand that proudly serves nearly 90% of the U.S. population every year, we feel a responsibility to make sure the real facts are available,” Erlinger said. Erlinger acknowledged that he and many franchisees were frustrated by a post on X last summer about a Big Mac meal in Connecticut that cost $18, calling the price “an exception.” He noted that franchisees own and operate 95% of U.S. McDonald’s locations and set their own pricing but “work hard to minimize the impact of price increases.” The average U.S. price of a Big Mac meal, which includes a sandwich, fries and a drink, currently is $9.29. Still, the Chicago burger giant said the cost of some items have seen bigger price jumps than the Big Mac. The average price of medium fries was $2.29 in 2019 and is $3.29 now, a 44% increase. McDonald’s said the average price of all menu items has risen 40% over the last five years, to account for a 40% average increase in the cost of labor, paper and food. That is higher than overall consumer prices, which have increased 21% since December 2019, according to government figures. McDonald’s saw a marked slowdown in store traffic in the first three months of this year as inflation-weary customers in the U.S. and other big markets ate out less often. As a result, the company promised more deals. Next month, McDonald’s is expected to introduce a $5 meal deal across the U.S. that will include a sandwich, a four-piece McNugget, small fries and a small drink. Erlinger said he hopes customers will find the company’s upcoming deals “meaningful.” “It’s clear that we — together with our franchisees — must remain laser-focused on value and affordability,” Erlinger said.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life “Find a job you love and you’ll never have to work a day in your life.” Ever since I entered the workforce about a decade ago, I’ve noticed versions of this expression on inspirational posters, mugs, online memes, laptop stickers and more. The phrase speaks to the idea that if you are passionate about your work, it won’t feel like a chore or a burden, but rather an enjoyable and fulfilling experience in which you want to take part. This is all a nice idea, but even in a job you love, is it really possible to feel like you’re never working? I spoke to career coaches, psychologists and people who genuinely love their jobs to find out what they think about the expression and how it relates to the reality of work. “When so many people are stressed and burnt out by work, the idea that you could have a job that doesn’t ‘feel like work’ is incredibly appealing,” said Lauren Appio , a psychologist, executive coach and organizational consultant who specializes in mental health at work. “It’s aspirational and soothing for people who live in a culture like ours in the U.S., where there is little social safety net and people typically have to work very hard to make ends meet.” Many people have very negative relationships with their work. Gallup’s latest State of the Global Workplace report showed job dissatisfaction to be at an all-time high, along with staggering rates of unhappiness and disengagement. “You hear about the ‘Sunday Scaries’ or a ‘case of the Mondays,’” said career strategist Ana Goehner . “Some people also believe that everyone hates their job. This expression gives people hope that finding a job they love makes their negative feelings about work go away.” While people commonly attribute the quote to Confucius, there’s very little information regarding the origin of “find a job you love and you’ll never have to work a day.” Some citations of the expression date back to the 1980s , but it seems to be even more prominent in the Etsy era of embroidered quote pillows and inspirational memes. “I think this mantra is almost as millennial as ‘live, laugh, love,’” said Kate Kennedy , author of the upcoming book “One in a Millennial” and host of the “Be There in Five” podcast. “I’m not sure when it became widespread, but I remember hearing it a lot in the early 2010s, whether it was a product of being post-recession, the start-up boom, or being in peak ‘Shark Tank’ America.” Having entered the workforce amid the economic downturn of the Great Recession, Kennedy believes many young people were made to feel lucky to have any job at all. “There comes the point of burnout where a lot of the joy is sapped from the hobby when it becomes your meal ticket.” “That built-in sense of indebtedness to our employers normalized having a job you tolerated that paid the bills, so having a job you loved seemed like the most glamorous dream of all,” she said. Meanwhile, technological advancements expanded our career options, with full-time bloggers, Instagram influencers and entrepreneurs monetizing their hobbies through e-commerce and other new sources of income. Social media compounded the shift, as we saw people “just like us” showing off their flexible schedules, financial success and other aspects of these new aspirational work lifestyles. “It’s hard not to find other people’s lives and careers more desirable based on how they portray them online,” Kennedy said. “It’s almost like the volume of options and the frequency of seeing successful examples of exercising those options created a sense of ‘elsewhere’ for careers, where during the moments you are feeling job dissatisfaction, it’s hard not to idealize doing something else.” “It’s important to acknowledge that not everyone has the luxury of choosing a job they love,” said Elizabeth Pearson , a women’s career coach and author of “Career Confinement.” “For many people, their work is simply a means to an end, and they may not find much enjoyment or fulfillment in it. Additionally, even if you do love your job, there will still be times when it feels like work ― deadlines, difficult projects and long hours can all take a toll on your energy and motivation.” Stressful situations, terrible bosses, difficult co-workers, economic downshifts and other obstacles can arise no matter how passionate you feel about your work. Thus, “find a job you love and you’ll never have to work a day in your life” is, for most people, more of a feel-good statement than a feasible reality. “I see this idea sold to service professionals: Work for yourself and do what you love,” Goehner said. “But few people discuss the challenges of building a business and performing tasks you dislike. Few people talk about the issues you face and all the learning involved. Doing what you enjoy should be the norm, but it’s still work. You are still trying to make a living.” Even if you have the freedom to take a leap and monetize your hobby, it probably will still feel like work at times. “There comes the point of burnout where a lot of the joy is sapped from the hobby when it becomes your meal ticket,” Kennedy said. “The biggest issue for me when I started a product-based business was not having access to capital to outsource or hire out many of the functions to get off the ground efficiently, so it all fell on me to figure out, which ended up with me working way more hours for a lot less money than I made in my corporate job.” The job doesn’t magically feel like it’s not work once you’ve found a sustainable way to make a comfortable living, either. “I absolutely love my job, and I’m still beat by the end of the day,” Appio said. “It requires deep, sustained focus and active emotional processing and regulation for hours at a time. Outside of my sessions, I also complete paperwork, manage all of my billing, marketing and communications with clients and colleagues, offer consults for prospective clients, develop and deliver trainings, and pursue continuing education.” Any job comes with difficult days, including one that overall brings fulfillment and joy. And it’s normal to not always want to devote the required time and effort to the job. “Even when you find work you love, jobs are temporary,” Goehner added. “In our current economy, you won’t likely spend your entire career with one company and do the same tasks. Even people who dedicate their lives to their careers may have tough days or perform tasks they dislike. You do what you enjoy, receive pay and hopefully get recognized for your efforts.” “Telling others to ‘do what you love!’ is an oversimplification. Doing what you enjoy is not enough. Doing what you’re good at ― and being willing to stick with something, even when what was fun is no longer so fun ― can be just as important,” said Gorick Ng , a career adviser at Harvard University and author of “The Unspoken Rules: Secrets to Starting Your Career Off Right.” Consider whether you can leverage certain skills or expertise to succeed in your field. “Maintaining the belief that work you love isn’t actually 'work’ can create shame for people who feel burnt out or overwhelmed by work that they do truly love. This is especially common in work like health care, mental health and education.” “The expression doesn’t help people see possibilities based on where they are in their careers now,” Goehner said. “You can use your skills, gain new ones and find a workplace where you use 60-70% of the skills you enjoy. Sometimes, feeling a sense of expertise and having the freedom to share that at work can help you feel a sense of purpose or connection with your job.” If you’re feeling drawn to a completely different path, give it a lot of thought and do your research. Ng emphasized that the idea of something is often more interesting than the thing itself. “Would I like to be a musician? Sure! Can I sing to save my life? No!” he said. “And does singing the same song over and over again in a different city each week still sound fun when I haven’t been home for six months? I’m not so sure.” “Your number one passion may not be a realistic career,” Goehner added. “I’d love to take care of baby pandas, but the likelihood of this happening is minimal. Also, what you love may not provide a decent living for yourself or your loved ones. It could be a source of income, but you may need to supplement it with another job. Love doesn’t always pay the bills.” Additionally, consider how you feel about the business of the thing you love, not just the activity or hobby itself. “It’s great to have a dream job, but it’s also important to remember that you may not like the day-to-day tasks associated with monetizing that dream,” Kennedy said. “I started a handmade business selling home decor where I hand-painted things, and I loved the category, I love working with my hands and being creative and I loved the idea of self-employment. But I didn’t spend most of my days doing an artist’s work ― I was mostly buried in things I was less passionate about, like shipping, fulfillment, customer service, and inventory management before I could afford help in those areas.” Ng shared a time he met a talented photographer and asked if he wanted to pursue his art as a full-time career. “His response surprised me,” Ng recalled. “He said, ‘I love taking photos, but I hate the business of taking photos. The minute I start relying on photography to pay the bills is the minute I’ll stop loving it.’ Be honest with yourself if you’re thinking of turning an interest into a career. Do you love the business of doing something as much as you love doing the thing itself? Not everyone will say yes to this question and that’s OK.” One problem with this idea about work? “It can keep people preoccupied with finding their ‘dream job’ and experiencing a chronic sense of dissatisfaction,” Appio said. “Because if your work feels like work ― as work does ― does that mean you’re doing something wrong?” This fantasy of doing what you “love” and never feeling like you have to work can also lead to feelings of guilt or shame for those who don’t take a huge leap. This is especially true in the age of social media when we frequently see “creators” sharing all the highlights of their careers and few if any of the downsides. “When I was in a corporate job, I wondered if I had ‘sold out’ or forwent meeting my potential by working in the corporate world,” Kennedy said. “Sometimes, it creates a fear that you actively chose to do something you don’t love when you could have followed your passion.” There’s a sense of guilt for those who do make the choice to pursue a passion-based career. “Maintaining the belief that work you love isn’t actually ‘work’ can create shame for people who feel burnt out or overwhelmed by work that they do truly love,” Appio said. “This is especially common in work like health care, mental health and education. Professionals in these areas may feel guilty or ‘ungrateful’ for experiencing compassion fatigue or needing a break.” She also believes the “find a job you love and you’ll never work” expression can be used to further devalue creative or mission-driven work. “If you love your job, people will often tell you that you ‘didn’t get into it for the money,’” Appio said. “But we all work to earn money, and even if we’d do our work for free in a different world, we all deserved to be paid well for the work we do.” “This is actually an expression that I believe in myself, and there have been moments where I lived it,” said career coach Jasmine Escalera . “The thing is, I do believe the expression needs to be tailored because it isn’t just about finding work you enjoy, but finding work that is connected to your purpose, to your passions and to your strengths.” She believes a job that integrates the skills or tasks you’re particularly good at can make you feel inspired and as though you’re not working at all. “The company culture is such an integral part of enjoying the work, as well,” Escalera said. “So I would say not just find a job you love, but find an environment that will let you be the most successful version of you, and you’ll never feel like you have to work a day in your life.” Other experts offered their own rewrites of the expression. “To make the expression accurate, I’d say, ‘Find a job you enjoy and that recognizes your efforts, and build time for hobbies and activities that bring purpose outside of work,’” Goehner said. “You are more than your job.” “I’d tell people if they haven’t found a job they love, to find a job comprised of tasks they like and do what they love on the side,” Kennedy added. “Jobs are often more about the day-to-day than the broader industry or buzzwordy job description, and paying attention to the type of work you find engaging can be a good way to find job satisfaction within the confines of being employed by someone else.” Whether you’ve monetized a hobby or simply work to pay the bills and seek greater purpose elsewhere, Ng noted that there is no objective right or wrong in your approach to your career, just a difference in personal choices and values. If you do want to find meaning in work, however, he shared this rewrite: “Find something that brings you joy and purpose every day, and you’ll always have something to look forward to.” “Ultimately, the idea that you should ‘find a job you love’ is a good one, but it’s not always realistic or feasible,” Pearson echoed. “Instead, it’s important to strive for a job that aligns with your values and provides some level of fulfillment, while also being realistic about the fact that work is still work, even if you love it.” This story was previously published on an earlier date.

    "article_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — James Kane has used a magnet to fish all manner of junk from New York City waterways, but stacks of $100 bills he pulled from a safe were something else entirely. Kane’s girlfriend, Barbi Agostini, 39, thought he was joking when he said their life was about to change, she told The Associated Press on Monday. She was filming as Kane, 40, pulled a slimy safe out of a lake in Flushing Meadows Corona Park and extracted bags of waterlogged Benjamins from inside it. “Oh, that’s money,” Kane said Friday in video he posted online. “Oh, it is! Stacks of bills, dude!” “Oh, my God!” Agostini said in the video. The couple estimates that the safe contained $100,000 in damaged currency. The bills featured the 3D security ribbon that indicates recent vintage, but the safe bore no clues to a rightful owner. Kane and Agostini said they called the police to report their discovery and the police said there was no evidence of a crime. “They gave it to us, as, I guess you call it a finders keepers thing,” Kane said. The New York Police Department did not respond to requests for confirmation of Kane’s discovery. Kane said he and Agostini plan to take their soggy money to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington to redeem it. Some portion of the bills will likely be too damaged to recover, he said. The pair have ideas for spending whatever they end up with, including a new vehicle and upgrades to the equipment they use to produce content. Kane is far from the only magnet fisher who has made a mark in recent years. All it takes is a powerful magnet, a body of water and a rope. A magnet fisher found a human skull padlocked to an exercise dumbbell in New Orleans last month, and someone fishing in a creek in Georgia in April pulled up a rifle and some belongings of a couple who were killed nine years ago. As magnet fishing videos rack up views on YouTube, skeptics grumble on Reddit that some of the finds must be fake. Kane may just be lucky. He’s hauled up bicycles, guns, grenades, and jewelry from New York City waterways, promoting his exploits on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. “I have seen and worked with other magnet fishers that can hit a spot for three months, and I’ll come along and throw the same magnet and get and find something that they’ve been trying to get the entire time,” he said. “I personally can’t explain that.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life On average, American men out-earn women. Across all ages, women’s median annual earnings were 82% of men’s for full-time year-round workers, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. This gender pay gap is smaller when women are younger. Those younger than 30 make 93 cents, on average, for every dollar made by a man in a comparable position. A new study from the Pew Research Center that analyzed Census Bureau data from 2015 to 2019 delves deep into where exactly these narrowing pay gaps are happening. In 22 major metropolitan areas, including New York City, Washington and Los Angeles, women under 30 years old were earning the same or significantly more than their male peers. “Women are at their greatest parity with men in their early years of entering the labor market, during the teens and 20s,” Richard Fry, the senior economist behind the Pew Research study, told HuffPost. “As you follow them over time, the pay gap widens.” Of the 250 major U.S. metropolitan areas examined in the study, there were 22 in which women under 30 working full time were at or above wage parity with men: These city areas include about 16% of all young women working full-time jobs year-round in America, according to the Pew analysis. Midwestern metropolitan areas had the widest gender gaps among young workers, with women earning about 90% of their male counterparts’ wages. In Southern and Western metropolitan areas, they earned about 95%, and in the Northeast, they earned 94%. “Pay parity tends to be more elusive if you’re living out in the Midwest,” Fry said. University towns that attract young people, like Morgantown, West Virginia, San Diego, California, and Gainesville, Florida, were on the above-parity list for young women, as well as major urban regions like New York City. “We know that college towns tend to retain people that go to college there,” said Linda Babcock, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University who researches gender gaps in negotiations and promotions. “The education is going to create more opportunities for women in more white-collar, professional types of jobs, and those are going to be higher paying than the ones that men are going to have who are less likely to be college-educated.” The college attainment levels of young workers could be one factor in why women earn more in these regions. Fry pointed to national research finding that more young women today are likely to complete a bachelor’s degree than would men. This tracks with a statistical pattern he found. “The amount of pay parity is positively associated with how much better educated young women are than young men living in that metro area,” Fry said. “Young women have really upped their game in the skills that they bring to the labor market,” he added. “They are substantially outpacing men in completing college, and that is contributing to the narrowing of the pay gap.” Pay advantages that women gain early in their careers are not likely to hold. The Pew Research study cites census data showing that in 2000, a woman age 16 to 29 working full time year-round earned 88% of that of a young man in a similar role, on average. But by 2019, when these workers are age 35 to 48, women were earning only 80% of that of their male peers. Fry said the “ motherhood penalty ” could be part of the reason women lose pay parity over time. While men are seen as more mature and committed to their jobs when they have children, women are seen as mothers first, workers second. Women tend to lose 4% of hourly earnings on average for each child they have, while men earn 6% more, the research group Third Way found, using decades of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. “Many women under 30, especially in major metropolitan areas, do not yet have children and have therefore not been hit with the ‘motherhood penalty’ in their careers,” said Sarah Small, a researcher in the Rutgers Center for Women and Work. “Once women have children, they often leave the labor force to provide child care, meaning they have gaps in their résumé during which their male counterparts are getting promotions and raises.” Women with children face lose-lose options: They get penalized for taking career breaks and penalized for staying in the workforce as mothers. Studies have found that hiring managers can see mothers as less competent and less committed to their jobs. Even when women don’t become mothers, they also are more likely to face the disadvantage of being saddled with work that won’t get them promoted over time, compared with men, Babcock said. When there is not equal pay for equal work, that contributes to the pay gap, she said. “Helping others to do their work, training new employees, hiring the summer interns, planning the office party, taking notes at meetings... these are the kind of tasks that need to get done, but they don’t actually show up in your performance evaluation, and our research shows that women do much more of these than men,” said Babcock, who is the co-author of the upcoming book “ The No Club: Putting a Stop to Women’s Dead-End Work. ” “It could be a really big factor in why women’s advancement lags behinds men, because women are tasked with doing this work.” Overall, the study shows that young women have a head start compared with young men in certain cities in America, but they may lose that edge during the prime earning years of a career. “The study is certainly encouraging, but it represents just a select group of American women,” Small said. “We still have a long way to go to close the gender wage gap nationwide and across age groups.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life A pay stub shows you an itemized list of what your employer deducted from your pay and contains valuable information about where your money is going. It’s something you shouldn’t ignore. “An employee is well advised to keep a vigilant attitude towards his or her pay stub,” said Maryland-based employment attorney Bruce Godfrey. “Keep every pay stub, which most people don’t want to do, or enter the main data off of each stub onto a spreadsheet.” Godfrey personally uses a spreadsheet to keep track of each pay period’s gross income, 401K withholding and his bonuses, plus year-to-date totals for each. “I don’t want to depend on the employer’s computers for that,” he said. “I want to have it.” Most employers are required by the Fair Labor Standards Act to keep time and pay records for employees, including total wages paid each pay period, overtime earnings and hourly rates. Most states also require employers to provide this information in a pay stub to employees. Your pay stub may come attached to a paper check or be viewable in your company’s online payroll system. Sometimes, a pay stub may contain accounting or tax errors or other mistakes. In worst-case scenarios, they can reveal workers are being shorted wages. “It’s not that common that employers just mess up the pay stub [like] a transcription error or data entry error,” Godfrey said. “The mistake happens behind the pay stub in the decision not to pay a worker who is entitled to overtime overtime, or not to pay the worker as agreed, or to dock somebody’s pay illegally.” Here are some key terms to understand so you know what your paycheck should look like and what you should regularly double-check. Typically, a pay stub should list the employer and where it is located. That seems basic, but if it’s missing, it could be a sign something’s wrong. In Washington, D.C., for example, receiving a personal check would be a red flag, said Sarah Bessell, counsel for the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. An example of an incorrect pay stub “would be just a personal check with [a] dollar amount,” she said. “And it might have a short memo about the number of hours worked, but it’s lacking all those record requirements that D.C. law usually requires,” including some of the items and calculations below. “The number one thing that people fail to do is keep track of what is actually owed them. If you are hourly, keep a record of the hours that you worked.” Gross income is the total amount of money you earned during the pay period indicated. “The most important line on a pay stub is the gross pay. If the gross pay is wrong, everything else is wrong,” Godfrey said. Your employer takes money out of your pay for taxes and benefits, and the money left in your paycheck after these deductions is what’s known as take-home pay or net income. This is blank if you are a salaried employee. But if you’re an hourly employee, keep a close eye on whether your employer is listing and paying you for all of the time that you work. If you’re eligible for overtime , your overtime hours and rate should be reflected as well. As Florida-based employment attorney Donna Ballman told HuffPost, “The number one thing that people fail to do is keep track of what is actually owed them. If you are hourly, keep a record of the hours that you worked,” she said. “Know how many hours you are entitled to be paid for. If you worked over 40 hours in any week, make sure they are paying you time and a half. If you keep a daily record of your hours, it can be used as evidence.” If your employer owes you wages, that should be reflected in your pay stub in some form. “It really varies per employer how that will show up,” Sage said. For example, an employee who got a raise may see a retroactive payout listed as its own line item. This shows the beginning and end dates of the period for which you are being paid. “Most states require that an employer establish a regular pay period,” Godfrey said. This could be a schedule such as every Friday, on a biweekly basis or twice a month on set days. Small employers “will sometimes pay employees chaotically,” Godfrey said. “They’ll pay on the third and then on 14th and then not until the 17th of the next month. That is illegal under most state laws, and it is also a sign that the employer is recklessly disregarding the overtime laws, because the employer should be calculating by the week strictly.” If you see “year-to-date” or “YTD” next to your net or gross pay, that’s the total amount of wages you’ve been paid from the beginning of the year to the end of the pay period on the check. “ Anything year to date would be from January 1 to this point right now,” s aid Minnie Sage, program director of Tax-Aid , a nonprofit that provides free tax services in the San Francisco Bay Area. “Year-to-date is how much you’ve made cumulatively.” This money is withheld to pay your federal income taxes. It’s deducted each pay period and sent to the IRS so that you don’t have to pay it all in a really big lump each year when you file your taxes. When you start a new job, you fill out a W-4 form so that your employer can withhold the correct amount of federal income tax according to factors including the filing status you indicate and the number of dependents you claim. Sage recommends using the IRS’s free tax withholding estimator so you can see the ideal withholding amount for your personal situation. Changes to your W-4 can be made at any time. “The one thing that a lot of people don’t know is that you can look at your contributions at any time of the year. It doesn’t just have to be when you are hired,” she said. If you experience a change such as having a child or getting married, you can contact your employer at any time to adjust the information on your W-4, which in turn adjusts the amount of your federal withholding. If your state has an income tax, this money is deducted each pay period so you don’t owe a large amount when you file. Some cities and counties may also levy taxes, too. Both you and your employer are required to contribute a percentage of your taxable wages to Social Security and Medicare. The current basic rate for Social Security is 6.2% each, according to the IRS , and 1.45% each for Medicare. If you see the term “OASDI” on your stub, that stands for the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance program ― aka, your Social Security taxes. If you see “FICA” on your pay stub, that stands for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, and it indicates the combined employee and employer portions of your mandatory OASDI and Medicare taxes. These numbers tend to be correct. “Because there are recipients of this money who have a fiduciary duty to get the number right... or a selfish interest, either one, they tend not to be messed up very often,” Godfrey said. Other costs taken out of your paycheck may include health insurance, disability insurance, union dues and contributions to your 401(k) retirement account. Some of these deductions may be “pre-tax,” meaning they’re subtracted from your gross income before federal or state taxes rates are applied, putting more money in your pocket. If you face deductions from your pay for uniforms or cleaning, Bessell advised keeping a close eye on those deductions. “At least in D.C., your employer is allowed to make certain deductions like that as long as it doesn’t make your wages fall below the minimum wage,” she said. “A deduction like that might be OK, but you just want to double-check and make sure.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life If you, like millions of Americans, work for a startup or in the tech industry, you have likely been offered a grant of options or restricted stock units (RSUs) when you got your job offer. Kyle Holm is the vice president of total rewards advisory at Sequoia Consulting Group, which works with clients on designing their compensation programs. He said in technology and life sciences industries, offering a grant of options is a very common scenario. “For a new hire, it’s probably a 90% practice,” he said. ” Equity is a huge component of the overall total rewards package at a company these days.“ But what exactly are those stock benefits even worth? For companies that are already public and selling shares of stock to the public, it’s easier to understand their value. But for a company that has not yet undertaken an initial public offering (IPO), figuring out the value of stock benefits is “more art than science,” said Gianna Driver , chief human resources officer at Exabeam. “You do have to take a little bit of a leap of faith,” she said. “Public companies, you know what that value is, because that’s what it’s being bought and sold at right now on the open market. With a non-public company, it’s hypothetical. Technically on paper today, it’s worth nothing.” “When you receive equity instead of cash, there’s more risk but there’s also more upside.” For early startups that cannot afford to pay new hires competitively high salaries, it’s common to offer new employees stock benefits in lieu of more cash. In a best-case scenario, the company does really well, its value goes up, and its share price skyrockets. You make a generous profit when you choose to sell your stake, because your strike price — or the set price at which you can purchase the stock — is lower than the market value of what your stock options are worth. In the long run, getting equity in a company can be higher risk, but it’s also higher reward, too. “W hen you receive equity instead of cash, there’s more risk, but there’s also more upside,” said Daniel Lee , director of financial planning at BrightPlan and a personal finance instructor at University of California, Berkeley Extension who teaches students about stock compensation. “When I’ve worked with some of the instant millionaires that have come out of IPOs, that’s 99.9% a result of their equity, not their cash compensation.” But how can you tell what’s a good deal or a red flag when a recruiter or hiring manager is pitching you about their company’s stock benefits? Here are some critical questions to ask yourself and hiring managers before accepting a compensation package with stock options. First, it’s important to understand what kind of stock benefits you have. One big difference is whether you are being offered stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs). If you are joining a company after it’s gone public, you are likely getting RSUs, which are the most common type of equity award. One 2018 survey of 150 publicly traded technology companies found that 99% of the companies were giving time-based RSUs to employees. A stock option is the option to buy your company’s stock at a certain set price in the future. Conversely, you don’t have to spend any of your own money to get an RSU: Your company sets you up on a vesting schedule — predetermined intervals at which your RSUs become available to you —and assigns a fair market value once your RSUs vest. That’s why RSUs are seen as less risky than private company options; once your RSUs vest, they are yours to keep, whereas with a stock option, you have to buy the option, Lee said. “They [RSUs] are almost always going to be worth something,” Lee said. With RSUs, “it’s the same thing as getting a bonus at the end of a year, but instead of giving you cash, they are going to give you shares of the company. And they typically vest over four years, so you get a quarter after one year, and then you might get one portion of it every quarter,” he explained. You don’t want to sacrifice too much of your salary for stock benefits. Ask yourself: “Can I live without this money?” said Ramona Ortega, founder of My Money My Future who is working to bring financial education to underserved communities. “You don’t want to be taking stock options if you are not getting a base salary that’s going to cover your necessary expenses,” Ortega said. She said you should always try to get the market rate of your salary , unless you are independently wealthy or if you really believe in the company and are willing to take on the risk. “The worst-case scenario is you just take way too much risk,” Lee said. He outlined an example where a person takes on debt to cover their cost of living, because their cash salary is not enough to cover basic necessities like rent. In this situation, “you are just hoping and praying that all these stock options you’ve been getting will be worth billions of dollars, but most companies don’t IPO ... Statistically, your options are not going to be worth anything.” Holm said it’s important for employees to understand the long odds of getting liquidity with stock options. “It really is a long shot — it doesn’t matter which company it is — that you will actually see liquidity. Maybe 1% of companies actually go public, if that, especially in the current environment. We’re just not seeing a wide-open IPO window,” he said. “Most employees are probably going to be looking at the cash being more appealing, especially with the equity markets where they are at.” Reflecting on whether you see a future with this company is key to deciding if an employer’s stock benefits are worth it in the long-run. Both stock options and RSUs usually vest over several years. Often, there is what’s known as a one-year cliff waiting period, where you are required to stay at the company for at least a year before you receive the benefits. “Let’s say I was hiring you,” Ortega outlined as an example. “You’re going to get 200,000 options over four years. But you’re not going to get the first drop of those until a year later. You have to stay with the company for a year before you even get any of it. That’s the cliff.” You typically have to exercise your options within 90 days of leaving the company. As you are weighing the timeframe, you also want to consider whether you could raise enough money in time to buy those options before they expire if you quit or get laid off, Ortega said. And even if the equity rewards are amazing, you won’t be staying around long enough to enjoy them if you’re driven out by a toxic work environment . “ There’s a saying in HR that people don’t leave jobs, they leave managers,” Driver said. “Yeah, you can throw money at people, you can throw equity at people, and that’s all great and wonderful. But at the end of the day the job does needs to be one that is fulfilling to the employee ... That matters a lot.” Once you get a job offer with stock benefits, you have the right to ask more questions about it. If it’s a private company, you should ask to see its 409A evaluation , which is an independent appraisal of the organization’s stock that determines fair market value by analyzing financial statements, assets and cash flows. “That’s the latest value of each share of their company,” Lee said, noting that every time the company raises money, they get a new evaluation. “If they’re saying they are going to give you 10,000 options, you don’t know what that is worth unless you know what the price of the shares are.” Lee estimates that more than half of employers would give you that 409A evaluation if you asked, and if they don’t want to disclose, you should consider that a red flag. “Where do you see the stock going before it IPOs?” is another good question to ask hiring managers, Lee recommended. “At least you’ll understand what the founder or the company’s mindset is as to where they would like to see the stock go,” he said. “They might say, ‘Shares are worth five dollars today, but we’re targeting the shares to be forty dollars by the time we IPO.’” Ask how many outstanding shares there are to find out the number of shares investors, employees and executives currently own. This can determine how big of a slice of the pie that you have, Holm said. “You can give me a number of shares but without the context of how many shares are outstanding, I don’t really know what it means,” he said. Of course, you can do your own online research to figure out the state of your company’s industry, too. Look at what kind of equity packages people with similar jobs and titles are getting on AngelList . You can also go to Blind , a forum where professionals can anonymously share their compensation packages, to compare what your peers are getting, but as with most review sites where it’s hard to verify claims, you should take what they are saying with a grain of salt. “It’s incumbent upon candidates to do their homework and diligence to really understand, 'OK, what sort of media and news coverage is coming out?'” Driver recommends that job candidates look at similar companies that have gone public in the last six months or year. “It’s incumbent upon candidates to do their homework and diligence to really understand, ‘OK, what sort of media and news coverage is coming out?’” she said. “Is this space that this potential company is playing in, is it a secure space? Is it going to be growing or is it legacy and going to be made redundant over time? What are the multiples [in stock value] of the other companies? Do I believe in this management team? ... Many companies have great products, but they don’t have the right leadership to execute on that.“ Know that once you are working within the company, you will gain a better sense of the true value of the organization, for better or worse, Ortega said. “If they are out there raising money and saying they have the coolest new gadget and are bringing in users, and you know from the inside that it’s a shitshow ... At that point, it’s just a matter of [thinking], ‘Well, I don’t know if I really believe this,’” she said.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life When we’re away from home, joining a public Wi-Fi network can be a convenient way to be online when we don’t have good service or want to cut down on data usage. But should you buy stuff while using these public networks? In many cases, you should be fine. As the Federal Trade Commission explains , “Today, most websites do use encryption to protect your information. Because of the widespread use of encryption, connecting through a public Wi-Fi network is usually safe.” But sometimes these free Wi-Fi hotspots do get compromised by malware infection, fraudulent networks that have legitimate-sounding Wi-Fi names and man-in-the-middle cyberattacks. “Public Wi-Fi networks often lack robust security measures, which makes them attractive targets for hackers who can intercept sensitive data, such as credit card information,” said Michael Jabbara, the vice president and global head of fraud services for Visa. Amy Nofziger, the director of fraud victim support with AARP, said she’s experienced this kind of cyberattack firsthand. When she was on vacation in Las Vegas, she needed to pay a bag fee for her upcoming flight, and she entered her credit card information on the free Wi-Fi at the hotel. “Within 20 minutes, I started to get emails and calls from my credit card company alerting to charges being made on my card in others states. That’s how quickly it can happen,” she said. Luckily, there’s a simple way you can double-check that your online behavior is encrypted ― and you should do it any time you use public Wi-Fi. Here’s what to know: Before you buy anything online, the most important step you can take to ensure that the website you are using is secure is to check that the URL begins with https://. The “s” stands for secure, and there is typically a padlock icon in the address bar. Under this encryption, people who are logged in with you on the public Wi-Fi cannot see the contents of your communication, explained Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “They can see that you are going to this website, but they don’t know what page you’re going to and they can’t see what you’re typing in,” Galperin said. The HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure) ensures that the data going from your device to the website you’re visiting is encrypted. As long as your website URL begins with “https,” Galperin said, you should be fine to make online purchases. If you want to make sure that you’re strictly only using these websites, Galperin recommended making it the default in your browser. On Safari, using an HTTPS URL is already the default . On Chrome, you can do this by going to Settings, selecting Privacy and Security, then Security, then toggling on the option for “Always use secure connections.” On Firefox, you can do this by going to Settings, then Privacy and Security and selecting Security. Then scroll to the “Always use secure connections” option. In addition to checking for the HTTPS, you can always go one step further and use your mobile data over public Wi-Fi if you need to make a purchase, which is what Jabbara and Nofziger both advise over using public Wi-Fi for purchases. “Using your cell service is typically safer than using public Wi-Fi for transactions, as it’s more difficult for hackers to intercept data over cellular networks,” Jabbara said. “The best course of action is to wait to use a secure network, but using mobile data is a great second option.” If you want to enhance your security, one of the most effective measures is to use a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN “encrypts your data and makes it much more difficult for anyone to intercept and read your information,” Jabbara said. And be mindful of what seems too good to be true. If a network lets you log on without entering a password or the network has a generic-sounding name like “Free Public Wi-Fi,” Nofziger said those are warning signs that the hotspot could be compromised. Ultimately, you don’t have to stop yourself from ever using public Wi-Fi ― just make sure that what you are visiting is encrypted and secure. “While it’s not necessary to completely avoid buying anything while on public Wi-Fi, it’s important to be aware of the risks and take appropriate precautions, like checking to see if the URL is safe or using a VPN,” Jabbara said.

    "article_content": "Parenting reporter Ask any American with young children what their No. 1 household expense is, and you’ll hear the same answer almost every time: child care. Each family finds its own way to manage. Some parents are pushed out of the workforce. Others work jobs they wouldn’t take otherwise or hold down multiple jobs in order to meet their families’ needs. To show how real families are navigating this child care challenge, HuffPost is profiling parents around the country. If you’d like to be featured in an installment, email us at parents@huffpost.com. Name: Rachael Gomez Age: 34 Occupation: Texas sales manager for a group of small craft distilleries Location: Dallas area Children’s ages: 7 months, 2 years and 9 years (oldest child is Gomez’s stepson) Annual household income: $90,000 Weekly take-home pay: $1,500 Child care costs: $200 per month Work arrangements: Gomez and her husband, Jesus, met through work. “How we met was in the [restaurant] industry. Now, due to child care issues, he actually is a stay-at-home dad. He has been for about two years now. “When I was pregnant with Aly Rose, our 2-year-old, his son did not live with us full-time. We had him on the weekends. And at the time, he was working at a restaurant. The hours were crazy. We knew that we weren’t going to be able to swing caring for children. So he quit working in restaurants and started working for a wine distributor that offered a lot more flexibility. “We tried to make it work with our schedules. But he ended up getting a new boss that just made his schedule a lot more demanding, and so our schedules really didn’t align. We put Aly Rose on six to eight different waiting lists for day cares before she was born, and then a couple after. I’ve only even gotten a call from two of those places.” Aly Rose is now 2 and a half. “She was born in July 2021. She ended up in the NICU for three weeks, unexpectedly, and so we brought her home the beginning of August. We tried to make it work schedule-wise until he ended up quitting his job December 1, 2021. My parents actually came down and watched the kids for three weeks prior, just because it really wasn’t working like we hoped. We had looked at other day cares, and any other option that we could at the time, before we made the decision for him to quit his job: Angie’s List, Care.com. People didn’t have availability for like seven to eight months. There were two [day cares] that said that they were going to have openings within six months. But they were 3.1-star, 2.3-star — and they were the best-rated in the area. We thought, do we really want our kids to have a 3.1-star life? That’s almost failing. He had been managing people for so long, and he was kind of tired of it. I’m very career-driven, as well as family-driven. He gave me the option for him to stay home. “To go from two pretty decent incomes to literally cutting our income in half was hard. We tried to mentally justify it with, ‘Oh, but look how much we’re saving on day care’ and all of this, but at the end of the day, you’re still at a loss. It’s a blessing now, because his son has some special needs, he has autism. Now he’s able to live with us full-time, and Jesus has more time that he can dedicate to taking him to appointments, managing his care from home as well as taking care of the kids. It’s been a little over two years. I have a higher-paying job, but it’s still not enough to offset him having no income. “My employer covers my health insurance, but the plan that they offer for my dependents and spouse is like $1,200 a month. So we chose to get a plan through the marketplace for his use and the kids. It’s not much cheaper. It saves us a couple hundred a month, which, at this point, anything helps. “The thing about my job is, it’s pretty flexible. I typically have some calls in the morning and some admin stuff that I do, starting at nine. I usually have a couple of free hours in the middle of the day. Then I leave my house to go out to visit accounts starting around four o’clock, and there’s nights I don’t get home till midnight. “Even when I get home early, he’s put three kids to bed. The only thing he has energy for is to sit on the couch. We open a bottle of wine. We just veg out for an hour until we both say, ‘OK, let’s pry our eyes away [from the TV] and go to sleep because we’re going to be up in two hours.’” Gomez anticipates that Jesus will return to the workforce once all their children are in school, about five years from now. “He has his associate’s degree and he’s talked about getting his bachelor’s degree in an online program, but there’s just no time. Every time we try to prioritize something, even just as small as going to the gym — if I have a call in the morning, by the time that he wakes up to go to the gym, then both babies are up. So he’s probably going to put off going back to school at least for another two or three years.” Child care plan: “We did start Aly Rose in a ‘mother’s day out’ program in January of this year. It runs two days a week, five hours a day. Luckily, it’s right down the street from our house and gives Jesus a little bit of relief. It’s $200 a month, which is OK, in my mind. Pretty affordable compared to other day cares. But it is a very short window of time. He drops her off after he drops his son off at school and picks her up before he picks him up, but it gets him a good four and a half hours of ‘one-baby time.’ “We tried to [drive for] DoorDash or Uber Eats [to make] enough money to pay for her day care. If I get home and there’s a bonus program on DoorDash, I’ll go out and drive for DoorDash for three or four hours.” The family is looking at preschools for Aly Rose next year, but options are limited. Their income is too high for subsidized programs, and other programs are located far from home and offer only a few hours of care several days per week. They plan next year to send their younger daughter to the same “mother’s day out” program, which is housed in a church and runs on a school calendar. It’s for babies who are at least 1 year old and walking. “Both of us are happy that we’ve made it work. It’s a struggle financially, and I mean, I’m sure it will be forever, with the cost of everything going up. Yesterday he said, ‘I need adult time, I caught myself talking to your cousin in a baby voice.’ And I leave the city of Dallas and I work out of market throughout the rest of the state one to two weeks a month. So he’s here full-time. You couldn’t pay me money to stay home with with my kids. They’re great kids, but I just need that adult interaction. There weren’t really a whole lot of good choices.” What would help their family: “There’s no one mandating day care pay, and those are the people that are caring the hardest for our children. Not just educating them, but literally cleaning up after them and carrying them around and helping to potty-train them and do all of the things that parents are trying to do, but for 12 bucks an hour. Day care pay regulations would be super helpful. “Also, there’s no mandated parental leave, which is insane. I had six weeks with both children, and with Aly Rose I only had two weeks of maternity leave. The rest of it was short-term disability, meaning I didn’t even get full pay. We’re not planning on having any more children because we can’t financially — that’s another two years before Jesus can go back to work and we can try to pay off some debt we’ve accrued over the last few years. “I went back to work both times before I had my six-week checkup. I hadn’t been medically cleared to lift things, and I had to go back to work. Having a little more time, parents have the ability to bond with their kids. In our case, we thought we could make child care work between the two of us. [Paid leave] would have given us a little more more leeway and breathing room to figure out a different plan. But I had already gone back to work, and there was no spare time to figure out a plan B or C. “I might not have it all, but I have it better than a lot of people. OK, yes, we’ve racked up a lot of debt. And yes, it sucks that my husband is stuck at home with the kids all day and we don’t have that income and we’re not able to save money. It’s always hard for me to to be like, ‘I want subsidized anything,’ because we have it pretty good. Do we need help? We do need child care. We both slept an hour and a half last night with a sick kid, [and] our 2-year-old doesn’t sleep ever. If we got a day care facility for the kids, we could have taken a nap this morning. Been refreshed enough to actually care for our children, instead of, to be really honest, they’re probably going to end up in front of Ms. Rachel this evening, because we’re gonna be too worn out to do anything, and I won’t be home till midnight.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Vacations offer a much-needed break from the grind of working and everyday life. All good things must come at a cost, however, and sometimes that cost is much higher than expected. “Overspending on vacation is a common occurrence for many people,” Bola Sokunbi, the founder of Clever Girl Finance , told HuffPost. “Countless temptations on vacation can put us in a different state of mind. We want to treat ourselves and overindulge. Additionally, many of us follow the ‘work hard, play hard’ mentality. You put in the long hours to earn your money, and now it’s time to enjoy it by spending it on everything you want.” If you accidentally stretched your budget a little too far during your last vacation, don’t panic. We asked experts to share their advice for getting back on track financially after a particularly overindulgent trip. “The first thing you should do when you get home from vacation is know exactly how much you spent while you were away,” said Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma . “Look at your credit card statements and bank accounts to see a list of all your transactions, and think back to if you spent any cash.” Don’t forget to factor in any outstanding expenses, like repayment to the friend who put their card down for restaurant meals or a final charge from the hotel. “Although you may be fearful of looking at your bank account after vacation, the best thing you can do for your finances is to tackle it head-on,” Sokunbi said. “You may realize you’ve spent more or less than you thought.” Take note of when your next credit card bill is due and whether you’ll have the funds to cover it so that you can take action quickly. Resist the urge to ignore the problem. “Creating goals around your finances is a great way to get back on track and recover from overspending,” Sokunbi said. “Once you know how much you’ve overspent, you can make that number your savings goal. For instance, if you’ve spent $1,000 more than you intended, your goal can be to save that amount over the next two months.” You can embark on a specific money-saving challenge to gamify the process and make it a bit more enjoyable. Tell your loved ones or find an online community for extra support and encouragement. “Savings challenges encourage you to save a set amount of money each week for a period of time,” Sokunbi said. “It’s a great way to stay motivated when saving money.” If you’re facing credit card debt due to your vacation overspending, you’ll want to prioritize paying that back as soon as possible. “Create a debt repayment plan, figuring out how much you can afford to put towards your credit card balances to pay down these travel expenses faster before high interest fees start accruing, and makes these travel expenses even more expensive to pay down,” said Andrea Woroch , a consumer finance and budgeting expert. “Considering the average credit card interest rate is over 24%, paying any interest on travel expenses means you will end up paying 24% more for it!” She recommended getting a balance transfer credit card to give yourself time to pay off your debt without interest piling up. Try to be realistic as you make a plan. “Establish achievable financial goals and timelines,” recommended Kara Stevens, the author of “Heal Your Relationship With Money” and founder of The Frugal Feminista . “Breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable steps can make the process more manageable.” “You may need to make some temporary tweaks to your budget to account for the recent increase in bills, and attempt to decrease your nonessential spending,” Alev said. “There are certain tactics you can try ― for example, you can embrace a ‘little spend’ lifestyle, which essentially means you primarily spend on essentials until you’re in a better place financially.” After indulging on vacation, tighten your budget to pay back debt or rebuild depleted savings. Don’t make purchases outside necessities for a week, month, or however long you need. “If you usually allocate money to eat out each month, you can save that money and focus on preparing meals at home,” Sokunbi said. “Instead of spending money on entertainment, try having movie and game nights at home to save money.” She also recommended implementing a 24-hour waiting period before you make a purchase and disconnecting your cards from online stores. “Perhaps you don’t cut out every discretionary purchase either and only commit to cutting out those luxury services you really don’t need, like your once-monthly massage, bimonthly manicures, monthly house cleaning or weekly car wash,” Woroch suggested. “Some of these services you could forgo for a couple or a few months while stashing away the amount you would’ve spent in savings to help pay off your travel. This could easily and quickly amount to a few hundred dollars, if not to a thousand or more, without making a big impact on your daily living.” Budgeting tools and apps can also help with expense tracking and increase awareness of your spending habits. “The cash envelope method is a helpful budgeting strategy to help curb your spending,” Sokunbi added. “With this type of budgeting, you allocate different amounts of cash to varying expenses in your budget. Once the money is gone, you have reached your spending limit. By using cash more, you become more aware of your spending.” Adopt a savvier approach to shopping for any necessities that you can’t cut out of your budget. “Use cash-back sites for all those daily essentials you need to purchase, as the money you earn could be used to help pay off your travel debt,” Woroch said. “Meal-plan to save on groceries, and comparison shop.” Whether it’s pet care supplies or home goods, switch from brand-name to generic options when possible. Make good use of credit card points as well. “It’s also important to be consistent,” Alev said. “If your repayment plan and new budget aren’t feeling realistic once you put them in practice, and you see yourself falling behind, adjust them so that the goals you set are actually achievable.” Don’t get down if you fall behind. Take an honest look at your needs and routines, and tweak plans as needed. “You know your spending habits best, and you can avoid putting too much pressure on yourself by taking it step by step,” Alev added. “The idea of having to pay off the bills from your vacation may be overwhelming. But the longer you put it off, the more financial hardship you may face, especially if your credit card bill starts accruing interest charges,” Alev said. “Try a mindset shift: Viewing your temporary spending changes as a lifestyle choice to reduce your financial burden, versus viewing it as something you are forced to do, can alleviate some of that stress.” Adjusting your mindset will not only improve your mental well-being, but it will also help you commit to habits that can get you back on track. “Don’t shame yourself for overspending on vacation,” Sokunbi said. “After all, we only live once. Instead of dwelling on your mistakes, be proactive with your finances. Be more aware, focus on your goals and prioritize saving money. The more you focus on doing better, the easier you will manage your finances.” “Another strategy you can try out is increasing your income,” Sokunbi said. “This can look like putting more hours in at work, or working a part-time job or on a side hustle.” Talk to friends and get creative as you brainstorm ways to make a little additional money. You might try selling your unwanted clothes and other items on Poshmark or Facebook Marketplace, for instance. “Look [for] a side hustle that you can do in your spare time to make some extra cash,” Woroch said. “It’s not something you have to stick to either; you could go back to it when you need extra cash, like when planning a big trip. I love flexible side hustles that don’t require much skill, like pet-sitting.” “Reflect on your overspending and identify specific reasons for it,” Stevens said, suggesting that you “learn from the experience.” “Use these insights to adjust your financial habits and make better decisions in the future.” In addition to ensuring your next vacations are less financially problematic, you can also apply the lessons you learn to your general finances. “Use this experience as motivation to start or replenish an emergency fund,” Stevens said. “Having savings can provide a financial cushion for unexpected expenses and prevent future overspending.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life TikTok has quickly become many people’s go-to source for recipe ideas, style inspiration, organizing tips and even personal finance advice. And lately, a new approach to money management has been making waves on the platform: “ loud budgeting .” Since the start of the new year, TikTok has been flooded with videos touting the benefits of this method and the best ways to make it work. “Loud budgeting is a financial strategy where you share your money aspirations directly and not so quietly with the people in your life,” Derek Ober , a financial advisor with Northwestern Mutual, told HuffPost. “It’s a public commitment. Loud budgeting centers around the idea of telling others why you’re choosing not to spend money on something and being transparent about the reason you are saving.” For example, you might say no to an expensive dinner or group trip and explain that it’s because you’re prioritizing paying off credit card debt or saving for a down payment on a house. The idea is to proudly own your money consciousness. “Until now, we usually saw people flaunting their money on social media rather than flaunting their financial struggles,” said budgeting expert Andrea Woroch . “Loud budgeting suggests you should speak up about your financial situation and make spending decisions that support your goals and match your current budget and needs. It’s making it socially acceptable to use your financial struggles as a reason to opt out of certain gatherings, trips or group gifts.” But does this social media trend pass muster with experienced financial advisors? We asked some experts to break down loud budgeting and share their advice for implementing this approach into your everyday life. “As a financial advisor, I think this trend is a great approach to managing your finances,” Ober said. “Telling others why you’re choosing not to spend money on something can both hold you accountable and provide positive reinforcement from other loud budgeters who are doing the same.” He noted that loud budgeting offers a sense of camaraderie that makes it easier to say no to activities and expenses that don’t fit in your budget at the moment. “Ultimately, I think this trend transcends the notion of talking about your budget as a reason not to do something, but rather it’s helping move the money talk in the right direction so that we can feel comfortable addressing previously taboo topics like debt,” Woroch said. “Until now, there’s been a negative stigma around talking about money and a lot of shame around debt.” Hiding your financial struggles hinders your ability to make improvements for the future, he said. And if you’re worried about what other people think, you might be more likely to spend money on things you shouldn’t. By contrast, Woroch noted, loud budgeting is “the anti-YOLO.” Plus, speaking out about your money issues gives you the chance to gather helpful information from peers who’ve been in similar situations. It might also bring you closer to loved ones and to your personal values. “It’s easy to get caught up in mindless, lifestyle inflation that allows increased spending on things like food and vacations just because your income has increased,” said Jacqueline Howard, the head of financial wellness at Ally Bank. “Loud budgeting can help you realign your spending values with the things that matter most to you and rethink the why behind each purchase. A person may realize they are overspending only because that’s what their friends are doing, or it’s because of something they saw on social media.” Removing the shame and stigma from debt and budgeting conversations could help you live a more financially healthy lifestyle. But the loud budgeting trend could come with a few downsides if applied incorrectly. “I hope we don’t see people leverage this budgeting concept in an effort to be cheap, such as skimping on tips to deserving service providers,” Woroch said. She also emphasized the need to back up your “loud” words with action. “It’s important that you don’t fall into the trap of being all talk,” Woroch said. “Taking action is key to improving your finances and this will require a detailed plan to make it happen.” Once you’ve resolved to try to out loud budgeting, taking a mindful approach will help you stick with it and see real results. Some general guidelines to keep in mind: “It’s best to identify specific goals you are trying to achieve for the year, so that you can articulate your intentions clearly to others,” Ober said. Setting clear goals can also help you budget more effectively. “Spending less and saving more are great goals, but they don’t give you much direction to follow,” Woroch said. “You need to know what you’re working towards, so be specific when setting a financial goals and then build a budget that includes realistic debt payments, savings, etc.” As you establish your goals and budget, take stock of the things that truly bring you joy and meaning so that you can implement them into your monthly spending plan and cut down elsewhere. “A value-based spending plan considers your personal values, goals, and priorities, whereas a budget will track your monthly income and expenses,” Howard said. “When building out your spending plan, ask yourself, ‘What are your values? How do you define them?’ It’s easier to make decisions that align with your overall financial goals when you’re clear on what those values are.” “To practice ‘loud budgeting,’ talk with your loved ones and start discussing money matters with your kids and spouse,” said Michael Hershfield, founder and CEO of Accrue Savings . “This will ultimately help you learn and improve your spending habits.” Set aside time and space to talk to friends and family about your financial goals, values and needs. “Having an open and honest dialogue with friends and family might sound difficult, but you should never feel ashamed for sticking to your financial goals,” Ober said. If someone gets upset when you say no to something because it doesn’t fit with your budget, have a dialogue about it. “Make it clear this is not about them, but rather about you sticking to your goals,” Ober said. “While loud budgeting may seem positive when you start, you may start missing out on the fun stuff,” Woroch said. “When you have to dip out of a dinner or weekend getaway, come up with an alternative plan to spend time with your friends that doesn’t cost as much. Invite them over for drinks at your place, request everyone to BYOB. Set up a hike and picnic. Find a free event to attend.” The key is to emphasize that there are many ways to make memories together and to put in the effort to come up with workable alternatives. “You can suggest cooking at home with a friend instead of going out to eat,” Hershfield suggested. “Another idea is to walk together for 10 minutes rather than ordering an Uber .” “Just like you’re encouraged to be honest about why you chose not to spend, be honest about your needs when it comes to gifts for birthdays, holidays or a life event like a wedding,” Woroch said. “Rather than create a registry full of kitchen goods you really don’t need, ask family and friends to contribute to a home down payment or student debt repayment.” She suggested that new parents on a budget might open up a custodial account for their baby and ask that grandparents and loved ones consider making cash contributions, in lieu of expensive toys and birthday gifts, to support their child’s financial future. Many financial institutions and even brands like Gerber offer different custodial account options for families. “While loud budgeting suggests you need to make drastic changes in your spending on social events, you can find big savings without sacrificing by reducing monthly bills,” Woroch said. “This may even give you a little room to spend more on a dinner with friends.” She recommended negotiating rates with current credit card providers, comparing rates with competitors and canceling unused subscriptions. Consider opening a separate high-yield savings account to earn interest on your money. Once you start practicing loud budgeting, you’ll likely learn even more money-saving hacks from loved ones through your open conversations about finances. The potential for positive effects is seemingly endless. Ober added, “I hope that loud budgeting lives beyond just being a trend, and more people are comfortable enough to be transparent with their financial goals and continue to hold themselves accountable.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer Scrolling through Instagram recently, I stopped on a post . It was meant to be a joke — a word intentionally spelled the wrong way and its meaning misinterpreted because the person posting it supposedly had dyslexia. In the comments, someone said, “As a teacher, I find this exceedingly humorous!!!” I didn’t find it funny at all. You probably wouldn’t either if you had spent most of your life trying to prove a stereotype wrong and still found yourself unexpectedly becoming the butt of jokes. It doesn’t take much to discover what the average view of dyslexia is — a quick Google search for “memes about dyslexia” will provide various examples. And it isn’t just online. Over the years, I’ve been in more rooms than I can count where some unknowing person made an offhand comment about being dyslexic. They used it as a way to describe themselves or someone else when they made a mistake, fumbled through something or had an off day, with remarks like “They’re having a dyslexic moment” or “I can’t read today, I must be dyslexic.” I was diagnosed with dyslexia in the third grade. As a child in the 1980s, I was labeled “stupid” and “slow.” I was told that my diagnosis wasn’t real and that I just wasn’t trying as hard as the other kids. I remember the shame of being pulled out of “regular” classes to go to the resource room (where it was known “the dumb kids” were sent). I spent years in school fighting to get into classes I believed I deserved to attend despite my learning disability. I wasn’t encouraged to do so by teachers or administrators. Having children with learning disabilities in classrooms often means more work for the teachers as well. It’s easier to push those kids through school by keeping them in the lowest-level classes and shuffling them off to a resource room. Once I got myself into higher-level classes, I often had to work harder than the other students just to stay there. Although it’s been decades since my days in school and the cultural perception may be that we have come a long way, I’m not so sure how much things have really changed. Seeing posts like the one on Instagram, met with comment after comment of laughing emoji, makes me believe we still have a lot of work to do on how we view people with learning differences. Children with learning disabilities often feel like their brains don’t work “correctly,” believing that there is something about them that needs to be “fixed” and they need to learn the “right” way to do things. Often, the first thing a child feels after they are diagnosed is shame. That spurs a need to conceal the disability, which is often carried into adulthood. As a result, once a person learns the accommodations they need to navigate the world undetected, they may rarely talk about their learning differences again. For years I knew there was a lot of misunderstanding about dyslexia, but I stayed quiet because I feared my work would be judged differently if I told the truth. I’ve come to see that by doing this, I was part of the problem — because if people like me don’t speak up, the perception will never really change. I now feel a responsibility to be honest about who I am (and who I was back in school). Children should know that they aren’t defined by their learning differences and, in the long run, there may be positives they don’t even know about yet. There is no cure for dyslexia , but it has nothing to do with a person’s intelligence or desire to learn. It is a neurodivergent condition in which the brain works in a different way than the majority of other brains. “Dyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words,” writes the Mayo Clinic , noting that it’s “a result of individual differences in areas of the brain that process language.” This leads to trouble learning new words and issues with forming words correctly. You may wonder what people with dyslexia see when they read. Are all the words backward? The answer is no. People with dyslexia do not have a vision issue; they see words the same way that everyone else does. The difference is how they process and decode those words. And although dyslexia is not a condition that people outgrow, as we age we gain more skills to compensate for the differences. How might this play out in real life? In a recent meeting, I was reading aloud from a sheet of paper. I got through the first few sentences without a hitch but suddenly came to a word my brain knew but my mouth simply couldn’t pronounce. The word was “spirituality,” which I have said innumerable times without thought. And yet there I was staring down at it, and as hard as I tried, it just wouldn’t come out. I stammered and then did what I always do when this happens — I made a little joke to divert everyone’s attention. (I’m good at that.) Even though this doesn’t happen as frequently as it did when I was younger, it was not a stand-alone incident. In fact, I’d say it happens once or twice a month, usually on days when I haven’t gotten enough sleep or am particularly stressed. Sometimes I can’t think of a word. Sometimes pronouncing new names and remembering how to say them is challenging. Sometimes I say a similar but incorrect word in place of another. Recent examples of that are “grazing” instead of “gazing,” and “antidote” instead of “anecdote.” Do I know what the words mean? Yes. Could we have the same conversation tomorrow and I’d pronounce them correctly? Most likely. Do I wish I could say your name on the first try? Of course. I can also almost guarantee that if I were writing these words, I would select the correct version. How do I know this? Because despite my dyslexia, I have been a professional writer and editor for 25 years, so I’ve had a lot of practice. I chose this career because I love reading and writing, but I’ve always felt like I had to prove I could do the job just as well as someone without dyslexia, even if no one around me knew I was dyslexic. The reality is, the real world doesn’t have accommodations or modifications. You do need to learn strategies to help you navigate the same landscape as everyone else. As a 50-year-old woman who has worked successfully in what may be considered an unlikely career for someone with dyslexia, I think I’ve proved myself to be just as capable as many people with “typical” brains, if not more so. These days, I am happy to talk about the challenges but I also make it a point to focus on the things about dyslexia that make me better at my job. People with dyslexia excel in narrative thinking. They have strong long-term memory, particularly when it comes to experiences and visual information. They are creative and often have strong interpersonal skills and empathy. As a writer and writing instructor who specializes in memoir and personal essay, these traits make me the perfect fit for my job. Even though my learning difference initially posed challenges for me, I would never change my dyslexic brain. Shedding light on this aspect of myself allowed me to see that there was never anything wrong with this part of my makeup, but there was something wrong with the way I perceived it. Instead of trying to erase this part of myself, now I choose to embrace it. Darcey Gohring is a full-time freelance writer and editor based just outside New York City.

    "article_content": "On Assignment for HuffPost When it comes to iced versus hot coffee , conversations usually focus on personal taste. But what about health? Do the two versions of coffee affect the human body differently, and are the differences stark enough to warrant permanent changes in your caffeine consumption? To find out, HuffPost spoke with Dr. Majid Basit, a cardiologist with Memorial Hermann in Sugar Land, Texas. Basit said there isn’t much research on the su bject, but he did note one difference: “Hot coffee has been shown to have higher amounts of antioxidants, which may offer health advantages. But more research needs to be done,” he added. A 2018 study in Scientific Reports bears that out. Researchers from Thomas Jefferson University found that hot coffee has higher levels of antioxidants , which can prevent or slow damage to cells , compared to cold brew. But what if you’re looking to get an extra boost of caffeine? That’s when things get tricky. Caffeine is extremely variable in brewed coffee and depends on a variety of factors, including the beans used. Though a 2020 study by the American Chemical Society found that hot brewing methods yield slightly higher caffeine levels than cold brew methods, it’s important to note that the differences were not big enough to overcome the variables mentioned above. So in general, you’ll get a solid dose of caffeine whether you drink your coffee hot or cold. “Caffeine has both positive and negative effects on the body,” Basit explained. “It increases brain alertness and general energy levels, but will also increase the acid in the stomach leading to an upset stomach in some people.” The cardiologist also mentioned increased urination, blood pressure and heart rate, along with a decrease in the body’s ability to absorb calcium, which may lead to lower bone density. To recap: An average cup of hot coffee boasts slightly more antioxidants and approximately the same amount of caffeine as its colder counterpart. Overall, studies have not revealed major differences in how the human body reacts to the two forms of java. Hot or cold, coffee seems to generally be good for you. According to a 2017 study by the University of Colorado , drinking coffee weekly can help reduce one’s chances of getting a heart attack by as much as 7%. And a series of three 2022 studies that were presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 71 Annual Scientific Session further support that coffee is good for heart health. There is, however, one characteristic of a warm cup of joe that majorly differentiates it from a cold brew, and it doesn’t have anything to do with consumption: the smell of hot coffee. According to a 2008 study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, there is a connection between bean aroma and “potential antioxidant or stress relaxation activities.” Using rats in a lab experiment, researchers found that a single whiff of hot coffee was enough to reduce tiredness and stress levels. “Since hot coffee has more vapors emanating from it, it is possible this effect may be heightened with hot coffee versus cold coffee,” Basit said. The cardiologist does, however, also make it a point to note that there is no definitive research on the topic and that a lot of the results might be connected to a placebo effect. Turns out, then, that the battle between hot vs. cold brew is one still worth arguing about. But if you want to make your own cold brew before summer’s over, it’s not that hard.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer I suspect that my daughter and I are growing too costly and inconvenient for my health plan’s customer profile. They are genius (and stealthy) in their tactics to exhaust me financially, emotionally and physically. The company manuals must contain strategies for this, cleverly disguised as “working together.” I have tried to be patient and cooperative. I pay the premiums for my top-tier PPO plan on time. I have accepted the fact I must cover a sizable deductible, copays, and coinsurance. It’s harder to swallow the exorbitant “out of pocket maximums” we are required to pay before a health plan will cover at 100%. Not many people hit that mark, and are likely bankrupt by then. Looking at this logically, it was silly of me to believe the health plan when it said it wanted to help me or my family. After all, this is strictly business for the company, and businesses must make money. It’s nothing personal — unless we die. I learned the hard way how to survive in this wild world. It entails reading the fine print, contending with confusing website portals, and enduring astonishingly long wait times while being serenaded by repetitive jazz when attempting to reach a live person. Based on my decades-long journey, it appears that a health plan’s modus operandi is: When in doubt, deny. Unfortunately, at times I discover that a claim has been denied only after being contacted by a collections agency. Why? Because insurance approval or denial decisions can be delayed while providers are grilled for “more information” to justify their treatment plans, and bills deemed delinquent are routinely sent to collections. Claims are typically rejected for one or more of these reasons: Preauthorization forms or superbills are not submitted properly. The facility or doctor is not in network. The treatment is not medically necessary. (That one is my all-time favorite.) First, dealing with paperwork and shifting protocols during a crisis doesn’t help anyone’s well-being. This, coupled with the medical field’s reluctance to share digital files (citing privacy issues despite encryption solutions), means we are sent on a scavenger hunt for hard copies of our medical records, or must play digital hopscotch with external sites trying to transfer data into our insurance portals — which frequently malfunction. I believe these portals are programmed to crash multiple times a day. Once documents are submitted successfully, they aren’t always expedited to address urgent situations. It’s mysterious how information I work so hard to obtain seems to vanish into black holes. During my quest for records from a hospital that failed to help my child, I had to revisit the scene of our trauma. Despite being sent to the wrong buildings twice, I persisted and asked another orderly for help. Without breaking stride, she rattled off complicated instructions. She might as well have directed me to follow the yellow brick road, veer left to pass a magic tree house, and then descend floating stairs, all while reciting Hail Marys and clicking my heels three times to reach the golden door. Eventually, I found a dank basement office that matched my mood and the receptionist’s. I then faxed, emailed and even visited a local post office to ensure the copious paperwork reached a grievance coordinator. Trying to call this aggrieved individual was even more challenging. As I cannot get the same person on the phone twice, I find myself reliving the darkest hours of my life repeatedly with each new person, who inevitably offers different instructions than the last. One such encounter went like this: Me: “Hi. I’m calling about my daughter’s ambulance and hospital charges. I haven’t been able to reach my grievance coordinator about the appeal.” Representative: “I can help you.” Me: (Genuinely excited.) “Great!” Representative: “Oh, I see your daughter turned 18. I can’t discuss her information with you.” Me: “I sent a release of information form by mail, fax and email. I also faxed our conservatorship papers.” Representative: “I’m sorry, it’s not on file. What office did you send it to?” Me: (I give the information.) Representative: “That’s the wrong fax number. Let me give you the correct one.” Me: “I’m not inventing numbers out of the ether. This is the third new fax number I’ve been given. Are the address and email inaccurate too?” Representative: “I’m sorry, but I can’t discuss your daughter’s claims with you without this information. Can you put her on the phone to give verbal consent?” Me: “I can’t put her on the phone. She’s currently in a treatment center and has no access to a phone, which is why I have a conservatorship to help with her medical care.” Representative: “I’m sorry, ma’am. There’s nothing I can do without the forms or her verbal consent.” Me: “Who do you think pays the insurance premium and all her providers? I’m just trying to settle her claims, and I don’t know what we owe without access.” Representative: “I can only answer general questions.” Me: “OK. From the bills I’ve received, we’re being charged out-of-network fees for the ambulance, ER, ER doctor and hospital.” Representative: “Was this out of state?” Me: “ Yes.” Representative: “Hang on, I have to transfer you.” I was on hold for another 15 minutes, and then got cut off. I called back, was transferred twice and then repeated a version of the above conversation before resuming — with a grievance coordinator! Grievance coordinator: “The ambulance and ER facility were both out of state and out of network.” Me: “A treatment center called for an ambulance. I wasn’t given a choice of who responded or where they took her.” Grievance coordinator: “They used out-of-network providers.” Me: “They dialed 911. No one stops to ask the closest ambulance what their network status is.” Grievance coordinator: “They did transfer her to an in-network hospital, but the physicians were not participating providers.” Me: “ Under the No Surprises Act , insurance must cover all providers in the case of an emergency, whether they are in network or not — even if out of state.” (There was a long silence.) Me: “Are you still there?” Grievance coordinator: “Yes, ma’am. Once you get the conservatorship papers to us, we can look at those claims. Is there anything else I can help you with?” Me: “ Apparently not.” As for the incident in question , my daughter sustained injuries severe enough to require ambulance transportation, an emergency room visit and subsequent hospitalization. Yet, on top of the network status squabble, my insurance company disagreed with the triage physicians and determined that the hospitalization was “not medically necessary.” The hospital discharged her because the insurance would not cover her stay. The result was disastrous, and she was admitted almost immediately to another hospital. Despite this, she is still alive. Challenging this decision initiated the next phase of the appeals process, which mandates patients’ doctors to engage in peer-to-peer consultations with insurance company doctors to validate treatment plans. How can these decision-makers, who are on the health plan’s payroll and may lack expertise in the relevant specialty, be impartial or make more informed decisions than the doctors in the room? While dealing with my daughter’s crisis, I faced my own when my immunologist prescribed infusions to strengthen my severely weakened immune system. The insurance company was the entity with the authority to deny this treatment. Amazingly, insurance companies also get to dictate which medications patients should take. They prefer us to stay on generic versions that often have lower success rates and make us feel sick, rather than approve a brand-name or compounded medication with a better track record. The same approach applies to recommended alternative therapies. Maybe if health plan employees were with members during unspeakable ER experiences, or their company doctors thoroughly examined us, consulted expert colleagues or read our medical histories, there would be fewer catastrophic lapses in judgment. And, before dismissing our prescribed treatments, shouldn’t they at least learn to pronounce our names? Health plans are not just failing those they are supposed to serve; they are contributing to the problem of overbilling for health care. Physicians may charge more to offset the administrative burden of working with insurance companies and to account for expected negotiations on their service rates. The health insurance industry is so flawed that around half of the insured population in the United States struggles to afford the cost of care and has substantial medical debt. Others cannot afford coverage at all and go without even basic care. I know I am not alone in my outrage. Though I can’t revolutionize an entire industry overnight, I can share intel from my vast experience navigating the current structure successfully, so you can do the same. Laws exist to protect patients, and when staggering under impossible debt, I discovered that the No Surprises Act is one of the most effective. What’s surprising is how few people know it exists. I’ll review the most important bits. This act safeguards consumers from being charged more than the in-network rate for services in certain situations: Two additional factors can allow you to choose an out-of-network provider and still have your insurance cover the cost at the in-network level: Reviewing and appealing these criteria-related claims have become as routine as brushing my teeth. By appealing, I’ve successfully overturned almost $1 million worth of denials. I may now have colorful notes about me in my member profile, but I’m rarely patronized. You deserve access to the health care you need without paying extra. Chances are, you’ve paid for services you’re not even responsible for. You also have the right to appeal any denied claim. Instructions and a form on how to do so accompany every explanation of benefits, or EOB. You can also file from your provider’s website if your member portal is up and running. If you still need help, pick up the phone. Be patient, and don’t let the canned hold music defeat you. If you find yourself in a debate with an aggrieved person, mention the No Surprises Act and see what happens. Often, an awkward reversal occurs where you are offered assistance with an appeal to reprocess your claim. The key takeaway: When in doubt, appeal. Even if denied by your insurance company, you still have the option to escalate the matter to its governing agency , which is responsible for supervising health plans. Each state has one. Sure, it’s annoying, and insurance companies know most members (especially the severely ill) may lack the know-how, luxury of time, or energy to fight back. This exploitation of those most in need can have devastating consequences. There are health and medical billing advocates who specialize in these tasks and typically charge a percentage based on the amount they save or recover for you. The fact that this is a cottage industry further illustrates how badly our health care system needs an overhaul. Yet, as more members challenge the status quo, it creates a ripple effect. Even small actions can lead to reform. I encourage those who are able to call their health plan and request assistance with the appeals paperwork. This costs time and resources. If companies see their profits dip due to employees spending more time managing grievances, they are motivated to resolve the issue. This is how we can dissuade them from kicking back claims they are legally mandated to cover, and how we can effect policy changes, inspire new laws and hopefully keep more cash in our bank accounts.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer Back in 2014, I stood proudly on the New York Stock Exchange podium with my Care.com colleagues, making history as the seventh female founder to take her company public. It was a high point in my career after years of perseverance. B eing a woman of color, an immigrant, and eventually a female founder primarily focused on serving women, I faced expectations and stereotypes at every turn. Here are three key pieces of advice that I learned along the way. We encounter our first gender-based stereotypes early in our lives. Growing up in the Philippines in the ’70s and ’80s, I often fell short of the expectation that girls should be passive, pleasing and perfect. (I call these the three P’s that plague me and so many Asian women into adulthood.) My parents also had plans for me and my five siblings: Each of us had a designated profession. Imagine my parents’ surprise when I got pregnant in 1991 after my sophomore year at Mount Holyoke — a major detour on the road to becoming the lawyer they wanted. But even though I seemed to have a knack for flouting expectations, I still cared deeply about what others thought of me. I became determined to succeed even as I juggled my new role as a young wife and mother and completed not only my BA but also my JD/MBA. As I began my career, I often lied by omission about my family in job interviews so no one could question my dedication. I couldn’t hide the fact that I was a woman of color, but I could hide the fact that I was a mom. I didn’t want to be underestimated and dismissed. I was determined to look and act the part of a young, hungry go-getter whose only focus was to win. Soon, I realized that what I felt were my vulnerabilities were actually my superpowers. I used my intuition and experiences as a woman and mother to create Care.com. When I got to where I needed to be, I prioritized creating a work environment where no one felt the need to lie by omission about their families as I had done, a place where everyone could bring their whole self to work. By the early 2000s, I was a young VP on the management team at UPromise—a consumer rewards program that helped families save for college. Ryan, my first child, was now a teenager. This was a rocky time in my life. I built up very high expectations for everyone — my team at work and my family at home. At times, I treated them similarly to how my parents treated me. And when they didn’t meet those expectations, I struggled. I had given Ryan little choice in his designated hobbies. He’s Asian, so of course he had to play a stringed instrument, and because he’s Filipino, he had to play basketball. He hated me for being such a tiger mom. And I wasn’t faring much better with my team at work. I had gotten through my graduate degrees at Harvard with determination and frequent all-nighters, and I expected my colleagues to demonstrate the same tenacity. When they fell short, I reacted impatiently and without empathy. I thought that’s what respected leaders did. One day, after losing it in a meeting where I discovered my team had missed a deadline, a few colleagues sat me down and told me something that has become a mantra I repeat to this day: Be intense with outcomes, but be chill with people. And I followed through (adjusting my parenting style for my second son, Adam, after the lessons of raising Ryan). It was at this point in my life that I realized that the quality of my relationships is more important than how others see me. I realized that everyone around me has value beyond my expectations of them. My husband, my kids, my team, everyone is the sum of their individual experiences and interests and strengths. I had been so worried about achieving what was expected of me that I was turning around and putting unrealistic expectations on others. I had been so worried about being underestimated that I was underestimating those around me. I had been dragging everyone into playing the game with me, but at what cost? Later, as I was assembling an amazing team to help me build Care.com, I tried to remember the lessons I learned at my previous role. Though there were challenges along the way, we built an incredible culture where teams enjoyed working together as we focused on helping millions of people. While I was working at UPromise, my father had a heart attack, collapsing as he was holding baby Adam. Now I was not only juggling work and family but was also sandwiched between caring for young children and an aging parent. Compartmentalizing my role as an executive from my role as a mother and caregiver became impossible. This is what inspired the idea for Care.com, which would go on to become the world’s largest online marketplace for caregivers. But I was still concerned about what others would think of me if I started a business that appeared to only focus on serving women and moms. In the male-dominated world of tech startups, what could be less sexy than caregiving? Would I be taken seriously? Would I get a fair valuation for myself or my company? Ultimately, I wanted to build a product that people needed — something that would address a real pain point for myself and so many others. I wanted to help families, to put my identity as a woman and mom and caregiver on display for all, and ignore the expectations of the tech world. And so, we helped millions of families around the world find caregivers and helped millions of caregivers find jobs. I became an advocate for caregiving as an economic imperative that enables female entrepreneurship. It was not easy. I was doubly underestimated. Male investors often lack proximity to the problems women face and don’t fully appreciate the economic value of female-focused businesses. But again, I tried to worry less about how others valued me and more about how I valued others. I channeled my energy and experience into both pursuing a mission I loved and building a company on my own terms with compassion and empathy. At the party after I rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, Ryan, who was by this time 21 years old, surprised me with a toast where he said that I had been a great mom. In front of our bankers, accountants and colleagues, I shed tears of pride, unafraid to show my vulnerability. I’m so proud of what we achieved at Care.com, but there’s still unfinished business: to advance female founders, to solve the cognitive load crisis for families and to take advantage of recent advances in AI. And so I’m at it again with another venture: Ohai.ai , an AI assistant for “chief household officers.” I’m still trying to focus on how I see others and let go of how others see me. I’m still trying to be a good manager and leader. I’m still trying to help families around the world — but this time with the gift of hindsight. I’m following my heart, putting my full self and all my vulnerabilities out there. And now, playing the game to win looks totally different.

    "article_content": "General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost A 2016 meeting between Dodgers broadcast legend Vin Scully and Hall of Fame Giants star Willie Mays has gone viral after Mays died Tuesday at age 93. (Watch the video below.) Both men were among the best at their craft, making their conversation at a game in San Francisco so special. It would be Scully’s 67th and final season as a Dodgers announcer. Scully saw it all during his time in the booth but Mays’ visit brought out the gushing schoolboy in him. “First of all, you’ve always been my favorite player, even though you wore the wrong uniform,” Scully said. “You’ve also been the greatest player I ever saw and I’ve said that for a long, long time.” It was a one-way chat for the most part as Scully piled on the accolades. He broke down Mays’ best catches, noting how he marveled over one while dining at old-time New York restaurant Toots Shor’s. Their chat caught the attention of photographers. “He’s still the best in every way possible way,” Scully said toward the cameras. “You really are.” Scully, who died in 2022 age 94 , called his wife, Sandi, over to meet him. She and Mays hugged. The video was shared on the Dodger Blue YouTube channel in 2016 and racked up more than 1.5 million views after an X account posted it on Tuesday. If there is a heaven, perhaps Mays, who collected 660 home runs and 3,293 hits, and Scully can resume their conversation.

    "article_content": "Shopping Writer, HuffPost HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. A rechargeable LED reading light designed to wear around the neck was one of the most popular HuffPost reader buys during the holiday gift-giving season and earlier this year. The device has over 93,000 5-star ratings on Amazon , and reviewers call it “ tremendous ” and “ one of the best purchases I’ve ever made .” Its around-the-neck design is actually pretty genius: It lets you read, work or craft with completely free hands, and concentrates light directly on the page or your task so you can see clearly, even in the dark. The reading light can come in handy all year and best of all, it’s back on sale for under $20 with a coupon ! Just remember to clip the coupon before adding it to your cart and the discount will pop up at checkout. This versatile neck light is so much more than a reading light. Reviewers sing its praises for knitting, cross-stitching, camping, home improvement projects and more. It’d be useful for anyone who generally needs good, hands-free lighting; it even makes a great hands-free flashlight, wrote one reviewer . (It’s also great for reading on planes without disturbing your neighbor!) Plus — and this is huge — you’ll be able to read in bed without disturbing a sleeping bed partner, since unlike traditional reading lights that broadly project light, this focuses illumination directly on and closely to your page or phone. It’ll also let you read or knit while your family watches TV, without needing to turn on all the lights. Its addition to your home may just help avert fights or, at the very least, help your partner get better shut-eye or catch up on their favorite show while you do something else next to them. By swapping it in for a lamp or overhead light, it may just lower your electricity bill, as one reviewer is sure it will. Amazon reviewers with arthritis also love this gadget ; one wrote that the light is so comfortable and lightweight she sometimes forgets she even has it on. “Another perk,” explained another reviewer , “is the light adds zero weight to your books, which can get heavy and cumbersome for people with arthritis.” The light’s arms are adjustable and super bendy so you can get exactly the right fit, and you can choose between six brightness levels and three hues depending on whether you want an extra-bright or a dimmer glow. It’s available in eight colors so you can grab the one that suits you best. Take a look at what these very fervent Amazon reviewers have to say: “Obsessed!!! Had it one day and already bought as a gift. Most brilliant and useful gadget. So lightweight and flexible and easy and versatile. LOVE IT!!!!” — Vanessa “I needed more light for doing cross stitching. The lamp I had behind me was not shedding enough light and my shoulders and head always caused a shadow. I see these on a FaceBook advertisement and thought to my self “This is exactly what I need”. I can say they don’t disappoint I used them right from the box the day I got them and they didn’t need charging for 2 days. They charge fast and the charge lasts for many, many hours. I like the fact that they have different light settings so I can see the colors accurately. My daughter teased me about using them saying I had “old eyes”, but then the next evening she was doing embroidery in her room and came out and asked to borrow them. Now she wants a light of her own. These are a game changer for sure. 5 stars. ” — Celeste R Sotomayor “ This was recommended by two different people and my purchase didn’t disappoint! I spent years fighting with the book clip on ones and it drove me crazy. If reading a paperback, the book always fell over with the weight. If reading a hard back book, it added weight I didn’t need. This works perfectly for reading and for walking into the dark bedroom without waking my husband. Great product!” — tcw “Okay, this light is the best thing since sliced bread. I love to read at night, but hated leaving the lights in our bedroom on before going to bed. Even my table lamp was still too bright for me. This little light is perfect though. I loveee reading until I’m almost asleep. With this light I just close my book, hit the small power button, and then I’m out cold. Only thing I regret is not getting the travel case for this thing yet. I travel quite a bit and love taking this light with me. It’s perfect for reading on planes and not disturbing the people around you. I always feel so uncomfortable turning on the bright overhead “reading lights” on planes since I know it can bug the crap out of people! Game changer! ” — Michael Norris “ This has been a game changer for knitting and crocheting. As my eyes continue to age, working on dark color wools for knitting or crochet is getting harder. This light is perfect. It is lightweight so doesn’t cause pressure around my neck/shoulder and has great adjustments for cool to warm and brightness. It allows for clear visual on intricate stitching. I purchased a travel case for it and take this everywhere. It’s also great for reading on long plane trips. ” — Snow Girl By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost NEW YORK — As significant as the events inside a lower Manhattan courtroom this past month have been, with the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president, perhaps more significant is what has been happening on the streets outside: nothing. No rioting. No violence. Not even the hint of civil war. Despite dire warnings from Donald Trump and some of his allies that prosecutors in New York and elsewhere would trigger mayhem if they dared charge him with a crime, so far at least, his trial has taken place with virtually no protest at all. Early Monday in the park across from the courthouse, there were no pro-Trump protesters. A single anti-Trump protester walked back and forth holding a sign: “TRUMP 2 TERRIFIED 2 TESTIFY.” “People are now aware that there is a cost for showing up for him,” said Heather Cox Richardson, a historian at Boston College who in recent years has been warning about a Trump-centered autocratic movement. “They’re not willing to put themselves on the line for him.” In the blocks surrounding the courthouse itself, local business owners seemed unaware that Trump had called for protests on his behalf. “Didn’t know anything about it,” said one jewelry store owner, who asked that his name not be used. Salim Chowdhury, owner of the Kabob Town two blocks up the road, said he has seen plenty of large protests come up Canal Street, from Black Lives Matter to recent ones for Gaza. He has not seen much of anything regarding Trump. “We’re not worried,” he said. Trump has made it clear from his daily tirades to the reporters in the corridor outside his 15th floor courtroom that he has noticed the lack of major demonstrations on his behalf despite his repeated calls for one, including one on social media the day before his trial began when he wrote : “MAGA 2024! SEE YOU TOMORROW.” “It’s like an armed camp outside. You can’t get one person within three blocks of this courthouse,” he said May 13, falsely claiming that police were denying people access to the courthouse area. He repeated and embellished the lie as he entered court Monday: “Outside looks like it’s supposed to be Fort Knox. There’s more police than I’ve ever seen anywhere because they don’t want to have anyone come down. There’s not a civilian within three blocks of the courthouse.” Trump has already proved that he can incite violence. For weeks following his 2020 election loss, he lied that it had been “stolen” from him, perhaps most consequentially at a rally near the White House on the morning of the congressional vote to certify the election results. He urged the tens of thousands of his followers he had called to Washington on that day to march on the Capitol to pressure lawmakers and his own vice president into overturning the outcome and awarding him a second term. “When you catch somebody in a fraud, you’re allowed to go by very different rules,” Trump told them. Over the next several hours, 140 police officers were injured in the attack, some gravely. One died hours later, and four others died by suicide in the coming weeks and months. In the 40 months since Jan. 6, 2021, 1,424 of his followers who participated in the assault have been tracked down and arrested by the Department of Justice on charges including trespassing, assault on a police officer, and seditious conspiracy. There have already been 1,019 convictions from guilty pleas and jury verdicts, and new arrests continue to this day. Indeed, the DOJ’s aggressive pursuit of seemingly every person who entered the Capitol complex — which at the time was not open to the public because of COVID-19 restrictions — may be the biggest reason Trump has been unable to unleash havoc again, at least to date. “Jan. 6 failed, thankfully, and it led to severe consequences for those who participated,” a former congressional aide who worked with the House committee investigating Jan. 6 said on condition of anonymity. “It’s reasonable to assume those key points might dissuade anyone from trying to engage in those tactics again, despite Trump’s pleas.” Those pleas began more than two years ago, when it became clear he was under criminal investigation in at least three jurisdictions. “If these radical, vicious, racist prosecutors do anything wrong or illegal, I hope we are going to have in this country the biggest protests we have ever had in Washington, D.C., in New York, in Atlanta and elsewhere, because our country and our elections are corrupt,” he said to a rally audience in Conroe, Texas, on Jan. 29, 2022. Seven months later, after Trump’s Mar-a-Lago country club in Palm Beach, Florida, was searched for secret documents he had taken with him when he left the White House, Trump warned against a prosecution: “I think you’d have problems in this country the likes of which perhaps we’ve never seen before. I don’t think the people of the United States would stand for it.” As the months passed and prosecutors closed in, Trump’s language and tone escalated. “PROTEST, TAKE OUR NATION BACK!” Trump demanded in a social media post on March 24, 2023, just days before Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg brought the first of four total felony indictments. There have been individual cases of violence by Trump supporters. In 2022, after the Mar-a-Lago raid, a man was killed as he tried to shoot his way into an FBI office in Ohio. A Texas woman was charged with making threats against Tanya Chutkan, the federal judge overseeing the prosecution against Trump for the Jan. 6 coup attempt. Trump was able to get small groups of protesters for his arraignments in New York and Miami last year, and managed to persuade about 50 supporters to come to the courthouse the day of his trial’s opening on April 15. But, at least so far, there has been no massive attack by Trump followers, as there was on Jan. 6. Some Trump allies claim that no one is protesting for him because both the ongoing New York City trial on charges he falsified business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment as well as his other prosecutions are actually helping him. “Look at the New York Times polling,” said Mike Davis, a former Senate staff lawyer who has become a favorite legal voice in Trump’s orbit, when asked what happened to the massive protests Trump had called for. “That’s what happened.” Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman who unsuccessfully challenged Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination, said Trump’s hardcore supporters have not cared enough about the New York case to be angry about it. “They really don’t take this trial seriously at all. They don’t care about this one. They actually think he’ll get off on this one,” he said. Amanda Carpenter, a former staffer in Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz’s office who now works for the nonpartisan Protect Democracy, said it’s important to keep in mind that while Trump’s calls for unrest may not have brought actual violence so far, the undercurrent of violence appears to be slowing down the court calendar in his favor. In Atlanta, a trial on Trump’s attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia originally scheduled for this spring now has been postponed. In South Florida, the federal judge presiding over the classified documents prosecution has repeatedly stalled the proceedings and recently canceled a summer trial date. And the biggest case, the Washington, D.C., federal prosecution based on Trump’s actions leading to Jan. 6, is on hold until the Supreme Court considers Trump’s argument that he has immunity for everything he did because he was president at the time. Unless the high court returns a ruling quickly, a trial on the charges before the November election seems unlikely there, as well. “I think we should take into account whether these threats were successful in getting much of the trial action delayed,” Carpenter said. And Walsh, who supported Trump in 2016 but quickly became a vocal critic after watching his behavior in office, warns that just because there has not been violence yet doesn’t mean that it won’t happen in the days to come. “Trump going on trial for January 6th would be different,” he said. Davis, who argues that all four of the indictments are illegitimate, agrees: “Wait until they try to imprison Trump.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Both Time and the New Yorker offered sneak peeks of upcoming magazine covers that brutally mocked the former president’s convictions. Meanwhile, the verdict was the main story on newspaper front pages both in America and abroad. You can see how it was covered thanks to a social media thread posted on X, formerly Twitter, by Jason Kint of Digital Content Next, a media trade association. “As I’ve said in the past, nothing makes a statement on important news close to the newspaper front page,” Kint said while introducing the lengthy thread. “Across America, almost every editor went with the simple fact, ‘Guilty.’” Let’s do this.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer Everything I know about dad is what I have seen in other people’s fathers, how I have witnessed my husband behave with our children, what I have read about, or what I have watched in the movies. My own story never really had a dad in it. My parents split up when I was 2, and though my dad and I often spent holidays and summer vacations together, the relationship we had began to unravel. It isn’t the details that matter — the drinking or the certainty that being with him meant I was putting myself in a position where I’d be hurt. What matters is I lost him — or, more accurately, I lost the idea of him — and never got him back. Over the years, there were glimpses of a man that I could look up to. My father was a wonderful storyteller. He was spontaneous, adventurous, funny and charming. He was the kind of person who made a party. But that man was for everyone else, not for his daughter, once the trust between us was gone. When I was in high school, I wrote him a letter. I knew I wasn’t brave enough to say what I wanted to his face, but I was naïve enough to believe I could put together words on paper in such a way that it would move him enough to change. The letter was vulnerable and honest, and even though everything up until that point told me not to, I allowed myself the one thing I shouldn’t have —hope. After I mailed the letter, I checked the mail every day awaiting his response. A few weeks later, it came. I don’t remember much of what it said except two sentences, “You could learn a lot from a dog. Don’t shit where you eat.” Those words solidified for me that change was not going to be an option for us, and told me never again to open myself to him. It wasn’t long after that that our first estrangement began. It lasted many years — through all my college days, my early 20s and after I got married. A few years after my wedding, he sent me a letter. He had remarried (for the third time), had finally stopped drinking and wanted to try and repair our relationship. I was reluctant, but he said that all he was asking for was a chance; I told him I would try. What I remember most about that time was the oddity of it. Dinners at his house, chatting with his new wife, swallowing all the old feelings while clumsily trying to fabricate new ones. We were strangers playing the roles of father and daughter. After the get-togethers, he would walk me out, hug me and say he loved me. I would say it back even though I didn’t want to. He would feel better; I would feel worse. Each visit was like giving away another piece of myself. “My father was a wonderful storyteller. He was spontaneous, adventurous, funny and charming. He was the kind of person who made a party. But that man was for everyone else, not for his daughter, once the trust between us was gone.” A few months into our reconciliation, after two years of struggling with infertility, my husband and I started the process of IVF. It was then I began ignoring my father’s calls. I couldn’t bear him being a part of it. The experience was too personal; I was too raw. My body was bruised from endless shots, my emotions dizzy from the hormones. I didn’t have it in me to keep the charade going in the midst of it. Although the procedure was successful and I became pregnant with twins, the relief was short-lived. The pregnancy soon became high risk when a medical emergency left me on bed rest for several months. From the confines of my bed, I wrote him a letter saying I needed to cut off communication again. My decision was met with anger; I didn’t have time to care. The first few months after the twins were born were a blur. My days consisted of round-the-clock feedings, crying babies and walking circles around the house as I bounced them in my arms. But in this sleepless, grueling cycle, as my heart exploded with love, I knew I needed to focus on where my life was going instead of returning back to what it had been. ### Less than a year after I stopped speaking to my father for the last time, he died. A call informing me about his illness had come from my sister a few months before. “Dad has cancer,” she told me, “and it doesn’t look good.” I wrestled with what to do. Could I walk into a hospital room and play the part of a devoted daughter? Could I say I loved him when in reality I felt like I barely knew him? But what else do you say to a dying man? Especially when that man is your father. I decided I could not. I received updates on the progression of his disease but never went to see him myself. Sometimes, I think about that fact. A lot of times, I don’t tell people that fact. Almost always, I don’t think anyone would really understand unless they had a childhood with a man who may have been a father but was never a dad. Still, the choice I made has haunted me most of my adult life, revisiting my thoughts unexpectedly. Would I still do the same thing today? The answer, like so many things in life, is layered and messy. As a young girl, I was not as aware of what I was missing because I had never known anything else, but as I grew older and had my own children, I began to understand. I watched my husband dote on our children, and it solidified that they were experiencing a relationship I had never had. The void of not having a father felt deeper. Today, my children are the age I was when the first estrangement with my father began. I think about how different their lives have been from mine. When my father died, I didn’t cry. In some ways, instead of sorrow, what I felt most was a sense of relief. It was finally over and he could never hurt me again. I went to the funeral a few days later and sat in the back of the church, doing my best to go unnoticed while people I had never met got up and spoke about a man I never knew. The loss of my father will always be a part of who I am. It will always make me think about what could have been. But what I have come to understand is that my grief didn’t begin with my father’s death. I lost him at eight. And it was often harder to be with him and feel that loss when he was alive. His death didn’t change that. Cutting him off felt like taking hold of the narrative I had rarely had any say in before. It was not a decision that I came to easily. It was not something that happened after one event. It came after dozens and dozens of them. It came after just as many broken promises. I gave my father many chances and, in the end, I chose to protect myself instead. Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Despite the popular idea of job ladders, a career journey is not typically a straightforward path onward and upward. At some point, there are likely to be detours when you lose a job unexpectedly or need to take time off to take care of yourself or a family member . That’s when you might take what is known as a “bridge job.“ Career coach Jasmine Escalera defined a bridge job as one you take “to stay in the career game, even though that step isn’t your end goal, in an effort to acquire certain skill sets or experiences that will get you closer to that end goal.” In other words, they are the jobs you take when you need to shelter in place amid a tough job market and/or when you are burned out and need time to decompress. I’ve certainly had one, and you might, too. For me, my bridge job was a two-year stint writing blog posts for a job board site after a layoff. It boosted my confidence, gave me free time to write fiction on the side and taught me that I do enjoy staying up to date on management trends, something that I do to this day. For Escalera, one of her bridge jobs was being an Uber Eats driver while she worked on building her coaching business. “I credit that as being one of the most influential points of my life. Because there I really had the space and time to think about what kind of business I actually want to grow,” Escalera said. And you’re not alone if you’re weighing whether to take one. Due to mass layoffs and a flooded job market, Escalera said she’s seeing more people take a bridge job right now. “I think people are much more open to taking contract positions, freelance positions, things that are truly going to help them stay in the market and maybe potentially try some new things out,” she said. Despite how common they are, there can still be a lot of stigma attached to taking bridge jobs. “People often feel ashamed of taking a bridge job because it feels like taking a step backward from their career goals, they worry about the optics of a bridge job on a resume or they fear difficulty reentering their desired career path later on,” said marketing manager Hanna Goefft , who shares tips on how to get hired on TikTok . “We’re often socialized to believe that a ‘successful’ career means advancing in a traditional, linear trajectory.“ However, bridge jobs can be a strategic next move if you put their benefits into perspective. “If the best option for you is to take a role that allows you to pay your bills and take care of yourself, that is absolutely the right decision to make,” Goefft said. Escalera said the shame of bridge jobs is tied to “this old-school mindset and mentality of, ‘We have to be on a path.’” But careers are a long and winding road. A bridge job can be the refreshing reset your career needs when you feel stuck. “If you’re not on the right path, don’t feel fulfilled, don’t feel happy, don’t feel growth ... then you should have the opportunity to experience bridge jobs and use that as a very strategic way for you to create experiences to determine what you want to do next,” Escalera said. It can be overwhelming to wonder where you will be in five years and how you will get there. That’s why it can be more useful to break up your long-term goal into manageable, shorter goals. Ask yourself: What’s my next right move? A bridge job may be the right answer. Thinking of pivoting to an entirely new career? Get a bridge job that will expand your network in your desired field. “Bridge jobs are really great for transitioners because they give you the opportunity to dip your toe in and see what’s working,” Escalera said. Even if it is a job that is entirely outside of your desired industry, it can still be a useful bridge job if it will help you gain a new skill for your resume. Goefft used her own trajectory as an example. “I started my career by accepting a job offer in accounting while my subconscious was telling me I wanted a more creative career in marketing,” she said. “At the time, I felt the same concerns: fear that the role would pigeonhole me into an industry that I didn’t care about, and fear that I’d struggle to get interviews with that role on my resume. But over time, I’ve been able to recognize the invaluable skills I learned in accounting that I never would have gotten exposure to in marketing.” Maybe the bridge job is simply a chance to take a breather and have a lighter workload while your current career is not your top priority. That’s OK, too. For Jannese Torres , host of the personal finance podcast Yo Quiero Dinero , a bridge job is “any job that pays you probably less than what you’re used to earning.” Ideally, “It should also not contribute to your stress, it shouldn’t be a job that adds more to your plate in a negative way. It should be something that helps you manage that transition period,” she added. For entrepreneurs, the bridge job can be a great way for you to grow your business without feeling pressured to make it your full-time gig right away. “If you’re in a situation where your business might be bringing in maybe 50% of what you need to live on, that bridge job can help you make up the other income that you need in order to meet your expenses, but also not be the thing that sucks up so much time away from your business,” Torres said. You do not have to mention every bridge job you have done on a resume, but don’t be ashamed of your diverse skill set. Sometimes, it can be the very experience that will help you stand out from other candidates. Escalera gave the example of mentioning what you learned as a barista in a job interview unrelated to that field. If you can frame how the barista job taught you project management and customer service capabilities that no one else has and how you’re going to use those to solve problems at the organization, then, “Boom, you’ve got the job,” she said. So, see your bridge jobs as something to be proud of. They show you are still learning and pushing yourself forward, despite all the many bumps and potholes that you’re likely to hit on the road of life.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life It’s hard to imagine a worse place to get sick than on an airplane. But unfortunately, it happens ― in many forms. There are a number of unpleasant and even potentially dangerous conditions that travelers can develop during a flight. Nausea, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, congestion, blood clots, sinus infections, tinnitus — travelers may find themselves dealing with these problems once they’re in the air. “A bad sinus infection can sometimes worsen when you fly because of the change in air pressure,” Dr. Danielle Qing , an assistant professor and internal medicine specialist at Mount Sinai, told HuffPost. “This can lead to a popping sensation in your eardrums, and in very rare instances can sometimes cause your eardrum to perforate. And then, of course, there’s motion sickness, which can look like nausea, vomiting, headaches and lightheadedness. Turbulence can make it even worse.” Getting sick while flying can be hard to handle. As Dr. Daniel Chandler , a primary care physician at Tufts Medical Center, told HuffPost, “Airplanes are funny places because things that would be so easy to fix on the ground are more difficult to fix in the air due to a lack of resources and people to fix it.” Still, there are steps you can take to alleviate the issue if you get sick on a plane. HuffPost asked doctors to share their advice for dealing with in-flight illnesses. “If you are experiencing motion sickness, try to avoid things that are visual like your phone or the plane TVs,” Chandler said. “Instead, sleep. But if you can’t sleep, listen to something like music, a podcast or an audiobook.” If you’re trying to stave off nausea, he also advised against looking at the vomit bags in the seats, as that might make you feel more nauseous. “Stare at the horizon if you are in a window seat,” Dr. Rabia De Latour , a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, said. She also recommended avoiding unnecessarily moving your head. Qing offered similar advice in the event of dizziness. “Closing your eyes and applying a cold compress can often lessen the symptoms,” she said. If you’re experiencing nausea or gastrointestinal symptoms, do your best to stay hydrated, as dehydration can worsen your condition. Be sure to drink your fluids slowly and carefully, however, to avoid another trip to the bathroom. “Attempt hydration with water, not carbonated beverages,” De Latour said. The airplane cabin environment can be very dehydrating , so even if you aren’t feeling sick, take extra care to drink plenty of water on flight days. Getting ample H2O can help with headaches and dizziness as well. “People aren’t drinking enough water when they travel, so dehydration is a common reason for headaches during a flight,” Chandler said. “Sometimes dizziness is just a version of motion sickness, but sometimes it can be from dehydration, too. Particularly if you had alcohol, take in some extra water.” Sometimes, eating is the last thing you want to do when you’re feeling sick. But do what you can to get a little something down. “Try some bread or crackers,” Chandler said. “Having a small amount of bland food in your stomach can actually take away a little bit of that nausea.” Many experts recommend the BRAT diet ― bananas, rice, applesauce and toast ― in cases of nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea. Travelers with chronic conditions should try to pack helpful snacks in their bags, too. “If you are diabetic or taking insulin, make sure you bring some candy or snacks on board in case your blood sugar gets too low,” Qing said. “When you travel, it’s always a good idea to keep an extra supply of medication handy, especially if you have certain chronic conditions, such as diabetes or angina,” Qing said. “Having at least seven days of your medications in your carry-on is a helpful precaution, especially if your checked bag gets lost.” For example, if you have a seizure disorder, she recommended that you have your seizure medications handy in case of an emergency. Those with coronary artery disease or angina should bring their nitroglycerin tablets, and anyone with a history of anaphylaxis should bring an EpiPen, in addition to informing the airline of allergy concerns. If you’ve experienced motion sickness while traveling, take medication like Dramamine to help with that, Chandler said. He noted that many travelers pack medications like ibuprofen, aspirin, Pepto-Bismol, Tylenol, Benadryl and Excedrin to address potential health issues, especially if they have a previous history. “Traveler’s diarrhea is quite common, so if you’re traveling to a country where that often happens, you might want to bring medicine for it,” Chandler said. “Usually it’s a crummy 12 to 24 hours that you just have to tough out. But you need to stay hydrated.” Some illnesses that arise might require you to make frequent trips to the bathroom, but for the most part, you want to stay in your seat while you’re sick on a plane ― especially if you’re experiencing dizziness or headaches. “Try to stay seated, as sometimes standing could worsen your symptoms,” Qing said. “Make sure you are not standing to avoid fall risk and head injury,” De Latour added. “If you are able to lie down, that is ideal, although that can be difficult on a plane.” If you can manage to fall asleep either sitting or lying down, that’s an ideal way to pass the flight time and keep your body still. “Dizziness could also be from something called vertigo,” Chandler said. “If you’ve got either a predisposition to vertigo or have experienced it, some medicines can help. Otherwise, keep your head down and eyes closed. Having your center of gravity a little lower can help you feel less dizzy.” Vomiting or getting diarrhea on a flight can feel embarrassing, but it’s important to inform someone in the flight crew if you’re experiencing a health issue. “If you are having any of these symptoms, the first thing you need to do is let a flight attendant know so that they can get you medical attention if needed,” Qing said. “They should be able to get you some water or other fluids, especially if you are dehydrated. Many airlines also carry some over-the-counter medications that might help you feel better.” In extreme situations, the flight crew might even designate a lavatory for you to use for extended periods, though they can’t allow you to stay in there during takeoff and landing. Let a flight attendant know if you’re feeling dizzy and your symptoms are worsening as well. The more information the crew has, the easier it is for them to properly assist you if you pass out. “Flight attendants are incredibly well trained,” Chandler said. “If you have a chronic condition ― say you’re diabetic and at risk for having low blood sugar ― wear a medical ID bracelet so that people can read the bracelet and know to give you sugar or check your blood sugar.” He also recommended traveling with a list of your chronic illnesses, allergies and medications you take. “Another important issue to keep an eye on, especially long-distance flights, is blood clots, particularly for people who have a history of them,” Qing said. “The best defense against blood clots is to simply move your legs every once in a while. Swelling or pain in one leg can be a sign of a blood clot forming.” Staying immobile for long periods of time increases your chance of developing blood clots, and conditions like pregnancy can further escalate your risk. If you have a history of blood clots, Qing suggested trying to walk along the aisle every few hours to keep from developing another one. You can also inform the flight attendants to get the OK to move around, as long as it’s safe. Compression socks help as well. “Usually, when a flight causes blood clots, they develop after you land. But these days, some flights are almost 20 hours long,” Chandler said. “Make sure to walk around every 30 to 60 minutes. And if you notice one leg is more swollen than the other, then you definitely want to alert the cabin crew.” Sometimes, illness develops unexpectedly during air travel, but in other cases, you might have a heads-up. “Avoid flying when hungover or withdrawing from alcohol,” De Latour said. “Avoid traveling while sick, also to prevent infecting others. Don’t fly if you have any instability in your underlying medical condition.” Consult with a medical professional before flying if you’re unsure. “If you have certain lung conditions that require oxygen, they may worsen because of the change in air pressure,” Qing said. “If you are on oxygen, it’s definitely a good idea to discuss your plans with your doctor.” Also, pay attention to time zone changes if you’re traveling a long distance. “It’s very easy to miss a dose of your medication because your phone might switch to local time while your body is on the original time,” Chandler said. “Make sure you stay up on whatever medications you take on a regular basis so your chronic illness isn’t exacerbated.” Do your best to make contingency plans, even if it means postponing your trip or taking precautions like wearing a diaper, Chandler added. “This might sound complicated, but planning ahead can help prevent a scary situation,” Qing said. “If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask your doctor before you leave. That’s why we’re here.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life A lot of people are frequent flyers these days, but their knowledge of air travel still can’t compare with the level that flight attendants possess. This is especially clear when crew members travel as passengers themselves. “Working as a flight attendant changes your perspective on a lot of things,” Francesco Lentini , a flight attendant with a major U.S. carrier, told HuffPost. “You learn that many people are traveling for different reasons, whether it be vacation or a funeral, so you learn to be empathetic. You also realize that some people can be inconsiderate and are not thinking about their fellow passengers.” To combat that lack of consideration and offer guidance for air travelers, HuffPost asked Lentini and other flight attendants what behaviors they always avoid when they fly as passengers. “When I’m a passenger on a flight, you’ll never catch me taking off my shoes, walking barefoot, or casually putting my feet all over the walls and seats,” said Jay Robert, a former flight attendant and the founder of A Fly Guy Travels . In addition to the lack of social decorum, there are also hygiene considerations. “Having witnessed what goes on behind the scenes, I’m not about to expose my bare skin to the floors of an aircraft,” Robert noted. “I’ve seen the effort the crew puts into ‘cleaning’ the toilets on flights, and that damp bathroom floor isn’t damp from sink water.” He added: “Airplane carpets are typically spot-cleaned, if cleaned at all during the daily rotations. I’ve encountered every imaginable human fluid stain on those carpets. The goal for aircraft cleaners is often just to mask the smell; they don’t have the time, especially when the plane is in operation, to thoroughly clean the carpet.” “As a passenger, I would never stand in the aircraft galley for a lengthy period of time,” Lentini said. “This is the flight attendant’s workspace where we work and eat. Last thing we want is to have a passenger doing yoga poses in our faces while we are having our lunch.” Robert similarly emphasized the limited breaks that the cabin crew might get between and during flights. “During flights on the London-to-Dubai route, our free time in uniform was a mere 15 minutes within a 15-hour time frame, usually spent hastily grabbing a meal that often got interrupted by someone needing assistance,” he explained. “As a passenger now, I make a conscious effort not to intrude into the crew’s spaces, ensuring they can have a peaceful meal break. Treating the aircraft as the cabin crew’s office is crucial. I wouldn’t barge into a restaurant or hotel and sit in the employee break room to watch them eat, so I extend the same respect to the staff in the sky. It’s a shared space, and recognizing and respecting the limited space available is key.” “When I am on a plane as a passenger, one thing I would never do is ring the call light button unless it’s an emergency,” said Christa Treat , a flight attendant with a major U.S. airline. “Most people think that button is for extra drinks and snacks. But in reality, call lights should be saved for emergencies. Majority of the time, flight attendants never sit down and are constantly running the entire time doing things, so ringing the call light to ask for another drink as a passenger is something I would never do.” She noted that flight attendants frequently come through the cabin to do safety checks, so if you need another drink, you can ask then. Or if the seat belt light is off, you’re welcome to go to the galley to make a request. “Get up, stretch your legs and walk to the back to say hello,” said Heather Poole, a flight attendant and the author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads, Crew Drama, and Crazy Passengers at 35,000 Feet.” “I would never hand trash to the flight attendant as I’m boarding the airplane — which happens quite often,” Lentini said. “People come on the plane with their trash from the terminal and give it to the flight attendant to throw away.” Flight attendants have to do important preflight checks and keep the boarding process running smoothly as passengers stow their bags and find their seats. So try to dispose of your trash in one of the receptacles in the airport before boarding. Similarly, try to do your business before boarding and takeoff as well. “When I’m a passenger on an airplane, I would never use the aircraft lavatory during the boarding process,” Lentini said. “There are dozens of restrooms in the terminal to use. Using the lavatory during boarding can delay departure because then passengers are going against the flow of traffic to get back to their seat.” Many travelers understandably prefer to stick to carry-on luggage when they travel, but you still need to adhere to the size and weight restrictions. “I want passengers to know if you can’t lift your bag in the overhead bins, chances are I can’t either,” Treat said. “We are glad to check your bag and help get it to your final destination, but there’s no need for either of us to get a shoulder injury just because you want your bag above you. We’ll check it for free!” If you want a tasty, filling meal on a flight day, don’t assume that the airline will provide that for you on the plane. Unless you’re in a special premium cabin, you’re mostly on your own. “I don’t depend on an airline to take care of me,” Poole said. “I buy water in the terminal and make sure to bring food from home, or I buy something to eat before the flight. Travel is more enjoyable when you take care of yourself. Airplane food is like astronaut food. Not worth getting upset over.“ “What has changed the most for me since becoming a flight attendant is how I prepare myself before boarding the aircraft,” said Sif Björnsdóttir, a senior cabin crew member and deputy manager of cabin crew training at the Icelandic airline Play. “I have everything I need in my seat ready to go and everything else goes in my in flight bag so that when I board, it takes me seconds to get to my seat.” She emphasized the importance of getting organized before the boarding process. “If there is one passenger taking too much time to get things from their bag, everyone else has to wait for that person to get in their seat,” she said. “Working as a flight attendant will change your perspective the same way working as a waiter changes your dining experience, or how working in retail changes how you treat anyone who works in sales,” Poole said. “You make eye contact, you say hello, please, and thank you, and you treat workers with respect. You have patience, and you know when something goes wrong there’s only so much a person can do. You know a flight attendant can’t blink and, poof, magically create more baggage space or fix a broken plane.” Poole and other flight attendants who spoke to HuffPost emphasized that their primary job is ensuring safety. Although they do serve food and drinks, flight attendant training focuses on skills like evacuating airplanes, applying first-aid techniques, using emergency equipment, putting out fires, handling dangerous items and surviving in the event of a water landing. “Obviously as a flight attendant, I want everyone to be comfortable and hydrated and have a great flight, but it’s our job to keep everyone safe first,” Treat said. “That’s why we are so rigid about the rules. Our job is to get you from point A to point B safely.” Flight crews in the U.S. also typically aren’t paid until the airplane doors shut, which means their efforts during the boarding and deplaning process — and the hour they’re required to be at the airport before the flight and the time between consecutive flights — are not compensated. During long workdays involving many unpaid hours, kindness from passengers can really go a long way. “A flight attendant has no control over why the Wi-Fi is not working, or an aircraft maintenance issue, or whether or not you will make your connection ― and no, we can’t call your next flight and tell them to hold the plane,” Lentini said. “But at the end of the day, a flight attendant will bend over backwards for you as long as you’re kind and treat them with respect.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. Time and time again, dermatologists have told us how essential retinoids (like retinol ) are to a well-rounded skin care routine, specifically one that’s geared toward premature skin aging prevention. This is because, according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Rebecca Marcus , retinol i ncreases cell turnover, thus helping to stimulate collagen production. When it comes to this powerful “active” ingredient, there’s an ongoing debate about prescription-only compositions. Marcus explained that they’re already in an active form that can be utilized by the skin, making their effect stronger and faster than OTC products. The other side of the argument insists that stronger doesn’t always mean better. Retinol, particularly prescription-strength, has a notorious reputation for causing irritation, especially for more mature skin, which Marcus said is more delicate. OTC retinol, on the other hand, can be less sensitizing and better tolerated, though potentially less effective. But, the Pharma Development A313 retinol cream from France, which features a distinctive texture and three different types of effective retinol, may be able to provide a happy medium between the two. Today, the cream is on sale for nearly 35% off although we suspect it won’t be marked down for very long. ″[A313] contains minimal ingredients in its vehicle, which is helpful for those who are sensitive to fragrances or other ingredients that are commonly found in OTC retinol products,” Marcus said. And while she acknowledged the fact that the actives in A313 are not the same potency as the retinoid acid present in prescription-strength formulas like Tretinoin , “the three types of retinol in A313 are effective over-the-counter-strength retinol ingredients.” In fact, some users who had been using prescription-strength Tretinoin then made the switch to this alternative, say they prefer A313 and have maintained the same results that they had with the prescription-strength formula. Its distinctive occlusive texture is closer to a balm, which according to reviewers , can be more hydrating compared to other pricier formulations that you might find on the OTC market. The brand claims that the 2% retinol concentration can help unclog pores, minimize fine lines, reduce hyperpigmentation and even out skin texture. Reviewers agree that this lower strength hasn’t impacted A313’s efficacy and suggested adhering to a gradual and minimal application process in order to avoid redness or skin flaking, similar to the “tolerance building” period required for prescription retinoids. This period typically involves just applying a pea-sized amount one or two times a week for a few months before increasing to a more frequent application. (It’s always a good idea to check with your dermatologist to know if retinol is a good option for you.) Put A313 to the test and potentially target multiple skin concerns with this one under $20 product, or take a peek at some promising reviews just in case you need a bit more convincing. Promising Amazon reviews: “I have tried so many different products. I have spent so much money. This is superb !! I will never touch anything else. My skin is beautiful. My pores have shrunk , fine lines and wrinkles are gone and the skin texture is soft like I’ve always wanted it.” — Bella. “I was skeptical on purchasing this as I figured it would dry my face out as the other creams like this do. This actually hydrates my face and I have seen a huge improvement in my skin. I’m turning 40 and since I’ve started using this product I can actually say my face looks younger.” — Miss Pissy “ I’ve been using prescription Tretinoin for 20 years now and I like this A313 more because of the thick moisture barrier it gives. Has all of the benefits of keeping skin clear, high cell turnover to eliminate fine lines and wrinkles BUT….. 1. START SLOW. When they say pea size- they mean PEA SIZE. This stuff spreads and is thick in the best of ways. Once every day or two or your skin will become irritated. This is strong stuff. It will sting if you’re putting it on too often. But then your skin will start to tolerate it more and you can slowly move up to once at night. 2. DO NOT for the love of everything holy and holey put on within 45 minutes to an hour of washing your face or showering. Water will make this stuff sting like the devil and you do not need that in your life. Just wait. 3. If you’re a woman of a *ahem* certain age that tends to sweat at night, you may want to stick with just using a tiiiny amount. This stuff will literally replace so many skin care products. My skin is the best it’s ever been in my life and it’s supple and moisturized. It’s the miracle cream we’ve all wished for. ” — Huskermama “ Since I’ve been using A313 for about 6 months my skin’s general health and condition have significantly improved. It immediately and successfully lightened the sun-induced hyperpigmentation I had. My dark sun spots have faded to almost nothing, so I don’t need to apply makeup to hide them. In addition, my skin appears less wrinkled and has become somewhat firmer and smoother.” — Diana Duque “I’ve been using this for two weeks. I was looking for something to improve my skin’s texture and hydration. It did both- put it on at night and I’m noticing my skin is super hydrated in the morning and overall my deeper wrinkles and fine lines look diminished! I also have zero breakouts now and it healed the couple of blemishes I had when I started it. It does tingle if I get it too close to my upper eyelids but I put it high over my crow feet and lower lid area and it’s been fine. I use it nightly now after the initial tingling time frame when I had to do every other day. I’m a believer! It’s a generous tube size and I only need a pea size.” — Lively By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "HELENA, Mont. (AP) — The reported birth of a rare white buffalo in Yellowstone National Park fulfills a Lakota prophecy that portends better times, according to members of the American Indian tribe who cautioned that it’s also a signal that more must be done to protect the earth and its animals. “The birth of this calf is both a blessing and warning. We must do more,” said Chief Arvol Looking Horse, the spiritual leader of the Lakota, Dakota and the Nakota Oyate in South Dakota, and the 19th keeper of the sacred White Buffalo Calf Woman Pipe and Bundle. The birth of the sacred calf comes as after a severe winter in 2023 drove thousands of Yellowstone buffalo, also known as bison, to lower elevations. More than 1,500 were killed, sent to slaughter or transferred to tribes seeking to reclaim stewardship over an animal their ancestors lived alongside for millennia. Erin Braaten of Kalispell took several photos of the calf shortly after it was born on June 4 in the Lamar Valley in the northeastern corner of the park. Her family was visiting the park when she spotted “something really white” among a herd of bison across the Lamar River. Traffic ended up stopping while bison crossed the road, so Braaten stuck her camera out the window to take a closer look with her telephoto lens. “I look and it’s this white bison calf. And I was just totally, totally floored,” she said. After the bison cleared the roadway, the Braatens turned their vehicle around and found a spot to park. They watched the calf and its mother for 30 to 45 minutes. “And then she kind of led it through the willows there,” Braaten said. Although Braaten came back each of the next two days, she didn’t see the white calf again. For the Lakota, the birth of a white buffalo calf with a black nose, eyes and hooves is akin to the second coming of Jesus Christ, Looking Horse said. Lakota legend says about 2,000 years ago — when nothing was good, food was running out and bison were disappearing — White Buffalo Calf Woman appeared, presented a bowl pipe and a bundle to a tribal member, taught them how to pray and said that the pipe could be used to bring buffalo to the area for food. As she left, she turned into a white buffalo calf. “And some day when the times are hard again,” Looking Horse said in relating the legend, “I shall return and stand upon the earth as a white buffalo calf, black nose, black eyes, black hooves.” A similar white buffalo calf was born in Wisconsin in 1994 and was named Miracle, he said. Troy Heinert, the executive director of the South Dakota-based InterTribal Buffalo Council, said the calf in Braaten’s photos looks like a true white buffalo because it has a black nose, black hooves and dark eyes. “From the pictures I’ve seen, that calf seems to have those traits,” said Heinert, who is Lakota. An albino buffalo would have pink eyes. A naming ceremony has been held for the Yellowstone calf, Looking Horse said, though he declined to reveal the name. A ceremony celebrating the calf’s birth is set for June 26 at the Buffalo Field Campaign headquarters in West Yellowstone. Other tribes also revere white buffalo. “Many tribes have their own story of why the white buffalo is so important,” Heinert said. “All stories go back to them being very sacred.” Heinert and several members of the Buffalo Field Campaign say they’ve never heard of a white buffalo being born in Yellowstone, which has wild herds. Park officials had not seen the buffalo yet and could not confirm its birth in the park, and they have no record of a white buffalo being born in the park previously. Jim Matheson, executive director of the National Bison Association, could not quantify how rare the calf is. “To my knowledge, no one’s ever tracked the occurrence of white buffalo being born throughout history. So I’m not sure how we can make a determination how often it occurs.” Besides herds of the animals on public lands or overseen by conservation groups, about 80 tribes across the U.S. have more than 20,000 bison, a figure that’s been growing in recent years. In Yellowstone and the surrounding area, the killing or removal of large numbers of bison happens almost every winter, under an agreement between federal and Montana agencies that has limited the size of the park’s herds to about 5,000 animals. Yellowstone officials last week proposed a slightly larger population of up to 6,000 bison, with a final decision expected next month. But ranchers in Montana have long opposed increasing the Yellowstone herds or transferring the animals to tribes. Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte has said he would not support any management plan with a population target greater than 3,000 Yellowstone bison. Heinert sees the calf’s birth as a reminder “that we need to live in a good way and treat others with respect.” “I hope that calf is safe and gonna live its best life in Yellowstone National Park, exactly where it was designed to be,” Heinert said. ___ Associated Press reporter Matthew Brown contributed to this story from Billings, Mont.

The Grammy winner was performing her song “So High School” when she made a gesture pretending to pull and release a bow and arrow into the air — a move her Kansas City Chiefs star boyfriend is known to do during NFL games. Concertgoers at the Wembley Stadium shared videos of Swift’s pose on social media , celebrating the loving nod to her beau. Other clips captured Kelce, who attended the concert with his brother Jason Kelce and sister-in-law Kylie Kelce, happily singing along to the track from the audience. The Chiefs star was also photographed at the Wembley Stadium on Saturday for Swift’s second London show. He was once again joined by Jason Kelce and Kylie Kelce, who also returned for the second night in a row. Swift is slated to perform her third show in London on Sunday. Kelce also publicly shares his admiration for his superstar girlfriend. During an April episode of his “New Heights” podcast, he said he still didn’t know “how the fuck” he wooed Swift. Swift’s bow and arrow move wasn’t the only notable pose from her show Friday night. The “Fortnight” singer shared on social media a backstage selfie she took with Travis Kelce, Prince William and two of his children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. “Happy Bday M8! London shows are off to a splendid start,” she wrote in the caption of the Instagram post celebrating the Prince of Wales’ birthday.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Montana GOP Senate candidate Tim Sheehy failed to disclose his role at the Property and Environment Research Center, a property rights and environmental research nonprofit that has a history of advocating for privatizing America’s federal lands and rolling back environmental laws including the Endangered Species Act . Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL and wealthy businessman who is running against three-term incumbent Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), joined PERC’s board in 2022, according to the organization’s filings with the IRS. But he failed to include his position at the think tank in his campaign financial disclosure, in violation of Senate rules, HuffPost has learned. Public lands have emerged as a key issue in the race, with Tester painting Sheehy as a threat to their future and the Montana way of life. Sheehy’s failure to disclose his work at PERC could further complicate his already messy messaging on public lands policy. Sheehy did report being a board director at other nonprofits; however, PERC does not appear on his disclosure form. Sheehy’s campaign told HuffPost that Sheehy stepped down from the board prior to entering the Senate race last June. Asked why he didn’t disclose his role at PERC, campaign spokesperson Katie Martin said, “ This omission was an oversight. We are working on amending the report.” Senate rules require candidates to report both paid and unpaid positions held in the two years prior to their candidacy at any business enterprise, nonprofit organization, labor organization or educational institution. PERC confirmed that Sheehy left its board before announcing his campaign last year. But as of Wednesday, PERC’s website still listed Sheehy as a board member. “Tim was elected to the board in Fall 2022 due to his relevant background as a successful local entrepreneur in the area of forest health, wildfires, and ranching, all conservation issues we are engaged in,” Kat Dwyer, the organization’s marketing and media manager, said in an email. Founded in 1980 and based in Bozeman, Montana, PERC describes itself as an “independent,” “nonpartisan” think tank that advocates for “free market environmentalism” — the idea that private property rights and market incentives lead to better environmental and conservation outcomes than government regulation. Sheehy founded Bridger Aerospace, a Bozeman, Montana-based aerial firefighting company that relies almost exclusively on federal contracts. As HuffPost previously reported , Bridger has continued to pitch itself as a leader in the fight against climate change, even as Sheehy has toed the GOP line on the campaign trail and railed against what he calls the “climate cult” and “radical environmentalists.” The millionaire businessman also owns a sprawling 7,000-acre ranch in Martinsdale, Montana, where he co-founded a cattle company and once offered exclusive, pay-to-play hunting excursions. PERC is widely viewed as a right-wing outfit. It has deep historical ties to the fossil fuel industry and Donors Trust, a conservative group Mother Jones once dubbed the “ dark-money ATM of the right ” that has funneled millions of dollars to climate change-denier groups. Kimberley Dennis, the co-founder and board chair of Donors Trust, is a current member of PERC’s board of directors. PERC says it is “inaccurate” to characterize the group as right-wing. “PERC is a non-partisan conservation organization dedicated to conserving land, water, and wildlife through innovative market and incentive-based solutions,” Dwyer said. “PERC proudly works with policymakers across the political spectrum, including with the Biden administration on issues like forest restoration , wild horse adoption incentives , migration corridor conservation , and virtual fencing technology .” Oil giant ExxonMobil and Koch family foundations have historically given PERC money , but PERC told HuffPost that it has not received funding from fossil fuel companies in the past 10 years. Yet it remains a “ partner ” of the State Policy Network, a web of right-wing, industry-allied think tanks that for decades have waged war against environmental regulations, renewable energy and climate science. PERC supported the Trump administration’s industry-friendly rollback of Endangered Species Act protections and urged the Biden administration not to reverse the Trump-era changes. “PERC has a well-established, 44-year history of advocating to gut and undermine our nation’s bedrock environmental laws in favor of private property rights,” said Matthew Koehler, media director at Wilderness Watch, an environmental organization based in Missoula, Montana. “Over the past five years or so, I’ve noticed them kind of going on a full court press to rebrand themselves and to soften some of their rhetoric, and through creative marketing make unsuspecting people think that their solutions — quote, unquote — are more palatable. But at the end of the day, this is an organization that is far-right.” PERC simply can’t run away from its history, Koehler added. Over its four decades, the group has advocated for privatizing federal lands , including national parks , increasing fees for visiting parks and other federal lands, and covering park maintenance backlogs by diverting funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a decades-old program that uses offshore fossil fuel revenues to establish and protect parks, wildlife refuges, forests and wildlife habitat. In a 1999 policy paper titled “How and Why to Privatize Federal Lands,” PERC’s then-director, Terry Anderson, and others laid out what they called “a blueprint for auctioning off all public lands over 20 to 40 years.” “Local control has to be returned, whether that means, you know, some of these public lands get turned over to state agencies, or even counties, or whether those decisions are made by a local landlord instead of by, you know, federal fiat a few thousand miles away.” PERC says its support for public land privatization is in the past. Anderson’s 1999 paper “ is not representative of PERC’s current thinking ,” Dwyer said. “ PERC firmly believes that public lands should stay in public hands. We do not advocate for nor support privatization or divestiture,” she said. “We support improved management of our public lands and using market-based incentives to achieve better management such as conservation leasing to allow conservation to be a use on public lands, addressing deferred maintenance , streamlining permitting for more forest restoration , and a more creative application of user fees in our national parks to support our superintendents and their parks’ unique needs.” Much like PERC, Sheehy, a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, is trying to distance himself from a once full-throated embrace of pawning off federal lands. As HuffPost first reported , he advocated last year for federal lands to be “turned over” to states — a wildly unpopular position among voters in Western states, including Montana. “Local control has to be returned,” Sheehy told the “Working Ranch Radio Show” in October, “whether that means, you know, some of these public lands get turned over to state agencies, or even counties, or whether those decisions are made by a local landlord instead of by, you know, federal fiat a few thousand miles away.” Despite those comments, which came several months into his campaign, Sheehy says he opposes the sale and transfer of federal lands and has accused Tester and his allies of lying about his position. “Tim believes public lands must stay in public hands,” Sheehy’s spokesperson said in a statement. “Tim believes Montanans know best how to manage our land, not the Washington bureaucrats.” Sheehy and PERC apparently now agree on the issue of keeping public lands public, but they’ve been at odds when it comes to other policies. PERC has long supported the idea of leasing federal lands for conservation and applauded the Biden administration’s recent rule to begin issuing such leases to put conservation and ecosystem restoration on equal footing with drilling, mining and other traditional land uses. But like most Republicans in Congress, Sheehy has condemned the Biden administration’s changes to public land leasing. “Instead of supporting the producers that they’re supposed to be enabling, they are putting constrictions in place that could potentially put them out of business,” he told “Working Ranch Radio” last year , referring to federal land managers. “So taking some of these leases out of agricultural production and moving them into conservation is deeply concerning.” Nico Delgado, a spokesperson for Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, told HuffPost that Sheehy’s failure to disclose his role at PERC is part of a trend of “bending the truth with Montanans.” Among other things, Delgado noted, Sheehy admitted to lying to a national park ranger about how he received a gunshot wound, as the Washington Post first reported . “Now he’s hiding being part of a group that wanted to jack up fees at national parks,” Delgado said.

    "article_content": "Labor Reporter, HuffPost The Supreme Court sided with Starbucks on Thursday in a decision that could make it harder for labor prosecutors to win court injunctions against employers they believe to have broken the law. The case, McKinney v. Starbucks, revolved around the firings of seven baristas amid a union organizing campaign at a store in Memphis, Tennessee. The National Labor Relations Board secured an injunction in federal court requiring Starbucks to temporarily hire the baristas back while the underlying union-busting allegations were being litigated. Starbucks had maintained that the firings were justified, and argued before the Supreme Court that the criteria the federal court used to evaluate the injunction request were too lax. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the 8-1 decision for the court. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote a partial dissent. The case is unlikely to have a dramatic impact on labor law because of its relatively limited scope. But the decision fits into a broader pattern, as the court’s right wing has sided with corporations and sought to limit the power of federal agencies to intervene on behalf of consumers, workers or the environment. Lynne Fox, the president of Workers United, the union organizing Starbucks, said in a statement on the decision that workers have “so few tools” to defend themselves when employers break the law. “That makes today’s ruling by the Supreme Court particularly egregious,” Fox said. “It underscores how the economy is rigged against working people all the way up to the Supreme Court.” The NLRB is an independent federal agency responsible for enforcing collective bargaining rights in the private sector. Its prosecutors bring cases against employers and unions when workers’ rights have been violated, with a five-member board in Washington that hears cases on appeal. “We’re not going to stop our investigations or our litigation or [union] elections because of these challenges.” But when prosecutors believe the normal process can’t adequately protect workers, they sometimes ask federal judges to issue temporary injunctions to stop allegedly illegal labor practices. NLRB lawyers pursued such an order against Starbucks in the Memphis case, arguing that the ouster of several union supporters was illegal and could do irreparable damage to an active organizing campaign if it wasn’t quickly rectified. Courts have been split on which factors should be used to determine whether an injunction is warranted. The federal judge in the Starbucks case applied a lower level of scrutiny than what the Supreme Court endorsed, meaning the labor board will need to satisfy a higher standard in order to get future injunctions against businesses. The Starbucks case is part of the Supreme Court’s larger shift against deference to federal agencies. In a separate case this term, the court is re-examining what’s known as the landmark Chevron doctrine, which gives federal agencies latitude to interpret laws and issue regulations where Congress may have been ambiguous. In oral arguments the conservative bloc seemed poised to overturn the Chevron precedent. Such a decision would make it harder for agencies to enact regulations and give courts greater power to strike them down — a blow to any progressive administration hoping to tackle pressing issues like climate change through regulatory power. Patrick Muldowney, a management-side labor attorney at the firm BakerHostetler, said he viewed the Starbucks case as a companion to the bigger Chevron case, since the former hinged on how much courts should defer to the expertise of NLRB officials seeking injunctions. “I think this is sort of part of a larger movement by the court,” Muldowney said in an interview before the Supreme Court issued the Starbucks decision. “They are looking at agency deference with a jaundiced eye at this point.” The NLRB has turned out to be one of the most progressive agencies in the federal government under President Joe Biden. The general counsel, Biden appointee Jennifer Abruzzo, has applied a broad reading of workers’ rights and aggressively brought cases against employers for trying to snuff out organizing campaigns, angering business groups as well as congressional Republicans. Abruzzo has said in memos outlining her agenda that she wants to ramp up the use of injunctions because she wants to stop illegal behavior before it gets worse . She instructed offices to investigate alleged threats as soon as possible to figure out whether an injunction might be called for. “I think this is sort of part of a larger movement by the court... They are looking at agency deference with a jaundiced eye.” In an interview with HuffPost following oral arguments in the Starbucks case, Abruzzo called the injunctions “one of the most important tools available to us.” She noted that workers who’ve been fired for organizing don’t have a private right of action to sue the employer for damages — their only tool for rectifying injustice is the labor board. “We are it for workers, and we’ve got to aggressively pursue section 10(j) relief in appropriate cases,” Abruzzo told HuffPost, referring to the law that allows the NLRB to seek injunctions. “It’s a very painstaking review… . We don’t do it lightly, but we do need to do it in certain cases.” The board’s pursuit of injunctions is indeed rare, according to agency data . The NLRB has only litigated a total of 135 injunction cases since 2012, or less than a dozen a year on average. The board has succeeded in winning an injunction 74% of the time, and happens to have done better under the more stringent test in court than the more lax one. But Muldowney said it was hard to see Abruzzo expanding the use of injunctions if the bar is set higher. “I think the idea is if the court comes down in favor of Starbucks you won’t see an acceleration in terms of [injunctions],” he said. Starbucks isn’t the only company to challenge the way the board operates. SpaceX, the aerospace company owned by Elon Musk, has filed a lawsuit in federal court arguing that the NLRB’s structure itself is unconstitutional, and therefore the agency’s union-busting charges against SpaceX are illegitimate. If the company were to succeed, the case could upend labor relations. Abruzzo vowed that none of these cases would deter the board from enforcing the law. “We’re not going to stop our investigations or our litigation or [union] elections because of these challenges,” Abruzzo said. “It’s just not going to happen.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost A donkey who went missing five years ago in California has been caught on camera roaming with a herd of wild elk. “I bumped into a herd of elk that have adopted a donkey,” triathlete and hunter Max Fennell wrote on Instagram alongside a video of the blended herd . “I can’t get over seeing it and I’m amazed that the donkey looks happy and healthy!” The footage, recorded on a hunting trip and posted in March, shows a donkey standing among about a dozen elk. Members of the herd look at the camera simultaneously before trotting away. The storybook scene took place a few miles from the spot in Northern California’s Cache Creek Wilderness where a male donkey named Diesel disappeared in 2019, CBS Sacramento reported . One of Diesel’s owners, Terrie Drewry, told the news outlet in an interview published Thursday that the donkey in the video is definitely him. Diesel had been hiking with Terrie Drewry’s husband, Dave Drewry, when something spooked him and he got away. For weeks, the couple searched on foot and even with drone assistance to find the donkey, but were never able to locate him. It was “amazing” to see Diesel apparently thriving in the recent video, Terrie Drewry told CBS Sacramento. “He’s living his best life,” she said. “He’s happy. He’s healthy, and it was just a relief.” An earlier video , shared on Instagram by user Mikki Rhodes , also appeared to show Diesel wandering with elk. Rhodes said in a caption that his owners were “very happy” to see the donkey doing well. Diesel knows how to live without the aid of humans. He was originally a wild donkey , adopted through a Bureau of Land Management program . The program allows members of the public to adopt animals captured in the federal agency’s controversial roundups of wild horses and donkeys, aimed at reducing the free-roaming population of the animals on public lands.

    "article_content": "Assignment Editor, HuffPost A visitor to Yellowstone National Park has been sentenced to seven days in jail for trespassing near an active geothermal geyser. Washington man Viktor Pyshniuk, 21, walked off the boardwalk near Steamboat Geyser, the National Park Service and Justice Department said in a news release. He was photographed in the off-limits area by a park employee, who reported the incident to Yellowstone National Park law enforcement. According to the release, he “had clearly crossed over the fence and was walking up the hillside within 15-20 feet of Steamboat Geyser’s steam vent.” Pyshniuk told park law enforcement that he left the boardwalk to take photos, the release said. Steamboat Geyser is the world’s tallest active geyser. “It has erratic and unpredictable eruptions that can rise anywhere from six to 300 feet high,” the park website states . “In the last four years, the intervals between eruptions ranged anywhere from three to 89 days.” Park authorities noted that signs throughout the area state that it is illegal to leave the boardwalk. “Trespassing in closed, thermal areas of Yellowstone National Park is dangerous and harms the natural resource,”said Eric Heimann, acting U.S. attorney in the District of Wyoming. “In cases like this one where we have strong evidence showing a person has willfully disregarded signs and entered a closed, thermal area, federal prosecutors will seek significant penalties, including jail time.” During sentencing earlier this month, Stephanie A. Hambrick, magistrate judge for the U.S. District Court of Wyoming, reportedly told Pyshniuk the sentence was designed to deter him and other members of the public from leaving the boardwalk in the future. In addition to jail time, Pyshniuk was placed on two years of unsupervised release, received a two-year ban from the national park and was fined $1,550.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost The Senate voted nearly unanimously Tuesday evening to pass major legislation designed to reverse the American nuclear industry’s decades-long decline and launch a reactor-building spree to meet surging demand for green electricity at home and to catch up with booming rivals overseas. The bill slashes the fees the Nuclear Regulatory Commission charges developers, speeds up the process for licensing new reactors and hiring key staff, and directs the agency to work with foreign regulators to open doors for U.S. exports. The NRC is also tasked with rewriting its mission statement to avoid unnecessarily limiting the “benefits of nuclear energy technology to society,” essentially reinterpreting its raison d’être to include protecting the public against the dangers of not using atomic power in addition to whatever safety threat reactors themselves pose. “It’s monumental,” said John Starkey, the director of public policy at the American Nuclear Society, a nonprofit of academics and industry professionals that advocates for atomic technology in the public interest. The NRC, he said, “is a 21st century regulator now.” “This has been a long time coming,” Starkey said. In a rare show of bipartisan unity on clean energy, the House of Representatives voted 365 to 36 last month to pass its version of the legislation, called the ADVANCE Act. All but two sen ators — Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) — supported the bill in Tuesday’s vote or abstained, with a final tally of 88-2. Th e proposal will now go to the White House, where President Joe Biden is all but certain to sign it into law. It is widely considered the most significant clean-energy legislation to pass since the president’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. “ Republicans and Democrats recognize the development of new nuclear technologies is critical to America’s energy security and our environment,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), the bill’s lead sponsor, said on the Senate floor Tuesday evening. “Today, nuclear power provides about 20% of our nation’s electricity. Importantly, it’s emissions-free electricity that is 24/7, 365 days a year.” In a joint statement with the ranking Republican colleagues on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Reps. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) called the legislation a “much needed modernization of our nuclear regulatory framework.” The U.S. led the world in developing nuclear energy in the 1950s and went on to build by far the largest fleet of power plants, with more than 110 reactors providing more than one-fifth of America’s electricity. But as growth in electricity demand slowed in the 1970s and public concern over radiation issues grew, utilities struggled to afford the high cost of building new reactors. As climate change put a new premium on nuclear energy’s massive output of low-carbon electricity, the U.S. looked to restart its reactor program in the early 2000s. But right as the cost of first-of-a-kind projects ballooned into the billions of dollars, the U.S. saw a drilling boom that increased the domestic supply of cheap natural gas. Coupled with inexpensive wind turbines and solar panels from overseas, U.S. nuclear companies lost deals to supply power. As a result, more than a dozen reactors have shut down over the past decade and just two new reactors were built. That pair of reactors, which just came online last month at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia, cost more than $30 billion. As the expenses mounted, other projects to build the same kind of reactor elsewhere in the country were canceled. The timing could hardly have been worse. After completing the first reactor, the second one cost far less and came online faster. But the disastrous launch dissuaded any other utilities from investing in a third reactor, which economists say would take even less time and money now that the supply chains, design and workforce are established. Now that the two new reactors have turned the so-called Plant Vogtle into America’s most powerful generating station, with enough 24/7 clean electricity to serve more than 1 million households, there are no more reactors of that kind in the pipeline. “As successful as Vogtle 3 and 4 are ― and they’re incredibly successful ― we should ask ourselves the question, why didn’t we lay the groundwork to proceed from those two units to 20 more?” Jeff Lyash, the chief executive of the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority utility, said June 17 during a panel at an industry conference in Las Vegas. “Why are we sitting in this gap trying to figure this out? That’s the question we have to answer.” Though it may not contain all the answers, the ADVANCE (Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy) Act would make it easier to build multiple reactors at the same site by easing NRC regulations on the second, third and fourth units. “This bipartisan policy creates the framework for companies to start building that order book for a second project and a third project and ultimately get the NRC ready to license dozens per year,” said Nicholas McMurray, the managing director of international and nuclear policy at energy policy group ClearPath. The nuclear industry has a long way to go to line up the financing and construction crews needed to build new reactors at the speed and efficiency seen in China, Russia or the United Arab Emirates. But lining up multiple orders at a time, and making it easier to permit more than one reactor at the same site, could be a help to whatever company ends up building the next large-scale reactor like the ones completed in Georgia. Yet the nuclear energy bill is specifically tailored to boost types of reactors that are not currently in commercial production in the U.S. Virtually all commercial reactors around the world generate electricity by using heat released from splitting unstable uranium atoms to turn water into steam to spin turbines in a generator. Newer designs aim to use liquid metal or a high-temperature gas as a coolant instead, allowing reactors to run on different types of fuel that produce less radioactive waste and operate in more settings than a traditional nuclear plant. In recognition of these so-called fourth-generation reactor models’ unique uses, the bill would authorize the Department of Energy to give out financial awards to the first companies to meet specific goals, such as using fuel made from recycled nuclear waste or generating heat that could be used for things other than electricity production. The bill would also give the NRC power to hire key staffers more quickly and at higher rates than the federal government usually does, allowing the agency to compete more directly with private companies for employees. The legislation marks the biggest change Congress has made to U.S. nuclear regulations since then-President Richard Nixon signed the 1974 law establishing the NRC and disbanding the Atomic Energy Commission, which was seen as too promotional of the industry it oversaw. A law enacted in 1982 set the groundwork for how the U.S. deals with nuclear waste. A 2005 statute added new security measures and pumped money into researching reactors. In 2019, Congress passed a bill directing the NRC to update its approach to newer types of technologies. Then, in 2022, Biden signed his historic infrastructure-spending laws that directed billions of dollars to test, restart and run nuclear reactors, including reopening plants that had been shut down for financial reasons. But the provisions in the ADVANCE Act are designed to encourage utilities to order and build new reactors in bulk, a step analysts say will help lower the cost and make U.S. nuclear energy technology competitive with Russia and China again. “This is a huge win for our climate, economic and energy security goals,” said Farah Benahmed, a policy manager at energy group Breakthrough Energy, which is backed by billionaire Bill Gates. Yet it’s only a first step. The full legislation depends on Congress increasing funding to the NRC to make up for the lost revenue from licensing fees, help the agency staff up for an expected influx of applications and fund more diplomatic missions overseas. The bill’s supporters have pitched the legislation as essential to making the U.S. competitive with Russia and China in the race to build the first reactors in newcomer countries such as Ghana, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia. Though the fees that U.S. companies pursuing deals abroad pay to the NRC have historically funded officials’ trips overseas, the legislation gives the agency a clear mandate to look abroad for ways to help allied countries adopt the American regulatory playbook. Critics of the bill say it risks exporting poorer safety practices. “Make no mistake: This is not about making the reactor licensing process more efficient, but about weakening safety and security oversight across the board, a longstanding industry goal,” Edwin Lyman, the director of nuclear power safety at the watchdog Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement . “Passage of this legislation will only increase the danger to people already living downwind of nuclear facilities from a severe accident or terrorist attack, and it will make it even more difficult for communities to prevent risky, experimental reactors from being sited in their midst.” Speaking in support of the legislation Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the bill would “support job growth, clean energy and leadership while preserving the NRC’s fundamental” safety mission. At the same American Nuclear Society conference in Las Vegas, Southern Co. CEO Chris Womack, whose utility giant built the two new reactors in Georgia, warned that any future projects still depend on the federal government providing more money and financial backing. “What I hear you saying, Chris, is there needs to be more than what we’re putting on the table, and that’s hard to hear because we’ve just put billions and billions and billions on the table,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a fellow panelist, said in response. “I don’t know what the delta is between what you think is necessary and what it would actually take to build up.” Asked at the end of the panel when the U.S. would see its next large-scale reactors planned, Granholm, Womack and the TVA’s Lyash all said announcements would come in the next few years. Meanwhile, one of those new advanced reactors is finally breaking ground. Last week, Gates flew to Wyoming for the groundbreaking of his TerraPower startup’s first liquid salt-cooled reactor at a coal plant. It’s the kind of thing that could be helped by the ADVANCE Act’s funding for research on how to turn coal stations into nuclear plants and by support for “fourth-generation” reactors in bulk. TerraPower had initially planned to build its first reactor in China, which is currently building more reactors faster than anyone else and is on pace to surpass the U.S. within a decade. Gates’ company canceled its plan as the U.S. slapped trade restrictions on Beijing in 2019. Beating out TerraPower, China launched the world’s first commercial fourth-generation reactor in December ― and now, according to a recent study , “likely stands 10 to 15 years ahead of the United States in its ability to deploy” the technology.

    "article_content": "Reporter, HuffPost A pair of climate protesters were arrested Wednesday at the U.K.’s Stonehenge monument after they sprayed the 5,000-year-old rocks with orange paint, British police said . The protesters, 21-year-old Niamh Lynch and 73-year-old Rajan Naidu, are part of Just Stop Oil, a group that says it wants the British government to “establish a legally binding treaty to stop extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030” alongside other nations. With a national election set for July 4 , Just Stop Oil is demanding that the incoming British government take action to “phase out” fossil fuels within a six-year period. The paint is allegedly cornstarch-based, and is supposed to wash away in the rain, although the area is not expected to see rain before the weekend. The monument receives a swell of visitors each summer solstice. This year’s solstice is Thursday. Lynch and Naidu were stopped by concerned bystanders, who took their canisters of paint, leaving them to sit cross-legged in front of the monument. “Our enquiries are ongoing, and we are working closely with English Heritage,” Wiltshire police said in a statement, referring to the charity that manages historic sites around the U.K. Just Stop Oil issued a statement Wednesday acknowledging that the Labour Party has committed to stopping future oil and gas drilling licenses if they win. “However, we all know this is not enough,” a spokesperson said. “Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. We have to come together to defend humanity or we risk everything.” Lynch, a student from Oxford, said in a statement: “Stonehenge at solstice is all about celebrating the natural world — but look at the state it’s in! We all have a right to live a life free from suffering, but continued burning of oil, coal and gas is leading to death and suffering on an unparalleled scale.” Naidu, who is from Birmingham, added: “Either we end the fossil fuel era, or the fossil fuel era will end us.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Cleaning your floors and bathtub can be an ordeal, especially if you experience pain, mobility challenges or are just really low on energy some days. Instead of straining your back, arms or neck to get hard-to-reach grime, consider upgrading your cleaning process with the top-selling Labigo LA1 Pro electric sping scrubber . Thankfully, it’s marked down again to $34.99 with a $15 off coupon . For even further savings, you can also save an extra 5% if you grab more than one — which is ideal for anyone who wants multiples devices for a house, a business or simply just treating a loved one. The chargeable cordless device comes with a retractable pole that lets you reach the ground without hunching over and spin away dirt with a swiveling scrub head by way of an easy trigger pull. Tidy customers flooded the reviews section, noting that the scrubber is a significant quality-of-life upgrade and a handy back-saving tool. One reviewer sums it up nicely: It’s “the ultimate cleaning hack.” The LA1 Pro spin scrubber comes with four rotating brush heads for reaching corners and cleaning wider surfaces, and has a retractable rod to reach the ground without bending your body. It also comes in three color options! Many reviewers say scrubbing is effortless and doesn’t require much arm, back, or leg strain to clean. “I have a terrible back and it gets very sore, very easily,” one reviewer, Becca, shared. “This thing? I cleaned my tub in like [three] minutes without having to bend over once. It was so easy, and the scrubber really gets in there so I didn’t even have to spend time going back over areas.” A clean tub in three minutes’ time sounds like a dream scenario, and at $34.99, it could be a reality. This cordless gadget claims to charge for .5 hours and operate for 90 minutes before needing some extra juice, which is ample time to clean your bathroom or living room floors. It’s also useful for cleaning grout, stone, tile and hard surfaces that collect buildup over time or even vents and car rims. Reviewer Jade N Nguyen found it useful for baseboards and ceilings: “The handle is so long and solid that I can clean baseboard crevices without bending (I’m short) and reach the ceiling corners without a chair! I’ve cleaned by tubs, showers, windows, baseboards, doors, trash cans, and way more!” If you’re tired of straining your back when cleaning the floors and tub, grab this electric scrubber now before its price shoots back up.

Lastly, remember your updated price will show at checkout and not in your cart. Happy cleaning! “This has been heaven sent! I have a bad back and trying to clean the tub had become a nuisance making it painful and inconvenient. My husband purchased this due to my complaining LOL. Ever since we got this cleaning it has been super easy, convenient and just a life save, especially having kids when you need to finish tasks more efficiently” — Maribel F. “I recently purchased Labigo electric scrubber LA1 Pro and used on my tile grout in my kitchen. I also purchased the spray multi purpose “ The Pink Stuff ” off of Amazon that was recommended highly by customers. I sprayed it on the grout lines and let it set for about 15 minutes, the proceeded to use the scrubber. All I can say for me it was amazing. The handle extends long enough so can stand and not have to get on your hands knees. I haven’t used on other things yet, but I’m sure I will be satisfied. I hope if any of you purchase it you will have the same results.” — An Amazon customer “I often use my 3rd bedroom and bathroom as an Airbnb. I have a cleaning lady who comes between guests but if I’m home I often help. I particularly focus on the bathroom and mostly the shower I think all my guests are entitled to a germ-free shower. But I have a bad back so scrubbing the walls and the rest of the shower is difficult.This has made the job a lot easier. The doesn’t require a lot of pressure, it cleans thoroughly, you can see exactly where you’ve cleaned and it’s lightweight. My time cleaning the shower is reduced to a few minutes versus doing the job by hand. And I don’t have any back pain when I finish.” — Traveling Broad “I’m all about making my life easier (who isn’t) and this tool helps do just that. It used to take me 20 minutes to scrub my shower floor. Now I scrub it in 5 and thats including the walls. Its easy to hold and spins fast. I like it comes with different attachments to get in the corners. My back says thank you!” — Cynthia Villalta “Can a scrub brush change your life? I am not sure. However, this one can definitely improve your cleaning routines. It was almost embarrassing to see how much more invisible soap scum this brush scrubbed away. Then again, I often put off scrubbing the tub and shower because of my chronic fatigue and back troubles. After using this scrubber, I was not exhausted, nor was my back screaming. The different brushes get into all the almost impossible nooks, crannies, and curves. I even used it on the bathroom sink.— Kevin “This scrubber has plenty of power. The grout on my kitchen floor was looking bad and this made fast work of a labor intensive job. It easily tackled the mess on bathroom countertops and sinks. I even used it to clean the dirt off my a/c vents so I did not need to use a ladder.” — beachbaby By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Shopping Writer, HuffPost Many of us spend years trying to crack the code of our skin, so to speak: trying to deduce exactly which products it likes and responds to. Yet oftentimes, normal life transitions affect our skin and alter its needs. In particular, menopause and post-menopause engender a number of hormonal shifts and physical changes, including to one’s skin. If you’ve gone through menopause, you may have noticed a loss of brightness, moisture and firmness in your skin — all changes that are totally normal, according to San Diego-based dermatologist Dr. Azadeh Shirazi , who HuffPost previously spoke with. You may also notice your skin looking duller, with any sun damage you previously incurred appearing more visible, New York-based dermatologist Dr. Marisa Garshick also previously told HuffPost . This is due to decreased cellular turnover, Garshick said. These changes make choosing the right skin care during and post-menopause a different bird than in your pre-menopause days. Specifically, your skin may benefit from incorporating hydrating humectants like glycerin and collagen-boosters like retinol into your routine, according to Shirazi and Garshick. We combed the internet for the best skin care products for menopausal and post-menopausal skin, according to reviewers. Here are some of the best reviewer-vouched items to add to your routine.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. There is an iconic reviewer photo that any shopping writer who covers pets is probably familiar with. It shows a reviewer’s cat leaping , paws-out, into the air with the gusto you’d think only happens in cartoons. Not so. The culprit? The Cat Dancer , a cult-favorite cat toy that reviewers call the “ greatest cat toy ever ” and “ worth its weight in gold .” On first glance, the toy may not look like much: a springy piece of steel wire with cardboard rolls at the end. But its simplicity is part of its genius, according to an expert, and its design is more thoughtful and cat-informed than you might think. “The Cat Dancer toy brilliantly taps into a cat’s hunting instincts,” Stephanie Merlin , a certified feline behavior specialist and cat wellbeing educator , told HuffPost. “Domestic cats still possess the natural drive to chase and capture prey … [and] the quick, erratic movements of the cardboard [mimic] the behavior of small prey.” Plus, as opposed to the colorful fabric wands often associated with cats, “The wire is nearly invisible to cats , especially since their eyesight is better at a distance,” Merlin explained. As a result, your cat can focus on the cardboard’s prey-like movement, getting into the proverbial zone for hunting and playing. The Cat Dancer’s ingenuity also lies in its stimulation of your cat’s taste and auditory senses. Many of us associate dogs with a love of chewing and licking, but cats enjoy doing so, too. “The cardboard is satisfying to bite,” Merlin added, “[and the] auditory element when shuffled across the floor or moved through the air increas[es] the excitement.” All in all, a stimulating and interactive toy like the Cat Dancer can help keep your kitty’s mind sharp and help combat boredom and stress, according to Merlin. It’ll also help your cat “channel those wild instincts safely,” Merlin noted, instead of acting out or damaging your belongings. Plus, playing with an interactive toy like the Cat Dancer will help strengthen your bond with your feline, according to Merlin. I concur with 29,000 other 5-star ratings on Amazon : My cat goes absolutely nuts for this toy. She loves stalking it, leaping dramatically in the air (and sometimes catching it!) before settling down and gnawing blissfully on its cardboard ends. I also love how much enjoyable exercise it gives her: She’s noticeably satisfied and tuckered out after a session with this. Plus, she sleeps better at night — meaning I don’t get woken up early in the morning. I’m convinced that the Cat Dancer is a true no-brainer addition to any cat owner’s toy arsenal, a mainstay that’s more than earned its place. It needn’t replace all your other toys — it’s good to have different options for your kitty to play with — but the Dancer is one of a kind for its stimulation of cats’ natural instincts, its hardiness and its versatility. That’s not even to mention its incredible affordability, costing less than $5 for a toy that’s more than worth its salt. If you use it so much that you do have to replace it, no problem — that’s the beauty of it being $4 and so clearly beloved. Reviewers report that they usually replace theirs with a fresh one every four to five months. Grab a Cat Dancer toy for your cat from Amazon now , or read on for what reviewers have to say: “Who knew that a small piece of rolled up brown paper at the end of a length of wire would be so compelling to the feline brain? Our cats lose their minds when this toy comes out and go full predator. It’s got to be the springy movement. I’ve secured one end to the top of a wicker hamper and kept them (and myself) entertained for days.” — Scenic Ways “I’ve never seen my cats go crazier with a toy ! They are also a little bit older and it’s hard to get them jazzed about playing and this toy instantly intrigues them and gets them going. It’s also so cheap and you barely have to move your arm when playing which I love. Going to buy this for every cat I know!” — Cherise Alexander “We’ve bought my cat other expensive highly rated toys. Battery operated birds. Catnip pillows, toy mice, etc. Nothing piques his interest EXCEPT THIS. My 12 year old, neutered, overweight cat actually swats at this thing and pounces on it like the cats in the picture. It’s nice to see him energetic and enthusiastic about something. Worth every penny .” — Rigby “I bought this cat toy based on a recommendation from a friend. Based on the looks of it, I didn’t have high expectations but figured for the price, why not try it. Now I recommend this to every cat owner I know. My cat is older and would hibernate all winter. This toy actually brings her out of hibernation and gets her active again.

If you’ve ever dealt with what’s commonly called “crepey” skin — or skin that resembles crepe paper in its dry, wrinkled, thin appearance — you may have felt the desire to restore some elasticity to your skin. But correcting crepey skin is difficult, and it’s hard to believe a $10 drugstore moisturizer would do the trick — but Amazon reviewers swear Gold Bond’s Age Renew Crepe Corrector body and face lotion , which only costs 9.95 at Amazon, does the trick. Thanks to a unique smoothing concentrate that features protective antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and powerful botanicals, this fragrance-free lightweight lotion works to keep skin smooth and moisturized, while reducing the look of crepey skin. According to the brand, 82% of people who used Gold Bond’s Crepe Corrector saw visible improvement in just two days. Evidence elsewhere on the internet seems to support this: The moisturizer has been awarded over 20,000 five-star reviews on Amazon, 450 at Target and and over 1,800 at Walmart. (It has a shared 4.5-star rating at the latter two retailers as well.) “I’m 47 and just noticed my neck looking a tad wrinkly and crepey,” one reviewer wrote . “Within two days of using this product my neck looked back to normal and felt smooth again. A little goes a long way so the tube will last a while.” “I am very picky when it comes to lotion,” another reviewer wrote . “My hands and skin tend to be on the dry side so it’s been hard to find something that makes my skin feel good. This lotion is amazing for moisturizing and hydrating. I not only use it on my hands and arms, but I also use it on my face and neck... I have combination skin and I have not had any breakouts on my face when using it.” Another buyer who said she “should have taken before and after pictures” wrote, “I don’t know how it works and what kind of sorcery this product processes… but it works and could tell a difference after just 2 days. Will definitely use forever!” Whether you deal with crepey skin or dry skin in general, this moisturizer might just be the answer to your prayers. See what some other Amazon reviewers had to say or just scroll down to get a bottle for yourself. “This works better than the expensive stuff probably because it is better priced and I’m not afraid to use it. Use it after every shower. I can feel it when I shower the next day. I was getting crepey right by my knees. Gone. I am on my 3rd bottle.” — MotherHood “I’ve only been using this product for a few days and I swear I’m already seeing a difference in the appearance of the skin on my upper arms.” — Ninergirl “I have used many, many products over the years for skin firming, crepiness, laxity of skin…Even using my high end retinols and Vit C with minimal results at best. Some for cellulite actually made my skin feel dry and it’s been a never ending cycle of applying lotions and potions. I’m 5’5” 134#, 59 years old. I eat healthy, intermittent fast, exercise several hours a week. I don’t have a weight problem, just dimpled skin with muscles! When I started using this, I could see a difference in my skin almost immediately it gave it a blurring effect. At night, I use the retinol renewal lotion . I use it all over and it just has been amazing. This day and night lotion has given me my confidence for the summer wearing of sleeveless tops and sundresses. Skin looks healthy and moisturized.” — Jane “My sister told me to try this lotion for creepy skin under my arms from losing so much weight. She said it has been working amazing for her. So I thought why not. Well, it does seem to be really moisturizing my skin. I really did need a good moisturizer that doesn’t cost a fortune and works really well. This Bonds Lotion is definitely not greasy and really absorbed good. Seems to be helping the creepy skin so I’m going to keep on using it.

    "article_content": "Shopping Writer, HuffPost Most footwear trends come and go, but one style that’s garnered a community of lifelong enthusiasts? The ever-practical, stylish yet quirky clog. This stalwart group — of which I am a proud member — can rattle off a plethora of reasons for our devotion to the clog. The comfort! The ease! The support and understated functional chic (which many of us lovingly refer to as “ugly chic”)! But of course, the best person to ask about whether clogs are really worth their salt is a professional — namely, a podiatrist. Huffpost spoke to podiatrist Dr. Saylee Tulpule about her professional take on clog fandom. Tulpule is based in Washington, D.C. and Maryland and is active on Instagram as @thesoledoctor . Tulpule explained that folks who spend a lot of time on their feet often enjoy clogs because of their built-in arch support, their frequently added comfy cushioning and the easy-on, easy-off slip-on style. That’s why “clogs are traditionally worn by professionals who stand all day: nurses, teachers, doctors, chefs, etc.,” she wrote. Clogs are also often slip-resistant and waterproof, an added benefit for active professionals, Tulpule added. The beloved shoes can also be beneficial for those with certain medical conditions. In particular, “Clogs can be comfortable for people that suffer from flat feet, heel pain, tendonitis or even lower back issues due to the degree of arch support and cushion,” Tulpule said. That said, you may want to avoid fashion clogs with high heels over three inches, which can lead to tripping and potentially strain your Achilles tendon, Tulpule noted. In addition, clogs with overly firm wooden soles will not provide the same cushiony support and thus can “aggravate flat feet,” she added. As long as you stick to a practical style without high heels and wooden soles, clogs are one of the best comfy, supportive all-day shoes you’ll find. The best ones to stick to, according to Tulpule? Those from Dansko , Birkenstock and Sanita brands. She noted that the Dansko brand also carries the American Podiatrist Medical Association’s Seal of Approval . Based on Tulpule’s recommendations, we rounded up some of the bestselling Dansko, Birkenstock and Sanita clogs for you to check out, below. And, if you do fall in love with the clog as I once did, congratulations — you’re now part of one of the best footwear fandoms around.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. Time and time again, dermatologists have told us how essential retinoids (like retinol ) are to a well-rounded skin care routine, specifically one that’s geared toward premature skin aging prevention. This is because, according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Rebecca Marcus , retinol i ncreases cell turnover, thus helping to stimulate collagen production. When it comes to this powerful “active” ingredient, there’s an ongoing debate about prescription-only compositions. Marcus explained that they’re already in an active form that can be utilized by the skin, making their effect stronger and faster than OTC products. The other side of the argument insists that stronger doesn’t always mean better. Retinol, particularly prescription-strength, has a notorious reputation for causing irritation, especially for more mature skin, which Marcus said is more delicate. OTC retinol, on the other hand, can be less sensitizing and better tolerated, though potentially less effective. But, this $17 retinol cream from France, which features a distinctive texture and three different types of effective retinol, may be able to provide a happy medium between the two. ″[A313] contains minimal ingredients in its vehicle, which is helpful for those who are sensitive to fragrances or other ingredients that are commonly found in OTC retinol products,” Marcus said. And while she acknowledged the fact that the actives in A313 are not the same potency as the retinoid acid present in prescription-strength formulas like Tretinoin , “the three types of retinol in A313 are effective over-the-counter-strength retinol ingredients.” In fact, some users who had been using prescription-strength Tretinoin then made the switch to this alternative, say they prefer A313 and have maintained the same results that they had with the prescription-strength formula. Its distinctive occlusive texture is closer to a balm, which according to reviewers , can be more hydrating compared to other pricier formulations that you might find on the OTC market. The brand claims that the 2% retinol concentration can help unclog pores, minimize fine lines, reduce hyperpigmentation and even out skin texture. Reviewers agree that this lower strength hasn’t impacted A313’s efficacy and suggested adhering to a gradual and minimal application process in order to avoid redness or skin flaking, similar to the “tolerance building” period required for prescription retinoids. This period typically involves just applying a pea-sized amount one or two times a week for a few months before increasing to a more frequent application. (It’s always a good idea to check with your dermatologist to know if retinol is a good option for you.) Put A313 to the test and potentially target multiple skin concerns with this one under $20 product, or take a peek at some promising reviews just in case you need a bit more convincing. Promising Amazon reviews: “I have tried so many different products. I have spent so much money. This is superb !! I will never touch anything else. My skin is beautiful. My pores have shrunk , fine lines and wrinkles are gone and the skin texture is soft like I’ve always wanted it.” — Bella. “I was skeptical on purchasing this as I figured it would dry my face out as the other creams like this do. This actually hydrates my face and I have seen a huge improvement in my skin. I’m turning 40 and since I’ve started using this product I can actually say my face looks younger.” — Miss Pissy “ I’ve been using prescription Tretinoin for 20 years now and I like this A313 more because of the thick moisture barrier it gives. Has all of the benefits of keeping skin clear, high cell turnover to eliminate fine lines and wrinkles BUT….. 1. START SLOW. When they say pea size- they mean PEA SIZE. This stuff spreads and is thick in the best of ways. Once every day or two or your skin will become irritated. This is strong stuff. It will sting if you’re putting it on too often. But then your skin will start to tolerate it more and you can slowly move up to once at night. 2. DO NOT for the love of everything holy and holey put on within 45 minutes to an hour of washing your face or showering. Water will make this stuff sting like the devil and you do not need that in your life. Just wait. 3. If you’re a woman of a *ahem* certain age that tends to sweat at night, you may want to stick with just using a tiiiny amount. This stuff will literally replace so many skin care products. My skin is the best it’s ever been in my life and it’s supple and moisturized. It’s the miracle cream we’ve all wished for. ” — Huskermama “ Since I’ve been using A313 for about 6 months my skin’s general health and condition have significantly improved. It immediately and successfully lightened the sun-induced hyperpigmentation I had. My dark sun spots have faded to almost nothing, so I don’t need to apply makeup to hide them. In addition, my skin appears less wrinkled and has become somewhat firmer and smoother.” — Diana Duque “I’ve been using this for two weeks. I was looking for something to improve my skin’s texture and hydration. It did both- put it on at night and I’m noticing my skin is super hydrated in the morning and overall my deeper wrinkles and fine lines look diminished! I also have zero breakouts now and it healed the couple of blemishes I had when I started it. It does tingle if I get it too close to my upper eyelids but I put it high over my crow feet and lower lid area and it’s been fine. I use it nightly now after the initial tingling time frame when I had to do every other day. I’m a believer! It’s a generous tube size and I only need a pea size.” — Lively By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Taking a vacation is a great way to unwind, relax and enjoy some time away from the stresses of everyday life. Packing for vacation, however, feels anything but relaxing. Even seasoned travelers can feel a sense of dread trying to figure out the right outfits and individual pieces to pack before a trip. There are also the inevitable concerns about space, unexpected weather and forgotten items. Perhaps that’s why the “333 method” is so appealing. This packing system has attracted fans across the TikTok sphere thanks to its streamlined and stress-free approach. The concept is fairly simple: Choose three tops, three bottoms and three pairs of shoes to create different outfit combinations. The result is more than a dozen looks that fit easily in your carry-on luggage. “The 333 rule helps address the fear of overpacking, while also ensuring you look the part,” Katy Nastro, spokesperson for the flight alert service Going , told HuffPost. “An unexpected benefit is you have an excuse to pick up an item or two on the trip — you packed light after all.” If you look to TikTok, you’ll find endless videos of travelers showing off all the different vacation outfits they manage to make with their nine pieces. The source of this trend is influencer Rachel Spencer, who posted a video breaking down the method in October as a guide to creating a simple capsule wardrobe for fall. In her subsequent 333 videos, she’s managed to put together more than 20 different styled outfits. “A similar concept was created by Courtney Carver as a fashion challenge to simplify our lives back in 2010,” Nastro explained. “The original challenge was to lean on a capsule wardrobe with 33 items to wear over three months. A rebirth of the challenge takes the minimalist dressing approach even further applying it to not just travel but seasonal looks as well.” Even if you can’t perfectly stick to the limit, she believes the 333 method is a great jumping off point for packing that you can build upon as needed. “Yes, you can dress pieces up, but certain trips might need more formalwear, in which case you may have to break the rules,” Nastro said. “Using the 333 rule as your basis, you’ll be more conscious overall of how much you pack. Less stuff, less stress, and less unnecessary bag fees paid.” Fashion influencer Krista Lavrusik frequently posts 333 outfit videos on her social media accounts. She told HuffPost she usually starts her process by choosing three pairs of pants that look great, feel comfortable and provide a mix of dark and light colors. “I love a long-sleeved turtleneck and a crewneck sweater,” she said. “I’m also into wearing sweaters on your shoulder to add dimension.” To maximize your outfit potential, it’s helpful to choose three tops that each offer something different and can also be layered together. For example, try one base layer top ― like a tank or T-shirt ― one sweater and one nice button-down. Lavrusik recommends using the 333 method to push your sartorial creativity to its full potential. “Every time I do it, I stare at my bed where all my clothes and shoes are and think, ‘Wow this seems too simple. There’s no way I can make 17-18 outfits out of just this.’ But then I do,” she said. The style expert noted that you can throw in a couple of random pieces ― for example, a dress for a special occasion or an extra top ― if you’re dying to wear them on your trip, but emphasized that less is more. “My advice would be to invest in the basics,” Lavrusik said. “A pop of color is great here and there, but you’ve got to keep it neutral to get the most bang for your buck. Also accessories go a lot further than we give them credit for ― try adding scarves, belts and baseball hats.” When Nastro first tried the method, she found narrowing down to three pairs of shoes was a “piece of cake,” while pants required slightly more thought. “Where the overpacker in me struggled was selecting tops, especially since winter weather is mostly about layering,” she said. “Admittedly, I brought two additional tops outside of the three as a ‘just in case.’ You know what they say, old habits die hard.” Nastro believes the hardest part of the 333 method is getting past the “what if I need this?” mentality. “After talking myself down and sticking to basics, putting together outfits was pretty seamless,” she added. “I really was shocked at how many looks I could create from my small carry-on. And the best part ― my two security tops I brought, I never ended up wearing.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost For many people, bookmarking restaurants and bars is a beloved part of trip planning. And if you’re someone who considers dining and drinking an experience more than a necessity, then you may want to plan your entire vacation around destinations with unbelievable fare. But while viral TikTok videos and skewed restaurant reviews can sometimes lead you astray, there’s one group of people who certainly know where to go: chefs. These experts aren’t just pros at their craft, but they know their way around a menu, whether it’s a fine dining meal, huge food market or a street food cart. We asked chefs from across the country for their favorite places to travel to for good food (aside from the town where their restaurants are located) that they feel are attainable and affordable. Here’s what they said: Amanda Shulman, the chef and owner of Philadelphia’s Her Place Supper Club and co-owner of Philadelphia’s My Loup , recently returned from her honeymoon in Thailand where she said the food was incredible. She recommended “any single street food cart that serves plump Thai pork sausages stuffed with vermicelli noodles — a sour fermented pork sausage, grilled over charcoal until it is swollen and glistening, nearly popping out of its casing.” “Fatty and tangy and incredible, I grabbed them whenever I could,” Shulman said. “In Chiang Mai, there’s a roadside restaurant called Neng’s Earthen Jar Roast Pork filled with clay barrels rendering fat pork bellies until the skins are shatteringly crisp,” Shulman continued. In Northern Thailand, laarb, which is “finely minced pork dressed in fish sauce, chilis, herbs and rice powder,” and khao soi, a rich curry noodle soup, are mainstays on many menus. Shulman recommended Aroon Rai , a small restaurant in Chiang Mai for these items. In Bangkok, Shulman said “ Sorn was one of the best fine dining experiences I’ve ever had. Every bite was unabashedly delicious, the technique was evident and tight, and I’ll be dreaming of swiping warm roti into beef curry maybe forever.” “The modern London dining scene is, I think, the most exciting dining scene anywhere in the world,” said Ed Szymanski, the chef and owner of Dame and Lord’s in New York City. London has restaurants that feature high-quality produce coming from France, Spain and Italy, as well as seafood from the northern parts of the U.K. “All of these things come together to create this very diverse dining scene,” Szymanski said. Many restaurants serve modern British cuisine, including Planque , St. JOHN and Noble Rot , but the city’s food options don’t stop at British food. You can find great Pakistani, Indian, Spanish, Italian food, and more. Or, for an all-in-one spot for local food and drinks, visit Borough Market where “you walk around and get some snacks, and you can have oysters shucked right in front of you, have a glass of champagne, and then go and have a sausage roll after that,” he said. An oft-overlooked cuisine is Guatemalan food, which is known for its stews, and all things corn and beans, like corn tortillas, tostadas, tamales, empanadas, and pupusas loaded with cheese and beans, said Sofia Deleon, the owner of El Merkury in Philadelphia and the Guatemalan rum brand Tenango Rum . She added that the cuisine naturally has lots of gluten-free and vegetarian options, too. “One of my favorite places to go when I visit is Mercado Central , the central market, because it’s a one-stop shop for everything [in Guatemala City],” Deleon said. Here you can find produce stands, meat purveyors and vendors selling handwoven items, in addition to food stands selling fresh tostadas loaded with avocado, parsley and cheese, and traditional Guatemalan desserts like a condensed milk treat known as canillita de leche. Ceviche used to be a popular food throughout Guatemala but has since decreased in popularity. In Antigua, though, (which is about 1.5 hours from Guatemala City), she recommends you order ceviche at Hugo’s Ceviches . The restaurant “has been around forever, and it’s the one place that still maintains their standard and is really good,” she noted, adding Hugo’s Ceviches is also known for their micheladas made with Gallo, Guatemala’s local beer, along with the regular fixings like chilis and Worcestershire sauce. Also in Antigua is La Cuevita de Los Urquizú, which comes highly recommended by Deleon as well. “What’s nice about this place is ... it’s almost like a buffet where you can buy things by the pound, and they have 50 to 75 varieties of very traditional foods that you would otherwise not get to try if you went anywhere else,” she said. For traditional sweets, visit Doña María Gordillo in Antigua, which has been around since the 1800s. “Originally, based on Spanish-style sweets, but then it was adapted to Guatemalan flavors, so they have everything from the tamarind balls to chilacayote en dulce, which is like a type of Guatemalan pumpkin” in addition to tasty egg tarts. New Orleans has some of “the most diverse and delicious food experiences — there’s not enough stomach space to devour all the good the city has to offer,” Shulman said. The city is beloved for its food culture, which comprises Southern, Creole, Cajun and French cooking — think jambalaya, gumbo , beignets, and more. One affordable item on menus across the city are po’boys, a sandwich that’s traditionally made with fried shrimp, roast beef or fried oysters, and served on crusty bread. For a good po’boy, followed by lemon Hubig’s Pies (a sweet New Orleans hand pie), Shulman recommends Frady’s One Stop . For the New Orleans’ classic muffuletta (an Italian sandwich made with an olive salad, cured meat, cheese on a round roll) visit Central Grocery , according to Shulman. Additionally, she suggests Cane & Table , a seasonally-focused restaurant that specializes in Caribbean and Cuban food, and Dakar , which serves Senegalese food. Or for something more special, try Mosquito Supper Club , which is Shulman’s “crush of a restaurant — sitting at the bar and eating pickled shrimp and other small bites was a magical experience.” Cape Town, South Africa, is a destination that’s full of complex local flavors along with fresh produce, and lots and lots of great wine, said Deleon. Plus, it’s relatively inexpensive and totally beautiful, she noted. Specifically, the region is known for its Chenin Blanc wines, a type of white wine that is light and crisp. One of Deleon’s favorite places to drink South African wine is Babylonstoren Wine Estate , a winery where everything is grown in-house, from the olives for the olive oil to the grapes for the wines. In addition to wine, Deleon said Cape Town is known for its Cape Malay food, “which is a mix of Malaysian and Indian and South African flavors.” You’ll find curry on many menus throughout the city, she said, and you’d be remiss not to try it. One spot for curry she recommends is Curry Club , where you can choose from a menu of chicken curries, lamb curries and veggie curries, ranging from mild to spicy. Mexico City is another great place to eat, according to Szymanski. “There’s an unending list of places to go in Mexico City.” “Mexico City is one of the largest and most eclectic cities in the world, and the rich tapestry of street vendors, markets, high-end restaurants and mezcal bars means there’s always a fun discovery around the corner,” said Szymanski. Mexico City is known for a range of food, including its fresh tacos, making taquerias a must, according to Szymanski. Among his taqueria recommendations is El Torito, where they serve two kinds: suadero (which is like a beef brisket) and tripa (tripe) or a mix of both. The area is also known for its barbacoa (slow-cooked lamb). And mezcal, a Mexican liquor made from agave, is worth being sought out, too. Additionally, you should just “follow your nose and eat the street tacos that look good, eat the quesadilla, go to a market in Mexico and eat the thing that looks good. You have to trust your instincts and wait in line if there is a line because there’s a good chance someone else knows something that you don’t.” “Mexican cuisine is such a huge part of American cuisine that I am always drawn to Mexico,” Gregory Gourdet, chef and founder of Kann and Sousòl in Portland, Oregon, told HuffPost via email. “I was blown away by my first trip to Oaxaca in 2021. The history and culture is so rich.” In Oaxaca, you’ll find foods such as moles, which is a traditional Mexican sauce, barbacoa, tlayudas (a traditional Oaxacan dish made of a crunchy tortilla topped with things like beans, meat, veggies and cheese), and tamales, in addition to the local fruits and vegetables that are grown there, said Gourdet. As far as where specifically to go in the city, Gourdet said, “Criollo and Alfonsina are both incredible restaurants.” You can also visit the Zapotec village of Teotitlan del Valle to take part in traditional cooking classes at El Sabor Zapoteco , he noted. Additionally, the city is home to sprawling food markets that are must-visits during any trip. And beyond this, it’s a good destination for those with certain allergies, too. “My dietary distinctions include being gluten and dairy-free, and corn-based Oaxacan cuisine is extremely accommodating. I was often told I was missing out by not indulging in the legendary local cheese, however,” Gourdet said. “I can almost guarantee you that nobody will have chosen the place that I was going to propose speaking about which is Corsica. Specifically, the northern half of Corsica, which is referred to as Haute Corse,” said Tyler Akin, the chef-partner of Le Cavalier in Wilmington, Delaware, and Bastia , a coming soon coastal Mediterranean restaurant in Philadelphia. Corsica is an island, so it’s natural to think that seafood is the focal point. And while you can find great options (Akin suggests stopping in the town of Centuri for spiny lobster and sea urchin), the food here centers on cooking traditions from the mountainous region. “Unlike Sardinia to the south, you see these alpine cheese traditions and more land-animal-driven cuisine than seafood-driven cuisine,” Akin said. This includes high-quality charcuterie products, chestnuts and mushrooms. Akin said it’s best to go to Corsica during the offseason. “It’s really cool to be one of very few people there anytime but [specifically] May through October because you have an opportunity to really connect with the people.” “One of the highlights there for me was the charcuterie that was produced,” said Akin, who added that a favorite producer of his was Les Delices de Castellu, which has “these incredibly natural products, wild boar salamis, and the signature sausage of Corsica which is figatellu.” Additionally, he said you should try migliacciu, which are pancakes stuffed with a ricotta-like cheese known as brocciu. Another must-visit? Patrimonio, which is Corsica’s wine region where natural, organic wines are the focal point. In the university town of Corte, seek out baked goods from Casanova Patisserie, which makes a little cheesecake called falculelle and fresh fruit ice cream, and Fritelle Curtinese for the best beignets on the island and a herb pie made with lard, maquis herbs and maquis herbs. When you think of Austin, you likely think of tacos and barbecue — and that’s for good reason. These foods are woven into the history of the area and can be found all throughout the neighborhoods of the city. Andrew Taylor, the chef/owner of Big Tree Hospitality in Portland, Maine, which operates Eventide Oyster Co., the Honey Paw and Hugo’s, along with some artisan food markets, said Austin is the place that’s stood out to him most when it comes to food destinations. ”[I’m] just really impressed with the food ... it actually reminded me a little bit of Portland in that it’s not a huge town but it felt like the quality of restaurants, the breadth of the restaurant scene was exceptional and punched way above its weight,” Taylor stated. There are barbecue institutions like Franklin Barbecue and la Barbecue in Austin itself, in addition to options outside of town, too. He added that it’s hard to find a bad meal in Austin, but if you are looking for places to dine, he has a few tips. “We took a little trip out like 45 minutes from Austin [to] Lockhart, Texas ... and the barbecue there was just the best I’ve ever had in my life. We went to Kreuz Market, which was just outrageous, Smitty’s and Terry Blacks, were just all incredible,” he said. For tacos, he recommends Nixta where everything, from the tortillas to the braises, are handmade, and Veracruz, which is a food truck vibe. And there is much more than tacos and barbecue in Austin. Taylor noted that he tried great Japanese food, Mexican food, Caribbean fare, and more.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Traveling by train can be a magical experience. You can enjoy stunning scenery as you pass through parts of the world you might not have the opportunity to see otherwise. It’s also a more eco-friendly alternative to flying or driving. But like any form of transit, train travel also comes with its fair share of stress. To help train-goers, we asked experts to break down some of the most common mistakes people make while traveling by rail. Read on for their observations and advice for making the journey as smooth as possible. Compared with air travel, taking a train can be a more relaxing experience, as you don’t have to worry about bag rules. But you should still aim to pack as efficiently as you can. “Although you can take as much as you can carry and there are no luggage restrictions on the vast majority of trains, bear in mind that you will need to carry this on and off trains, as well as securing its spot in the luggage racks,” said Simon Hodge, managing director of the U.K.-based Tailor Made Rail. “It is best to travel light.” Hodge noted that another common mistake in train travel is not bringing enough food on board for a long journey, and planning to rely on the dining car ― if there even is one. “These restaurant cars can run out of your preferred choice very easily, and there are no restrictions to bringing your own food and drink on board, unlike airlines,” he said. “Take a picnic on board for longer journeys.” But do be mindful of... It’s important to pack enough food for yourself, but make sure you give some thought to what, specifically, you plan to eat on the train. “That wonderful speciality cheese you see in the deli on the way to the train station is perfect for ending dinner at home with friends, but it may not smell so great after several hours on a hot train,” said Rail Europe CEO and executive chairman Björn Bender, who commutes by train between Paris and Switzerland almost weekly. “Pack a picnic for the journey, to be sure, but go easy on strong-smelling foods,” Bender told HuffPost. “Anything too spicy or pungent may test the patience of fellow passengers in your carriage.” Be sure to familiarize yourself with the seating situation before you book your train journey. “A common mistake people make that affects their fellow travelers is not being familiar with seating assignment policies,” said Staffo Dobrev, director of communications at Wanderu. “Generally, train seats are offered on a first-come first-served basis, unless you have booked a business or first class fare, both of which allow you to reserve a specific seat ahead of time. Because of that, people who travel together sometimes end up not being able to sit near each other, which may result in frustration and even confrontations with other passengers.” “Here at Rail Europe, we’ve seen the renaissance of night trains across Europe,” Bender said. “That’s a great way of covering a lot of ground while also saving on hotel costs.” If you choose to train through the night, however, consider upgrading to a car with a bed. Sometimes it doesn’t even cost much more. “Always book sleeping berths,” Bender advised. “No-one enjoys an overnight journey in a regular train seat.” “Our guests choose rail travel to slow down and experience the epic scenery that is, in parts, only accessible by train while being able to reconnect with their travel companions. So, anything that detracts from this would be a mistake,” said Wendy McMichael, a train manager with Rocky Mountaineer. “For instance, spending time on tablets or phones when you can be enjoying the incredible scenery outside your window.” Another way people miss breathtaking scenery is by choosing these routes for their overnight train travel. “Don’t plan overnight train journeys through the Alps,” Hodge said. “People often take [overnight trains] on routes that are beautifully scenic, for instance traveling through the Alps, on a journey from Munich to Venice and missing out on the spectacular Brenner Pass route.” “Even if you’re on vacation, it’s always best to be a considerate traveler,” said Jody Ford, CEO of Trainline. “Respect the space of fellow passengers and be mindful of keeping your belongings out of other people’s way.” Keep your feet where they belong, as well. Ford pointed to a recent Trainline survey of about 7,000 regular train travelers from the U.K., France, Germany and Spain, which found that one of the most cited pet peeves was people putting their feet up on the seats. “A way to support everyone is by never stowing your bags and belongings on empty seats,” Bender noted. “Only take so much as you think you can store in the overhead racks or in the designated areas for bag storage at the end of your carriage.” “It should go without saying, but always be respectful of the train crew,” Dobrev said. Remember that their job is to get you to your destination safely, and many things are out of their control. That includes your own train travel missteps. “It’s normal to make mistakes, but it’s not acceptable to blame others for your failure to familiarize yourself with the details of your journey,” Dobrev said. “The crew is there to help you and make your travel experience better, but if you approach them with a confrontational attitude it’s less likely to get the best resolution to your problem.” You might not always know far in advance when you’ll need to a take a train, but in cases where you do, take advantage. “Booking ahead where possible will always get you the best ticket prices,” Ford said. “A recent consumer survey in the U.K. for example found that ticket machines at stations can charge more than twice the price of online tickets. Plus, in many European countries, trains on popular routes fill up, so booking in advance means you can know your schedule.” “In the United States, it’s not uncommon to have cities with the same name in different states,” Dobrev said. There are Newarks in both New Jersey and Delaware, for example, as well as Springfields across the country . “As a result, sometimes travelers make the mistake of booking a train trip to or from the wrong city,” he explained. “That could lead to losing money when they try to change it, or even worse, completely derailing their travel plans because they did not realize their mistake until well on their way.” Additionally, many cities have multiple train stations, and they might be in very different locations. “Some travelers may not necessarily be aware of that and may think that their train departs from the one station they know of,” Dobrev said. “If they did not arrive early enough before realizing their mistake, they may not have enough time to make the trek over to the correct departure point.” You can’t always rely on trains to have ample working outlets, so if you’re going on a long journey, make sure your phone is fully charged and you have a way to power it back up. “Take a power bank in case your phone is low on battery and there is no in-seat power,” Hodge advised. “When traveling by train, sometimes you may need to transfer to a different train to reach your destination,” Dobrev said. “Unfortunately, many travelers don’t realize that’s the case with their itinerary, so they end up stranded because they did not change trains when they were supposed to.” He emphasized the importance of paying attention to your trip details and itinerary so you don’t end up on the wrong train or miss a transfer. Don’t expect to have all the information on your ticket, either. You might need to keep up with updates on the train company’s app, or via information posted in the railway station. “Make sure you know the exact station from which you are departing, and when you get there, look for the schedule board to determine the specific track from which you need to board your train,” Dobrev said. “If you have any trouble, don’t hesitate to seek help from a station attendant.” “One of the most common mistakes that we see passengers make is not familiarizing themselves with the change or cancellation policy of the fare type that they booked,” Dobrev said. “For example, Amtrak’s cheapest fare classes, such as Sale or Value, don’t allow any changes post-booking and only offer partial refunds of 50% and 75% respectively. As a result, passengers whose plans change may get frustrated that they are unable to get all of their money back.” He advised travelers who need flexibility to book the higher-tier fare types that come with 100% refund and free change options. “It’s important to note that no refunds or changes are allowed once the trip has commenced, so if you expect that you are going to miss your train, we highly recommend that you contact Amtrak ahead of time and arrange to get any refund that is available to you,” he said. “Knowledge is power and the more you know about your rights as a passenger and the train carrier’s regulations, the smoother your travel experience will be.” Bender similarly suggested that travelers take advantage of rail passes, which can provide benefits like unlimited travel in designated places. “Additionally, they offer flexibility, allowing you to adjust your plans easily,” he said. “Many travelers make the mistake of having a rigid itinerary with little room for change when purchasing individual tickets for each leg of their journey, locking them into a specific schedule. With a rail pass, changing your plans is effortless.” “While we don’t suggest leaving your cell phone behind, minimizing usage during the journey can enhance the experience for everyone,” Bender said. “Avoiding loud phone calls and being mindful of noise levels contribute to a more pleasant atmosphere.” Dobrev similarly recommended keeping your noise levels down and doing your best not to disrupt others’ travel experiences. “If someone is being disruptive towards you, seek help from a crew member,” he said. “They are trained to deal with difficult situations and de-escalate confrontations.” Train travel can be a truly magical experience, especially if you take time to enjoy scenic routes and stop off in the smaller communities along the way. “I encourage guests to sit back, relax, and take in the incredible journey that comes with train travel,” McMichael said. Even if you aren’t taking a leisurely ride through stunning landscapes, there’s plenty to appreciate about this form of transportation. “Don’t worry too much about making mistakes, and instead focus on enjoying your journey!” Ford said. “Train travel is a much better way to enjoy your vacation than hiring a car ― for example you have no concerns around local traffic laws, navigating foreign roads, traffic or parking. Instead, you get much more time to relax, enjoy the view or take advantage of the free Wi-Fi that’s available on many routes, before arriving at your destination in the heart of the city center.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

In fact, the practice has become so popular that some hotels have even starting offering amenities that cater to solo travelers. Taking a trip by yourself is also a great approach for last-minute adventures when it’s hard to find others who are free to drop everything and get away. And the possibilities for places to visit are seemingly endless. “A last-minute trip is one that takes minimal planning,” Sue Cockell, a travel coach and founder of Sue Where? Why? What? , told HuffPost. “That means no complicated visa requirements or language barriers, plus easy navigation and good public transport networks.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life It’s an experience all too familiar with air travelers: One minute the flight is going smoothly, and the next thing you know it feels like the plane is bumping and shaking in all directions. Turbulence is a very common part of air travel, but that doesn’t make it less unpleasant. In fact, research has shown that turbulence is one of the biggest causes of flying anxiety, as many passengers tend to catastrophize and take it as a sign the plane is going down. If you’re someone who gets anxious when you’re on a plane that hits a stretch of rough air, there are ways to avoid spiraling. We asked some of the most seasoned flyers ― flight attendants ― to share their advice for soothing nerves during turbulence: “First and foremost, understand that the airplane is designed to fly through turbulence,” said Laura Nottingham, an Atlanta-based flight attendant with Delta Air Lines. “Nothing is wrong with the aircraft. Pilots are highly trained professionals and know how to expertly handle turbulence. There are various reasons turbulence occurs: wind, changes in air temperature, thunderstorms, etc.” She believes the best way to tackle fear is to understand it, so learning about the science of turbulence can put anxious passengers at ease. Focus on facts to avoid escalating into a state of worry. “Air turbulence is a common occurrence. It is a helpful technique to decrease travelers’ anxiety by helping them understand the effects of turbulence,” echoed Yulanda Armstrong, an Eastern Airlines flight attendant and air transportation ground instructor in Guyana. “In most instances, turbulence appears more detrimental than it may seem. The industry should communicate the rhetoric that ‘turbulence should be expected as opposed to dreaded.’” “I personally have dealt with anxiety since my teenage years,” said Doménica Jiménez, an Ecuador-based flight attendant with Eastern Airlines. “ A tip that helps me now in my career in the skies is slow breathing. Being mindful of my breathing by slowing inhaling and exhaling has been a game changer. It helps me to stay calm during turbulence and also do my job.” The meditation company Headspace has partnered with a number of air carriers, include JetBlue Airways and United Airlines, to provide in-flight guided relaxation. Nottingham noted that Delta now offers meditation classes led by Peloton instructors as part of its entertainment options. “Meditate or take a deep breath to help slow your breathing,” she advised, adding that short meditations can help passengers feel more mindful and comfortable during a flight. “What better way to relax than by distracting yourself?” Nottingham said. “Take advantage of the time you have during flight to read a book, listen to music, or make that to-do list.” Explore the movies and shows on your seatback screen or download your own entertainment before the flight. If you’re traveling with a companion, talk to them about something unrelated to the flight. The idea is to keep your brain focused. “What I will typically do is engage with the passenger with a friendly unrelated conversation to ease their mind off any anxious thoughts that may come during turbulence,” Jiménez said. “I also offer them something to drink. A smile and a distraction go a long way.” “Some passengers are not so afraid of turbulence, but really are afraid of getting airsick,” Nottingham said. Fortunately, there are tricks to help alleviate feelings of nausea. If you feel yourself starting to get nauseated, Nottingham suggested contacting a flight attendant and asking for an ice pack. “Nothing cures nausea faster than an ice pack on the back of the neck,” she noted. “Let your flight attendant know if you get anxious, so we can support you throughout your journey,” said Kim Howard, an Avelo Airlines flight attendant based in Connecticut. “I’ve had customers come on the plane in tears,” she added. “I will whisper to them, ‘Are you an anxious flyer?’ They say, ‘Yes, I hate turbulence.’ I ask their seat number and will reassure them before takeoff and check on them throughout the flight.” She emphasized that flight attendants do more than just pass out snacks. They are also trained to keep order and promote safety ― and to do so with kindness. So don’t hesitate to reach out if you need reassurance or even a moment of distraction. If turbulence makes you anxious, pay attention to announcements from the cockpit, as the pilots often give passengers a heads-up about anticipated rough air. “An announcement from our captain during turbulence goes a long way,” Howard said. “The captain will often assure customers turbulence will be a short period of time throughout the changes of altitude. Of course, there are different levels of turbulence. Some are more severe than others. But, most times it is mild and for short periods of time.” If you notice the plane is not full and feel uncomfortable or unsafe where you are, consider asking the flight attendant for a seat change. “At Eastern, if we notice a passenger is really nervous about their journey in the skies, and they’re seated toward the back, we offer to re-accommodate them to another part of the aircraft where the turbulence may feel lighter, like the front of the aircraft or near the wings,” Jiménez said. “I have encountered passengers whose responses to turbulence ranged from mild to severe anxiety during my career,” Armstrong said. “My ideal technique is reassurance. Passengers want to know that they are safe.” Whenever she feels anxious at work, Armstrong reminds herself that she is equipped with the skills and knowledge to remedy difficult situations and is responsible for the safety of all passengers. This understanding ― that trained professionals like Armstrong are in control ― can help ease passenger anxiety as well. “During a flight when I experienced passengers with high anxiety, which impaired their ability to co-operate with our procedures, I announced, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, remain calm. The flight attendants have the situation under control,’” she recalled. “Immediately, the passengers were calm and cooperative.” Jiménez said she reminds anxious passengers that aircraft are one of the safest modes of transportation and that pilots and flights attendants are highly trained professionals. “While flying through the sky can be daunting, the aircraft is designed to keep us safe and the entire staff on board is trained to keep you safe and comfortable,” she noted. Alleviating your anxiety around turbulence begins before boarding. If you take care of yourself and your body ahead of the flight, you’ll feel more comfortable on board. “It is always best to be well prepared for your flight,” Howard said. “Hydrate the night before. Bring your favorite snacks, books, magazine, and, nowadays, you can download movies or TV shows. The better prepared you are makes for a less anxious flight.” This story was previously published at an earlier date.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life If you have ever scrambled to find your gate number or forgot what carousel your suitcases are on, you know that figuring out flight or baggage claim information can be annoying or tedious at best. But there’s an easy way to get real-time updates about your flight right from your phone ― no ticket or airport TV required. On TikTok, former airline employee Darby Maloney said that her “No. 1 flying hack” ― besides getting TSA PreCheck ― is to text the flight number to herself and her family on the morning of her flight. A flight number consists of a 2-letter airline code and a series of numbers that will help you differentiate your flight from others that are flying that day. You will see the flight number in your booking confirmation or on your boarding pass. Maloney gave the example of an American Airlines flight like AA686. If you are confused about what your airline code is, you can also quickly look it up in the International Air Transport Association’s search engine . Maloney said when you text your flight number on an iPhone, it will send you a link that will show where your plane is and the current gate number, expected flight duration and your baggage claim carousel. Maloney said the link is helpful because if your gate changes, it will automatically change in that link too. “I never have to look at screens in the airport anymore,” Maloney said. “It’s the greatest hack ever and I think nobody knows about it.” S/O @Brooke Webster for teaching me this in my bag loading days 7 years ago Maloney’s advice was clearly news to many people. Her video had over 1 million likes and garnered thousands of comments. As one top comment to her video put it: “As someone who flies for work, this is SO helpful!” Sure, you can download your airline’s app to get the same information, but the genius of this tip is how it reduces the numbers of steps you need to take. Take the stressful scenario of having a short layover for a connecting flight as an example. Gates can often change, and you don’t want to waste time going to the wrong one. If you want to know immediately where your next gate is, Maloney recommended texting yourself the flight number for that leg of your trip. “The second you land, you can just click your link and know exactly what your gate is so when you get off of the plane ― boom, you’re off to your connection,” Maloney said. Or how about the family member who is picking you up? They just need your flight number to keep track of any delays. “I use this the most when somebody’s picking me up,” Maloney said in a follow-up TikTok video. “I’m not going to ask them to download the app ... I’m just going to send them the link.“ Because airlines use the same planes for different flights, it’s most useful to text yourself the flight number on the morning of the flight, Maloney recommended . Here’s how the hack works: If you’re on an iPhone, all you need to do is to text yourself your flight number. From there, you will click on the hyperlinked number and select “Preview Flight.” There you can look up your flight information in real-time. If you have an Android, texting yourself the flight number will not cause the same pop-up link, but you can type your flight number in your Google search bar to get the same real-time information. When you’re rushing through the airport, it’s nice to know exactly where your plane is. This tip makes that information a stress-free tap away on your phone.

Even as offices reopened, countless employees continued to work from home ― or from somewhere else. Not only did this change the way people work, but it also changed the way they travel. Enter the “hush trip.” But what exactly is a hush trip, and how does it work? Below, experts break down the benefits and downsides of this approach to travel. “A ‘hush trip’ is where employees work remotely from a location other than their usual one, without informing their employers,” said travel blogger Sean Lau . It’s a temporary setup in which employees might simply work from a beach house an hour away from home for a few days ― or they might travel to a different time zone or even internationally. “Since they can just log on and handle their job duties from anywhere, the mindset is why even bring it up to your employer if you happen to be in the Bahamas while you’re working,” said travel blogger Esther Susag . Hush-trippers typically continue to do their work tasks and take Zoom meetings, but refrain from mentioning where they are located. They work from hotel rooms, coffee shops and even short-term co-working spaces. “They may go as far as to use a VPN to disguise their IP address and location,” said Gabby Beckford , a travel expert and founder of travel site Packs Light. The concept is somewhat similar to “bleisure travel,” which involves combining business and leisure travel. Bleisure travelers might go on a work-related trip, but tack on extra time on the front or backend for vacation. They might also work remotely from their destination in between relaxation and touristy activities. With hush trips and bleisure travel, employees often take friends or family along, but they might also go solo. “It’s an experience woven into the fabric of the digital nomad and remote worker lifestyle since the dawn of connectivity,” said Erick Prince , a travel blogger and founder of travel site Minority Nomad. “And now, the broader travel world is having a taste of its charms. But like any dish, this trend comes with its own unique blend of flavors ― both delightful and challenging.” “As someone who works remotely and prefers working somewhere scenic, I think a hush trip can increase productivity and improve mental well-being, ultimately increasing employee retention,” Lau said. Proponents of hush trips believe this kind of travel offers a much-needed boost to workers’ morale and quality of life. “They can avoid the stress of explaining their reasons for travel to their boss and getting corporate approval, and a potential ‘no,’” Beckford said. Hush trips also allow for a level of spontaneity and flexibility in travel (which allows workers to take advantage of great deals , among other benefits). “You can just wake up one morning, decide ‘I feel like working with an ocean view this week,’ and can just hop on a flight that afternoon without sending PTO requests ― you’re just embracing that digital nomad lifestyle,” Susag said. Since 2020, many industries have rethought their approach to work environments. The hush trip fits into that escape from a traditional “desk-bound existence,” Prince noted. There’s a balance of structure and independence. “It’s a passport to freedom, a chance to roam, explore, and breathe life into both personal and professional endeavors in ways unimaginable within the confines of conventional office culture,” he explained. “It’s about combating the relentless specter of burnout, reclaiming our right to truly live rather than merely exist in the grind.” “There are risks to hush trips, especially if you are going somewhere with unreliable internet connectivity or significant time zone differences,” Lau noted. You might run into issues with your employer that could jeopardize your future with the company. “It shows a lack of trust between employer and employee, and if they were to call that employee into the office at the last minute, there would be issues,” Beckford said. In addition to the erosion of trust, administrative concerns might also arise, especially if you turn your short-stint hush trip into a more extended stay. “HR teams already struggle tracking where remote workers are based,” Susag said. “Hush trips make that borderline impossible and open up all sorts of potential tax, privacy and legal issues depending on where folks work from unannounced. So for workers, hush trips epitomize remote work freedom. But for employers, I don’t think they see them the same way.” Prince echoed this sentiment, pointing to the visa and tax implications, network security hazards and potential disruptions to workflows. But he and other travel pros who spoke to HuffPost expressed that the hush trip lifestyle can be OK as long as employees are delivering their work consistently and on time. “Certain challenges have prompted many companies to ‘ban’ hush trips,” he said. “But much like the reluctant return to the office post-pandemic, the economics of reverting to the brick-and-mortar grind may prove unpalatable for many.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Travelers understandably spend more time preparing for long-haul air travel than they do for one- or two-hour flights. But that doesn’t mean they’ve got it all figured out when it comes to those shorter plane voyages. With that in mind, HuffPost asked travel experts to share the common mistakes travelers make on short flights, as well as their advice for avoiding these errors. From forgetting crucial supplies to being unprepared for an often-smaller aircraft, here are some issues to keep in mind. “Certain smaller aircraft that operate shorter flights also might not have all the charging options ― USB ports, power plugs ― that you might expect on larger, longer-haul planes, so be sure your devices are charged ahead of boarding to make sure you don’t run out of juice mid-flight,” said Eric Rosen , director of travel content at The Points Guy. In addition to charging your devices before the flight, consider traveling with a portable power bank as backup. “One common mistake I see travelers make on short flights is getting too comfortable ― taking off shoes, sleeping too deeply,” said Gabby Beckford , founder of the travel site Packs Light. She emphasized that what’s expected on a long overnight flight might be a disservice on a short-haul journey. “It’s a short flight!” Beckford said. “You’ll just end up scrambling when it’s time to deplane.” “These days, it’s not uncommon to be stuck on the tarmac longer than expected or to experience a cancellation or delay,” noted Jessica van Dop DeJesus , founder and editor at The Dining Traveler. “Make sure to pack snacks and water.” Short flights don’t always offer full beverage or snack service, especially if there’s a lot of turbulence, so don’t depend on that cart for sustenance. “I cannot count the number of times I’ve said ‘It’s a short trip, I’ll eat later,’” said travel blogger Sean Lau . “Unfortunately, in-flight food often tastes bad and costs an arm and a leg, and there’s no guarantee of service on shorter routes. My advice is to take the time to eat before your flight or bring your own snacks. Better yet, sign up for services like Priority Pass and take advantage of the food and drinks in airport lounges before departure!” “Always consider your seat,” said Adam Duckworth , president and founder of Travelmation. “Even though it’s a short flight, you will still face many of the same things you do on a long flight. For example, people will still need to get up. If that bothers you, book the window seat. If you prefer to have extra room, then book those higher-class tickets. Two hours in main cabin is very different from two hours in business.” Short flights are often just the first step of a multileg air travel journey, so plan accordingly when you have to make a connection. “Like any flight, I always recommend sitting near the front of the plane, especially if you have a layover,” Duckworth said. A short flight might not be the best time to dive into that new superhero epic you’ve been wanting to watch. “Consider your in-flight entertainment,” Duckworth said. “If it’s a short flight, you may not finish the movie or TV show you’re watching, so keep that in mind.” “One common mistake is not preparing properly for the airport experience ― not giving yourself enough time, not having your documents and IDs ready, not organizing your liquids properly,” said travel blogger Esther Susag . “This adds unnecessary stress.” Even though short flights feel like less of a big deal, they’re still part of the typical airport and airplane experience. “My tips are to get to the airport early, have everything ready to go through security smoothly, bring an empty water bottle to fill after clearing security, download entertainment like movies/shows/podcasts, and dress in layers for varying cabin temperatures,” Susag added. “Also, I always double-check my carry-on and personal items for loose liquids that could get me flagged.” Be mindful of how much you pack for the trip, especially if you don’t want to gate-check your bag or cram extra stuff under the seat in front of you. “Short flights often mean smaller planes,” Beckford said. “Packing too much is often inconvenient and can make your experience more uncomfortable with the limited leg room and cabin size.” Don’t forget to build some buffer time into your day if you have a connection or other time-sensitive factors. “Given the amount of air traffic we’re seeing these days, folks with short flights might assume they’ll be on and off the plane in a matter of hours,” Rosen said. “But travelers should anticipate unexpected delays, including slow aircraft turnarounds and tarmac waits due to traffic congestion. Any of those could add on hours to an otherwise short itinerary, so pad your schedule.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Choosing your plane seat when you book a flight can sometimes feel like a crapshoot. Of course, we’d all love to enjoy the extra legroom and amenities that come with business class or other upgraded sections, but the reality is that most travelers are trying to stick to a budget. So which of the many economy cabin seats on a plane makes for the best choice? HuffPost asked travel experts to share which seat they usually opt for when flying. Keep scrolling for their best practices. “I always book a window seat on flights,” said Gabby Beckford , the founder of travel site Packs Light. “No one likes the middle seat for obvious reasons, and the window allows me to entertain myself and a better opportunity to sleep.” Indeed, sitting in the window seat means that you can lean your head against the wall to rest, and you won’t be bothered by row mates getting up to use the bathroom. “I’ll opt for a window if I know the flight path will offer great views,” said travel blogger Esther Susag . Basically, if you’ll be flying over the Grand Canyon or landing in the Maldives, you might want a chance to marvel at the sights without craning your neck. There are other advantages to window seats, especially if they’re over the wings. “As someone with a fear of flying, I always prefer the window seat above the wings,” said travel blogger Sean Lau . “I recently learned that this spot is usually the smoothest due to its proximity to the plane’s center of gravity. Being able to manage the window shade and having the opportunity to glance outside for reassurance comforts me.” “I try to sit as forward in the plane as possible so that I can find room for my carry-on in the overhead bin,” Beckford said. “I’m often carry-on-only, and don’t want to be forced to check my bag.” The closer you are to the front of the plane, the less time it takes to board and deplane as well. “Being near the front means deplaning more quickly than other passengers, which can be a lifesaver during quick connections,” noted Eric Rosen , the director of travel content at the website The Points Guy. However, there is one thing to keep in mind about opting for the front row of a plane or section. “If you are sitting in the first row behind a wall, you will have to place your bag in the overhead bin,” said Adam Duckworth , the president and founder of the travel agency Travelmation. “Some people do not like giving up their things, so don’t book this seat if that’s you.” Even if you can’t book a seat close to the front, it’s worth trying to avoid the last few rows of the plane when possible. “I avoid the last couple of rows on the plane, as it offers the roughest ride,” Lau said. “You’ll also have to deal with noise from the passengers using the lavatory. The last row on the plane may not always recline.” “For long flights, I prefer aisle seats for several reasons,” said Jessica van Dop DeJesus , the founder and editor at The Dining Traveler. “First, it’s easier to deplane without having to wait for several people. Second, it gives me easier access to the overhead bin. And third, it’s easier to get up to stretch my legs and go to the bathroom.” If you’re someone who likes to stand up and stretch, or has to use the lavatory somewhat often, the aisle seat will allow you to do that without worrying about disturbing your fellow passengers. If you had to book at the last minute and wind up with a middle seat, just know that there might be a way to get out of it. “Like most people, I avoid the middle seats at all costs unless it’s the only option left when booking late,” Susag said. “But even then, when I get to the gate, I will always as the desk clerk if there are any other openings besides my middle seat. You just never know unless you ask.” You might also wind up in the middle between a couple traveling together. While many might want to stick to their preferred window and aisle seats, it doesn’t hurt to offer to swap so that they can sit next to each other. “I know a ton of people who avoid sitting near a restroom for obvious reasons but also because it’s the area where people tend to gather,” Duckworth said. It’s not always just the last rows that are near bathrooms, especially on larger planes. So when you select your seat on the map, pay attention to where all of the lavatories are located. “Some planes have them in their midsections,” Rosen said. “I try to avoid locations by the lavatories at all costs so I’m not bothered by noise, foot traffic or smells.” Many travelers try to choose seats in exit rows when they fly because there’s often additional room in those areas. But this option can have a drawback as well. “If you are in the main cabin but prefer extra space, then consider getting the exit row — but remember that not all exit row seats will recline,” Duckworth said. Ultimately, every air passenger has different needs when it comes to seat choices. So the next time you fly, assess what you prefer and keep these expert tips in mind to make the best selection for you.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Group trips are a great way to explore a new destination and make lifelong memories while connecting with loved ones. But with many different personalities and preferences at play, issues can arise. “Most of the time, bad experiences on group trips aren’t a byproduct of going on a group trip,” Wendy Diep, a co-founder of the group travel app Let’s Jetty , told HuffPost. “It usually stems from poor planning, lack of communication and unmet expectations. But remember, it doesn’t have to be that way.” To help make group travel a more enjoyable experience, HuffPost asked Diep and other experts to share some common mistakes that people make on these types of trips. “Most people prefer to travel with loved ones, and post-pandemic, people are craving human connection and real-world experiences more than ever before,” Diep noted. “Avoiding talking about money is a big mistake,” Diep said. “With a group, you’ll have people who have different spending styles or budgets. I have friends who love to have every meal out at bougie restaurants while they travel, while I have friends who can’t spend that kind of money. Not discussing it upfront will lead to awkward or uncomfortable moments on the trip, which really sucks when everyone’s already spending their hard-earned money to be there and have a good time.” Before embarking on your trip, find out everyone’s budgeting priorities and preferences. Choose accommodations and meal options accordingly, and keep people’s financial needs in mind throughout the trip ― for instance, when you’re figuring out how to split a dinner bill after some people had multiple courses and drinks while others just ordered salad. “Ask everyone how much they are looking to spend for the entire trip, including food and activities,” said Phil Dengler, a co-founder of travel website The Vacationer . “Traveling with people who have a high budget is easy, but you will have to do a little more work if you are with more frugal people. If your budget is limited, figure out any potential splurges that will make everyone more comfortable.” “Not having a plan is the biggest mistake you can make on a group trip,” said Madison Pietrowski, the director of brand for the U.S. at the travel platform GetYourGuide . “Book your activities in advance! It’s important to have a plan for each day when dealing with a large group, or else you’ll feel like you’re herding cats.” She recommended booking at least one or two planned activities for each day, but also familiarizing yourself with the cancellation policies in case you need to make changes. Keep the group informed of the proposed itinerary so that everyone has a chance to give their input. “Plan interactive experiences that everyone will enjoy,” Pietrowski added. “Does your group like to cook and eat? Are they adventurous? Into history? Personally, I’d suggest a cooking class because it’ll get the whole group involved and take one lunch or dinner reservation off your plate.” At the very least, snag a few meal reservations because it’s more difficult for a large party to get a table at a restaurant as walk-ins. “When I am traveling with groups larger than four, I usually book dinner reservations for each night just so we have something,” Dengler said. “I’ll share the reservations with the group, as well as a few alternative options, and adjust as needed.” While structure and advanced planning are important for group trips, resist the urge to go overboard with your schedule. “Planners often go in thinking they need to sort events for every day and every hour, otherwise the trip will be a bust,” said Suzie Palma, another co-founder of Let’s Jetty. “But the reality is, your group might want time to hang back and catch up with each other.” She recommended giving people the ability to opt out of certain structured activities and leaving free time for rest. It’s natural to get carried away by the excitement of exploring a new place, but you don’t want everyone to feel exhausted and cranky by the end of the day. “Plan for breaks in between activities within your schedule, so that everyone has a little bit of downtime and can get a snack or just relax,” Pietrowski said. “Also, think about the weather and the types of activities you’re booking. If you’re traveling somewhere that will have hot temperatures, consider booking a museum activity or other indoor tours when the time of day gets very hot. Save the outdoor activities for the early mornings or evenings.” “It’s a group trip. You’re going to be spending the bulk of the time together, so it’s OK if groups split off or people want to do their own things for a bit,” Diep said. “It’s everyone’s vacation. Just make sure to establish the main things that people are going to be doing together. You will still have plenty of quality time together!” Just as it’s helpful to build in unstructured time for people to rest, the group can also benefit from a little space here and there. Many folks are introverts who need a occasional time apart from others, or you might have someone in your group with a very niche travel goal that they’d like to pursue on their own. “While group activities are essential for bonding and shared experiences, it’s also important to respect each other’s need for personal space and downtime,” said Lisa Chen, the CEO of the company ToursByLocals . “Building in some free time or optional activities allows individuals to pursue their interests independently and recharge as needed.” Leaders tend to naturally emerge in group settings, but that doesn’t mean they should be forced to do all the heavy lifting in preparing for the trip. “Help out your planner friend where you can,” Diep advised. “Most of the time, the responsibilities fall on one or two people, and it’s a ton of work. Volunteering to do research or book something goes a long way in saving them time or stress.” In addition to offering help, she also emphasized the importance of acknowledging the main organizers. Consider buying them a thank-you drink to recognize their hard work. “And on the flip side, as an organizer, sometimes you think you have to do it all, and that will lead to stress and exhaustion,” Diep added. “Don’t be afraid to delegate or ask for help! Sometimes it’s not poorly intentioned; others who don’t typically organize or plan trips may not realize how much you have to do, but when asked are willing to help.” “A common mistake made when planning a group trip is not discussing expectations for the trip,” said travel guide Tonia Hope . “There are many important aspects that people planning on going on a group trip don’t discuss before booking and planning that really can worsen the experience.” In addition to budgetary and dietary restrictions, she recommended asking your travel companions what type of travelers they are ― do they prefer lounging by the water and eating at hotel restaurants at an all-inclusive resort, or do they want to explore different neighborhoods and fill the itinerary with lots of activities? Just because someone is a good friend of yours doesn’t mean that you can assume your travel preferences and styles are fully aligned. “Some people may want to indulge in outdoor adventures, while others may want to explore the foodie scene or catch up on rest and relaxation,” noted Nicole Martinez, another co-founder of Let’s Jetty. “Properly setting these expectations ahead of time will allow everyone to plan for these activities together or enjoy on their own terms. Either way, asking this question upfront will allow the group to collaborate on a vacation everyone can enjoy.” “Shared costs are at the heart of most fallouts and arguments during group trips,” said Laura Lindsay, a travel trends expert at Skyscanner. “Forgotten pledges to pay you back later can quickly descend into resentment. It’s best to avoid any issues from the offset.” She recommended having everyone in the group download the same budgeting app before the trip so that people can stay on top of shared expenses in real time. Splitwise is a popular option for keeping track of who paid for what and who owes whom. “An interesting strategy we’ve also heard from our users is, when going out in large groups, put food and alcohol on separate tabs,” Diep shared. “They say it makes it easier to split because typically people are sharing food pretty equally, but how much people drink varies a lot and can be a significant portion of the bill.” “Flexibility is key to accommodating the diverse needs and preferences of group members,” Chen said. “Encourage travelers to remain open to changes in plans or spontaneous opportunities that arise during the trip.” Some of the most memorable travel experiences come from unplanned moments during the less structured parts of the itinerary. Fluidity and adaptability are key to taking advantage of exciting opportunities, rolling with the punches when unexpected changes arise, and enjoying a vacation to the fullest. “Everyone going on a group trip should be open-minded, flexible and willing to compromise,” Diep echoed. “Even with the best planned itineraries, things come up. With a group of people, if everyone’s willing to give and take here and there, usually everyone ends up happy. And sometimes you’ll find that you had a great experience doing something you might not normally have done!” At the end of the day, the most helpful thing you can do on a group trip is to go into it with a positive attitude and teamwork perspective. “Things happen, conflicts can arise, but don’t [let] it ruin a whole trip if they do!” Diep said. “Be direct, have a conversation and talk through it. Remember you’re there to spend time together and have a good time! And most likely, these experiences end up being funny, memorable stories later.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life “Travel dupes.” “Hush trips.” “Slow travel.” The list of buzzy new terms and trends in the travel industry is ever expanding. Lately another new concept is circulating the tourism media-sphere: gig-tripping. As we approach summer 2024 and peak travel season picks up, expect to see more globetrotters reveal themselves as gig-trippers. But what exactly is gig-tripping and how does it work? Below, travel experts break down the benefits and downsides of this trend. “Gig-tripping is a new trend that sees fans planning travel ― often internationally ― around the tour stops of their favorite artists,” said Lisa Chen , CEO of ToursByLocals. “This might be because they can’t get tickets for their home show, to save money, or simply to combine their love of travel and music into one adventure.” Although the concept of traveling around the country or world to see a musical act is hardly new, the gig-tripping experience is different from more familiar iterations ― like the Deadhead subculture of living on the road to watch the Grateful Dead perform as many times as possible. Gig-trippers, by contrast, are typically fans who plan a vacation (or workcation) around one or two concerts in a specific location. “In some cases, it is cheaper to travel to a different location to see a popular artist,” explained Phil Dengler , a co-founder of the travel website The Vacationer. “For example, Taylor Swift tickets are often very expensive in some cities, so you could save hundreds if not thousands of dollars by flying to a city with cheaper prices. I personally flew from Philadelphia to Charleston a few years back to see the Black Keys. Concert prices were much lower in Charleston, and it gave me an excuse to explore the city for a few days.” Summer promises to bring a slew of gig-tripping Swift fans from the U.S. to Europe, as many found better ticket prices and availability in cities like Lyon, France, and Gelsenkirchen, Germany. A 2023 survey from the travel platform GetYourGuide showed that 45% of Americans have been inspired to choose a specific travel destination by an event or experience they heard would be happening there, such as a concert. Recent survey data from Skyscanner also found that 60% of Americans were open to traveling abroad to save money on music events, and 44% of U.S. travelers were willing to fly short haul to see their favorite artists. This interest in music-related tourism is perhaps unsurprising in an age when pop culture travel trends like “set jetting” have taken hold. Chen noted that ToursByLocals has seen a lot of success with tours related to movies or TV shows that were filmed and/or take place in various travel destinations. “Given the popularity of gig-tripping and continued excitement around the Eras tour internationally, we’ve actually recently launched a selection of London for Swifties Tours with Swift-inspired tours to some of London’s best neighborhoods,” she said. “Gig-tripping has a lot of perks,” said Madison Pietrowski, the director of brand for the U.S. at GetYourGuide. “Not only do you get to see your favorite artist live, but you’ll be immersed in a new city, likely a major tourist destination, and get to visit an iconic venue, like the local sports stadium hosting the concert.” Indeed, Gelsenkirchen might not have been on many U.S. travelers’ radars before Taylor Swift announced her European tour dates, but this summer, more Americans will be filling the German football club Schalke 04′s impressive stadium. “The benefits of traveling for a concert are that travelers are expanding their horizons of destinations they’re interested in visiting, whether they’re traveling internationally due to the cost of a domestic show, looking for a specific energy related to the venue or ‘surprise song,’ like we see with Taylor Swift’s Eras tour,” Chen said. “Additionally, travelers are more likely to meet and connect with those with similar interests.” Fans often organize meet-ups, and local businesses plan events around major concerts, so there are opportunities for out-of-towners to maximize the experience. Many gig-trippers also plan unrelated cultural activities, such as guided tours, local restaurant meals, visits to historic sites and even more off-the-beaten-path opportunities. “Gig-tripping is essentially traveling for music concerts, but now we’re seeing people turn these trips into full-fledged vacations to get the biggest bang for their buck,” Pietrowski said. And that’s all on top of the benefit of potentially paying lower prices on concert tickets or getting to see an artist who didn’t schedule a tour stop in your hometown. Despite the excitement and unique opportunities that come with gig-tripping, this approach is not without its challenges. “One of the downsides to gig-tripping can be the large number of visitors the destination can experience during the time of the concerts,” Pietrowski noted. As a result, the costs of accommodations and transportation to the area can skyrocket due to demand. The larger crowds, especially in destinations that aren’t accustomed to as many visitors, can be an issue as well. “If you want to avoid the crowds, search for activities that bring you to major attractions during off-hours, or find small tours or classes with local guides that take you off the beaten path,” Pietrowski suggested. Consider exploring beyond the immediate surroundings of the concert as well. “When there is a rush of travelers to one destination for a specific event, the area can become overpopulated, and the destination as a whole can become overlooked, with travelers missing out on the local culture and history, and instead focusing on the specific event and mainstream tourist attractions,” Chen said. The rise of gig-tripping might also affect unrelated travelers who wanted to visit a specific destination but unknowingly booked their trip during a time when the city would be overrun with an artist’s die-hard fans. And, of course, gig-tripping is not always the best deal for the fans themselves. “The downsides include higher overall costs,” Dengler said. “For example, it does not make sense to save a few hundred dollars on tickets if you are dropping thousands of dollars on the flight and accommodation. Before gig-tripping, take the concert price, airfare price and lodging price into consideration. Do the math to see if it really makes financial sense.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life From “gig-tripping” to “travel dupes” to “hush trips,” the number of new travel trends is seemingly endless. But perhaps the most appealing concept in the tourism space of late is the “sleepcation.” So much of travel these days seems to involve running ourselves ragged trying to hit every amazing attraction we see on TikTok and Instagram. Sleepcations, however, take the polar opposite approach to vacation. But what exactly is a sleepcation and how does it work? Below, travel experts break down the benefits and downsides of sleep tourism. “At its root, it’s really as simple as it sounds: taking a vacation with the intention to get a good night or a few good nights of sleep,” said Tanner Saunders , a senior hotels reporter at The Points Guy. “It can be as simple as checking into a hotel in your own city with a special sleep package that includes enhanced ways to get a great night of sleep ― like a fancy bed, some advanced technology, sound machines or some sleep-enhancing supplements ― or a full-on sleep retreat where you meet with experts who help guide your physical and mental wellness to make sure you leave feeling renewed, refreshed and relaxed.” Although the idea of taking a vacation with the aim of getting quality rest time is nothing new, the number of travelers interested in sleep tourism is growing. According to Skyscanner’s 2024 travel trends report , nearly 50% of American travelers surveyed say they are more mindful about sleep health now compared to a few years ago. The same research showed that “sleeping” topped the list of U.S. travelers’ main activities for their next vacation, outranking shopping, nightlife and wildlife spotting. “While some wellness resorts have been focusing on sleep for years, now more and more resorts and hotels, from luxury to lifestyle and even budget-friendly properties, are making sure that sleep is as the forefront of a stay,” Saunders said. “ For example, many luxury hotels are adding beds that use adaptive technology to enhance and track your sleep while some more budget-friendly options, often associated with a major hotel company, offer in-room meditation apps or sleep sounds.” For example, the Malibu Beach Inn in Southern California features two designated “sleep suites,” and the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai on Hawaii’s Big Island offers an 80-minute “sweet dreams” massage treatment meant to promote a good night’s rest. Virgin Hotels Dallas offers blackout curtains in each room and bedtime amenities like bath bombs and relaxation spray. You can take advantage of all the sleep-related benefits hotels offer by reading up on the amenities, asking a staff member or even downloading the hotel app when available. You might find pillow menus that allow you to choose your preferred level of firmness or guided meditations based around healthy sleep. “A sleepcation typically entails staying in accommodations that offer features such as high-quality bedding, soundproofing, blackout curtains, plus sleep-enhancing amenities like aromatherapy products, meditation aids, soothing bedtime rituals, and specialized menus designed to encourage relaxation and better sleep,” said Anna Pierzak , spa director at Royal Champagne Hotel & Spa in France. From nonalcoholic “mocktails” and herbal teas to satin eye masks and white noise machines, there are endless ways to elevate the sleeping experience. Some hotels even provide bedside dream journals. Although these amenities and services might seem like unnecessary luxuries, the reality is that doing whatever you can to prioritize sleep is quite important. “Most people don’t get the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep per night,” noted Danielle Desir Corbett , an affordable luxury travel and personal finance expert and host of “The Thought Card” podcast. “Over time, this ‘sleep debt’ can have serious health implications, affecting cognitive function, mood, weight, and immune systems. Sleep is even linked to chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Sleepcations focus on rest and rejuvenation and can be a powerful tool in combating health issues.” “You know the common saying of ‘needing a vacation from your vacation’? Well, sleepcations were designed to focus on the well-being of the mind and body over sightseeing and hectic schedules,” noted Michael Bridges, general manager of Virgin Hotels Dallas. The idea is to escape the fast-paced lifestyle, relax your mind and body and leave your vacation feeling rested and refreshed. It’s about self-care and setting boundaries in a time when the lines between work and leisure have become blurry. “Many people take a vacation and plan everything down to the last detail, and then it’s ‘go, go, go,’” said Gregory Day, managing director of Malibu Beach Inn. “A sleepcation is a more intentional vacation where you are prioritizing yourself and your sleep — one of, if not the most, key pillar of health. You may still have the packed itinerary, spa treatments and restaurant reservations, but are coming back to your hotel room to intentionally sleep.” He noted that his hotel even features smart technology-equipped beds that track your length of sleep, amount of restful versus restless sleep, heart rate, breath rate and more. Thus, you can use your trip to gain personalized insights into your sleep health. “If you’ve been sleeping poorly, a sleepcation can break that cycle and set you up for better sleep going forward,” said Dave Grossman , a travel expert and creator of MilesTalk and Your Best Credit Cards. “They are also more cost-effective than a traditional vacation since you aren’t spending on outside activities.” Sleepcations can be as elaborate and expensive or simple and low-cost as you’d like. The concept is truly fluid and flexible. “As a parent of an active and adventurous toddler, I see sleepcations gaining popularity quickly among sleep-deprived parents with young children,” Corbett said. “You can plan them at exotic, off-the-grid locales or DIY by being more intentional. Simple steps like requesting a room away from the elevator or ice machine, packing an eye mask, turning off your alarm, or reducing the brightness on your phone can all contribute to a more restful sleep experience.” You might even go home with new tips and tricks that will help you sleep better in your everyday life as well. “While I’m not an expert on sleep itself, it goes without saying that taking a sleepcation means you leave feeling truly rested — and hopefully with a pathway to stay well rested and energized after sleeping in your own home,” Saunders said. “Taking a sleepcation after a particularly complex or stressful life event can help you reset. Or, on the opposite end, taking a sleepcation without a ‘need’ for it can still be extremely beneficial, relaxing and helpful for your everyday life.” “One thing to consider about taking a sleepcation is that not everything you enjoy during the experience can be replicated at home ― or at least economically,” Saunders said. “Say you end up sleeping in a super fancy bed that lulls you to sleep, controls your body temperature and wakes you up at the exact right moment. That can be a great way to help you sleep great for a night, but something unattainable to the everyday person to bring into their own home. These types of trip can often be very expensive and cost prohibitive to people looking for a more economical experience.” Doctors are skeptical about the long-term benefits of sleepcations as well. “While sleep tourism seems like a decent idea, it’s more of a Band-Aid,” said Dr. Abhinav Singh, a medical review expert at Sleep Foundation and medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center. “Consistent habits of sleep-wake are essential for long-term health benefits.” If you struggle with your sleep heath, you might get more out of a consultation with a doctor or home-based sleep program than a restful vacation. “While a sleepcation may sound tempting due to its undeniable benefits, it may be difficult to pull off,” Corbett said. “Traveling is often associated with exploring and trying new things, which can make it difficult to relax and unwind. Additionally, many vacationers wake up early to avoid crowds and make the most of their time, which can further disrupt their sleep and leave them exhausted.” She added that another sleepcation downside is the fact that you might miss out on certain tourist activities and amenities by prioritizing rest. “I wish more hotels would offer later breakfast buffets so I can sleep in without worrying past 10 a.m.,” Corbett noted. For many, prioritizing sleep might require some extra effort. “While there aren’t inherent downsides, travelers intrigued by this vacation style should be open to adjusting their habits,” Pierzak said. “We suggest forgoing pre-bedtime cocktails and excess stimulation, inviting guests to embrace a distinctive form of rejuvenation that may diverge from their typical vacation experiences.” If fully experiencing a destination and creating lasting memories with loved ones is your ultimate goal, sleep tourism might not be for you either. “Sleepcations may also be better suited for solo travelers who travel independently and don’t have to worry about the pressure of spending time with companions,” Corbett said. “Lastly, many people won’t hop on this travel trend because they won’t see the value of spending their hard-earned money prioritizing sleep while away from home on vacation. However, it’s important to note that any vacation can have sleepcation elements, so it’s easy to tailor to individual needs and travel preferences.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Take a Break is your ultimate guide to the perfect trips to recharge, rediscover yourself and your relationships, and reengage with the world. We’ll cover shopping stops, great bars, restaurants worth your money, photo opportunities, memorable experiences and other important details you need before you book. Thousands of football fans and sports professionals descended on downtown Detroit over the weekend as the city hosted the 2024 NFL Draft. It’s a fitting location: the home of iconic sports franchises, including the Lions, Pistons, Tigers and Red Wings. But Detroit has so much more to offer beyond the world of sports. I recently had the opportunity to spend a long weekend in the Motor City with some friends and was impressed by the diverse cuisine, cool shops and welcoming locals. Although the airport services more than 125 destinations (including 30 international), I’ve found that Detroit is not particularly high on travelers’ lists of American cities to visit. I personally think that should change, and I had the chance to talk to many locals who agree. If you need more convincing, I put together some favorite sites, bites and more. I stayed at The Siren Hotel in downtown Detroit and loved the vintage decor and buzzy atmosphere. It’s a boutique hotel with about 100 rooms and two great bars — including one where you can watch the Detroit People Mover go by as you enjoy a nice cocktail. The other is a pink oasis off the lobby, complete with plush velvet seating and a stunning chandelier. Another popular boutique offering is the Shinola Hotel , which is affiliated with the Detroit-based lifestyle brand of the same name. Naturally, the lobby spaces and rooms are outfitted with Shinola products, from clocks and record players to blankets and candles. Practically everything I ate in Detroit was fantastic, but my favorite meal was at Baobab Fare , a colorful East African restaurant opened by Burundian refugees. Baobab Fare, a 2024 James Beard Award finalist, serves up delicious beef stew, fried fish, slow-roasted goat shank and more. I also had a wonderful meal at a Lebanese spot called Leila and a top-notch sandwich and latte at the multipurpose cafe Trinosophes . I’ve heard great things about Yemen Cafe , Yumvillage and SavannahBlue as well. Sampling some Detroit-style pizza was a must, and my travel companions and I got our fix at Como’s in Ferndale. We also picked up some incredible hummus and other dips from AlTayeb in Dearborn. On the sweet side, I was a big fan of the pastries at Warda Pâtisserie and bite-sized chocolate treats at BonBonBon (shoutout to the local “Bumpy Cake” flavor). Detroit is also known for its “Coney dogs,” served at eateries known as Coney Islands. And although locals told me it’s a tourist trap, I’m still curious to check out Eminem’s restaurant, Mom’s Spaghetti , on a future visit. In addition to enjoying cocktails at The Siren, my group had some excellent rooftop drinks at The Monarch Club at the top of the historic Metropolitan Building. We also visited Ghost Bar, in the historic mansion-turned-restaurant The Whitney (named for its former resident, lumber baron David Whitney). According to lore, the building is one of the most haunted spots in Detroit and offers guided tours. Other bars we enjoyed were Cafe Sous Terre (which is a coffee shop during the day), Bumbo’s and Temple Bar . We had a wonderful time dancing at Spot Lite . A friend also recommended the perfume-themed cocktails at Castalia at Sfumato and Salty Dog, a quirky dive bar shaped like a boat. As for non-alcoholic drinks, we had some great coffee at The Red Hook and Madcap Coffee . There are plenty of activities and experiences to fill a Detroit weekend itinerary. My friends and I spent time strolling the Riverwalk and exploring Belle Isle, which has lovely natural vistas and a small free aquarium that dates back to 1904 and is covered in stunning green tile. Later, we visited the historic Fisher Building and admired the impressive mosaic interiors. I carved out a little solo time to check out the Motown Museum , located in the original “Hitsville U.S.A.” headquarters and recording studio. The guided tour was a special experience in no small part due to my fellow tour-goers, who enthusiastically took in every detail and sang along to the Motown hits that played along the way. A couple of music-lovers even started to tear up at points because they felt so overwhelmed with emotion to be in the place where such important artists recorded iconic songs that endure to this day. When I met back with my group, we shopped around Eastern Market and saw some of the murals in the area. We also went over to Cass Corridor and hit Third Man Records , Shinola and City Bird . As Carhartt is headquartered in the Detroit area, we made sure to pop in at one of the brand stores as well. Being in the Motor City, I felt compelled to visit the Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation . It’s an impressive complex with endless artifacts and information about the history of transportation in the U.S., and it includes Greenfield Village, an outdoor living history museum where visitors can ride around in authentic Model Ts, old steam trains and horse-drawn carriages. I can see why the museum is a popular stop for tourists, especially families traveling with children, but I was curious to see how the museum grapples with its namesake’s antisemitic history . Unfortunately, I did not see any acknowledgment at the museum of this dark reality, though I later found a section on its website (and perhaps I simply did not come across a similar exhibit on the property). Although I wasn’t able to explore The Detroit Institute of Arts , I’ve heard great things about its collection, and on a future visit, I’d be interested to check out The Heidelberg Project as well.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life “Is there a doctor on board?” Those who fly frequently may have heard this question asked at some point on a plane. In-flight medical incidents can range from minor to serious, and sometimes the outcome is fatal. In February, a 41-year-old passenger died after falling ill on an American Airlines flight from the Dominican Republic to North Carolina. Weeks earlier, a 63-year-old experienced a medical emergency and died on a Lufthansa flight from Thailand to Germany. And just this week, a 73-year-old passenger died aboard a Singapore Airlines flight after the plane hit severe turbulence. “A death on board at 35,000 feet is one of the most feared situations for flight attendants, often because it follows a medical emergency, which is already very stressful to manage,” said Jay Robert, a former flight attendant and the founder of the brand A Fly Guy . “When a medical emergency results in death, it can be a very traumatic experience for everyone on board, especially if the passenger is young.” Although these incidents receive much media coverage, in-flight deaths remain relatively rare. A 2013 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that over a period of about three years, there was 1 in-flight medical emergency for every 604 flights, and of the 10,914 afflicted passengers for whom there was follow-up data, 0.3% died. That translates to 36 known deaths in that period, or about one per month, with 30 of those deaths occurring during flight. “The likelihood of facing a death in the sky increases for crew members working on wide-body aircraft on long-haul routes,” Robert said. “There are more passengers, fewer opportunities to divert, and passengers are in a pressurized environment, sitting for extended periods, which often can lead to serious health problems.” So what happens when one of these problems arises and a passenger dies during a commercial flight? Below, Robert and other experts explain the procedures that crew members must follow to handle the situation with sensitivity and professionalism. “Airlines typically develop their procedures in compliance with international aviation regulations and guidelines,” Dr. Paulo Alves, the global medical director of aviation health at MedAire , told HuffPost. He named the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Air Transport Association, or IATA, as two authorities that issue such guidance. “These guidelines provide a framework, but airlines tailor their procedures to fit their specific operational needs and training programs,” Alves said. Although the exact protocols vary from airline to airline, flight crews are typically trained to provide basic life support, notify the pilots and seek assistance from medical professionals. “We have AEDs [automated external defibrillators] on board the planes to use if a passenger goes unconscious and stops breathing, and we’re all trained to do CPR,” said Heather Poole, a flight attendant and the author of “Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads, Crew Drama, and Crazy Passengers at 35,000 Feet.” “We’ll page for a medical professional to help us if we need them,” she said. “And if there’s not one on board, we can contact a physician on the ground.” Airlines use services like MedAire’s MedLink to get guidance from on-call medical professionals during emergencies. IATA guidelines recommend that the crew and any medical professionals on board administer CPR until it becomes unsafe due to turbulence or landing conditions, the passenger has been transferred into the care of emergency services, or the person is believed to be deceased. “Crew members cannot declare if a person has died or not,” Alves said. “But if specific criteria are met ― e.g., the person is not responding and not breathing, CPR has been performed for 30 or more minutes, and AED is used without return of spontaneous circulation ― the person could be presumed dead.” He noted that a medical volunteer on board might also come forward to provide assistance and, in some cases, determine whether a passenger has died. When a medical emergency arises, the crew must notify the captain, who will decide with the airline’s operations center whether to continue to the intended destination or divert to another airport. There are several logistical and humanitarian aspects to weigh during this process. “A death on board does not automatically entail a diversion to another airport,” said Markus Ruediger, the assistant director of corporate communications at IATA. “Diversion to a third country ― neither origin nor destination of the flight ― could add further complexities in repatriating the deceased. Furthermore, airlines are required to inform the relevant authorities of the death on board.” There are specific procedures for securing the deceased person’s body in a way that respects their dignity and shows sensitivity to their travel companions and others on the plane. “To handle the body with dignity and respect while ensuring minimal disruption to other passengers, the crew covers the deceased passenger with a blanket,” Alves said. “Nearby passengers may be moved to other seats if space permits. The body may be moved to a less populated area, such as an empty row, if available. Otherwise, the body is secured in the original seat with the seatbelt fastened to prevent movement during the flight.” He added that the crew wears personal protective equipment to maintain hygiene and safety while handling the body. Protocols might be different for lengthier flights with many more hours remaining. When Robert worked for a major international airline that operated some of the world’s longest flights, the on-board equipment included a kit with a body bag and toe tags. “If the pilots decided to continue to our destination, we would have to prepare the body for storage,” he recalled. “This involved moving the deceased to a private area where the body could be stored flat for the remainder of the journey without other passengers noticing and without obstructing an exit. It was essential to keep the body flat, as postmortem stiffening of muscles would start about two hours after death and the flights could still have a long way to go.” The aircraft that Robert worked on typically had first-class suites with flat beds and privacy doors, which crew members would use if one was vacant. “We were trained to use the onboard wheelchair, which we discreetly wheeled backward through the cabin to move the body to a suitable location,” Robert said. “Once the body was in the body bag, we were trained to zip it only to the neck, as the person wouldn’t be officially declared dead until after the plane landed. We could use a blanket to cover the head out of respect.” For the remainder of the flight, the crew must prepare for what will happen to the body after landing. “Throughout this process, the crew communicates with ground staff at the destination airport to ensure proper handling upon arrival,” Alves noted. When a plane makes an emergency landing due to a medical situation, passengers are advised to remain seated until health professionals board and remove the affected individuals. But the IATA recommends the opposite if the passenger is presumed dead. “Disembark other passengers first and make sure the family members stay with the body,” its guidelines note. “Do not disembark the body until the proper local authority has arrived to take care of the body and that the ground personnel is available to assist the family members.” While flight attendants receive training in basic life support and how to recognize and respond to various medical conditions, they also learn the best ways to offer emotional support during these traumatic situations. “A significant part of our training on death on board was how to break the news to the people traveling with the deceased,” Robert recalled. “We had scripts to follow loosely, and we role-played how to tell someone their travel partner had died. A lot of care goes into this process.” Flight attendants handle the deceased person’s body with awareness of how distressing the situation is for not just their loved ones, but for onlookers as well. They are prepared to talk to and comfort any passengers who may be experiencing emotional difficulty. “A medical emergency is very stressful on crew,” Poole said. “On my last flight from London to New York, a passenger had a seizure during the middle of the dinner service. One minute we were serving meals, and the next minute we were running for oxygen and paging for a doctor. Twenty minutes later, we were back to serving drinks and picking up trash. It can be very overwhelming at times.” Passengers should understand that a medical emergency becomes crew members’ top priority, so service often stops. “I have literally been on the floor trying to keep a passenger alive while other passengers tapped me on the shoulder, asking for drinks,” Robert said. “Additionally, please keep your phones away during these sensitive times. Not everything needs to be filmed and posted on social media. Someone traveling with a person who dies in flight doesn’t need to have the nightmare relived online.” Flight attendants do not need to relive the nightmare either. “We have resources available to us after an emergency situation that helps crew deal with the emotional stress,” Poole noted. Airlines can provide mental health resources like counseling and peer support through MedAire and similar companies. “It’s essential to acknowledge the professionalism and compassion of flight crews in these challenging situations,” Alves said.

    "article_content": "Senior Staff Writer, HuffPost When it comes to travel dressing , it’s nice to pack lightweight fabrics that won’t take up to much space in your luggage. But is there anything more horrifying than reaching your destination and unpacking your carefully chosen clothes only to realize that they are crumpled beyond repair? Hanging them in the hotel bathroom while you take a shower can only do so much. A few years back a friend who happens to be a fashion designer and I jetted off to Spain to celebrate 30 years of best friendship, and I packed a linen jumpsuit to wear the evening of her birthday. Much to my distress, the look was so profoundly rumpled that it was rendered unwearable — that is, until my pal pulled out the handheld steamer she never leaves home without: the Hilife garment steamer . In minutes, the jumpsuit was good as new. Despite being a fairly fastidious person, it had never occurred to me to purchase a handheld garment steamer (I was raised in an ironing board household). But as soon as I got home I ordered my own and I now use it near-weekly and never go out of town without it. With 4.3 out of 5 stars and over 71,000 5-star ratings on Amazon , this hardworking hand-held appliance boasts an enormous fan base, and there are a host of reasons why. One of my favorite features is that it has a nine-foot cord, so I can use it with ease in hotel rooms where outlets are scarce, and in my ancient apartment that was wired in a device-free era. The steamer holds 240 ml of water, which adds up to about 15 minutes of continuous steaming — a must if you have multiple items to work on. It is powerful enough to work on heavy-duty fabrics like wool, but is gentle enough for more delicate summer fabrics, like silk, satin, chiffon, cotton, linen and more. The steamer itself is lightweight, so while it might be hard to give up suitcase space, you don’t have to worry about it adding a ton of overall weight. It also comes with a measuring cup, so you don’t have to take the steamer to the sink to refill it, and two brushes, which can be used on thicker fabrics like wool, flannel and some cotton. In my opinion, you’re unlikely to need them for finer fabrics; I use the steamer without attachments most of the time. Whether you’re headed to a destination wedding this summer , have a business trip on the horizon, or simply need a quick and easy way to keep clothes wrinkle-free, having one of these Hilife steamers handy is a total game-changer. But don’t just take my word for it, check out the reviews below and pick one up for yourself before you hit the road. HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

    "article_content": "Shopping Writer for HuffPost HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Anyone who’s packed for a big trip or trekked through an airport with luggage in tow knows that a good suitcase makes all the difference between a smooth travel experience and one that’s pure chaos. As a fairly frequent traveler, I’ve definitely experienced the latter — and I blame my former clumsy luggage for all my travel woes. Recently, however, I made a suitcase investment that has added a level of convenience to my trips that completely justifies the cost: the Monos suitcase , which is up to 25% off right now. Before I get into how much I adore this worthwhile purchase, know that the entire Monos site is also up to 25% through March 24, with an automatic discount code applied at checkout. (Keep in mind that only certain colors of your selected luggage items offer the full 25% discount.) You can also save an additional $150 when purchasing a three-piece family set, also automatically applied at checkout. This Japanese-inspired travel brand has an inventory stocked with impressive packing goods and accessories, including a sleek little line of hardshell suitcases that range from effortless carry-ons to large checked bags with beautifully organized interiors. I opted for the largest check-in model ahead of a recent trip to New York after the wheels of my old suitcase had completely given out, making it impossible to maneuver. Throughout my entire trip, I regularly thanked myself for this very worthwhile purchase. Because of my bad wheel experience, you’d guess correctly that a suitcase with good, long-lasting wheels able to navigate nearly any terrain was my main requirement when shopping for a replacement. Based on reviews, Monos overwhelmingly ranked at the top in this category, even when up against the more trendy “household name” travel brands like Away and Béis. I could tell right out of the box that these wheels do in fact live up to the online testimonies: they’re slightly oversized, double-sided and incredibly easy to roll, with a thick coating of rubber material that feels legitimately durable. I even took it for a test run on the gravel and uneven sidewalk in front of my apartment and the operation was as smooth as ever. Another decision-confirming factor was how thoughtfully designed the Monos suitcase is. Separating the generous interior is a two-page divider featuring dual layers of organization pockets — a welcome difference from most suitcases I’ve seen, which typically have only a single panel of pockets. One of these layers also offers an extra dose compression in addition to the typical X-strap you find in suitcases. This means I’m able to pack more clothes and more shoes compared to my old bag, while also staying significantly more organized. The bag even comes with two different-sized shoe sleeves! The case’s exterior is equally desirable. Made from an aerospace-grade polycarbonate shell, this suitcase features an integrated TSA-approved lock and a high-grade aluminum telescoping handle that’s sturdy and, in my experience, completely trouble-free. Because I’m a sucker for aesthetics in addition to function, I splurged and grabbed the limited edition banana color in a glossy finish. However, there are 13 colors to choose from, as well as seven different models and sizes to suit everyone’s needs. Monos says in its brand statement that it aims to make luxury-level luggage accessible to more travelers by using the same materials as other high-end manufacturers. So although $355-plus for my large suitcase is objectively a very expensive price for most, it’s certainly less than offerings from other luxury travel retailers . This alone, along with my first-person experience, has truly helped justify my splurge purchase. To any other future travelers out there who are in the market for new luggage, I couldn’t endorse it more. But, in case my word isn’t convincing enough, I won’t be offended if you need to take a peek at some of the promising reviews from real Monos customers that feel the same way as I do. Promising Monos.com reviews: “ Monos is no joke! The quality of my check in luggage is serious quality. I utilize check in luggage a lot. I have traveled around on a 6 country tour previously when my luggage wheels broke on country #2. I instantly became ‘that obnoxious American’ with the noisy check in bag who was lost all the time. From that experience I knew I had to get a higher and better quality luggage set. I got a check in piece from Monos and I do not regret it in the slightest! one of the best decisions I’ve made! I know with this new luggage I will never be put in a similar situation like that ever again. Not only is this design WAY more high end than Away and just stunning overall, it has the quality to boot! Now I will still be a lost American roaming around with gorgeous high quality luggage.” — Tiffany L. “I’m a grown man and this is the first actual piece of luggage I’ve ever bought for myself. My entire life I’ve traveled with hand-me-down suitcases, weekender bags, or various duffles... even when flying overseas. Can I please tell you how dumb I feel for not ever investing in quality luggage before now? Can I also tell you how legitimately impressed I am with this piece that I’m about to immediately pull the trigger on a matching Carry On Pro? “ I compared a ton of other options, from Away (obviously), July, Beis, to a bunch of trendy offerings on IG, to more expensive options like Rimowa. I couldn’t be more thrilled about deciding on Monos. The interior layout and design was really the deal maker for me, but I also wanted something that looked as good as it functioned. For me, Monos hit the perfect balance of everything I was looking for. “I opted for a Stellar White Medium Check-In. The sizing was exactly where I hoped it would be. After receiving it, I feel the Large would be a little too big for my needs. The quality is great, the wheels are super smooth and quiet like all the other reviews mention, and the zippers are solidly smooth. I also picked up a set of four cubes, and a protective cover to help keep scrapes and scuffs down. The cover is frosted clear to let the color show through, but feels thick enough to not get trashed on first use. I highly recommended picking one up if you’re concerned about scuffs. If you’re on the fence like I was, go for it. You won’t be disappointed .” — Adam “The product itself is above & beyond what I expected . I did thorough research comparing Monos to Away, & based on their extensive research into the durability of their product I went with them. Also the fact that sustainability is a part of their mission statement which I appreciate & look out for. There’s no other way to describe the feel of the luggage besides ‘buttery’: that’s how wheeling this gigantic thing feels. It’s so smooth & almost shock-resistant. The inside is super spacious & has lots of pockets & fits a ton of stuff. The outside is gorgeous, I just love the color. “The company itself is also just amazing. The customer service was outstanding; when I chatted online with someone about my fears I wouldn’t receive the product that was showing as out of stock in time for my trip, she assured me that there were two in stock & that I would definitely receive once I made my order. The confirmation that my luggage was ‘claimed’ so to speak was really quick, I think within 3 days of when I made my order. So really great service & attention. Would recommend company & product & will be buying more from this company.” — Nicole S."

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life A couple of years ago, I was invited to attend a friend’s July wedding in his wife’s hometown in northern Italy. As the date approached, I remarked to another friend who was also planning to travel from the U.S. for the celebration that I was glad I had just renewed my passport since it was due to expire in May. She responded cheerfully that she was all set because her passport wouldn’t expire until September. She was mistaken. My friend was not all set because Italy, as part of the Schengen Area of European countries, requires visitors to have a passport that is valid for at least three months beyond the date they intend to depart. Fortunately, she was able to expedite her passport renewal and make it to the wedding, but her situation highlighted a fairly common misconception about international travel. “A lot of us just think we need a valid passport to travel the world beyond our borders, but what many people don’t realize [is] that a current passport alone might not be enough,” said Katy Nastro, a spokesperson for the flight alert service Going . Indeed, many countries require your passport to have a certain duration of validity remaining beyond the intended dates of your trip. The most common lengths are three and six months past the date you fly back to the U.S. “A lot of countries, namely in Asia and the Middle East, require six months’ validity beyond your travel dates ― meaning if you take a trip to Vietnam in July, for example, your passport needs to be valid up until at least January,” Nastro explained. “If you arrive at the airport and try to get on your flight, some airlines won’t even let you board without this very important bit of time, in which case you run the risk of not being able to take your trip.” Each country has a different timeline for passport validity, so international travelers need to familiarize themselves with these policies before booking a trip. “Some may require three months, while others may require six months or even more,” said David Alwadish, the founder and CEO of the passport and visa concierge service ItsEasy.com . “When some countries also require a visa and grant a multiyear paper visa, they may require at least one year or more [of] validity.” The specific requirement depends on a variety of factors, including the country’s immigration policies, bilateral agreements and security risk considerations. “Therefore, it’s crucial for travelers to thoroughly check the entry requirements of the specific country they plan to visit to ensure compliance with passport validity regulations,” Alwadish emphasized. He and Nastro have both observed a lack of understanding around passport validity rules. “It’s common for people to be unaware of the three- or six-month passport validity rule, particularly among those who don’t travel frequently or haven’t encountered it before,” Alwadish said. “The rule may not be consistently enforced across all countries, causing misconceptions among travelers. The complexity of immigration policies, which can change, adds to the challenge of staying informed. Lastly, passport validity requirements may not be well-publicized, leading to lower awareness among travelers.” “These requirements ensure that visitors have a valid passport for the duration of their intended stay, as well as for a buffer period in case of unexpected delays or extensions,” Alwadish explained. You might’ve planned a two-week sojourn in the South of France, for instance, but maybe after a few days you realize that you actually want to stay for two months. Or perhaps something happens that’s out of your control. “This is mainly out of precaution,” Nastro said. “Let’s say you fall seriously ill or have an accident and then need to stay in that country longer than intended. If your passport expires during this unplanned time, it can cause a mountain of issues upon trying to exit the country.” The period of passport validity for international tourists provides an extra cushion in case you sustain an injury that precludes you from flying for a while, or you delay your return for other personal reasons. The point is to account for the fact that plans might change. “Countries set a minimum of three or six months of passport validity for foreign visitors to facilitate efficient immigration procedures, bolster security measures and improve emergency management,” Alwadish said. “This ensures that visitors have a valid travel document throughout their stay and can respond effectively to unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, these requirements promote fairness and reciprocity in visa policies, fostering balanced relationships between countries.” The specific duration varies from country to country, and not every destination has these requirements. “For example, the Mexican government only requires that your passport is valid during the entirety of your trip versus after the trip,” Alwadish said. “For a lot of folks, it’s not an issue since you get 10 years out of a passport,” Nastro said. “When you realize it’s the year your passport expires, however, you actually might be running against a six-month clock depending on where you are traveling to. It makes sense to just go through the renewal process sooner rather than later.” She recommended renewing your passport a year before it’s due to expire so that you know it’s all taken care of early. “With expedited processing and wait times at record lows, you’ll most likely see a new book back sooner than expected,” Nastro added. When it comes to passports and other important travel documents, advanced planning is the name of the game. “While some countries enforce uniform rules for all foreign visitors, others may have different requirements depending on the visitor’s nationality or specific visa agreements,” Alwadish said. “It is so vital that travelers check the entry requirements of their destination country to understand any variations based on nationality.” He recommended reviewing an embassy or consulate website in your home country for the place you want to visit. Most provide detailed information about entry requirements for foreign visitors. You might also consult the State Department’s website or travel advisories from the immigration authority at your destination. Once you have that information, compare your passport expiration date with your planned travel dates. “To cross-reference with the country’s validity rules, start from the day you return and add the number of months required for the validity,” Alwadish said. “The rule is usually three to six months from the day you return, not from the day you leave.” Make sure to check the rules of the airline you’re flying as well, especially if you only have four or five months of validity after the date you return home. “If you don’t have six months of validity starting from the date you return from the trip, the airline has the power to turn you away, whether they’re right or wrong,” Alwadish said. “You should call them and have them put a note in the system regarding this issue so they’re aware of it prior to your arrival at the airport.” Confirm that your passport has sufficient blank pages and is not damaged. If you changed your name recently due to marriage, divorce or another reason, your passport will need to reflect that as well. Don’t forget to see if your destination requires a visa or electronic travel authorization. In the event that an issue arises, there are ways to get your travel documents in a rush , but you can avoid the extra stress and hassle by doing a few extra checks in advance. Then, just relax and enjoy your international vacation.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life There’s been a lot of buzz lately in the travel industry about “gig-tripping,” as fans of Taylor Swift and other musical artists plan vacations all around the world just for the live concert experience. Meanwhile, another experience-driven trend is also on the rise: sports tourism. Whether you’re an athlete yourself or just a big fan, you might want to consider this approach to travel. So what exactly is sports tourism, and what does it involve? Below, industry experts break down the benefits and downsides. “‘Sports tourism’ refers to when individuals plan their travel tied to specific sporting events, typically to spectate but, depending on the event, it could include participation as well,” said Carolyn Addison, the head of product at travel company Black Tomato . “Some of the classic examples are the Olympics and we’ve often seen this type of travel for events like F1 [Formula One racing] or the Tour de France.” Sports tourism can sometimes involve venturing to a different city to watch a regular-season away game for your favorite team. Or you might travel to participate in your own athletic endeavor, like a marathon or team competition. “Sports tourism ranges all the way from youth sports to professional leagues,” said Nate Hardesty, the managing director of the Thompson Austin and Tommie Austin hotels in Texas. “For instance, we see so many families traveling around the country for tournaments that it’s become their spring break or summer trip. The same goes for collegiate and professional sports. We see so many fans follow their teams around the country and take the opportunity to check out the destination while they are here.” If you live in a popular sports market, it might be easier to get good tickets to your team’s away game in another city. Some people also just like to merge their love of travel and sports into one experience. Although taking a trip for a sporting event is not a brand-new phenomenon, more fans seem eager to have these kinds of experiences after being forced to stay at home amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “People have been traveling for sports for years,” Hardesty noted. “However, experiential tourism has skyrocketed post-COVID.” The popularity of shows like “Formula 1: Drive To Survive,” which gives a behind-the-scenes look at the world of auto racing, and “Welcome to Wrexham,” a docuseries about a Welsh soccer team, has also sparked greater interest in professional sports experiences. The sports documentary movement has now expanded to golf with “Full Swing,” as well as to football with “Quarterback.” And with the buzz around the new sports drama “Challengers,” perhaps we’ll see more travelers planning trips around big tennis tournaments. “We find that planning a trip around a sporting event gives a nice framework and intention to an itinerary,” Addison said. “Special events can also be a compelling way to interact with locals in a way that feels spontaneous and unforced.” She pointed to the powerful energy in crowds at big events and the opportunity to bond with people who have similar interests. Sports tourism might take you to an exciting destination you wouldn’t have otherwise visited. “You’re crafting your trip around a pivotal core memory and occasion which is supplemented by other local attractions, creating a comprehensive travel experience,” added Nikki Glass, the general manager at The Sawyer in Sacramento, California. She noted that many sports tourism destinations have made efforts to ramp up various attractions and offerings around sporting events to give fans a multifaceted travel experience. “These travelers tend to stay in their destination for extended periods to immerse themselves in the cultural tapestry and urban milieu, from vibrant dining scenes to museums and green spaces,” Glass said. “Sports tourists are tapping into it all.” “There can be some additional challenges around planning travel during a major event,” Addison said. “Crowds and traffic can make the overall travel experience less enjoyable, and properties often impose higher rates and/or longer minimum stays.” She emphasized the importance of advance planning to secure hotel reservations, airfare and tickets for sporting events. “Sometimes the availability will be tight, and you need to book as soon as you can to get the best available rate,” echoed Lisa Bush, the director of sales and marketing at Thompson Nashville in Tennessee. “The last-minute booker usually learns that procrastination is not the best.” Expect longer wait times and higher costs for things like accommodation and transportation. If you plan a trip based around sports tourism, you might find yourself in overcrowded areas that aren’t always equipped to deal with a surge of people. And you may have to put in extra effort to get an authentic local experience during times when so many tourists have taken over a destination.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Most food lovers agree that when you’re on vacation, one of the perks of staying at a hotel is the free continental breakfast or breakfast buffet included with your visit. On the other hand, one of the biggest setbacks you can have on a vacation is being relegated to the bathroom after you’ve contracted a foodborne illness. And food that’s been sitting out all morning can be at high risk of potential bacteria contamination, so it’s important to know which items are safe to eat — and which you may want to skip. “There are two main factors I think about … that can increase [the] risk of getting foodborne illness,” explained Dr. Ellen Shumaker , director of outreach for the Safe Plates program at North Carolina State University. “[Those are] temperature control of foods [and] … other guests potentially contaminating utensils or food due to lack of handwashing.” A lot of the time you can’t taste the difference when food is contaminated, so it’s key to know what to look out for ahead of time. “There’s a number of different microorganisms [that can contaminate food and] can prove to be pathogenic or produce toxins,” said Dr. Bryan Quoc Le , food scientist and food science consultant. “For example, [with] certain species of E. coli, salmonella or listeria, you only need a couple cells to really cause havoc.” We talked to food safety experts about what they usually avoid at a hotel breakfast — and what they feel comfortable eating and drinking. “Hot foods [should be] staying hot, and cold foods [should be] staying cold,” Shumaker said. “[This helps to] avoid … the temperature danger zone where bacteria like to grow.” When foods are left out in the “danger zone” (between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit) for more than two hours, germs that make you sick can rapidly reproduce, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And in a buffet or continental breakfast setting, food is likely sitting out longer than that. If you see sausage patties, bacon, scrambled eggs, quiches or other meat and egg products sitting out without any heating appliance, you’re going to want to skip those. These types of foods should be kept warm with a device such as a hot plate or chafing dish, Shumaker explained. “This does not give the exact temperature, of course, but is an indicator that measures are being taken to keep food in a safe temperature range,” she said. “If there’s milk that’s been sitting around and it’s not on ice or hasn’t been refrigerated, that’s certainly something that I’m planning on avoiding,” Le said. You’re going to want to make sure perishable items (like yogurt, cheeses and deli meats) are kept cold and stay out of the temperature “danger zone.” Some precut fruits and veggies (like tomatoes, leafy greens and melon) also should be chilled because “when cut, the fleshy part … has the level of moisture and pH to allow bacteria that can cause illness to grow,” according to Shumaker. As for juices, both fresh and pasteurized should be cold. Since fresh juice isn’t pasteurized, it’s at a higher risk for growing harmful bacteria when left out at room temperature. Shelf-stable juice packaged in boxes, bottles or cans don’t need to be refrigerated, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Individually wrapped creamers and butter packets also don’t need to be kept cold. These types of creamers have been treated to kill off bacteria, and the salt in the butter helps it maintain shelf stability, Shumaker explained. While Le generally eats from the salad bar if it looks clean and fresh, he pays attention to signs that the fruits and veggies aren’t being properly handled. For example, if they have soft edges or if there’s any dirt or other material on the surfaces, this could indicate that they’re old or haven’t been thoroughly washed. Melons, like cantaloupes, can be particularly risky because people often don’t wash the rinds, he said. If the rind is damaged and there’s bacteria on it, it can spread to the inside part of the melon. It can also cross-contaminate other fruits or veggies it touches. “Fresh vegetables that are normally picked from the ground, like a lettuce or a cabbage … can pick up dirt quite a bit and then spread that … if they haven’t been washed carefully,” Le added. “Dirt can … start to produce a number of different microorganisms.” Raw sprouts (such as alfalfa or mung bean) should be avoided, Shumaker explained. They’re grown from seeds and beans under warm, humid conditions, which are ideal for the growth of E. coli, salmonella and listeria, according to the FDA . “If just a few harmful bacteria are present in or on the seed, the bacteria can grow to high levels during sprouting.” Sure, that tray of fruit may look appetizing — until you notice there’s no serving utensil for it and people are touching it with their bare hands. If they haven’t washed their hands after using the restroom, coughing or blowing their nose, they could be contaminating the other food on the plate, Shumaker said. When you do use serving utensils or shared condiments that a lot of other people are touching, you want to make sure your hands are clean before picking up the food on your plate. “Other guests may have hands that have not been washed thoroughly after using the restroom or … have been in their mouths for their finger-licking first course,” said Dr. Jonathan Deutsch , professor of culinary arts and science at Drexel University. “I always try to sanitize my hands between making my plate and sitting down to eat.” Norovirus, known as the “stomach bug,” is the most likely culprit to be transferred from unclean hands to utensils and surfaces. “If not cleaned and sanitized, norovirus can persist on surfaces for weeks,” Shumaker said. Making sure food and beverages are served at the appropriate temperature and washing your hands before eating are two of the most important guidelines. There are a few other items experts say are safest to consume. “I’m going to trust [packaged foods, like muffins or individual yogurts] more just because there’s a lot of processes that are involved to make sure that [they] are kept safe,” Le said. “[And] no one’s touching them or handling them.” Deutsch said whole fruits that haven’t been cut (like bananas or oranges), cooked-to-order options like omelets, and cereal in a dispenser (wash your hands after touching the handle) are also usually safe bets, particularly if you’re immunocompromised. For people who are at a higher risk of food poisoning (weakened immune system, pregnant, aged 65 and older, or younger than 5), they should especially be aware of options that are safer to eat and what to avoid. While anyone can get food poisoning, individuals in these groups could get severely sick from it, according to the CDC . Besides the above safety guidelines, you can also check out inspection reports for restaurants and hotels. (They are usually publicly available in the United States and many other countries, according to Deutsch.) And when you’re eating out at a restaurant or hotel, “don’t be afraid to ask questions regarding how food has been handled,” Deutsch said. “And follow your gut — if you see something that’s questionable or if you have a health condition that makes you particularly vulnerable, pack some protein bars.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life When you get a new job, you might be one of the 30 million Americans who also signed a noncompete agreement. A noncompete agreement stops you from going to work for a competitor or from starting up a competing business of your own, typically within a geographic zone and a set period of time after you leave a job. You may not realize the consequences of what you signed until you try to leave for a new job. In January 2023, the Federal Trade Commission proposed a comprehensive noncompete ban and opened their proposal to public comment. Thousands of responses poured in from professionals who shared stories of how these noncompetes forced them to stay in jobs with toxic working conditions, to uproot their families, and to stop serving their patients and clients. As one Appalachia-based physician put it in their comment: “Providers with aggressive noncompetes must abandon the community that they serve if they chose to leave their employer. Healthcare providers feel trapped.” From doctors and janitors to sandwich makers and yoga instructors , noncompetes have become one of the main tools employers across industries can use to control what kind of job an employee can take next. They are not usually negotiable if you’re a new hire who wants to keep your job. Or as one car power-washer explained in their public FTC comment: “My boss said that if I didn’t sign before the end of the week, not to come in the next week ... I’d like to start my own business but I would have to find another job and wait five years.” The FTC estimates that one in five Americans are under these restrictive employment agreements right now. But no more, according to the FTC. On Tuesday, the federal agency set a historic precedent and banned noncompete agreements nationwide in a 3-2 vote, saying that they are an “ unfair method of competition ” and therefore in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC cited research about how noncompetes suppress wages, and estimated that its noncompete ban would raise workers’ wages between $400 billion and $488 billion over the next decade. “It’s clear the freedom to leave your job and take another job is fundamental to a free and fair economy,” said FTC commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter in her Tuesday presentation on the rule. “The final rule bans new noncompetes with all workers, including senior executives after the effective date,” according to the FTC’s fact sheet on its rule. In other words, there is no salary threshold and independent contractors are covered by this ban, too. However, if you’re a nonprofit employee, you would not be covered by this rule, because the FTC only covers the private sector, said Daryl Leon , a New York-based noncompete, trade secret and employment law litigator at BakerHostetler. There is also an exception for noncompetes that are made when a business is sold. And what if you already have a noncompete? Under the rule, existing noncompetes are also no longer enforceable after it goes into effect and your employer must give you “clear and conspicuous” notice of this fact, according to the FTC. In its final ruling, the agency outlined a scenario where a former employer would individually text, email, or mail a notice to past workers about their rights with language like: “A new rule enforced by the Federal Trade Commission makes it unlawful for us to enforce a noncompete clause.” However, existing noncompetes remain in effect for senior executives because the FTC said this group is less likely to be exploited by them. The FTC defined a senior executive as someone who makes more than $151,164 annually and is in a “policy-making position.” In the final ruling, the FTC said the ban would be effective starting 120 days after the rule gets published in the federal register. In other words, by mid-August under the best of circumstances. But the FTC rule is also likely to face significant legal challenges from firms and trade groups seeking an immediate stay of the ban’s implementation. Leon said that more than likely a nationwide injunction will be issued by a district court, and then that would go through the appellate courts, and potentially all the way up to the Supreme Court. “There is very little chance, it seems, that this rule in its current form will ever go into effect without the Supreme Court blessing,” Leon said. Businesses typically say that they need noncompetes to protect trade secrets and customer relationships, as well as their investments in worker training. In its public comment to the FTC against the ban, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest business lobby, said noncompetes were needed to reduce “free-riding,” and that nondisclosure agreements and trade secret suits were not enough protection for “vital procompetitive business and individual interests.” The Chamber of Commerce said Tuesday that the rule “sets a dangerous precedent for government micromanagement of business” and that it plans to sue the FTC over the rule. Even without noncompete bans, employers still have other tactics to stop you from quitting, according to Reid Skibell , a New York-based civil litigator at Glenn Agre Bergman & Fuentes who counsels professionals on breaches of noncompetes. If noncompetes become unavailable, Skibell said he expects more “golden handcuffs” tactics to be more widely used on senior employees. He cited the common practice of employers delaying bonuses until the first quarter of the following year to deter employees from leaving, and loans that are only forgiven over a certain time that an employee remains employed. Skibell said he also expected major employers to rely more on confidentiality restrictions and nonsolicitation bans to retain lower-level employees. And if you want a glimpse of the future, look at California, a state that has already banned noncompetes, said Orly Lobel , the director of the Center for Employment and Labor Policy at University of San Diego. In California, banning noncompetes helped to bring entrepreneurship and venture capital investment to the region, she said. That’s because the power dynamic between a boss and employee shifts when noncompetes are no longer on the table. Employers “learn to use carrots rather than sticks to secure retention,” Lobel said, citing incentives such as stock options and greater company innovation to get employees to stay in California. Without noncompetes, employees have more leverage to leave toxic jobs, too. Take it from a bartender, whose story was highlighted in the FTC final rule. This bartender said they were being sexually harassed at their old bar, so they took a job at a competing bar with better wages and conditions, even though it violated their two-year noncompete agreement. “I took the new job, thinking our legal system wouldn’t allow a massive company with over 20 locations to sue a young entry-level worker with no degree. In December 2021, I was sued for $30,000,” the bartender wrote . Fighting a noncompete in courts can result in costly litigation fees, said Basel Musharbash , a Texas-based antitrust lawyer who has defended employees against noncompetes. He said that the less wealthy and less expert that an employee is, the more likely it becomes that they cannot defend themselves against the enforcement of a noncompete. “We currently have a system that lets employers basically write noncompetes, regardless of whether they’re legal or not, and then just intimidate and bully employees into submission to their terms. And that ends with this rule,” Musharbash said. He noted that the FTC rule will hopefully deter lawyers from adding noncompetes into new employment contracts. And in the meantime, employees can use the FTC rule against noncompetes to negotiate their way out of one. Until it goes into effect, Leon said that the FTC’s rule does not change workers’ conditions right now legally, but it could still be a way for employees to advocate on their own behalf. “When they are leaving employment or thinking of leaving employment, it’s ... more ammunition that they have available to them to try and say, ‘If I have a noncompete, employer, you should waive it, or you should not enforce it against me,’” he said.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life When you turn the big “3-0,” you are going to hear many unsolicited messages about what you should have accomplished by now. Whether or not you ask for it, you’ll hear advice and admonishment from friends, families and pop culture about what this next decade should look like. And if you were a young millennial in the early 2000s, you likely got one of these messages of what a thirtysomething could and should be from the popular film “13 Going on 30.” In the 2004 romantic comedy, 13-year-old Jenna Rink (Christa B. Allen) makes a desperate wish to jump past the humiliation of puberty and be “30 and flirty and thriving,” which has now become the movie’s most famous line. Jenna gets what she asked for, although nothing turns out quite like she expected. Jenna wakes up and suddenly she is 30, as portrayed by Jennifer Garner. This older Jenna has all the status markers of thirtysomething success that young Jenna wanted. She lives in a luxury apartment filled with designer shoes and clothes, she has a “big-time magazine” job, is on a first-name basis with Madonna and has a buff boyfriend who’s a professional hockey player. But she also happens to be a “pretentious, conniving snake,” as one disgruntled colleague puts it. She is passing off a secretary’s idea as her own after firing her. She ignores professional boundaries and is having an affair with her co-worker’s husband in her office. Jenna’s ambition has made her well-known in her industry but a stranger to those her knew her growing up. As Jenna learns in the movie, you can be 30 and still be a hot mess. Her journey in the film is learning that the success you might end up treasuring the most is something that will not show up on a résumé. (In Jenna’s case, it’s regaining the relationship with her childhood best friend, Matty, as portrayed by Mark Ruffalo.) Although the movie is now 20 years old, “13 Going on 30” depicted a very real pressure to understand yourself by a certain date that is still relevant. Jenna strongly believes her teen angst will end when she turns 30 because society is telling her that’s when she should be “thriving.” And that’s a common belief young people still hold, said Kayleen Schaefer, a journalist and the author of “ But You’re Still So Young: How Thirtysomethings Are Redefining Adulthood .” “I absolutely had the misconception, as Jenna does in the movie, that you hit your 30s and everything is figured out,” Schaefer said. “And your life is settled, and the hard stuff is over. And that is a lie.” In this way, the milestone of 30 still carries a heavy weight, especially if you are dissatisfied about what you have yet to do with your life. “There is this idea of taking your 20s to find yourself. But ... I think when you hit 30, you kind of are like, ‘Oh, OK, this is the decade where it gets serious and where I need to figure out my adulthood,’” Schaefer said. “But the thing is, adulthood doesn’t look the same for anybody.” For Schaefer’s book research, she found that 1950s sociologists had a checklist for what adulthood should entail: finish school, leave home, make your own money, marry and become a parent. Back then, you needed all five markers of success to be a real adult. And even though what’s on that cookie-cutter checklist has undoubtedly changed, many young people still have one. “I certainly had that belief that when I was in my 30s, I would just check all these things off, and I was really rocked when it didn’t work out like that because you actually have to go after these things,” Schaefer said about the checklist. “We have a lot of agency, which is amazing, but it’s also really hard.” In this way, it’s interesting how “13 Going on 30” depicted Jenna being unmarried, child-free and career-driven ― and a professional success as a result. Schaefer said it’s an example of how the 2004 film shows a shifting on-screen idea of what society expects from people in their 30s. So, yes, this can be a decade of transformation. But ultimately it helps to put your life in perspective. Each of us has our own path but no roadmap to consult. Schaefer gave the example of starting a new career in your 30s or making the decision to not have children as milestones you can give yourself. “Some people are in early stages of their careers. Some people are in late stages of their career, some people have two kids, some people are still deciding if they want to have kids or not,” she said. “Life isn’t just a straight line anymore.” “I absolutely had the misconception, as Jenna does in the movie, that you hit your 30s and everything is figured out.” Take what happens to Jenna. Once she realizes all the people “older Jenna” has betrayed, she returns to her parents’ home in need of comfort. The background music swells. Billy Joel croons “You’re so ambitious for a juvenile / But then if you’re so smart tell me / Why are you still so afraid?” Jenna is at her lowest, loneliest point. She climbs into her mom’s bed and apologizes for not visiting at Christmas. Her mom gives Jenna the pep talk she needs to keep going, and Jenna returns to New York City to make amends. Jenna discovers that these relationships ― not her résumé ― are what she values. Nurturing and investing in these acquaintances and friendships can actually end up creating the most meaningful memories of all. Indeed, the big lesson of “13 Going on 30” is that those personal connections can be what saves you from going down a lonelier, harder path. That can look like befriending your young neighbor who lives down the hall and learning her name. Or it can involve thanking your secretary and promoting her ideas. Or sometimes it’s simply sharing red Razzles with your old friend. “We need to remember what used to be good. If we don’t, we won’t recognize it even if it hits us between the eyes,” Jenna declares to her magazine colleagues as she pitches a redesign, to applause. They are taking her more seriously as someone to respect and admire, and so is Jenna. Ultimately, turning 30 has as much power as you give it. This decade will likely take you on a journey you did not intend to make, and that uncertainty can fill you with anxiety or excitement. It just depends on what you wish, as Jenna would tell you.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Since she got laid off from her job in December, Donna Kopman, 57, has sent out over 300 job applications. From Sunday through Tuesday, the Lake Oswego, Oregon, resident spends eight hours a day at her computer applying for jobs. The rest of the week, she focuses on researching jobs she will submit applications for the following week. So far, she has gotten only one job interview with a recruiter. “It’s really frustrating,” Kopman said. “I’m not trying to shoot for the moon at this point in my career. I just would like gainful employment until I retire.” Before her layoff, Kopman was a sales operation manager at software company Milestone Systems. She had two decades of sales experience and made $110,000 at her last job. Now she is applying for jobs that earn $60,000 and has broadened her search to include administrative or contract work, in order to get affordable health insurance. Kopman said she regularly experiences highs and lows with her job search. First, she will get excited by a job and spend hours crafting a personalized application based on how the role aligns with her direct experience. Then, she will have those hopes dashed by an automated rejection 24 hours later. “It’s like, did anybody even look at my résumé?” she said. That’s when Kopman questions: “Well, is it ageism?” Kopman is right to be concerned. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act protects U.S. workers who are 40 and older from being discriminated against on the basis of age, but the odds are stacked against older job seekers. If you’re over 50, you are more likely to lose ― or be pushed out of ― your job. Once this happens, it takes much longer for older job seekers than their younger counterparts to land a job again, let alone a job that pays them what they are used to earning. In fact, half of people in their 50s are laid off at least once and only 1 in 10 of these workers will ever again earn as much as they did before this setback, according to a 2018 data analysis by ProPublica and the Urban Institute of the Health and Retirement Study. One major reason it’s so hard to get rehired? Because of machines that rank an older job seeker’s job application. When older workers apply for a job, they often get rejected by automatic tracking systems that can sort out their résumé based on dates used and skills that they do not list, said Carl Van Horn, a public policy professor and director of the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. He gave the example of digital skills not being listed, even though they can be easily taught. Employers “make this assumption and say, ‘Well, they probably don’t know how to do X, Y, and Z.’ Now, of course, on the other side, what we know is that [those] people have been successful in the labor market for a long time. They’re probably good workers,” he said. “But it flies against some people’s attitude about older people and what they can and can’t do.” And as more employers adopt generative artificial intelligence into their workflow, Van Horn said he expects older job seekers to face potentially more rejections. The common advice you’ll get as an older job seeker? Hide any suggestion of your mature age. That’s because hiring managers can make instant judgments based on what you share. In one experimental study , economist Joanna Lahey sent out 8,000 fake résumés of candidates to hiring managers and tracked what they looked at with an eye-scanning lab. Hiring managers’ eyes were pausing at years of employment history and the year candidates got their education, and ultimately spent more time scanning the résumés of younger candidates. Kopman said she no longer bothers applying to jobs that ask for a graduation date in their online applications. Nina, a 55-year-old Allentown, Pennsylvania-based job seeker, said she keeps her 1987 college graduation date off her résumé and, when possible, she avoids including the years she worked at past jobs. Nina, who asked to be identified by her first name since she is currently employed, said she also purposefully colors her hair for interviews. “I want to go gray so bad, but like our society, they just write you off as invisible anyway, so I’m still coloring my hair,” she said. On top of these appearance biases, some employers still hold ageist beliefs that older employees are “too stuck” in their ways and that they will not adapt to new business needs, Nina said. To fight against the assumption that older workers are unfamiliar with technology, Nina posts her LinkedIn and Instagram information on her résumé to show she is up to date on social media. Kopman is aware of how her long-term unemployment is eating into her savings. She has not taken a break since her layoff. Her unemployment insurance will expire in November. She is currently paying $900 a month to retain her health insurance from her past job through COBRA. “I’d love to take advantage of this opportunity of not working to enjoy myself and do things. But you can’t psychologically allow yourself to do that, because you have no idea what your next real paycheck is going to be,” she said. To stay positive, Kopman said she takes walks. People keep working and looking for work into their 50s through their 80s both because they want to and because they have to, for their budgets. If you were born between 1943 and 1954 in America, you will not get full retirement benefits until you turn 66. And many older workers do not have enough saved up to retire comfortably. About 43% of people between 55 and 64 do not even have a retirement savings account, according to a 2022 survey of consumer finances from the Federal Reserve. Washington, D.C.-based Elizabeth White, who is now 70, is the author of “ 55, Underemployed, and Faking Normal: Your Guide to a Better Life ,” which is based on her experiences looking for work. After losing consulting jobs amid the 2008 Great Recession, White said she faced challenges with re-entering the job market, despite her advanced degrees and accomplished employment history. To make ends meet, she got a roommate and started taking a Greyhound bus at times for job interviews in New York, among other cost-cutting measures. “It was humbling to have the kind of background that I have and to have this whole thing [happen]. I felt like I had stepped on a banana peel,” she said. And she’s not alone with experiencing financial insecurity as an older adult. White said a lot of older workers will eventually give up searching for the types of jobs they once had and start looking for what she calls “a casserole of work.” “So they might [get] a little bit of Social Security, they might rent out a room in their place on Airbnb ... that older guy you see at Trader Joe’s bagging groceries is probably not there because he wants to be,” she said, as an example of what this series of money-making opportunities might entail. So if you’re an older job seeker, it helps to “get off your throne” and be open to changes and pivots, White said: “Sometimes you have to ... go back a couple of steps before you can go forward.” Mark Gyurina , chief program officer for job training nonprofit Operation ABLE, said a common challenge people in their 50s and 60s face is the reality of being single or widowed and needing to get back to work to support themselves. Darla Jelley is a 57-year-old single mom of a 17-year-old teenager who lives in Boston. Now that her daughter is almost an adult, Jelley wants to re-enter the workforce full time after taking part-time jobs doing eldercare. In April, she graduated from Operation ABLE’s 12-week job training program for older job seekers who meet federal low-income guidelines and are interested in working for medical offices. Jelley said the program taught her computer skills like how to craft a résumé and how to use Excel and PowerPoint. But more important than teaching her how to save files, the program boosted her confidence, Jelley said. Before the program, Jelley didn’t have much contact with the outside world except for her home-care clients. “I didn’t think I had anything to offer,” Jelley said about her skills. Studying to become a nurse has always been Jelley’s dream that she has not been able to afford doing. But through Operation ABLE, she has a few interviews lined up to be a hospital front office coordinator and a pharmacy technician that have tuition reimbursement programs. Recruiters came to her classes, which gave participants “a foot in the door for interviews,” Jelley said. Jelley said she once used to view her goal of becoming a nurse at 61 as “crazy.” But after her job training, “I don’t consider that at all. Like, I would do it in a heartbeat,” Jelley said. “People over 50 are not ready to be put out to pasture.” Even talking with fellow older job seekers can be a much-needed balm. When Greg Bailey lost his job at 56 in 2020, he joined an online job search support program called Who Ya Know four months into his search. He said ageism was one of the most common shared issues people talked about. “That was a huge lifesaver for me, because it does get very painful, it gets very lonely, especially when you’re not interacting with other people,” Bailey said. “The things that I was feeling, they were feeling too.” Bailey has since found a new sales job. Research finds that once you have been out of work for more than six months , it gets significantly harder at any age to find a job, but particularly for older job seekers. That’s why it’s critical for older job candidates to network to get past long-term unemployment biases on top of ageism. “Emailing résumés is not going to get you employed, you really have to be out there in the community,” Gyurina advised older job seekers. He said older job candidates should network extensively through internships, volunteering and part-time work to avoid résumé gaps and build references, and that they should take advantage of help that family or neighbors offer. You never know who might lead you to your next job opportunity, so make time to invest in your relationships. “I often find that people in their 30s and 40s are much more knowledgeable about where the jobs are, who are the rising stars, where’s the money, where are the opportunities,” White said. “I’m applying for something now that I would not have heard of, but somebody told me about it.” White gave a past career success as an example. She said she got into an entrepreneurial incubator, because someone in their 40s who was already in the incubator and had worked with her years ago, told her, “Oh, this would be a good opportunity for you.” If you’re not finding success with getting a regular 9-to-5 job, it might be time to forge your own path. White, who is now the founder of NUUage Coliving , which seeks shared affordable housing solutions for older adults, also pointed to entrepreneurship as a growing alternative path older job seekers can take. She cited 2019 research from the job nonprofit Kauffman Foundation, which found that more than 25% of new entrepreneurs were ages 55-64 ― a number up from about 15% in 1996. Ultimately, older employees are an asset to any company. Research backs up that older workers are less likely to quit and are more likely to have higher performance ratings than younger colleagues. And at their best, multigenerational teams can share their unique knowledge, networks and experiences for better ideas. But more hiring managers need to believe in this, too. Until then, don’t count out people just because of their age, older job seekers implore. “At this stage of the game, I have no kids at home,” Nina said. “I don’t have to be home at 5. I can stay late, I can come in on the weekends, I’m not running out to drive anybody anywhere. To me, it seems like a no-brainer, like, ‘Give me this job.’” Nina said losing out to job candidates who are 20 years younger than her can make her feel self-doubt, but ultimately, “It’s your age, and ... it’s their loss.“ Nina is currently the oldest person at her video production job, and when she started, she believed she got “OK grandma” vibes from certain younger colleagues who avoided interacting with her. But the teammates who did take the time to know her now “lean on me for everything.” “You’ve got to be a trailblazer at a certain point,” Nina said. So don’t be ashamed of highlighting the skills and experiences your long career has given you. In the eyes of the right employer, it’s what will make you stand out. In his job interviews, Bailey highlighted the fact that “I don’t have to learn those things; I already know them.“ Or as Kopman puts it: “People over 50 are not ready to be put out to pasture. We have so much experience and personal learnings to be shared with colleagues who are new to the workforce.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life When you’re a middle manager, the pressure comes from all sides. You’re going to be held accountable for carrying out executives’ marching orders, but unlike senior leaders, you’re the one who has to directly sell leadership’s vision to your team. “Middle managers often have limited authority, yet they are held accountable for achieving results,” said Jenny Fernandez , an executive and leadership consultant. “This creates a feeling of being trapped between conflicting demands.” In toxic situations, middle managers become the buffer between bad management and frustrated, anxious employees. “They are tasked with managing up and are responsible for delivering business goals that may be unrealistic due to external factors” like economic downturns and intense competition, as well as internal challenges like hiring freezes, budget cuts or reorganizations, Fernandez said. Autumn Maison said that she experienced these types of demands firsthand as a middle manager at a major tech company. Maison recalled that during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, she felt a pressure to make sure her direct reports were productive at a difficult time, while also managing up the expectations from leadership. “I was getting increasingly frustrated, because it felt like every step that I was taking in every single decision I was making was the wrong one,” she said. “It was always this endless sort of building of frustration and angst, because it felt like I was just constantly letting people down.” Eventually, Maison hit her limit and said she became completely exhausted. She took six weeks of medical leave from work for her anxiety. “The tension I had been holding on to and all the adrenaline that had been keeping me through that period, it all hit at one time,” she recalled. “I was so depleted from that period.” Research has shown that middle managers are the type of employees most at risk of experiencing job burnout . Gallup survey results from 2021 found that managers were more likely to report higher levels of burnout and stress compared with direct reports. Psychologist and executive coach Lauren Appio said that middle manager burnout can show up as irritability, restlessness, a preoccupation with work, feelings of failure or ineffectiveness, difficulties with focus and concentration, or increased substance misuse. “They may find themselves with a fancier title and bigger scope of responsibilities, but without the resources or influence to do their job well,” Appio said about why middle managers have such a tough role. Jocelyn Lai , the global head of talent acquisition at Duolingo, identifies as a middle manager. According to Lai, what can make middle management taxing is how you become the “secret-keeper” for your team. “That burden is on me, all the positives and all the negatives,” she said. “I have to figure out, what do I share and what do I not share with upper management?” As a middle manager, you have to balance the needs of your team with what upper management wants, and this can be challenging. In fact, an increasing number of younger middle managers say that these duties are too much to handle. Approximately 71% of middle managers say they “sometimes” or “always” feel overwhelmed, stressed or burned out at work ― and that number spiked to 75% for millennial and other middle managers under 35, according to a 2023 survey by productivity software company Capterra with responses from more than 300 middle managers in Australia, Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. According to Maison, something that can exacerbate burnout is how many middle managers are part of the “sandwich” generation ― a term used to describe the financial and emotional challenges of supporting both aging parents and young children. “Just as they are coming into more responsibilities at work, they may also be experiencing increasing or changing responsibilities outside of work, like parenting or caring for aging family members,” Appio said. “It’s a lot of pressure all around.” At the time of her middle manager burnout, Maison was taking care of her hospitalized father and two children, who needed her to show up and be present for them on top of dealing with her work demands. She described that time period as a “sandwich squeeze” from both her job and her personal life. “It felt like I was just constantly letting people down.” Another thing that can be emotionally tough for middle managers is how teams expect more from them nowadays. As employees, we need them to help manage our careers, but more of us also want them to know what we are feeling and thinking ― and we want to know what they feel and think, too. “Modern middle managers face new challenges in managing diverse teams,” Fernandez said. “With four to five generations now in the workforce, conflicts and disagreements arise due to differing expectations, values and work styles.” Lai said that with younger, Generation Z colleagues who want more vulnerability, she will share glimpses of her personal life, but she’s learned that she does not have to “open the whole window.” Lai lays out explicit boundaries around what she does on the weekend, with language like “I really value my privacy in life, but I appreciate you asking.” She noted, “That boundary, I think just showing them what it is, is an act of vulnerability.” And when it comes to interpreting leadership’s decisions, Lai said it helps to be upfront that you are not an expert on everything. Lai said that she’s learned to be transparent with her team about when she does not agree with upper management’s decisions. Saying “here’s what I think,” “here’s what we’re doing as a company,” or “I don’t know why we’re doing it this way, but I’m going to find out the answer for you” is how she’ll frame the discussion, Lai added. “What I’ve learned is, if I say [that] I don’t agree with a certain aspect of it but I’m still committing to standing behind the company, it actually strengthens the message,” Lai said. As a middle manager, your well-being should be a top priority. “I have to first take care of myself to be then able to work through it with everyone else,” Lai said. She added that it helps to talk with other middle managers within your company who might have the “missing puzzle piece that [you’ve] been trying to figure out.” To prevent burnout, it also helps to understand the extent and limits of your power as a middle manager, Appio said. “You can be influential, but you cannot actually control other people’s behavior — your team members’ or your leaders’,” she said. “Therapy and coaching can be helpful with recognizing and tolerating this.” In some cases, it can help to ask executives to meet with your team and explain their decisions, said organizational psychologist Laura Gallaher of the consulting business Gallaher Edge . That way, “you can all work to get on the same page, and you have less weight on your shoulders to play the ‘middle person,’” she said. “This is especially useful for very critical changes, or changes that create a sense of loss for your teams.” And make sure to use the support that your company offers. Maison said she had a supportive workplace that allowed her to have the time off that she needed. She advised middle managers to take advantage of company-sponsored mental health benefits or ones that you’re entitled to in your state. Also, it helps to know that middle management is not for everyone. Quitting is a perfectly fine option, too. Maison, now a New York City-based tech consultant, said that during her disability leave, she realized that her situation was untenable and resigned. “The environment that I was in was causing the anxiety, and going back into that environment would have led me to the exact same place of burnout,” she said. Maison said that her middle management burnout completely recalibrated her expectations for what she wanted from her life and career. She said she is now much more fulfilled as an individual contributor, because this role allows for more flexibility in her schedule and ownership over her time. “I thought that as a very driven person, that the path for me was very linear and that path was an upward line. But it doesn’t look like that to me anymore,” she said. “It looks like, ‘How does work fit into my life?’ not just, ‘How does my life revolve around work?’” People in other positions should be conscious of middle managers’ well-being, too. Although it can sometimes be a thankless job, middle managers are still necessary for any company. They deserve a shoutout for their hard work. A little gratitude and grace can count for a lot. Lai said that she still remembers a direct report who actively thanked her. That’s because middle managers’ jobs are both tough and rewarding under the best of circumstances. The “most effective middle managers are the systems thinkers,” Lai said. “They’re the ones who understand how this impacts five people over here, or how one person’s unhappiness could trickle into other things.” Lai said that most leaders in senior roles care about people, but middle managers are the ones who express that care and make people feel cared for. This involves “checking in with someone and having a conversation, [asking] them how their day is going. And that goes a long way,” Lai said. “I truly believe that that actually then makes the work more motivating. ...

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Are you a “pleasure to work with”? That could be why you’re not getting ahead at work ― even if you’re good at your job ― according to one viral TikTok. In the video , a TikToker named Jacqueline claims that people who are “a pleasure to work with” will “never get promoted” because executives “will never allow an employee who is both good at doing the work and good at keeping a smile on their face while doing the work move up the ladder, because they know they can keep serving you shit on a platter, and you’ll eat it with a smile.” but if I take a week off everything falls apart? it ain’t adding up Her theory about the “curse” of being too pleasant has sparked a nerve. The video has been viewed more than 8 million times. But is it backed up by research? Are agreeable people more likely to be exploited and fall behind at work? It depends, experts say. In response to the TikTok, commenters to her video said that what Jacqueline was describing actually has a name: “ performance punishment .” Similar to a “ quiet promotion ,” it’s where you get more work dumped on you for being a high-achiever, but you do not get the rewards of a raise or a promotion. In this case, hardworking agreeable colleagues take on work that consistently goes above and beyond their job title. Cynthia Pong, founder of Embrace Change , a career coaching and training firm, said a performance punishment mindset in organizations “does exist and can even run rampant.” “There absolutely is a perverse incentive there for leaders who would prefer that person to stay in the role where the high achiever is extremely competent, reliable and pleasant,” she said, noting that it can be due to the manager worrying if the workload is going to be done or done “with a smile” if other people do it instead. Lois P. Frankel, executive coach and author of “ Nice Girls Don’t Get the Corner Office: Unconscious Mistakes Women Make That Sabotage Their Careers ,” said there is a “kernel of truth” to the TikToker’s theory because being nice is “simply not sufficient for upward mobility. “Being nice and good at your job are ... just table stakes. You’ll most likely get to stay in the game, but you won’t win it,” Frankel said. She noted that it’s often women who face a social stereotype to be “nice,” which can backfire in the office: “You can’t be the nice little girl you were taught to be in childhood and expect to achieve your adult goals.” In this way, if your niceness is making you too agreeable to what other co-workers demand, it’s a problem. There’s a key tipping point when your agreeable nature is leading you to become a pushover at work. Pong said if the following is true, you might be one: One way to break out of the pushover cycle is to set boundaries that will help you prioritize your own career needs. “Before you say ‘yes’ to tasks, events, and even conversations at work, pause and take a few minutes to reply,” advised career strategist Ana Goehner said. “If the task will not help you become more visible, learn new skills, challenge you, or add to your career, then politely say no.” But once you turn down a request, you need to show your value in other ways. “Look for opportunities to not simply do your job but add value by questioning less effective ways of doing things, and proposing new ways that would save or make your company money,” Frankel advised. “Now you’re not just nice, you’re also strategic.” Frankel said to actively volunteer for high-profile assignments, even if these bigger bets could fail: “You’re either going to be seen as a hero if you succeed, or brave if things don’t quite turn out the way you hoped.” Pong said it also helps to get the help of a public-facing sponsor who can back you up and help you get promoted if you’re meeting resistance. If you are too agreeable, you may become the pushover your colleagues exploit to further their own careers. But simply bulldozing your way up the ranks with your unpleasant, brash demeanor is not a good career strategy, either. In his 2020 study , Cameron Anderson, a professor of organizational behavior at the Haas School of Business at University of California, Berkeley, measured college and graduate students’ selfish, combative, manipulative personalities prior to getting jobs, and then assessed the power and rank they held at work 14 years later. Anderson found that disagreeableness did not give people a leg up at their jobs, even in more cutthroat environments. “Disagreeable people are no more ― or less ― likely to gain power because they engage in two kinds of behaviors that have offsetting effects,” Anderson told HuffPost. “On the one hand, they are intimidating to others. This would have helped them gain power, except that their behavior also repels others. Their colleagues and coworkers maintain a distance from them, which isolates them and reduces their power.” In this way, the TikToker’s argument that “people who are a pleasure to work with will never get promoted” is “just flat wrong,” Anderson said, because it is “irrelevant to getting ahead. Other traits matter far more.” Anderson said there is actually one personality trait that will determine how far ahead you get at work, and it’s not dependent on how pleasant you are to work with. He said assertiveness is the key personality trait associated with gaining power. He defines it as “being self-assured, confident and forceful.” “It doesn’t mean being aggressive or bullying, but instead means believing in your abilities and ideas and pushing for yourself,” he explained. “If you are assertive, you are more likely to gain power, regardless of whether you are agreeable or disagreeable.” So don’t count yourself out if you have a reputation for being nice. It is still possible to be collegial and powerful. Anderson gave the example of imagining a leader you admire. Often it might be “someone who cares about their people, treats their people with respect, but who is also a strong leader and is willing to make difficult decisions and to fight for their people,” he said. In other words, pleasant people can be effective leaders when they are able to demonstrate both pleasantness ― or respect and concern for their people ― and assertiveness, or being willing to fight for them. It’s a good lesson for those who worry they are too nice to climb the ranks ― plenty of nice people outlast and outwit the jerks, but those leaders have the assertiveness to back up their pleasant charm. “Many workplaces often mistake pleasant and quiet people for weak and powerless [people],” Goehner said. But in fact, “most people value and remember leaders who were nice to them, including those who have shown humility, vulnerability and support. It’s all about what type of leader you want to be and what people say about you when you are not in the room.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Looking for solid noise-canceling ear buds but don’t want to pay that AirPods Pro or Bose QuietComfort price? Good news: Beats Studio Buds are quietly lower than their Black Friday sale price at multiple retailers, and they offer a lot of bang for the buck. These Beats Studio Buds are compatible with both Apple and Android phones with simple and quick one-touch pairing. With an IPX4 water-resistant rating, you won’t even have to worry about sweat or rain. Choose between transparency mode, so you can still hear the world around you, or noise-cancelling mode so you can enjoy the best audio and calls. You’ll get eight hours of listening time on a charge and up to 24 hours with additional charge from the case. And like Apple’s AirPods Pro, they come with three tip options for the best in-ear fit. You’ll save 47% off the regular price. These earbuds even support spatial audio for movies and gaming, and have finger-tap controls for taking and ending calls, playing music and more. Check out some promising reviews from Amazon buyers: “After going through 3 sets of $200 Apple AirPods Pro’s in the last year, the speakers always blew out, I wanted to try something different, I had beats back in high school and they were the best quality headphones I had, so I figured I’d see what their Apple equivalent had to offer, and I’m beyond impressed. For HALF the price, you get a more comfortable and lighter earbud that you can barely tell is in your ear, and doesn’t hurt sitting in my ears after an hour like the AirPods, but most importantly, the sound quality is 10x better, a lot clearer with more bass, as well as they higher output of volume. These are as loud as AirPods at 3/4 volume when AirPods are at full volume. They also have the same tapping features as the AirPods for song skipping, pausing, and calls so it’s not like having to relearn a different style from before. I will never waste the money on AirPods again.” — Juliana Straessley “This earbuds are so incredible. I love the pink color. They are comfortable to wear once you figure out how to properly place them in your ear. They pair quickly on your device and I have used them on Android and Windows PC as well. The battery life is amazing, which was the biggest thing I was looking for when deciding which earbuds to buy. They also charge super quick and I love the little case. And the sound quality is very good. I am not an expert on audio but for a casual person that loves to listen to music, watch movies and play videogames this work great . So happy with my purchase!” — Gabriela Fernandez “I am personally super pleased with these headphones...The entire time I’m working out though, my headphones have no issue staying in my ear, the sound quality is amazing, and they have an excellent noise cancellation. Every once in a while you have to adjust them and push them more in your ear if the noise cancellation isn’t perfect, but thats every ear bud, if you don’t want to deal with that then get yourself a set of over the ear headphones. I think this purchase was one hundred percent worth the price! I got them almost a month ago, only charging them a few minutes here and there and they still haven’t been on low battery mode. I was using skullcandy ANC earbuds and honestly they just kept breaking on me, 30/40$ adds up if you have to keep buying a new pair every six months. I would rather pay a hundred bucks at this point for a pair of headphones that work than to not be inconvenienced at the gym with not being able to workout because my headphones broke, and keep buying a new pair of headphones which in the end, end up more costly than this pair anyways.” — Tabby This article was paid for by and created by HuffPost’s Branded Creative Team.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost High-functioning anxiety can go unnoticed. It’s a term that is often used to describe a person who struggles with symptoms of anxiety such as racing thoughts, body tension or frequent worrying ― however, this person can mask or hide these symptoms and appear “fine” on the outside. “It’s not a diagnosis, but rather someone who has anxiety but still goes about their day-to-day lives managing it,” said licensed clinical psychologist Scott Lyons . “They are typically someone who is successful and performs well but internally or at home experience this anxiety, rather than showing it in a work or public setting.” Someone may experience anxiety at work for a lot of different reasons: deadlines, toxic work relationships, job security concerns and so much more. “People with high-functioning anxiety often are successful at work but will mask this anxiety to others,” Lyons explained. “It also is a sign of compound stress, like there’s too many things to focus on, and there’s not enough resources or control of the future.” On the outside, someone with high-functioning anxiety may appear to have it all together and yet their internal world and even their mental health is suffering. They are constantly in the mode of “something bad will happen if I do not get this done,” which can be pretty difficult to handle day in and day out. Not sure if you actually show signs of high-functioning anxiety at work? We spoke with psychology and mental health experts to lay out six work habits that are secretly high-functioning anxiety: “Perfectionism is a huge sign of high-functioning anxiety as you work to be the best at everything, which is an impossible task,” explained Erin L. Moran, a licensed mental health counselor in Jacksonville, Florida. A perfectionist “often places a lot of shame and blame on yourself or others any time something is perceived as less than perfect,” she added. The thought of your boss or co-worker being upset or disappointed in you, despite there being zero specific evidence that they actually are, may occur in your strides to be perfect. While you’re doing well with your tasks at work, if your personal relationships with those in your office are seemingly not up to the standards of those with high-functioning anxiety, you may begin assuming the feelings and intentions of others and personalizing them. “Someone with high-functioning anxiety may be a perfectionist with their work or conversations as they are anxious of how it will be perceived by others,” Lyons said. Getting distracted and not being able to focus on your tasks at work are two very common occurrences for those who have high-functioning anxiety. Often, those who experience issues with concentration and focus will implement their own coping mechanisms to be able to work efficiently. For example, some people may wear headphones at work. “A person with high-functioning anxiety may wear headphones because this helps them feel less distracted and more in control of the information they receive,” Lyons said. The stress, worry and anxiety is to blame for the lack of focus at work and “will eventually lead you to have more difficulty staying present on your tasks,” Moran said. “When a person becomes overworked, over-stressed and places high pressure on themselves, there is an increased likelihood of their brain dropping some things due to the emotional energy drain attached to anxiety.” Reassurance and validation are two very important things for those with high-functioning anxiety in the workplace because it will dictate how they perform, their thoughts, and emotions every time they come to work. “At work, people with high-functioning anxiety will often seek reassurance on their work or projects from others to ease their anxiety,” Lyons said. Seeking validation often reflects a fear response. “Validation is super important and helpful, but when you need your boss or co-worker to frequently provide this feedback without the ability to gauge your own success, this can create a sense of not being good enough when the likely reality is that other people are busy in their own work and will forget to praise or acknowledge you, which is not a reflection of doing anything wrong,” Moran explains. Reassurance may also come in the form of interacting regularly with certain co-workers only. “They find people safe and more reassuring than others and, outside of those select individuals, they may not socialize at all,” said Michele Leno , a psychologist and founder of DML Psychological Services in Michigan. “They may even shun others’ attempts to get to know them.” A routine is predictable and not anxiety-inducing. However, when there is a slight change, it can really stir up the entire day for someone with high-functioning anxiety. “The person with high-functioning anxiety may view change as total injustice and spend days talking about it, as they can’t afford any disturbance to their routine,” Leno said. Along with perfectionism and seeking validation, comparison is common in those with high-functioning anxiety. “The root of this is insecurity attached to anxiety,” Moran said. “This is often associated with a fear of rejection, a desire to be seen as worthy, and overall pressure associated with attempting to be seen as good enough and not wanting to experience any negative feedback from others.” In efforts to feel worthy at work, it’s not uncommon for someone who has high-functioning anxiety to keep themselves extremely busy. “This might include volunteering for extra projects, despite these additional projects creating additional stress and strain and not having the time to fully focus on them,” Moran said. “This often creates burnout due to the constant pressure and lack of balance in workload.” Because of the overwhelming need to stay busy, these people will often arrive early to work and stay late in hopes to get ahead of any possible issues or changes. They’ll also rarely say “no” to things. “ Often people with high-functioning anxiety tend to be people-pleasers and will be hesitant to say no when they’re asked to do something,” Lyons explained. If these signs resonate with your work life, there are steps you can take to help you feel more at ease, mentally and physically, at work: Deep breathing is something that can help anxiety in the moment. Our bodies naturally respond to taking deep breaths and will calm down when the parasympathetic nervous system is activated, per the Cleveland Clinic . Speaking to someone else about what you’re struggling with at work may help you immensely with your high-functioning anxiety. Not only will it help you talk about the things that cause you anxiety, it can help you learn to effectively manage your symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is one option that helps people learn to reframe their thoughts about life and transform those behaviors that feed your anxiety. This could help you manage your thoughts, find solutions that work for you, and navigate your way through anxious moments. Going on medication can help reduce your symptoms of high-functioning anxiety, and your doctor can work with you to find the right one for you, according to the Cleveland Clinic .

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life “Make yourself indispensable.” Work long enough, and at some point, you’ll hear this pithy advice from well-meaning colleagues about how you can advance your career. It remains a top-searched topic on TikTok and a piece of so-called wisdom that executives will share in interviews. Former CEO of PepsiCo Indra Nooyi, for example, said in a 2019 interview that it’s a mantra that helped her succeed at getting PepsiCo to accommodate her parenting needs. “If you establish a niche for yourself, and make yourself indispensable based on competence, what can they do without you?” Nooyi said at the 2019 Women in the World Summit. In the interview, Nooyi said it was her indispensability that OK’d the corporate decision for her children to hang out with her in her office after 5 p.m. The underlying message is that if you work hard and make your skillset unique, the company will reward your efforts, encourage your development and meet your needs. Maybe it’s comforting to hear this because it gives you a sense of empowerment and control over your career. And if you’re a senior leader like Nooyi, maybe this advice works. But there are glaring problems with this supposed wisdom. For one, the idea that you should make yourself indispensable rings especially hollow after mass layoffs of talented individuals that feel completely arbitrary. “I think that this advice makes us feel like we have some control over what companies decide to do when we absolutely do not [have control] if a company decides to eliminate a product or shut down a division or scale down a department,” said career and leadership coach Phoebe Gavin . “They’re just going to do that.“ Similar to the advice that you should not job-hop too soon after taking a new job, career coach Jasmine Escalera said the “make yourself indispensable” advice feeds “this concept that corporate America is the one in charge. And so I think ‘making yourself indispensable’ is just another way of saying, ‘You’re supposed to focus on their wants and needs, not your own.’” This mentality can also trap you in roles you don’t want or force you to stretch yourself thin. For Escalera, internalizing the “indispensable” advice at a job meant she believed that “they make the decisions, and you have to adapt to that.” Eventually after five years, this belief led to her burnout . “I was always focused on what the company wanted, and trying to make myself indispensable. And inevitably, what I started to realize was that what I was trying to do, and what I was trying to work within really wasn’t even what I wanted to do with my career,” she recalled. Her wake-up call was “going through a divorce and realizing that committing to my job so intensely was one of the factors that led to that,” Escalera said. “It was really burnout. Like, I felt like I was burning myself out for a company that wasn’t paying me what I deserved.” “‘Making yourself indispensable’ is just another way of saying, ‘You’re supposed to focus on their wants and needs, not your own.’” Executive coach and career strategist Susan Peppercorn said “make yourself indispensable” is advice she’s heard all the time throughout her career, but being irreplaceable to a team can trap you into roles you’ve outgrown. She gave the example of a career coaching job she had for laid-off professionals. After 13 years in that role, Peppercorn asked her employer if she could transition to a leadership role with workshop facilitation. “I was very successful in that role. But I was getting tired of doing it. I was getting bored. And so I wanted to do something else. And the response I got when I asked to do something else was ... ‘No, we want you to keep doing what you’ve been doing,’” Peppercorn said. “The reality was, I had made myself indispensable.” It’s a hard lesson that just because you deserve to be rewarded and promoted, doesn’t mean that it’ll happen. Peppercorn said as a result, she quit that job. This doesn’t mean, however, you just throw your hands up and believe that you have zero agency over your career. “Make yourself indispensable to your employer” without any caveats is bad advice, but being seen as reliable and a hard worker are good qualities to have on a team. Peppercorn said making yourself indispensable is not bad advice if you have a clear expectation of what it means and if the colleague who believes in it has the power to advance your career into roles you want. “Are you learning new skills? Is that a pathway to a promotion? You need to know that,” she said. But don’t assume that making your boss’ life easier will automatically help your career, though. Escalera said being a solution-finder to your boss’ problems can help you advance, but before you start agreeing to their requests, you should take a step back and ask yourself, “Am I even doing the work that matches what I want to do?” And then you can use that answer to find the right environments, companies and jobs that actually connect to your personal mission. There’s a better way to layoff-proof your career than this approach, too. Gavin said she thinks everyone receives this advice, “but folks from ... historically marginalized backgrounds are more likely to deeply internalize it, and also have it sort of turned into self-blame versus motivation.“ You cannot guarantee you’ll avoid being laid off, but you can prepare yourself for that scenario. Gavin said that instead of internalizing the message of becoming indispensable, professionals can focus on building their layoff resiliency. According to Gavin, there are three pillars on how to do that: “If you have money in the bank, then it’s easier to say no to demands and requests from employers that you aren’t interested in,” Gavin said. “It’s easier for you to step away from a role that’s not working for you.“ Actress Lucy Liu dubs this power move as investing in “‘fuck you’ money.” In a 2013 interview with “DP/30: The Oral History Of Hollywood,” Liu recalled picking up catering jobs in her 20s and working a lot to be able to say “no” to jobs that did not serve her. “If you have it, and something’s not working out, and they say you have to take this job otherwise you’re fired, you can be like, ‘Fuck you,’” Liu said. Gavin said it helps to make your skill set “really strong and up to date” to the needs of your industry. You can do this at your current job by taking on projects or initiatives that allow you to develop skills that you can demonstrate to a future employer, she said. “Humans are social creatures, we tend to share information and give the benefit of the doubt to folks that we know, and we tend not to do that with folks that we don’t know,” Gavin said. “And so if you have great skills, but you don’t have a great network, it is still going to be much more challenging for you to step into another role.“ Once you break away from the mindset of serving your boss and your company’s bottom-line, you start to be in service of yourself. Under capitalism, you cannot be indispensable to an employer, but you can make commitments to yourself that last you past any one job. This story was previously published on an earlier date.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost According to the 2024 World Happiness Survey , the United States is no longer one of the 20 happiest countries. It’s pretty glum news, but not necessarily surprising. While some of our stressors and sources of grief are out of our control, or might constitute a “ permacrisis ,” there’s also a common misunderstanding about happiness that’s plaguing us. This belief often stands in the way of us truly experiencing regular, daily joy. The misunderstanding in question: that happiness is an end goal, or something we can’t have right now. In reality, we can cultivate happiness every day and before our goals are met. So why do we think otherwise? Why do we see happiness as an end goal? Here are a few reasons, according to therapists. This viewpoint is partially rooted in cultural and societal norms, according to Hayli Evans , a therapist who specializes in trauma. In the U.S., many of us see productivity and hard work as top-tier. It leads us to constantly chase after the elusive “American Dream” ― the idea that if we’re productive all the time, we’ll be successful, happy and financially stable. “People are taught that work and play are to be kept separate, and often, we do not prioritize rest at all,” Evans said. “We commonly ‘live for the weekend,’ perpetuating the idea that happiness is something to be chased, or something reserved for later.” Thanks to this mindset (and thanks to capitalism), there’s always something we feel we should “fix” before we’re “allowed” to be happy, whether it’s our bodies, our relationship status or our job titles. Then, when we get to that point, we may confront the arrival fallacy , the illusion that meeting a goal brings lasting happiness. Or we might discover that the happiness doesn’t last. “Our society has turned [achieving happiness and reaching your full potential] into a way to measure success,” said Aurisha Smolarski , a Los Angeles-based therapist, certified co-parenting coach and author of “Cooperative Co-Parenting for Secure Kids: The Attachment Theory Guide to Raising Kids in Two Homes.” “Thus, you might feel happy for a moment when you achieve one success, but then you immediately jump to the next goal. And whatever happiness you found evaporates.” Further, we’ve grown up hearing that “happily ever afters” only come at the end of a story. “Hollywood has sold us an idea of ‘happily ever after,’ from fairy tales to rom-coms,” said Jenny Maenpaa , a licensed psychotherapist, author and founder of the Forward in Heels coaching practice. “We have grown up with the idea that happiness is a destination that we reach and then we hang on to for dear life.” Envisioning true happiness as something that’s coming ― rather than something already at our fingertips ― gives us hope. It gets us through less-than-ideal times. Basically, it’s self-protective. “In many ways, it’s easier to live in the future, because if you’re not happy in the present moment, then all you need to do is think about how your life will be better when you lose weight, make more money, have a partner, own a home, etc.,” said Tess Brigham , a licensed therapist, certified coach and author of “True You: A Step-by-Step Guide to Conquering Your Quarter-Life Crisis.” ...which means you can’t take time for pleasure now. “We’re told by our parents over and over again, ‘Work hard in school so you can get into a good college.’ ‘Work hard in college you can get a good job,’ and so on,” Brigham said. “We’re told that we have to do these things that we don’t want to do and don’t enjoy so that our future selves will be happy.” For starters, this type of thinking makes us more likely to feel unhappy (and when happiness is so close!). Evans said many people think they’ll be happy once they’ve attended to their (never-ending) responsibilities. But besides robbing us of the joys of the present moment, this can lead to a plethora of negative emotions. “We end up being more anxious, more depressed and less satisfied in our lives,” Evans said. “Chronically postponing enjoyment increases our impulse to numb ourselves when we feel overwhelmed or too stressed to function .” In an attempt to avoid the dreariness, she said, we may reach for substances or social media , which keeps us from “investing our time and energy in the relationships and activities that will bring true fulfillment.” Next, this kind of mindset can keep us from having complete, intimate relationships. Smolarski has heard many people say they “just want to be happy,” and she’ll challenge them to see the upside of occasional negative emotions. “[Just being happy] makes it difficult for them to be empathic to their own or someone else’s experience that conflicts with or threatens their protective stance around being happy,” she explained. “For some people, this becomes an avoidance strategy, whereby they push aside the full range of emotions, and instead aim to keep the peace with people who may be afraid of conflict.” Additionally, if you put too much pressure on the idea of happiness, and you expect perfection, you may struggle to feel like you’ll ever attain it. “Because we are unable to sustain happiness, we are always confronted with the feeling that we have somehow fallen short,” Smolarski said. “In fact, what has happened is that we have lost touch with the state of being, in which we are content with what is.” Shame can play a role, too. “You’re consciously, or unconsciously, telling yourself the person you are today isn’t enough,” Brigham said. Finally, this mentality inhibits you from living your life in the moment. Have you ever looked at a picture of your body years ago , or recalled a memory, and wished you appreciated it more? It’s easy to forget to be mindful and grateful, but that’s one thing that keeps us stuck in discontentment. “It’s unhelpful because you’re not really living your life,” Brigham said. “Your life is happening now, and the more you live in the past or future, you’re not allowing yourself to be in the moment and enjoy what you’re experiencing.” There are several solutions, both in the short and the long term, that can help you think of happiness differently and feel it more regularly. They include: In hard times, happiness requires more work — but it’s doable. “Happiness exists in the moment that we experience it,” Evans said. “Happiness is experienced through mindfulness ... When we are mindful, we are able to tune in to pleasure, gratitude, joy — the ingredients that make up ‘happiness.’” This could involve taking a moment to appreciate nature, or being grateful you have a job (even when it’s stressful). Emotions are supposed to change, and they all have a purpose. Anger, for example, tells us that something isn’t OK. “We need to experience a full range of emotions,” Evans said. “However, if we find that we are sitting in stress, sadness [or] anxiety, but never allow ourselves to experience happiness, we might need to investigate what’s going on.” She recommended addressing this with loved ones and a trusted mental health professional. Maenpaa said that constant happiness wouldn’t actually feel as great as it sounds. “If we were happy every second of every day, we’d take it for granted,” she explained. “It would become the norm, and then we’d need to pursue something else to feel alive.” Do you have perceptions of what happiness is, or ideas about when you can or can’t feel it, that might be holding you back? “Shifting our mindset about happiness and about our present moment can help us to give permission to experience it more frequently,” Evans said. She loves Zabie Yamasaki’s trauma-informed yoga affirmation card deck. Evans said the purpose is to “be here, now.” Silent walks , meditation, breath work and journaling are all ways to practice this. Along the way, Evans encouraged noticing and exploring any thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations that arise. Additionally, gratitude can bring happiness through similar actions and pursuits, such as journaling, spirituality, bringing your mind to the present and listing what you’re thankful for ― for example, a supportive friend, an apartment or a sunny day. Afterward, Evans said to “spend a few moments really sitting in what that gratitude feels like. Notice your body’s response to gratitude.” When we feel an emotion we don’t want to feel, it’s easy to experience shame or hopelessness as a result. Try acceptance and self-compassion instead. “Instead of fighting negative feelings, roll with them,” Maenpaa advised. Specifically, with pen and paper. Maenpaa said research shows that physically writing things down activates parts of the brain that typing doesn’t. “Writing down our worries and fears actually releases them from our short-term memories, allowing us to feel that space with new thoughts, ones that can be happier and more rewarding,” she said. First, consider what makes you happy and aligns with your purpose (if you have an idea of what that is). Then, brainstorm how to turn that into a ritual. “Focus on the little things, such as a morning cup of coffee, hugging your kid, writing for a half hour per day, fixing a plumbing issue or planning a date night with your partner,” Smolarski suggested. Happiness is created within, but it can be affected by external events ― anything from a friend’s betrayal to a health diagnosis to oppression. It’s OK to validate that; there’s no need for toxic positivity . What might be more helpful after validating yourself, though, is focusing on what you can do. “If you’re not happy and you’ve identified the reasons why are in your control, great — you can now start doing things to change it,” Brigham said. “If you determine that your happiness or unhappiness is out of your control, then you can acknowledge this is how you feel and accept it.” She added that statements like “I’m feeling sad and there’s nothing I can do about it, but I know it will pass” can actually help you move through and process your feelings faster. In short, don’t wait until you get married or promoted to be happy. Engage in micro-acts of joy every day with gratitude.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost While it’s not an official medical diagnosis, high-functioning depression is more common than most people think. That’s because, as the name suggests, a person with high-functioning depression doesn’t fit the “typical” profile that may come to mind when we think of someone living with depression. People with high-functioning depression don’t sleep all day, and their colleagues or family members might not suspect anything is wrong. Instead, “the struggles are often hidden behind success and productivity,” explained licensed psychologist Natasha Trujillo . Someone with high-functioning depression will probably not have issues performing well at work or fulfilling responsibilities at home. They may even use these productive actions to cope. Often, someone with high-functioning depression might not even know they’re depressed at all. So, what are the signs to look out for if you suspect you might be dealing with high-functioning depression? And what can you do about it? We asked mental health experts, and here’s what they had to say. Trujillo says the top high-functioning depression sign to look out for is that you don’t experience any sustained sense of joy or pleasure, despite good things happening. “People with high-functioning depression remain productive, successful, and able to achieve,” she said. “And yet, the person may not be able to maintain a mood of pride, joy, or pleasure for long, or they may pick apart a compliment or achievement to somehow make it ‘less than’ or inadequate in some way, emphasizing that they may not be deserving or they just got lucky.” Therapist Becca Reed agrees with this. “Someone with high-functioning depression might feel disconnected, as if they are going through the motions without genuine engagement or joy,” she said. “This detachment can manifest as a lack of interest in activities they once enjoyed, a sense of being stuck in a routine or feeling emotionally flat even in situations that would typically bring about strong emotions.” Trujillo emphasized that there are other signs a person might have high-functioning depression. These may include: High-functioning depression is serious, and just as with more overt forms of depression, its consequences if untreated can include substance misuse and suicidal ideation. In fact, someone with high-functioning depression might actually be at greater risk for suicide attempts because they feel so isolated in their experience, according to Saba Harouni Lurie , a licensed marriage and family therapist. So, getting help is key. The first thing Trujillo encouraged is to work on being more open with loved ones about what you are experiencing. “Being more vulnerable can help you gain support and connection,” she said. “You can also work on focusing on what in your life isn’t actually working for you, and initiate ways to change what’s maintaining your depression.” And of course, finding help from a mental health professional should be a priority. “The most important thing to do is to seek [professional] support,” Lurie said. “Many people with high-functioning depression don’t seek out help, because they interpret their ability to still function relatively normally as a sign that they aren’t struggling as much as others with more overt symptoms may be.” Reed noted that a therapist can provide you with someone to talk through difficult emotions with, and can offer invaluable coping skills that you may not be able to get from friends or family members. “A therapist can provide you with tools to help you regulate your nervous system in an effort to increase resiliency and overall mood,” she said. “It can also be helpful to incorporate activities that nurture well-being, such as exercise, hobbies, and social time.” Medications like SSRIs, also called antidepressants, are always an option as well, and they work well for many people . A psychiatrist or doctor should be able to chat with you about exploring a prescription. High-functioning depression is tricky, and it can be hard to know if you’re dealing with it — and even harder to tell if a loved one is. But by looking out for certain signs, you can identify the issue and work toward getting necessary help as quickly as possible. If you or someone you know needs help, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org for mental health support.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Everyone has bad days at work, but there are signs that employees need to watch out for before a bad week at the office turns into never-ending, debilitating work stress that is ruining your health . Too many Americans are trapped in toxic jobs, a problem employers and employees need to take more seriously. Jeffrey Pfeffer, an organizational behavior professor at Stanford who wrote the book “ Dying for a Paycheck ,” found through his research that poor management in U.S. companies accounted for up to 8 percent of annual health costs and was associated with 120,000 excess deaths every year. Your body may know before you fully do that your job is to blame for your stress symptoms, sending you red alerts that you are not okay. “A lot of times the first thing we’ll hear about is sleepless nights ,” said Maryland-based clinical psychologist Monique Reynolds of the Center for Anxiety and Behavior Change . “ People report either not being able to sleep because their mind is racing or not being able to stay asleep. They wake up in the middle of the night thinking about their to-do list.” A few restless nights is not a huge deal, but if it becomes a pattern, that may be a sign your job stress has become toxic. “If it’s consistently related to work, that is a sign that something is off-balance,” Reynolds said. Your muscles tense up to guard your body from injury. When you see the workplace as a danger zone, it keeps your muscles wound tight, according to the American Psychological Association . Chronic tension in the neck, shoulders and head can be associated with migraines and tension headaches . “Stress creates physiological symptoms, and that manifests as pain,” said Reynolds. When your job is toxic, it can feel like you’re fighting off a wild tiger at your desk. Under a perceived threat, your brains flood your system with adrenaline and other stress hormones. “Our nervous systems in toxic jobs are constantly on edge,” Reynolds said. “We are constantly anticipating, ready to react to an unpleasant boss or co-worker.” If you are always typing “just following up” emails with your shoulders hunched and your jaw clenched, this could be a sign that your job is impacting your health. Reynolds noted that increased stress can exacerbate existing mental health issues. “Someone who might be a worrier in a really toxic work environment; that worry will often exacerbate to cross the clinical threshold,” she said. If you feel like your boss is always out to get you, your mental health pays a price. One 2012 analysis of 279 studies linked perceptions of organizational unfairness with employee health complaints such as overeating and depression. E. Kevin Kelloway, the Canada Research Chair in Occupational Health Psychology at St. Mary’s University, said that unfair treatment at work can cause us outsized stress. “Injustice is a particularly toxic stressor because it strikes at the core of who we are,” he said. “When you treat me unfairly you attack my dignity as a person —essentially saying that I don’t deserve fair treatment or to be treated the same as others.” If you are catching colds constantly, consider how you are feeling about your job. A large body of research shows that chronic stress can compromise the immune system, making you more susceptible to illness. How you spend your time reflects what you value. When you bring your work home with you, your relationships can suffer. The American Psychological Association notes that when women have to juggle professional stress on top of their ongoing personal and financial obligations, it can reduce sexual desire. For men, this chronic stress can result in lower testosterone production, which in turn leads to lower libido. “There has to be a certain amount of relaxation in order to allow the arousal feeling to arise,” Reynolds said. “Then there’s the time factor. People report not having enough time to have sex.” This is fatigue, a bone-deep weariness that no nap or weekend lie-in seems to cure. Kelloway noted that “there is no set way that individuals react to a toxic workplace,” but he said that fatigue is in the range of physical symptoms employees may feel. Toxic jobs can create a cycle that drains us, said Pfeffer. “ You’re feeling overwhelmed, because you’re working too long, and you’re working too long because you’re feeling overwhelmed,” he said. Indigestion, constipation, bloating can all be associated with stress, because stress impacts what the gut digests and can also change our gut bacteria, which in turn impacts our mood. It’s why you may get stomach pangs when you are upset, said Kelloway, who experienced this himself in one toxic job. “About six months in I started to notice that every Sunday afternoon I developed a pain in my stomach. It was not the symptom but the timing (just as I was starting to think about what I had to do on Monday morning) that alerted me to the connection to the job,” he said. “All symptoms went away when I quit the job and moved on to something else.” Your appetite is closely linked to your brain. Under acute stress, your fight-or-flight response releases adrenaline, telling your body to suppress digestion to focus on saving us from a perceived danger, according to the Harvard Health Letter . Under long-term stress, though, your body’s adrenal glands release and build up cortisol, a hormone which can increase hunger. When your job is causing long-term emotional distress, you may turn to food for comfort. Harvard also reports that eating sugary foods may blunt stress-related responses and emotions, which is why they’re often seen as comfort foods ― but that’s an unhealthy habit you should avoid. Take breaks. After your body goes on high alert to defend you from unreasonable demands and bad bosses, you need to give it time off. “When we don’t give our nervous system an opportunity to relax and reset itself, it starts to cause long-term damage,” Reynolds explained. She said that companionship outside of the workplace , meditation and exercise can help to offset the stress symptoms. Reframe negative thinking. One of the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy is that how you think can change how you feel. “It’s not possible for everyone to switch jobs, but we can focus on the situation that we can control,” Reynolds said. We can use mindfulness to manage our unhelpful rumination about how the presentation went or what our colleagues are thinking about us. Leave. See this as the warning that you need to get a new job or else. Pfeffer said that long hours, absence of autonomy, uncertain scheduling and economic insecurity at jobs are all factors that contribute to a toxic workplace environment that employees need to leave behind, not just cope with. “You need to fix the underlying problem, not deal with the symptoms,” he said.

Without knowing where I stand in the process, I’m not comfortable spending 90 minutes in Excel Me:…well…I can tell you where you stand now To be fair, a lot of places are just using applicants for free labor. The job doesn't exist. The \"test\" is the only work they need done. I don’t mind doing work for free to show what I can do. But last time I did this, the company ghosted me after I spent a weekend on a take home. So I don’t mind this stance. If you don’t like me protecting my time now, you’re not going to like me working for you anyways. Because he values his time? The kid isn't wrong just because we accepted this type of behavior from the Boomer employers our whole lives. Applicant is right. Unless you offered to compensate for that 90 minutes. He has no idea how many applicants remain in the process. He probably has interviews with other businesses. Effort vs reward definitely not there for this. Good for him. A response I would have actually enjoyed would have been. “I’m good at this and do t work for free. Give me $1,000 and I’ll break this deal down in amazing detail” Would have gladly paid and probably hired But this is pretty much the subtext of his email, no? No one is obtuse enough to suggest to their future employer to pay them $1000 for completing an interview assessment; him declining shows he understands his value and has options I once had a place give me a four hour data analysis and modelling test packet. Told me they loved the work, and then the next day laid off 30% of staff. I get why people can be suspicious. 90 mins (if true) seems reasonable Having made applicants do intense case studies when I was at a boutique I bank, I’ll tell you they’re 100% worth it. I don’t care if it’s a lot of your time. It’s unreal how hard it is to find good people. I’ve watched people that present themselves so well fall flat when asked… Couldn’t have given you a better signal. We require applicants to do a 1 hour graphic design test. If people raise concerns about doing an unpaid test, it is the best feeling the world because I know we dodged a bullet. Gen Z would benefit from being in more fistfights at a young age.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life On Monday, Apple announced new features that are on the way at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Our cellphones have become one of the primary ways we talk to each other, and there are upcoming iPhone features for iOS 18 that are giving users more ways to express how they feel, organize their thoughts, and stay in touch with family off the grid. Here’s how: For fans of Gmail’s feature for scheduling emails to send at a later time, you’re in luck –– Apple is rolling out a similar feature for iMessage. Gone are the days of worrying about waking up in time to send that birthday text or early morning reminder to the group chat. In its press release, Apple said that users will have the ability to cancel or edit the message at any time. You’ll also be able to see that your message has been scheduled. Being able to quickly skim through a transcribed conversation is a huge time-saver. And if you currently use a third-party service to transcribe phone conversations (looking at you, fellow journalists), you might be pleased to learn that Apple has announced its own upcoming feature. After the iOS update, people using the Phone app will be able to record calls and read transcriptions and AI-powered summaries of the conversation after the fact. Apple is calling its AI features “Apple Intelligence” and announced that they will launch in beta this fall for iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. At its developer conference, Apple said that the person on the other line would first get an automatic heads-up that they are being recorded. Formatting your words with a playfully bolded phrase can help get your meaning across more than just text alone. After the new iMessages app update, iPhone users will be able to underline, bold, strikethrough and italicize texts. You will also be able to react to messages with any emoji, rather than just the thumbs up, exclamation points and other limited options we currently have. You can even create your own emoji with an AI-powered feature Apple is calling “Genmoji.” In Genmoji, users can type “Labrador with red glasses” in the iMessage emoji search bar and get an AI version of what that will look like, as one example . Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant, will have new capabilities and be able to answer more questions in the iOS 18 update. In the new Siri, you can ask it text-based questions as well as voiced ones. Can’t remember when you took that photo and which album you put it in? You will be able to ask Siri to pull up photos, links and PDFs, as well as edit images or move items across various apps, according to Apple. As one example, Apple shared that Siri can pull up a photo of your driver’s license and copy-paste the number into a form or can pull up an old link your friend shared with you. Apple is building off of its Emergency SOS feature and will allow iPhone iOS 18 users to do SMS texting over its satellite. This way, you can shoot off a text to or share a video with a loved one even when you do not have cell service or a Wi-Fi connection. At WWDC, Justin Titi, Apple’s director of intelligent system experience engineering, announced a Rewrite feature that will be available in Mail, Notes, Pages, third-party apps, and systemwide for macOS Sequoia. In the demo, we see Rewrite being used in the Mail app where a woman is following up after a networking conversation in an email. Using the Rewrite options allows the user toggle between “professional,” “friendly” and “concise” versions of that email. There will also be a new proofreading service that can give you grammar and sentence structure suggestions on your messages. If you handed over your phone, is there a dating app or a photo that you would be embarrassed if someone else saw? Apple is making it a little harder for strangers to tap and access sensitive information. Under the new iOS update, you will be able to lock specific apps on your iPhone, so that you can only access them through authentication features like Face ID, Touch ID or your passcode. After selecting this feature, information from those apps would not show up in your search bar, notifications or Siri suggestions. Beyond these specific iPhone features, there are other updates that may make your life a little more convenient. After the new macOS Sequoia update , people will be able to mirror and control their iPhone screen directly on their Mac. This way, you can click through your phone on your Mac device without using a touchscreen. But while you’re using the mirror feature on your Mac device, the iPhone will temporarily lock itself, so no one else can access your iPhone. And there are new security options being rolled out. Similar to existing password managers like LastPass and 1Password, Apple is introducing its own passwords app that will access your credentials, generate complex passwords, and securely store them all in one place. Apple said the new Passwords app will soon be available on Mac, iPad, iPhone, Vision Pro, and on Windows through iCloud. Talk about upgrades.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Do you swipe in to your office building to meet your in-person mandate, but leave as soon as possible? There’s a word for your covert strategy: “coffee badging.” It is where you show up to the office long enough for a coffee or a meeting expressly to fulfill in-office mandates — while primarily continuing to work from home whenever you can. This new workplace lingo was popularized by videoconferencing company Owl Labs. The company defined it as “showing face at the office and then leaving.” In its 2023 report of 2,000 full-time U.S. workers, 58% of hybrid employees said they were “coffee badging,” with an additional 8% saying they were interested in trying it out. And as hybrid arrangements have become a more permanent feature of office life, coffee badging is still here to stay. In a more recent June LinkedIn news poll of 1,568 people, 19% of LinkedIn users said they were still “coffee badging” into work. Amanda, a Chicago-based IT project manager for a health insurance company, is one of them. Her company has a hybrid policy, and Amanda ― who asked to keep her last name private for her job ― said managers are open with employees that badge swipes are being tracked for “badge reports,” which calculate the percentage of people in office per week or month. She has not had a conversation about her own attendance record, but knowing that her badge swipes could potentially result in a performance issue has made her diligent about commuting to the office because she does not “want to have that conversation come up at all.” As a result, Amanda stays at least four hours to signal “I’m here,” she said, but will head home when she can. The feeling of having her attendance tracked does make her “uncomfortable.” If she could, she would be a 100% remote employee, because she finds in-office days with commuting to be draining and “a waste of time” since her direct boss works in another city, and she has video meetings with remote colleagues. “I don’t want to be here. I can do this from home,” Amanda said. In this way, coffee badging in and out of work is a way to wrest back control and autonomy over how your job gets done. An employer may order some of my time, but not one second more than they must, is the strategic coffee badging philosophy. And it’s not in employee’s heads ― badge logs can result in real negative consequences to one’s career. In January, one professional service firm reportedly showed some partners’ analysis that linked office attendance from turnstile data to mid-year performance ratings. For her book, “ The Algorithm: How AI Decides Who Gets Hired, Monitored, Promoted, and Fired and Why We Need to Fight Back Now ,” journalist Hilke Schellmann interviewed a head of HR, who shared a story about a company making promotion and layoff decisions based on badge log data. “They wanted to promote the people who had the longest hours at the office. So they looked at keycard swipe-in data,” Schellmann said about this company. “And then when it came to the pandemic, and they had to look at layoffs, they wanted to use this kind of data again to sort of understand who were the ‘least productive’ people, and they were going to look at the badge data logs.“ But to be clear, your badge swipes are a flawed signal of your performance at work. Using badge swipes to determine productivity “could harm people who are on medical leave, or people who have caregiving obligations who we know have literally fewer chances to be at their desk than others,” Schellmann said. So why are employers so tempted to find deeper meaning with badge logs despite the clear flaws? It might be because it is part of a growing field of people analytics. “Companies want to use the data they have on their employees,” Schellmann said, noting that there is also a long-held mindset of “managers just sort of [wanting] to look around the room and see butts in seats.” “It’s all about impression management,” she added. But a word of caution to the coffee badger: You do need to stay longer than just a cup of coffee, because managers can easily look up how long you stayed at the office, and may feel betrayed by you popping in and out. “Now with digital technology, everything leaves a trace, and that trace can be checked by superiors,” Schellmann said. You can either go to the office begrudgingly or you can be pragmatic about the in-office mandate. The latter can be a helpful attitude adjustment. “Try to reframe the coffee badging so that you feel that you’re making the most of this situation,” suggested Archana Bharathan, an executive coach at Columbia Business School. Bharathan said she would go to her office less than her required three days a week if she had a choice, “but I would still go because I do see the benefit of it.“ Her role requires her to build and deepen relationships with colleagues, so she sees the face-time as a boost, but she acknowledges that if she were an individual contributor who mostly did Zoom calls, her productivity might decrease. Bharathan’s advice to fellow coffee badgers is to find ways to make the time in office productive. She suggested scheduling meetings on in-person days. “If you have the flexibility of choosing which three days you need to be in, figure out...how you can potentially combine your commute with other things that require attention in your personal life, [like] if you need to run errands,” she said. And if you’re a manager of a team that is “coffee badging,” you should look deeper into why this trend is happening. Ask yourself: “Are those who spend more time in the office delivering stronger results? Are they coming in for meetings and collaborative spaces? Or are they simply spending time commuting to sit on Zoom calls from the office instead of home?” suggested Bonnie Dilber, a recruiting manager with app-automation company Zapier. “Great managers focus their teams on the highest impact actions, so my encouragement to any employer that sees employees going through the motions of meeting a minimum in-office expectation would be to consider whether the expectation is actually going to lead to impact,” she continued. “If the answer is yes, help your people recognize that so they’ll spend more time in the office, and if the answer is no, I’d revisit the requirement.” Here’s a word to the wise: Coffee badging is not an accurate signal of someone’s performance. Busyness is not the same as accomplishment. Seeing a co-worker physically typing at their desk next to you does not mean they are actually working. Take it from Amanda. Instead of putting weight into an employee’s number of badge swipes, she would want managers to instead “look at the work that’s actually being done and feedback from other people that [have] worked with the individual as a true measurement.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life What if there was a way you could permanently leave your work at work and live your life free of job worries? On “ Severance ,” the new Apple TV+ series that concluded its first season this week, that is the promise Lumon offers to its “severed” employees, who agree to have their memories surgically divided between their work and personal lives as part of their employment contract. For Lumon, severance is a nondisclosure agreement taken to new extremes. As soon as severed employees step out of a Lumon elevator, they have no memory of who they work with or what they work on. The show follows Mark, played by Adam Scott . At home, he’s a lonesome man grieving the loss of his wife, while at work he’s an obedient company man leading Lumon’s severed Macrodata Refinement team. For Mark, working for Lumon is an eight-hour reprieve when he is not haunted by his grief. His “innie,” as Lumon management call his work side, knows no family and sees no people other than his co-workers. He doesn’t know what sleep is like. “I find it helps to focus on the effects of sleep since we don’t get to experience it,” Mark tries to reassure his new direct report. It’s bleak. All severed Mark knows about the world is the windowless building he works in, and for the most part, he has made his peace with the arrangement. Innie Mark is more self-assured than his grief-stricken outie. He walks straighter and parrots back the company handbook sayings, like “the work is mysterious and important,” without irony. But as the season unfurls, we see severed employees who are not willing to work forever just for the reward of a quarterly waffle party. And that’s where “Severance” shines at highlighting how ridiculous and inhumane workplace culture can be. One part that “Severance” nails is how business language can distort itself to the point where words mean nothing. Mark and his team all work in “Macrodata Refinement,” and even after watching the finale I am no closer to understanding what exactly is getting refined. At Lumon, obtuse business language is also a euphemism for corporate misdeeds. T he break room is actually a detention center designed to break employee’s spirits. An “overtime contingency” mechanism is a sinister surveillance tool that violates employees’ privacy. Lumon’s severed floor is really where the show pokes fun at sad corporate perks. Irving, the most-senior macrodata refiner (played wonderfully by John Turturro ), remembers a time when employees were incentivized with coffee creamer. Dylan, another refiner, is pleased by the finger trap puzzle and cartoon caricatures he earns as he completes a task. When an employee earns an MDE, it’s a five-minute Music Dance Experience for which the employee gets to pick a song and boogie around their desk. When this is all the stimulus your mind gets to experience, even a brief hip-shaking dance to “defiant jazz” with your evil manager can seem like a break from the drudgery and horror of endless toil. “Don’t live to work. Work to live” is the commercial slogan printed on Lumon’s severance chip. Lumon’s girlboss public spokesperson (Sydney Cole Alexander) describes severance as a way to put the “human first.” It’s a perverse interpretation of work-life balance. When newest Lumon trainee Helly (Britt Lower) is onboarded, we see the human sacrifices that make a life free of work troubles possible. After Helly undergoes severance, she wakes up on a conference table, not knowing where she is, or who she is. When she realizes that her life will now be spent endlessly toiling away on a computer, she has a reasonable response: “I quit. I don’t want to do the file-sorting thing or the never-seeing-the-sun thing.“ Mark tries to reassure her with the facts of their employment: “Every time you find yourself here, it’s because you chose to come back.” But Helly refuses to accept that this is her life, and sends many resignation requests to her outie. Helly’s refusal to work the job escalates to a point where innie Helly threatens to chop off her fingers with a paper cutter unless her outie lets her quit. Through a video message to innie Helly, her counterpart lays down the law of her existence. Outie Helly says she understands that her work self may be unhappy, but this is the lot she has been given. “I am a person. You are not. I make the decisions. You do not. And if you ever do anything to my fingers, know that I will keep you horribly alive to regret that,” outer Helly firmly and coolly continues. “Your resignation request is denied.” This is where the show succeeds at using Helly’s bizarre battle with herself to talk about a familiar work conundrum: What’s the ideal boundary to set between work and the rest of your life? It’s normal to act differently at your job than in the privacy of your home . Researchers call people who draw hard work-life boundaries “ extreme segmenters. ” Segmenters separate work and home through objects ― for example, by having separate calendars, uniforms or keys for each place or activity. Segmenters love ending the work day at the same time every day. “Integrators,” on the other hand, are workers, researchers find, that prefer for everything to be intertwined, and don’t need hard lines between where work starts and begins. Integrators don’t mind taking an hour break at lunch and then going back to work. The researchers on preferred work styles have found that no matter if you are an integrator or a segmenter, you still need recovery time. “Severance” shows the fallout of what happens when “extreme segmenters” get no breaks. To get true recovery from work, researchers find that you need detachment from the job, relaxation, time to gain a sense of mastery over a skill, or time to do what you will . The tragedy of each severed worker is that they get no time to recharge. Take Mark. During the weekends away from Lumon, he drinks and isolates himself from his loved ones, and that carries over to his work self. His body keeps score of what his mind is trying to forget. As ex-colleague Petey shares with outie Mark, he could always tell when Mark spent the morning before work crying: “You carry the hurt with you. You feel it down there too. You just don’t know what it is.“ The most horrific parts of “Severance” remind me of the film “ Sleep Dealer ,” which is also a dystopian workplace nightmare. “Sleep Dealer” follows a Mexican man named Memo who works a “node job” where employees have to get cyber implants. While his body is in stasis in a factory, Memo’s cyber arms virtually power robots constructing skyscrapers and robots mowing lawns in America. As one character in the film puts it, “We give the United States what they always wanted: All the work without the workers.” No spoilers for the “Severance” finale, but what this sci-fi thriller and films like “Sleep Dealer” do best is show the inhumanity of bosses forcing workers to do work without considering any of their human needs. Luckily, even when companies do their best to subjugate workers into compliance , there are still parts of humanity that will always rebel and harbor dreams of autonomy and true rest.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life In many workplaces, there’s an unspoken truth that who you know matters more than what you do when it comes to being successful. But in Netflix ’s racing reality show “ Formula 1: Drive To Survive ,” workplace politics is no unspoken secret. Don’t let the beautiful race backdrops of verdant Belgian hillsides and yachts in Monaco fool you: Formula 1 is a ruthless, hyper-competitive workplace. As someone who didn’t know anything about the sport before bingeing the show, I found it to be refreshingly direct in dispelling the myth that hard work speaks for itself . Working hard doesn’t automatically lead to success for drivers who are dealing with a poorly built car or a team that wants to replace them for someone more “sellable” to sponsors. This workplace is not a meritocracy; the more money a team has, the better its car will typically be, and the more likely it is to go faster. “Cash is king,” says seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton , the sport’s most famous face, in one episode. In Formula 1 these days, it’s totally common for a billionaire sponsor to sweep in and keep a team afloat in exchange for his son securing a spot as a driver. “ This is no magic, this sport,” says Guenther Steiner, team principal of the cash-strapped and perennial loser Haas team in one conversation. “This sport is hard work, fucking dedication, and money to keep it all going.” Steiner would know; in one memorable scene, he poses in front of toy boats and saunas for a brochure of one of Haas’ sponsors, the discount supermarket chain Aldi. “I’m not too proud to do these things,” he says. It’s true and hilarious. The Netflix series, which so far has covered seasons from 2018-2021 in four seasons of television, is so popular that viewership of F1 races in the U.S. spiked 41% in 2021. I can understand why. What makes Formula 1 an entertaining soap opera is the circus of team principals whose egos war with ambitious drivers and billionaire stakeholders. When asked by his pop star wife Geri Halliwell to name his favorite driver, Red Bull Racing boss Christian Horner answers, “Whoever is winning for us.” The drivers are the stars, but we also see polished public relations representatives looming over their charges, engineers trapped in tense meetings with team principals after a technical failure and pit crews gasping in horror when a car crashes. The show is not without faults. Red Bull driver Max Verstappen stopped participating after seeing early episodes, telling The Associated Press that the series has “faked a few rivalries which they don’t really exist.” And the show makes glaring omissions about sketchy sponsors and sexual harassment allegations . But overall, it’s a show that depicts messy interpersonal team dynamics in a unique way I have not seen anywhere else. You may not be in the driver’s seat of an expensive, elite Formula 1 car, but there are compelling management case studies we can all learn from. In F1, teams deal with constant reminders that they are only as good as their last race. In one brutal example, rising star Alex Albon replaces struggling Pierre Gasly in the Red Bull Racing team. A team photographer shows Albon a promo photo of Gasly in his Red Bull racing suit, telling Albon, “We just have to shoot you in a similar pose, because we’re going to remove that subject and put you in place.” It’s an oblique way of saying, “We’re Photoshopping out the guy being demoted and editing you in,” and a stark reminder of drivers’ replaceability. In this volatile environment, it’s no wonder that so many drivers buckle under the pressure. To feel psychologically safe at work, we have to feel free to speak up and share bad news without fear of blame. But most of us — including F1 drivers, who often blame things like bad weather and their engines for their poor performance — have what is known as “ fundamental attribution error ,” by which we minimize our own role in a failure and place outsized blame on external or situational factors. When we sidestep accountability, we prevent ourselves from learning. Some teams talk about addressing this. Mercedes’ team principal Toto Wolff says his organization has a “no-blame” culture and doesn’t point fingers when things go wrong, but as the team who has the world’s most-winning F1 driver in Hamilton, I was less than convinced by his pep talks. It’s much more interesting to watch the rallying tactics of teams that know they do not have competitive cars. Steiner, who greets perpetual failures with optimism, first curses and bluntly names what goes wrong. “ We look like a bunch of fucking wankers ,” he tells team owner Gene Haas after a poor outing. Meanwhile, Jost Capito, who becomes Williams Racing’s CEO in Season 4, shares that his team has to do a daily “walk of shame” past all the others because for each race, team hubs are assigned locations in order of success. “It’s physically painful to pass all the teams ahead of you. I told the team they have always to do the whole walk and stop at the point where they want to be next year,” Capito says. “Every single time you walk through the paddock, it gives you the pure reality check of where you are.“ The first step to learning from failure is to accept the reality of it happening. Time and time again, people call F1 a family, but these families frequently break up for business demands. Case in point: Haas drivers Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnusson. Steiner calls them part of the longstanding Haas “family” in an F1 media session in Season 3, but when money runs dry, he cuts them both for drivers that will bring more sponsorship money. It’s a reminder of how the bottom line ultimately determines who stays and who gets fired. Drivers with the pedigree of a famous or rich family have an advantage. In Season 3 of the show, Sergio “Checo” Pérez comes to the rude realization that he is being replaced on his current team for Sebastian Vettel, a previous world champion with a bigger name, even though Perez is having a career-best year and had a great job review. “I felt the decision had nothing to do with performance,” he says. In a good family, your inclusion is not conditional, but in a business, it can be. Of course, putting business moves before personal camaraderie goes both ways. In Season 3, Renault driver Daniel Ricciardo announces he’s signed up with Renault’s biggest competitor, McLaren, citing the realization he cannot win in a Renault if all cars finish a race. But Ricciardo still needs to finish the rest of the season with Renault before switching teams. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner likens the situation to a girlfriend staying in your house after a split. Renault team principal Cyril Abiteboul admits, “With the breakup, there was a period of time where we’ve not spoken ... I am emotional. I am not going to change what I am.” There is an awkward scene in the show where we watch the pair greet each other, but Abiteboul does not linger and keeps walking away. “Oh wow,” Ricciardo sighs after the frigid interaction with his boss. Eventually, Abiteboul and Ricciardo make up, and at the end of the season, Abiteboul gets a tattoo to fulfill a bet with Ricciardo. The work relationship is ultimately repaired, but it’s a lesson to bosses everywhere: Loyalty to a brand is conditional upon an employer’s performance, too. Formula 1 has 10 teams that each have two drivers responsible for bringing in points for the team based on how fast they finish. Yet despite this shared responsibility, it’s typical for an F1 driver to groan when their teammate is doing a good job, because it puts their own seat in jeopardy. When Ricciardo is the hot new driver on the Renault team in Season 2, he frankly states, “You don’t want your teammate to come in and ruin your career early ... There might always be a little threat whenever you have a new teammate.” Some drivers are more collegial to their teammates than others, but none of the drivers actively practice “Shine Theory,” a term coined by Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman . Shine theory is when professionals mutually invest in each other’s careers, even if they are technically competitors, because they do not see that person’s success as a personal threat. “Shine Theory is an investment, over the long term, in helping someone be their best self — and relying on their help in return,” as Friedman and Sow explain it on their website. “It is a conscious decision to bring your full self to your friendships, and to not let insecurity or envy ravage them.“ In Formula 1, team drivers pose united in front of cameras, but alone with the camera, they are frank about the threat they believe a successful teammate poses. There’s only so much they are willing to do to help a teammate do well on the track. In Season 4, Ricciardo is struggling on his new team at McLaren, and he is the one feeling threatened by a hot young driver. But his teammate Lando Norris has no sympathy for Daniel not being able to come to grips with the car. “What I said is the just the truth,” he says after an article is written about his lack of sympathy for Ricciardo’s struggles. “I don’t feel sympathy for him. Why should I? No driver on the grid would feel sympathy for another driver.” The tension between what’s good for driver’s careers and what’s good for a team’s championship chances guarantees dysfunctional work partnerships when teams are losing. But it certainly makes for great TV. By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life In the new FX series “ The Bear ,” there are no breaks. There are too many messes to clean up, too many crises to settle. The comedy-drama, now streaming on Hulu, centers on Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto, played by Jeremy Allen White, who inherits his late brother’s sandwich restaurant along with its skeptical employees, who are wary of change. He also inherits dirty floors, broken toilets, piles of unpaid bills and a $300,000 loan his uncle wants to collect. Carmy takes it all on to honor his brother’s memory, but he’s not exactly given a hero’s welcome. Although he’s an award-winning fine-dining chef, he has not earned the respect of his new staff. He gets hazed and his knives go missing; any attempts to change “the system” at the Original Beef of Chicagoland are met with displeasure. “Don’t mess up our place,” one employee warns him, while his own cousin Richie, a longtime manager who is resentful he did not inherit the Beef himself, tells him, “This is a delicate ecosystem.“ At the Beef, there is no time for Carmy to slowly build trust with staff and repair tensions. Lunch orders need to be served ASAP. It’s a world in which shouting is normal ― “Hands!” “Corner!” “Behind!” ― in the claustrophobically tight quarters of the kitchen. The Beef is a fictional restaurant, but the conundrums that come with being the new guard at an old establishment are universal problems. The show shines at unpacking these queasy tensions of workplace hierarchies. There are years of history built into the loaded glances and passive-aggressive comments about competence that Carmy and his employees trade. And with the high jinks and schemes it takes to win over customers and staff, “The Bear” makes what could be a stressful half hour funny and heartwarming, too. Everyone gets humbled. I laughed when prideful Richie has to cater a kiddie hot dog party with Carmy to pay back their uncle’s loan. Carmy announces to his staff that he knows exactly what a creaking sound in the bathroom means, and also gets a surprise spray of toilet water in his mouth. Refreshingly, “The Bear” does not focus on any romance, either at work or outside of it. We get limited information about who any of the chefs are when they punch out and go home. This is a show about the frenetic demands of working in a cash-strapped restaurant, trying to get orders out on time. It’s about navigating your colleagues’ fears and anxieties, and the care you can show co-workers, with whom you spend more time than your own family. Here are the most relatable work takeaways: In an attempt to bring order to the Beef’s chaos, Carmy enlists the help of his newest hire, Sydney, played wonderfully by Ayo Edebiri. Sydney is young and ambitious. She wants more work to do, but she doesn’t want to do the task Carmy asks of her ― leading a fine dining-style French “brigade” chain of command for each cook in the kitchen to follow. “It’ll create a toxic, hierarchal shit show,” Sydney warns. “With that type of system, I’d have less of a voice.” But Carmy says this is what’s necessary to change the Beef’s chemistry, and it’s what “real kitchens do.” The old guard is skeptical when told of the news. Ebra, one of the longtime staff members, says the division of labor is just a hierarchy. Sydney unconvincingly tries to frame it as “more like regular chill-archy... because I’m the sous, right? I just follow orders, even if it leads to tension and chaos and resentment, and ultimately doesn’t work.” Ultimately, it does turn out how Sydney predicted. Unwilling to take orders from a newcomer, the cooks make her chopped-up onions vanish and turn her burner up too high in acts of sabotage. Pissed off, Sydney declines their help to lift a vat of veal stock, and it spills everywhere. The spectacular failure of the brigade reminds me of the critical mistake a lot of first-time managers make : They try to do too much, too fast, to make their mark on an organization, without accounting for how staff feel about losing their predictable routines. To do our jobs well, we all need certainty about when things will occur and how we can prepare for future challenges, as illustrated in a behavioral model developed by the performance coach Paloma Medina. If Carmy really wanted his brigade to succeed, he would not have left it all up to Sydney to execute, as he later acknowledges in an apology. And he would have incorporated more staff input about what they most wanted changed in the first place. Throughout the series, Sydney and Carmy both allude to the toxic kitchen environments they’ve worked in and are trying to escape. “I think this place could be so different from all the other places we’ve been at,” Sydney tells her new boss. “I don’t want to be wasting my time working on another line or tweezing herbs on a dish, or running brunch, God forbid.” Carmy can relate. In one flashback, we see the tyrannical boss he worked under at a swanky New York City restaurant. This bad boss (played by Joel McHale) believes a pep talk consists of telling Carmy: “Why do you hire fucking idiots? Do you like working with fucking idiots? Say ‘Yes, Chef.’ ... You are bullshit. You are talentless ... You should be dead.” Compared to this kind of bad boss, Carmy’s tolerance of his staff’s outbursts and eccentricities seems downright kind. He calls every staff member “Chef” as a sign of respect, and frequently asks “Are you good?” if he notices someone buckling under pressure. But in the penultimate episode of the season, all of Carmy’s promises of being a better listener crumble on his own bad day. It’s a pile-on of errors: Sydney leaves the pre-order option on by accident, so they now need to fulfill orders of 255 beef sandwiches in eight minutes; pastry chef Marcus is so focused on making the perfect doughnut that he has not cut any cakes. Carmy blows up under the stress and yells at Sydney: “I told you to be more fucking ready!” He brings up past grievances and kicks her out of her station, becoming the bad boss he promised not to be. This, in turn, causes Sydney to yell at staff, too. “Hey, you don’t need to be screaming and shit. That’s not you,” one employee says to Sydney. “You know, maybe it is,” Sydney replies, mulishly. The toxic behavior spreads to the rest of the staff, and everyone is soon sniping at each other with sarcastic, mean comments. Research does show that if you are a bystander to rude behavior, you are more likely to become mean yourself . In a series of experiments , organizational management researchers found the more that people saw and were the victims of rudeness, the more likely they were to become rude and hostile themselves at work. Sydney becomes the bad boss Carmy once had when she stands beside Richie as he prepares giardiniera, a task she thinks she should be doing herself. Sydney goes beyond critiquing his vegetable prep, telling him: “I see you for the loser you fucking are. And everybody knows it ... Your daughter probably knows it.” The line is crossed, and now Sydney, who started the series as an ambitious, polite employee, has become an unforgivably mean boss under stress. At its best, “The Bear” acknowledges how weird and tense it can be to spend hours of your life each day in close proximity to people who are so different from you. It can be supremely awkward to apologize, and your grievances can get personal. But unlike at many toxic workplaces, the staff here do the work of learning to be better. After a cooling-off period, everyone at the Beef is willing to be accountable for their actions. Or as Carmy, Sydney and the rest of the Beef staff would say when giving their full attention to each other after a mess-up: “Heard, chef.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life As a job seeker, it is frustrating when your amazing résumé gets no responses. There are many reasons outside of your control as to why you’re hearing silence , but one clear reason might be because of your address. That’s because the address you list on your résumé –– or lack thereof –– can rule you out of contention before you have a chance to make your case to a hiring manager. Ashley Watkins Thomas , a job search coach, said that when she worked as a corporate recruiter for on-site jobs, her “spidey senses” would kick in when she saw résumés with no address listed at all. “When you intentionally leave pertinent information off of your documents, we know you’re hiding something,” Watkins Thomas said, noting that the missing information signals that you likely live out of town. “You’re saying that you live in Florida, yet your experience section says that you’re in Tennessee, so which is it?” she said recruiters will question. So the first mistake is thinking you can get away with listing no address for hybrid or fully onsite jobs. On the other hand, how you word your address can also be a dealbreaker for certain jobs. Here’s why: Jessica Hernandez , a career development coach with more than 10 years of human resources experience, said for remote jobs, “the only element that will matter is the country.” In those cases, you just need to clearly state that you’re based in the United States for a U.S.-based role, for example. But you will need to be more specific for hybrid or on-site jobs. Hernandez said the biggest résumé mistake she sees on listing an address is not including a local address when they’re open to relocating. “If a recruiter is looking for a local candidate and the person has an address that isn’t near the location, for instance ... then this candidate may be excluded from the search,” she said. “I’ve heard of many job seekers who struggle to relocate because their current address is on their résumé instead of the address for where they are relocating to.” To work around this, Hernandez recommends using the address of a friend or family member in the area where you hope to relocate. And if you do not have a trusted friend, “you can always get a UPS box at a local UPS store, and it will give an actual street address,” she advised. Watkins Thomas, however, said it is better to be transparent about where you live and to avoid using other people’s addresses. She said an employer could find out your location through a background check, and you will come across as “being dishonest.” Additionally, being upfront about where you live can make you eligible for potential relocation benefits, “because companies will make changes for who they want.” Recruiters often exclude candidates outside of a certain radius because the job requires local connections. They also might assume you will not be able to start working within a tight timeframe. To counter that, Watkins Thomas said job seekers can signal their readiness by including a sentence at the top of their résumé alongside contact information that says: “Willing to relocate by July 2024.” And you can reinforce this message with more details in your cover letter. One other big mistake is listing your full street address on job applications that do not require it. You typically just need a city, state, and zip code for recruiters doing location-based searches, experts said. With a full street address on a résumé, recruiters can make assumptions about your race and socioeconomic status, Watkins Thomas said. It’s OK to leave off your small town in favor of a more well-known metro region, though. Watkins Thomas said some of her clients in smaller towns have gotten callbacks after saying they live in the “Atlanta, Georgia, area,” for instance. Don’t give more than one address, though. Watkins Thomas said she commonly sees college students put both a permanent and current address, which she advises against doing. For one, it clutters your résumé, and “when things are cluttered, we’re more likely to skim over them and not pay any attention to them.” Additionally, it’s a signal that you are a new graduate entering the job market for the first time. “A lot of times, that’s a dead giveaway that you’re a college student,” Watkins Thomas said. “And you don’t want people focusing on the fact that you just graduated; let them focus on things like the value that you bring, the problems that you solve.” You can spend hours agonizing over the exact wording of your résumé, but Watkins Thomas said that candidates who need to relocate have a much stronger chance of getting interviewed if they network with people who can advocate on their behalf. “If it’s your target company, you should already be building those relationships and already having those conversations,” Watkins Thomas advised. In these informational interviews , you can ask them, “Are you familiar with the hiring manager and whether or not they have specific requirements about location?” “If you have someone on the inside who has some influence with the organization, they can vouch for you and say, ‘Hey, I’ve got this person here, they’re easy to relocate,’” Watkins Thomas said. “They can help tell that story for you and advocate for you versus you being just among the number of résumés received for a particular position.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Have you been told you are “too sensitive”? Do interruptions throw off your whole day? Can you instantly read the emotions in a room? There’s a name for what you might be: a “highly sensitive person,” or an HSP. It’s a personality trait that was first defined by psychologist Elaine Aron and was popularized by her 1996 book, “ The Highly Sensitive Person. ” If you’re an HSP, you have what is known as sensory processing sensitivity. Highly sensitive people are easily overstimulated and process information more deeply. Studies have found that it is a trait that evolved in humans and in other animals to notice environmental dangers others may miss. By Aron’s estimate, 15% to 20% of people in the world are highly sensitive. “Put very simply, it means that you have a more reactive nervous system,” said Melody Wilding , a licensed social worker and executive coach who identifies as an HSP. “Highly sensitive people will often say, ‘I feel everything more deeply. And I’m so much more aware and vigilant of other people’s behavior and emotions,’” Wilding explained. “Our brains are literally spending more time processing all of that information more deeply, too.” Being an HSP is going to affect all your relationships, including how you do your job. Here are some common ways it might show up at work: Alane Freund , a licensed marriage and family therapist and international consultant on HSPs, said highly sensitive people operate under a “do it once and do it right” mindset. “They’re more reflective and responsive to their environment. They pause before they react, and they process what they see before they act,” she said. “I won’t just give you my off-the-cuff initial response. When I give you a response or when I do a project, I’m going to do it really thoughtfully,” added Freund, who also identifies as an HSP. Wilding said that an HSP’s ability to think deeply can be a huge strength, but it can also be a challenge when it turns into “overanalyzing every little interaction or why someone used a period instead of an exclamation point.” “It can also be really hard for HSPs sometimes to be able to make a decision because they can see all the options and they can see the pluses and minuses of everything,” Wilding noted. Wilding said a lot of her HSP clients struggle with speaking up in meetings. Because HSPs have a highly reactive nervous system, they may freeze up in stressful group environments. Or they may doubt their own ideas because they do not hear anyone else noticing the same opportunities or risks that they see. But this does not need to be a challenge. Wilding said HSPs can lean into their strengths to ask a really thoughtful question or build on somebody else’s point: “Like, ‘Mark, that’s a great idea. I hadn’t considered that before. And I’d also like to add XYZ.’” An open-plan office can be an HSP’s nightmare. The noise, movement and distracting fluorescent lights can be “disturbing enough to make it really hard” for an HSP to concentrate, Freund said. Freund said she recommends that sensitive people find a way to help supervisors and co-workers understand “what it means to be highly sensitive.” That way you can get more leeway to say “Let me get back to you on that,” or you have the ability to work alone more. We all need breaks during hectic workdays. But when you are an HSP, you don’t just prefer downtime, you need it for your brain to function well. One 2021 study found that highly sensitive people’s brains showed enhanced connectivity even during a resting state after they’d completed a task. “In order for our brains to work their best, we need to do lots of micro-breaks throughout the day,” Freund said. For HSPs, she suggested short HSP naps , when you can elevate your legs and lie down with your eyes closed. That way you can block out some of what can be overstimulating you. HSPs benefit from work/life boundaries, so try taking a pit stop in nature on the way home if you’re expected to go straight from work to a draining family interaction. Or if you are at your desk, just briefly close your eyes to block out some of the distractions around you. “Even just 30 seconds of having your eyes closed at your desk helps bring more downtime,” Freund said. One of the strengths of HSPs is that they are conscientious, committed and “tend to be very loyal,” Wilding said. But these same strengths can be what holds HSPs back at work. Wilding said her desire to help others became a people-pleasing tendency, and it was her hardest challenge with being an HSP at work. That’s because HSPs have a highly attuned internal threat-detection system. An HSP may think, “If I say no to this, I’m going to be fired, this person is going to hate me. They’re going to think I’m lazy,” Wilding explained. “And so it can be really painful for HSPs to say no.” HSPs notice subtle cues and can show great empathy toward their colleagues, which is a great skill. That’s what makes HSPs good team members. But if you are taking on everybody else’s stresses and problems, it can also lead HSPs to burn out quickly, Wilding cautioned. “Sometimes we’re more invested. We want something more than other people want it for themselves.” Wilding said that she has had HSP clients who ran themselves into the ground, “trying to be the hero and the one taking care of everyone else around them.” If these signs are resonating with your experience, Aron has developed a test, which you can take here , to see if you are highly sensitive. There are also a few steps you can take to make your workday a little easier: When you’re an HSP, it helps if you can design your workday to honor the fact that your brain needs to process information deeply and that it can become easily stimulated. And if you’re a manager of an HSP, help them out by sending agendas out in advance and giving everyone more time to think before brainstorms or decisions. The manager of an HSP could signal this by saying, “I would love to hear from you all if you have some initial ideas now, but you’re also welcome to sit with this and follow up with me about whatever comes back to you,” Wilding suggested. And if you’re an HSP, it helps to plan to be at every scheduled event 30 minutes early. “You have a little extra time to rest, get your bearings, set your workstation up, that kind of thing,” Freund said. “Changed my life when I started doing that.” And if you don’t have that extra time, just mentally start prepping for that next event in your head. Being a HSP can have job challenges, but being highly perceptive can also be a competitive advantage at work. “I would often be able to sense that there was a change coming ... before it was publicly announced,” Wilding said. Freund said that when you are an HSP, you may be the one who can calm down a upset client or be the person who is really conscientious at making sure that all elements of a strategy are thought through. “Those are huge advantages that you bring to the table that other people may not have.” The empathy of HSPs, who are often driven by a need for fairness and justice, can also make them highly valued bridge-builders, Wilding said. “They tend to be good at brokering relationships across an organization,” she said. “Because we’re more attuned to people’s needs, pain points, motivations, that actually makes us really good persuaders and influencers.” So HSPs should take pride in their innate skills, because it is not a character defect. “There’s a lot of misconceptions around what it means to be sensitive,” Wilding added. “It’s just the way it is. ... It’s a part of your personality.“ Once you accept your HSP trait, you may find that there is a community that is waiting for you. “The more you talk about your trait, the more you’ll find your people, and the more other people will learn that it is simply a different way that your brain works,” Freund said. “It’s mostly a gift, so I think we need a little HSP pride.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer A little over a decade ago, I was a young mother sitting on a playground bench with a group of other women. As we watched our little ones climb and swing, the conversation centered around parenting — the healthiest ways to raise children, how to avoid pitfalls and so on. I listened intently, agreeing with many of the sentiments until one of the women said something that caught me off guard. “All I know is if a girl has daddy issues, she will always be fucked up,” the woman said. And with those words, I instantly went from feeling like I was one of them to feeling like an outsider. To my surprise, the comment was met with a robust amount of approval. Many shared how their positive experiences with their fathers had shaped them into the people they were today. The implication was clear: How could you be a good parent when you didn’t have a solid foundation of your own? What they clearly didn’t know was that sitting among them was a woman who, in their view, was destined to be defined by a relationship she had no control over. I sat silently, feeling increasingly ashamed of my own story and wondering: Could they be right? Was I really different from them? Would they be better parents simply because they’d had a strong bond with their fathers growing up while I did not? My father was an alcoholic and perpetual deadbeat dad, often absent but verbally abusive when he was present. Over the years, I have listened to variations of that conversation at the playground more times than I can count. The term “daddy issues” is often linked to the ideas of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. But the phrase itself is not a real medical term and is not recognized as an actual disorder. A quick Google search would lead you to believe otherwise, with countless articles bearing titles like “8 Signs You Have Daddy Issues” and “What Are ‘Daddy Issues’ and How Can You Recognize Them in a Partner?” Women who suffer from them are said to be clingy, jealous, possessive, promiscuous, emotional and needy, and to always get involved with the wrong partners. I will not deny that my father’s actions affected me. I developed trust issues, chronic insecurity and a penchant for self-destructive behavior, a few of the classic hallmarks attributed to girls who grow up with absent, abusive or neglectful fathers. When you are raised in an environment where love is laced with contingencies and judgment, it’s easy to fall into these patterns. At 19, I dropped out of college and moved across the country to live with my boyfriend. I thought I was running away from my traumatic childhood, but what I really did was run to a relationship that repeated what I had experienced with my father. My boyfriend often belittled me. When the relationship turned physically abusive, I thought my own deficiencies were the reason. I thought if only I were different, maybe he wouldn’t hurt me. That feeling stayed with me even after we broke up. I wondered if “daddy issues” would in some way always be a part of who I was. It was not until I experienced a healthy relationship with the man who eventually became my husband that I began to understand there was an alternative. I started to see that what was missing was not something in me, but in the quality of the love I was receiving. This shifted the way I saw myself, and helped me gain agency over my life and who I let into it. When I became a mother, it became even more important to heal the wounds from my past. Through therapy and my writing, I was able to attain a greater understanding of how my relationship with my father shaped me and, more importantly, to identify how I wanted to parent my own children differently, so they understood their worth. Now, as a 49-year-old woman who has been in a stable marriage for more than two decades and raised two healthy children, I know that the phrase “daddy issues” holds little meaning. What I wonder today is if I — the child of a strong, supportive single mother — had never heard the phrase, would I have seen myself differently? Would I have believed the truth — that my family was still whole and that I was, too? I no longer sit in silence when someone tosses out the phrase “daddy issues.” Now, I tell them my own story. When I choose to open up about my history, the question I am asked most often is, “How did you turn out so well?” The questions I have asked in return are: “Why are we judging women for being affected by men’s bad behavior? Rather than stereotyping those who had no control over their situations, shouldn’t we recognize and celebrate their power to change the narrative?” Any form of trauma, however challenging, offers the opportunity for growth, learning and ultimately becoming a stronger person. As a child, I was forced to navigate a landscape of potential land mines, and I have become an adult who can more easily spot them and deal with them when found. Instead of negatively affecting my parenting, my experiences make me more aware of and intentional in how I raise my own children. I have a greater sense of empathy. I have learned to use my imagination in a way that I never would have without the times in childhood when I dreamed of different circumstances. I have learned that I am not defined by an outdated, sexist and misdirected label. It seems more likely that the adults who cause so-called daddy issues are the ones who might never change. My father didn’t. But either way, it didn’t matter — because I could. Need help?

    "article_content": "ATHENS (AP) — The body of missing British TV presenter Michael Mosley was found on a Greek island Sunday morning after a days-long search, his family said. A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of an ongoing investigation, said a body was found on a rocky coast by a private boat and that formal identification was pending. Mosley’s wife said in a statement that her husband took the wrong route on a hike and collapsed in a place where his body couldn’t easily be seen. Mosley went missing on the island of Symi on Wednesday afternoon. “Michael was an adventurous man, it’s part of what made him so special,” Dr. Clare Bailey Mosley said. “It’s devastating to have lost Michael, my wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband. We had an incredibly lucky life together. We loved each other very much and were so happy together.” She thanked the people of the island of Symi, who she said worked tirelessly to find him. “Some of these people on the island, who hadn’t even heard of Michael, worked from dawn till dusk unasked,” she said. “My family and I have been hugely comforted by the outpouring of love from people from around the world. It’s clear that Michael meant a huge amount to so many of you.” Lefteris Papakalodoukas, the island’s mayor, told The Associated Press he was on the boat with members of the media representatives when they saw a body some 20 meters above the Agia Marina beach. “We zoomed with the cameras and saw it was him,” he said. The mayor said that Mosley appeared to have fallen down a steep, rocky slope, stopping against a fence and lying face-up with a few rocks on top of it. As police officers were retrieving Mosley’s body, one fell on the slope and had to be carried away on a stretcher, local media reported. The body will be taken to the nearby island of Rhodes for autopsy. Mosley, 67, was well-known in Britain for his regular appearances on television and radio and his column in the Daily Mail newspaper. He was known outside the U.K. for his 2013 book “The Fast Diet,” which he co-authored with journalist Mimi Spencer. The book proposed the so-called “5:2 diet,” which promised to help people lose weight quickly by minimizing their calorie intake two days a week while eating healthily on the other five. He subsequently introduced a rapid weight loss program and made a number of films about diet and exercise. Mosley often pushed his body to extreme lengths to see the effects of his diets and also lived with tapeworms in his guts for six weeks for the BBC documentary “Infested! Living With Parasites.” Mosley had four children with his wife Clare Bailey Mosley, who is also a doctor, author and health columnist. ___ Brian Melley contributed to this report from London.

    "article_content": "Reporter, HuffPost Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have agreed to a set of rules regarding their upcoming CNN debate , including allowing their microphones to be muted except when it is their turn to speak, the network said Saturday. The event, scheduled for June 27 at 9 p.m. Eastern time, will be the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle. CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash are set to moderate at the network’s Atlanta, Georgia, studios. The event will mark a departure from previous debates due to the lack of a studio audience; it is also the first time since the 1980s that the Commission on Presidential Debates will not be playing host . Although their podiums will be the same, a coin flip will determine at which position Trump and Biden will stand. Two commercial breaks will punctuate the 90-minute discussion between the Republican and Democrat, but campaign staffers are not allowed to interact with their candidate during those breaks. Each candidate will be given a bottle of water, a pad of paper and a pen — no prewritten notes or props are allowed. According to CNN, Tapper and Bash will “use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion.” To qualify for the debate, candidates need to secure at least 15% support in four separate national polls that meet CNN’s standards. The network noted that while it was still technically possible for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to qualify, this is unlikely to happen, particularly given how few states’ ballots he is expected to appear on. Over the last two presidential election cycles, Trump has repeatedly refused to keep his responses contained to the questions directed at him. His chaotic style appeared to encourage his GOP challengers to adopt similar techniques in the Republican debates held last fall , even in Trump’s absence. Biden was famously moved to protest Trump’s interruptions in a September 2020 presidential debate by saying, “ Will you shut up, man? ” Muting the candidates’ microphones will help viewers follow along (although we suppose a muted candidate could still shout while the other is speaking).

    "article_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — New leaders of The Washington Post are being haunted by their pasts, with ethical questions raised about their actions as journalists in London that illustrate very different press traditions in the United States and England. An extraordinary trio of stories over the weekend by The New York Times, NPR and the Post itself outline alleged involvement by Post publisher Will Lewis and Robert Winnett, his choice as a new editor, in wrongdoing involving London publications as much as two decades ago. The Post said on Monday that it had brought back its former senior managing editor to oversee the newspaper’s coverage of the matter. Lewis took over as publisher earlier this year, with a mandate to turn around the financially-troubled newspaper. He announced a reorganization earlier this month where the Post’s executive editor, Sally Buzbee, stepped down rather than accept a demotion. The coverage revealed Lewis’ sensitivity about questions involving his role in a phone hacking scandal that rocked the British press while he was working there. Lewis has maintained that he was brought in by Rupert Murdoch-owned newspapers to cooperate with authorities to clean up after the scandal. Plaintiffs in a civil case have charged him with destroying evidence, which he has denied. The public revelation of phone hacking in 2011 led to the closure of Rupert Murdoch’s News of the World tabloid and sparked a public inquiry into press practices that curbed some of the worst excesses. The British press has long been considered freewheeling in its pursuit of scoops, willing to tolerate behavior frowned upon by its American counterparts. For example, when Lewis and Winnett worked at The Daily Telegraph in 2009, they cooperated on stories about politicians’ extravagant expense-account spending. They paid for data that revealed the spending, a reporting practice that would be considered a substantial ethical breach in the U.S. The Times reported on Saturday that both Lewis and Winnett worked on stories in the 2000s that appeared to be based on fraudulently obtained phone and business records. Both the Times and Post reported on a 2002 story article about British politicians who had sought to buy a Mercedes-Benz vehicle described as the “Nazi’s favorite limousine,” based on information obtained by an actor who had faked a German accent to call a manufacturer who gave it to him. The Post story delved into Winnett’s relationship with John Ford, the actor whose “clandestine efforts” helped uncover stories that included private financial dealings by former Prime Minister Tony Blair. He was allegedly adept in “blagging,” in which a person misrepresents themselves to persuade others to reveal confidential information. That’s illegal under British law unless it can be shown the actions benefit the public. Headlined “Incoming Post editor tied to self-described ‘thief’ who claimed role in his reporting,” it was among the newspaper’s most popular stories on Monday. Winnett was chosen by Lewis to take over the Post’s main newsroom after the presidential election. It was an unusually harsh story for a news organization to write about its own leadership. In announcing that Cameron Barr, who left his position last year, would supervise the reporting, the Post said that “the publisher has no involvement or influence on our reporting.” Other editors, including Buzbee’s temporary replacement Matt Murray, will also look over stories produced by the media team. NPR’s story details several of these issues, along with Winnett’s supervision — when he worked at the Sunday Times in London — of a reporter, Claire Newell, who was hired as a temporary secretary in the U.K. Cabinet office, giving her access to sensitive documents that made their way back to the newspaper. The Post said Lewis declined comment on the stories. Winnett, a deputy editor at the Telegraph in London, did not comment on the three most recent stories, and a message to the newspaper by The Associated Press was not immediately returned on Monday. Similarly silent: Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of the Post, who will ultimately decide whether this is a public relations and internal morale storm that he and the institution can weather. Not everyone is sure that he can, or should. “The Washington Post is a great, great, great paper, and its greatness pushes the rest of us in the media world to do a better job,” New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote on X Monday. “Yet its leadership is now tainted in ways that are unrecoverable; time won’t heal the injury but let it fester.” Lewis, a former publisher of The Wall Street Journal who is also vice chairman of the board at The Associated Press, has spent the past week trying to assure Post staff members that he understands and will live up to the ethical standards of American journalism. ___ Associated Press correspondent Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost A freelance photojournalist who lost her eye when police shot her with a foam bullet in 2020 is now receiving end-of-life care as a result of that injury. A professional journalism organization shared this week. Linda Tirado, 42, “is at life’s end and receiving palliative care,” the National Press Club said in a release , because the strike to her face also caused a traumatic brain injury and corresponding dementia. Police struck her with the supposedly “non-lethal” bullet while she was covering the 2020 anti-racism protests in Minneapolis following the police murder of George Floyd. “Tirado took all precautions trying to hold the line where police instructed, wearing protective goggles and mask against tear gas, which filled the air,” Emily Wilkins, president of the National Press Club, said. “During the chaotic action, officers aimed a gun firing ‘non-lethal’ foam plastic bullets at journalists including Tirado. The projectiles struck several journalists. Tirado was hit in the eye despite her protective goggles. She lost the eye.” Over the past four years, the mother of two’s condition has worsened and is expected to soon result in her death, the organization said. The Minneapolis Police Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tirado’s condition. When the shooting drew worldwide media attention in 2020, the photojournalist called on the people outraged on her behalf to turn their ire toward the systemic racism she was covering when police shot her. “I will not regain sight in my left eye. I will need more surgeries. But I have not been crying for my lost vision; rather, it feels as though my body is reacting to what is happening to my country,” she wrote for The New Republic . “I have lost half of my vision, but I lack no clarity: There can be no peace without justice, and no justice without full-throated, damningly righteous anger,” she continued. “I am asked over and over again why are people burning and looting, and I wonder what anyone thinks they would do if they spent their whole lives being told they were lesser than and not equal, and then one day they woke up to a police state.” Tirado also contributed to HuffPost in 2013 and 2014. A piece she wrote entitled “ This Is Why Poor People’s Bad Decisions Make Perfect Sense ” went viral, and the discussion it sparked about poverty and pregnancy remains relevant today as GOP lawmakers slash access to reproductive care and skewer women’s decision-making. In a follow-up piece, she referred to herself as “the woman who accidentally explained poverty to the nation.” The National Press Club honored Tirado with its John Aubuchon Press Freedom Award in 2020 following her shooting. A $600,000 settlement she received from the Minneapolis Police Department was largely absorbed by her medical bills, which continue to accrue, the National Press Club said, and her inability to work or earn an income following the shooting has put immense financial pressure on her family.

    "article_content": "Reporter, HuffPost Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said it was “undemocratic, un-American and cowardly” for CNN to announce, as it did Thursday, that he had not made the cut to join President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in next week’s debate. Kennedy said in a statement Thursday that it was illegal for CNN to exclude him. “CNN, and every member of CNN who is participating in planning, executing, and holding this debate, is at risk of prosecution, as happened to Michael Cohen, for violating campaign finance laws,” Kennedy was quoted as saying in a statement released by his campaign. “This risk is now acute given that any further violation would be knowing and willful, and thus could carry with it serious jail time.” Asked for comment, a CNN representative directed HuffPost to its reporting detailing the event’s requirements, which were first laid out in mid-May. Kennedy did not meet the requirements because he had not received at least 15% support in at least four different qualifying polls and has fallen far short of securing his name on enough state ballots to ensure it would be possible for him to earn 270 electoral college votes — the amount needed to win the presidency. Trump and Biden are expected to square off at 9 p.m. EDT June 27 on the debate stage. “Presidents Biden and Trump do not want me on the debate stage and CNN illegally agreed to their demand,” Kennedy said in the statement. He added: “Americans want an independent leader who will break apart the two-party duopoly. They want a President who will heal the divide, restore the middle class, unwind the war machine, and end the chronic disease epidemic.” Kennedy is a known conspiracy theorist who has spent many years spreading fear and distrust of vaccines , including the false idea that vaccines cause autism. So far, his name appears on the ballot in Delaware, Michigan, Oklahoma and Utah, with likely appearances in California and Hawaii, according to a Washington Post survey of all 50 states. That amounts to 100 electoral votes. Kennedy’s campaign argues that CNN is being unfair by holding him to the ballot requirements but “not requiring Presidents Biden and Trump to meet this requirement by claiming they are each the ‘presumptive nominee’ of a political party.” Biden and Trump are the presumptive nominees of their parties, however, and are expected to appear on ballots nationwide. They also dominate presidential polling. The Kennedy campaign said it plans to “pursue this issue for as long as it takes to obtain justice against these illegal acts.” His campaign filed a complaint on May 28 with the Federal Election Commission.

    "article_content": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost NEW YORK — Making Mexico pay for a border wall, creating a “big, beautiful healthcare plan” to replace Obamacare, balancing the federal budget and avoiding Minnesota if he lost the 2020 election have new company on the lengthy list of broken Donald Trump promises: his vow to testify in his New York City hush money trial . Despite repeated pledges to take the witness stand to proclaim his innocence, Trump had his lawyers rest their case Tuesday after calling only two witnesses, neither of them the coup-attempting former president. Trump refused to answer shouted questions as to why he didn’t testify as he left the lower Manhattan courtroom after the brief morning session. In recent months, he has on many occasions said he was eager to tell his side of the story in the business records falsification case that could send him to prison for as long as four years. “Yeah, I would testify, absolutely,” he told reporters just three days before the trial began five weeks ago. “I’m testifying. I tell the truth, I mean, all I can do is tell the truth.” Even his lawyers suggested it was possible Trump could testify — last week, Todd Blanche told Judge Juan Merchan it was a decision that had not yet been made — before essentially admitting Monday in open court that it would not happen. Legal experts and observers, of course, said they were not in the least surprised that testimony ended without hearing from Trump. “He was never going to testify,” said Ty Cobb, a former top lawyer in the White House when it was under Trump and who is now a Trump critic. “If he had taken the stand, they would have cross-examined him for three days with every lie he has told about E. Jean Carroll, maybe January 6th, the classified documents, Stormy ― does Stormy, a ... porn star, pole dancer really remind you of your own daughter ― McDougal, his real estate tax fraud cases, his taxes and more to show he is a darker version of Michael Cohen.” Cohen is Trump’s former lawyer and fixer who ended up in prison in part because of his involvement in a payoff to Stormy Daniels. Daniels is the adult film actor and director who testified she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and received $130,000 from Cohen to remain quiet about it in the days leading up to the 2016 election. McDougal is the former Playboy model who received $150,000 from American Media Inc. not to reveal the affair she claimed she had with Trump. Carroll is the writer whom Trump owes $88 million to after a federal jury found he sexually abused her and then defamed her. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts against him and denied having had sex with either Daniels or McDougal. Cobb said that had he been the prosecutor doing Trump’s cross-examination, he would not only have poked holes in Trump’s version of what happened but also made sure the jury understood what a prodigious liar Trump is. “Credibility is always relevant and no one is more exposed on that point than Trump,” Cobb said. “It would have been glorious. Alternating gusts of incoherence, egoism, anger, insolence and prevarication,” said Mac Stipanovich, a lawyer and longtime Republican political consultant in Florida. He added that he would have had a field day as the prosecutor doing Trump’s cross-examination. “I would have goaded him about the tawdry details of the Stormy Daniels encounter, his business practices, his relationship with Cohen, and then just stepped back and let him go,” Stipanovich said. “Whenever he slowed down, I would goad him again.” An informal adviser to Trump said the feeling that Cohen did poorly under cross-examination last week led to Trump’s ultimate decision not to take the stand. “I think he really wanted to until Cohen crashed,” the adviser said on condition of anonymity. The adviser also conceded it would not have been in Trump’s best interests, saying, “It would have been crazy for him to.” One former Trump White House lawyer with experience practicing criminal law who remains sympathetic to Trump agreed that having a defendant testify is always risky — particularly one as undisciplined as Trump. “A big risk,” he said on condition of anonymity, explaining that even a small misstep can lead to answering all kinds of damaging questions on cross-examination. “You say the wrong thing or say it in the wrong way, and the prosecution can say, ‘Judge, he opened the door.’” The prosecution in Trump’s case wrapped up on Monday afternoon. Trump’s defense finished Tuesday morning, and Merchan spent the afternoon working with both sides to hash out what instructions he would give to the jury. Closing arguments are scheduled to take place on May 28, the day after the long Memorial Day weekend. If Trump winds up regretting his decision not to testify, though, he may have at least three more chances to do so in other trials. Trump is facing federal charges in Washington, D.C., based on his actions leading up to his Jan. 6 coup attempt and in South Florida for his refusal to turn over top secret documents he took with him to his Palm Beach country club upon leaving the White House. He also faces felony charges in Georgia for his attempts to overturn his election loss there. If convicted in any of the other jurisdictions on these charges, he could receive decades in prison.

    "article_content": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost NEW YORK — Donald Trump , who is accused of dozens of felonies and literally salutes violent rioters who assaulted police officers, has nevertheless been treated like a hero by New York City police officers during his criminal trial — possibly because many are unaware of his pledge to pardon those who attacked officers during his Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt. “That’s news to me,” said one on a lower Manhattan street corner that the former president’s motorcade had just driven past. “I had not heard that,” said another near the parked black shuttle buses that have been ferrying Trump’s congressional supporters — who attack the trial judge and district attorney on his behalf — to and from Trump Tower. In fact, of two dozen New York City police officers interviewed by HuffPost within a few blocks of the Centre Street courthouse where a jury will soon decide his fate, only one said he knew that Trump routinely honors the Jan. 6 police-assaulters and plans to pardon them. “I don’t think that should happen,” said the officer who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to talk to the press while in uniform and on duty. “I think that sets a bad example. If you do a crime, you should be held accountable for it.” At his rallies, the former and would-be future president stands at attention and even salutes while a recording of the national anthem, sung by Jan. 6 jail detainees who violently assaulted police on that day, is played over the loudspeakers. In speech after speech, he has called those accused and, in many cases, convicted of felonies “ hostages ” and “ political prisoners ,” and has vowed to grant them pardons if he is elected. Trump, who faces 88 felony charges himself, throughout his criminal trial has been treated like a celebrity by New York City police officers, nonetheless. Video from April 16, for example, shows him shaking hands and taking photos with a group of officers outside a campaign stop following that day’s court proceedings. “That’s not the police officers’ initiative. That’s him wanting to shake hands,” said one officer last week, adding that he also did not know about Trump’s promise to pardon those who had assaulted his fellow officers. “I don’t know anything about that.” The New York Police Department did not respond to HuffPost queries about officers’ interactions with an accused criminal currently on trial, particularly one who promises to pardon those convicted of assaulting police officers. The city’s Police Benevolent Association, which endorsed Trump in 2020, also did not respond to HuffPost queries on those same topics. The group typically issues fiery responses when someone accused of assaulting an officer is not kept in jail pending trial or is otherwise treated leniently. “Criminals who assault police officers are seeing no jail time,” the union wrote in a Jan. 3 press release earlier this year. A month later, upon the announcement of additional indictments against gang members who had attacked officers in Times Square in late January, the union said : “They should be in jail. We won’t call it justice until they are all behind bars.” The group’s website does not indicate whether the union has condemned Trump for his stance on those who assaulted police on Jan. 6. It also did not issue a statement condemning the Jan. 6 rioters whose actions injured 140 police officers and led to the deaths of five in the following days and months. The union’s then-president did criticize the mob two days later but, notably, did not criticize Trump for having instigated the attack. Trump’s reception from police officers in New York is similar to the one he gets from officers around the country. He typically has a line of officers willing to shake his hand and be photographed with him when he boards his plane after a campaign visit. The Trump campaign has over a period of many months never responded to HuffPost questions about his praise for and promises to pardon Jan. 6 rioters who assaulted police, and did not respond this time, either. The affinity of many police officers for Trump, despite Jan. 6 and despite all the charges he faces, does not surprise Zachary Carter, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn who more recently led New York City’s legal office. “He gives cops permission to give in to their worst impulses,” Carter said of Trump, recalling a speech in which Trump told police they didn’t need to be so careful about preventing head injuries to people they arrest as they put them in the back seat of their cruisers. “Is there a certain kind of cop receptive to someone who gives out that signal? Yes.” Carter said Trump also enjoys the sort of admiration some people have for members of the Mafia. “Organized crime figures have a cult following. Even people in law enforcement are drawn to it,” he said. Trump is currently on trial on charges that he falsified business records to hide a $130,000 hush payment to a porn star to keep her claim about a sexual encounter with him from coming out before the 2016 election. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday morning, with the jury set to receive the case for deliberations after that. If convicted, Trump could receive up to four years in prison. Trump is also facing prosecutions in three other jurisdictions. A federal indictment in Washington, D.C., and a state court indictment in Georgia are both based on his actions leading up to his coup attempt. A second federal indictment in South Florida is based on his refusal to turn over secret documents he took with him to his Palm Beach country club when he left the White House. If convicted on the more serious charges in these cases, he could receive decades in prison. Despite all these cases, though, Trump was overwhelmingly chosen by Republican primary voters as their presidential nominee for November.

    "article_content": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― President Joe Biden on Tuesday cracked down on illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, potentially defusing one of his weakest political issues heading into November’s election. The executive order he signed suspends the processing of asylum claims for most migrants encountered along the border between official ports of entry after the daily number of such encounters hits 2,500. The order does not affect people entering at official crossings who have sought permission using the authorized Customs and Border Protection mobile app, and creates exceptions for unaccompanied children, victims of trafficking and people fearing torture. “ Republicans have left me no choice,” Biden said in brief remarks from the White House Tuesday afternoon, blaming congressional Republicans for refusing to pass a bipartisan deal put forward earlier this year. “I’m moving past Republican obstruction and using the executive authorities available to me as president to do what I can on my own to address the border.” It’s unclear, though, whether Biden’s action will improve his standing with voters who view illegal immigration as a top issue. “He already has a failing grade from voters on immigration,” said GOP pollster Neil Newhouse. “This is akin to closing the barn door after the horses have already gone out. Too little, too late.” It’s also unclear whether Biden has the legal authority to impose such rules by executive order alone, rather than through legislation approved by Congress. Advocates for migrants are promising legal action to block enforcement of the order ― just as they successfully did when former President Donald Trump tried to take similar but far more drastic action on his own. The American Civil Liberties Union said Tuesday it would sue. Seeking asylum under threat of violence or persecution is a right under international law and is codified in U.S. law. But the large number of migrants who have been entering the United States after Biden undid many of the anti-immigration policies adopted by Trump has alarmed even many Democrats . Critics argue that people coming primarily for economic reasons are simply claiming asylum because they understand that the legal process to adjudicate their claim would take years, during which time they could live and work in the United States. Earlier this year, Biden’s staff helped negotiate bipartisan legislation supported by a number of Senate Republicans that would have applied stricter rules for claiming asylum, as well as increased funding for Border Patrol staff and other enforcement agencies. That compromise bill, though, stalled indefinitely after Trump instructed congressional Republicans not to pass it because it would help Biden’s reelection effort as Trump tries to win the White House back. “Why? Because Donald Trump told them to,” Biden said Tuesday. “It was an extremely cynical political move.” Trump, who attempted a coup to remain in power after losing to Biden in 2020 and is now a convicted felon on charges based on his actions ahead of the 2016 election, has long been attacking Biden on immigration. On Tuesday, just minutes before Biden spoke, Trump’s campaign staged a call for reporters with his immigration advisers. “This is a pro-invasion executive order,” said Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s policy to separate children from their parents at the border as a way to deter families from trying to come. “The only reason they’re doing this is because of the election,” said Tom Homan, who was acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump. “We handed him the most secure border in my 34-year career, and he unsecured it on purpose.” Biden in his remarks attacked Trump’s tactics and generally anti-immigrant policies. “I believe immigration has always been the lifeblood of America. We’re constantly renewed by an infusion of people and new talent. The Statue of Liberty is not some relic of American history,” he said. “I will never demonize immigrants. I will never refer to immigrants as ‘poisoning the blood of our country.’ I will never separate children from their families at the border. I will not ban people because of their religious beliefs.” But Biden said that the flow of migrants had to be controlled because the country’s capacity to absorb them is not infinite. “The simple truth is, there is a worldwide migrant crisis,” he said. “If the United States doesn’t secure our border, there is no limit to the number of people who might try to come here, because there’s no better place on the planet than the United States of America.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday urged Americans to honor the Army Rangers who turned the tide of World War II by scaling the steep cliffs of Pointe du Hoc in France by doing their part to preserve democracy against aggression from both abroad “and at home.” “They fought to vanquish a hateful ideology in the ’30s and ’40s,” Biden said at the iconic monument atop the windswept promontory overlooking the English Channel in Normandy. “Does anyone doubt they wouldn’t move heaven and earth to vanquish hateful ideologies of today? These Rangers put mission and country above themselves. Does anyone believe they would exact any less from every American today?” Biden never mentioned his coup-attempting predecessor, Donald Trump , by name in the 11-minute speech, but has spent the last year warning that the now-convicted felon is promising to rule as an autocrat if he wins back the White House in November. Biden’s speech at Pointe du Hoc mirrors the one given by then-President Ronald Reagan from that same site in 1984, at the 40th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of the French coast that began the process of liberating Western Europe from Nazi Germany. Like Reagan four decades earlier, Biden recounted the assault on the cliffs mounted by 225 U.S. Army soldiers from the 2nd Ranger Battalion as they landed on the beach with the assignment of taking out the long-range German artillery at the top that threatened the thousands of Allied ships taking part in the assault. “They launched their ladders, their ropes and grappling hooks, and they began to climb. When the Nazis cut their ladders, the Rangers used the ropes. When the Nazis cut the ropes, the Rangers used their hands. And inch by inch, foot by foot, yard by yard, the Rangers clawed ― literally clawed ― their way up this mighty precipice until at last they reached the top,” Biden said. “One thought comes to mind: My God. My God. How did they do it?” But while Reagan’s warnings about freedom and democracy in 1984 focused on the then-Soviet Union and its decades-long grip on Eastern Europe, Biden’s warning was largely centered on something unimaginable four decades ago: a threat from within. Biden pointed out that he is the first president to go to Pointe du Hoc when none of the surviving Rangers from the assault is still alive, and he asked Americans to honor their spirit. “So listen to the echoes of their voices to hear them, because they are summoning us and they’re summoning us now,” he said. “They’re not asking us to scale these cliffs, but they’re asking us to stay true to what America stands for.” He urged Americans to remember the sacrifices made to preserve democracy by resisting the call to abandon those ideals. “The most natural instinct is to walk away, to be selfish, to force our will upon others, to seize power and never give up,” he said. “To come here simply to remember the ghosts of Pointe du Hoc isn’t enough. We need to hear them. We have to listen to them. ... We need to make a solemn vow to never let them down.” Trump became the first president in U.S. history to refuse to hand over power peacefully after losing an election, instead attempting a coup to remain in office. That culminated in the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, a last-ditch effort to coerce Trump’s own vice president, Mike Pence , and Congress into awarding Trump a second term. One hundred and forty police officers were injured in the hourslong assault. One died hours later and four others died by suicide in the following weeks. Trump faces federal and Georgia state indictments based on his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, as well as an unrelated federal indictment because of his refusal to turn over secret documents he took with him to his South Florida country club when he left the White House. Late last month, a New York state jury convicted him on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment to a porn actor to keep her story from hurting his 2016 presidential campaign. Despite all this, Trump is expected to be officially nominated as the Republican presidential candidate for the November election at the party’s convention next month in Milwaukee.

    "article_content": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost President Joe Biden on Sunday is set to visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, the burial place for 1,800 U.S. Marines, whom Donald Trump famously called “suckers” and “losers” and had refused to honor with a visit in 2018 because it had been raining. Trump, president at the time, had been scheduled to visit the cemetery about 60 miles from Paris but canceled because of the rain. He told his then-chief of staff John Kelly: “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” Later on the same trip, he called servicemembers who died for their country “suckers.” Kelly, a retired Marine general whose son, also a Marine, died in Afghanistan, went to the cemetery in Trump’s place. Photos from the visit show no rain falling as he walked amid the gravestones. It’s unclear whether Biden will mention Trump’s failure to pay his respects at the cemetery, which largely holds the remains of Marines and Army soldiers killed in the key World War I Battle of Belleau Wood, during Biden’s own visit there Sunday. The president has been in France since Wednesday for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion in Normandy that brought on the collapse of Nazi Germany. Still, Biden has been using Trump’s “suckers” and “losers” comments against the coup -attempting former president now for months in campaign appearances, arguing that a person who believes such a thing has no business being commander-in-chief. On Jan. 5, in remarks marking the third anniversary of the Capitol insurrection, Biden said of Trump’s insults: “How dare he? Who in God’s name does he think he is?” “They asked him to go visit American gravesites. He said ‘no.’ He wouldn’t do it. Because they were all ‘suckers’ and ‘losers,’” Biden said four months later, in a speech in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. “I’m not making that up.” And at a fundraiser in Connecticut last week : “He said they’re ‘losers’ and ‘suckers.’ ‘Losers’ and ‘suckers.’ Who in the hell does he think he is? This guy does not deserve to be president, whether or not I was running.” Trump campaign officials did not respond to HuffPost queries about Biden’s planned visit. Trump, for his part, appears to have clearly understood from the outset how damaging his disrespect for American service members could be for him. Two days after refusing to visit Aisne-Marne, Trump was posting on social media that he wanted to go but just couldn’t. “By the way, when the helicopter couldn’t fly to the first cemetery in France because of almost zero visibility, I suggested driving. Secret Service said NO, too far from airport & big Paris shutdown,” he first wrote on Nov. 12, 2018, repeating the false story that his press staff had been putting out. In fact, the Marine 1 helicopter, a Sikorsky VH-3D, can fly in precipitation, and on multiple occasions carried Trump through light rain and drizzle from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland back to the White House. Further, Secret Service advance teams always make contingency travel plans for bad weather. During the 2018 Armistice Day events marking the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, both French President Emmanuel Macron and then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel traveled to Compiègne — just as far from Paris as Aisne-Marne — for a ceremony there that same afternoon while Trump remained indoors at the U.S. ambassador’s residence in Paris, tweeting. Following critical news coverage of the canceled Aisne-Marne trip, though, Trump visited the American military cemetery in Suresnes, on the outskirts of Paris, just before leaving France to head back to Washington, D.C. And two years later, when the Atlantic published its account of the true reason for skipping Aisne-Marne — including Trump’s “suckers” and “losers” comments, descriptions of which it attributed to unnamed sources — Trump emerged from Air Force 1 after a campaign trip and raged about it to traveling reporters for seven minutes, claiming the article was a complete fabrication. “If they really exist, if people really exist that would have said that, they’re low-lifes and they’re liars. And I would be willing to swear on anything that I never said that about our fallen heroes. There is nobody that respects them more,” Trump said on the Andrews tarmac. Kelly last year publicly stated that the Trump quotes were accurate. Trump late last month became the first former president to become a convicted felon after a New York state jury found him guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in order to hide a hush money payment to a porn actor, which was meant to keep her story from hurting his 2016 presidential campaign. Separately, he faces both a federal and Georgia state indictment for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, including his actions leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his followers – actions that, had they succeeded, could have effectively ended American democracy. He also faces a second federal indictment for refusing to turn over secret documents he took with him to his South Florida country club upon leaving the White House. Notwithstanding the criminal conviction and the outstanding felony charges against him, Trump is set to be nominated as the Republican presidential nominee next month in Milwaukee.

    "article_content": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost WASHINGTON ― Eight years after a credible effort to dump Donald Trump as their presidential nominee because of his vulgarity, Republicans today appear stuck with the newly convicted felon for November, with no realistic means of taking the nomination away from him at their convention next month, even if they wanted to. “There will be no move to, no mechanism for and no interest in removing Trump at the convention,” said Richard Porter, a Republican National Committee member from Illinois. To Fergus Cullen, a former RNC member as a onetime chair of the state party in New Hampshire, the key element of that analysis is “no interest in.” “The residents of Jonestown chose suicide rather than leave,” he said, likening Trump to the infamous cult leader Jim Jones. “He has a death grip on the RNC and the delegates. Even if polls showed him losing 65-35, they would choose to go down with him.” Trump campaign officials did not respond to HuffPost queries. Republicans who vocally opposed the coup-attempting former president as the 2024 nominee often mentioned that his various criminal cases could put the party in the position of having a convicted felon at the top of the ticket on Nov. 5. Not only has that warning come to pass, but there also is now the possibility that their nominee could even be staring down an actual jail sentence when RNC members and delegates meet in Milwaukee next month for the Republican National Convention. The judge in Trump’s New York criminal case, Juan Merchan, has scheduled sentencing for July 11, just four days before the convention begins, after a jury convicted him on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in an attempt to hide a hush-money payment to a porn actor to prevent her story from hurting his 2016 campaign. Though Trump could receive probation as a first-time offender, his decision to go to trial rather than plead guilty and his continuing lack of remorse could result in a stretch behind bars, legal experts said, although Merchan is likely to allow him to remain free until his appeal of the May 30 verdict is decided. But within the Republican National Committee, which, like other groups allied with Trump, has taken to calling all prosecutions against him politically motivated “witch hunts,” even the prospect of a nominee facing incarceration is not sparking any effort to depose him. “Even if there was such a movement, and I have not seen such, most all delegations are bound by state law on one or more ballots at this stage of the process,” said Ohio RNC member Jim Dicke. Most state parties and some state laws do, in fact, require that delegates at the national party convention vote for the candidate who won their state or congressional district, at least for the first ballot or two. Nevertheless, the Republican Party is a private entity that can change its own rules at it sees fit. “I suppose that the Convention Rules Committee could propose a new rule that would release all delegates, but that seems unlikely,” Oscar Brock, an RNC member from Tennessee. “The Trump campaign will have practical control of the Rules Committee.” After his election in 2016, Trump and his allies made sure that people personally loyal to Trump moved into party slots at the local, state and national levels. Similarly, grassroots-level Republicans attending the party convention this summer are overwhelmingly loyal to Trump. The situation was almost exactly the opposite in 2016, after Trump unexpectedly defeated 16 more established Republican candidates for the nomination despite a background as a New York City developer and a “reality” TV game show host with no political experience. Almost none of the 168 members of the Republican National Committee were personally loyal to Trump that year. Nor were a majority of convention delegates, most of whom were decades-long activists in Republican politics. Republicans who disliked and distrusted Trump ― primarily religious conservatives and abortion opponents ― believed that they could persuade enough RNC members and convention delegates to change the party’s rules to permit delegates to vote according to their conscience rather than mirroring how primary voters in their state had voted earlier that year. That effort led to Sen. Mike Lee of Utah urging Rules Committee members to “unbind” the delegates so they could vote against Trump. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the 2016 primary candidate whom Lee and other anti-Trump Republicans were hoping to nominate instead, in his convention speech never endorsed Trump. Instead, he told delegates and Americans in general to vote “your conscience.” But party leaders, including then-chairman Reince Priebus, decided that jettisoning Trump would enrage his supporters, leading to huge losses that November for Senate, congressional and state legislative races. Kendal Unruh, the founder of the “Free the Delegates” group that lost its convention floor fight to replace Trump, said the party is now basically Donald Trump’s party. “The delegates elected this time to the Republican National Convention were rock-solid Trump supporters who will never waver from their support,” she said. “In 2016, we stood a good chance because enough of the delegates truly did not want Trump and wanted another option.” Three years before Trump became the first former president in American history to be convicted of a crime, he became the first president to refuse to hand over power peacefully after losing reelection. Instead, he falsely claimed the election had been “stolen” from him and tried to overturn the results, which would have effectively ended American democracy, by coercing his own vice president and Congress to award him a second term. Trump faces two criminal indictments based on that Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt and his actions in the preceding weeks. One indictment is federal and one is a state case in Georgia. He is under a second federal indictment for his refusal to turn over secret documents he took with him to his South Florida country club upon leaving the White House. He is unlikely to go to trial on any of the other three cases before the November election thanks to his legal maneuvers to delay proceedings. However, the federal Jan. 6 case could result in an evidentiary hearing this summer or fall featuring a string of his top aides and former aides publicly testifying about his actions leading up to Jan. 6 and on the day his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. Whether that evidentiary hearing might happen depends on the Supreme Court’s decision on Trump’s claim that he cannot be prosecuted for his coup attempt because it was an official action he took while president, making him immune.

    "article_content": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden abruptly altered his schedule Tuesday afternoon to head home to Wilmington, Delaware, hours after his son, Hunter Biden , was found guilty on gun possession charges. Joe Biden was to be in Washington, D.C., all day, but hours after a federal jury in Wilmington returned a guilty verdict on all three counts, the White House announced that he would leave the Washington Hilton, where he delivered remarks at a gun violence conference, and go directly to Joint Base Andrews. There, he boarded Marine 1 for the short flight to Wilmington. Biden did not mention his son’s legal problems at all in his 20-minute speech to the hundreds of attendees at the “Gun Sense University” conference sponsored by Everytown for Gun Safety. He spoke about the actions he has taken to reduce gun violence and thanked the activists for their work. “We’re going to get there. I have no illusions about how difficult it may be, but I also have illusions about the people in this room,” he said. “You’re changing the attitude of the public. I really mean that.” The president has not yet spoken about the verdict Tuesday, although he did release a statement shortly after it was announced in the courtroom. “Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,” Biden wrote, referring to first lady Jill Biden, who was frequently in the courtroom during the trial. “So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery. As I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.” Biden plans to leave Wednesday morning for the G7 conference of the world’s largest democratic economies in Italy.

    "article_content": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost A long-standing, unwritten rule that evolved to avoid clogging up the criminal justice system could now work to sentence newly convicted felon Donald Trump to prison when he appears before a New York City judge next month. The former president, legal experts say, has put himself on the wrong side of a process that rewards those who do not force the state to expend the time and money for a jury trial — and punishes those who do. Any normal defendant who pleaded not guilty and then lost their trial, these experts note, would likely see the harsher end of the sentencing range. “If you spare the government the expenditure of resources and accept responsibility and plead guilty early in the process, you get some credit for that,” said Rebecca Roiphe, a former state prosecutor in Manhattan and now a professor at New York University School of Law. “Trump obviously didn’t do that.” Trump also spent the entirety of the trial, from jury selection through his verdict and beyond, personally attacking the judge, the district attorney, the witnesses against him and the legitimacy of the entire nation’s justice system — something the vast majority of criminal defendants avoid doing. “I can assure you, if his name was not Donald John Trump, this is exactly the person and the case where a judge would give a stiff prison sentence,” said Karen Agnifilo, also a former Manhattan prosecutor who is now a defense lawyer. Neither Trump’s lawyers nor his campaign staff replied to HuffPost queries about his July 11 sentencing. Everyone accused of a crime in America has a right to a trial by jury. But jury trials are labor-intensive and time-consuming for prosecutors, public defenders, judges and court staff. Further, the volume of criminal cases in most jurisdictions means it would be physically impossible to take every case to trial without a manyfold increase in the number of taxpayer-funded lawyers, judges and courtrooms. Over the decades, the workaround that has been almost universally adopted results in the vast majority of prosecutions being resolved with plea agreements – or “bargains” ― that allow the accused to admit to the charged crime or a lesser crime in exchange for a reduced jail term or, depending on the severity of the offense, even just probation. But for those who insist on taking a case to trial and end up getting convicted by a jury, particularly when the facts underlying the charges are well-established, the end result is often a sentence much closer to the maximum allowed under the law. “I can say generally that, across jurisdictions, prosecutors typically rely on the prospect of harsh alternatives to incentivize pleading,” said Lee Kovarsky, a University of Texas law professor. The basic facts of Trump’s case had been well-known since 2018, when Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to violating federal campaign finance laws and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker signed a no-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors. Both explained during Trump’s trial the circumstances that led Cohen to pay porn actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep her story about a sexual encounter with Trump out of the headlines in the days leading up to the 2016 election. Pecker told prosecutors that he refused to get involved in the Daniels payoff after the National Enquirer’s top lawyer advised him that the tabloid’s earlier $150,000 payment to a Playboy model who had a similar story about Trump would become a federal crime if he accepted a reimbursement for it from Trump. The payment to Daniels by, according to Cohen’s plea, was an illegal campaign contribution that Trump arranged and then reimbursed Cohen for. At that time, Trump was the sitting president and Department of Justice policy barred prosecutions against him. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg pursued a state prosecution of Trump on those same underlying facts but charged him for falsifying business records to hide the illegal campaign contribution. Rather than taking a plea, though, Trump insisted that he had done nothing wrong. Late last month, a Manhattan jury agreed that Bragg was right and that Trump had, in fact, falsified 34 such records for that purpose. While Trump faces three other indictments, including two based on his Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt, at the time of his scheduled sentencing on July 11 he will be a first offender in a non-violent crime — a category that, had Trump pleaded guilty, would have almost certainly given him no time behind bars. “That ship has sailed,” Roiphe said, adding that all of Trump’s outside-the-courtroom behavior that judge Juan Merchan prevented the jury from considering in its deliberations was now fair game in his sentencing decision, including his “conduct during the trial and around the trial and his disrespect for the process.” Agnifilo said that Trump’s attacks on and attempts to intimidate witnesses should weigh heavily in Merchan’s decision. “A defendant should be rewarded for taking responsibility for their actions and sparing witnesses and victims from this arduous and often painful process. Here, Trump still has never taken responsibility, shows no remorse, continues to deny it and, if he could, would attack the witnesses,” she said. Each of the 34 felonies Trump was convicted on carries a maximum sentence of one and one-third to four years in state prison, although multiple felonies arising from the same criminal act — there were 11 separate payments to Cohen ― generally result in a single sentence. Merchan could further let all Trump’s sentences run “concurrently,” could give the former president house arrest or even just give him probation and fines. Most importantly for Trump, he could delay any sentence of incarceration until after Trump has pursued an appeal — a courtesy often granted in non-violent offenses. That would almost certainly mean that Trump, the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential candidate, would remain free in the final months leading up to the November election. Trump’s continued attacks on the justice system — and his refusal to express even a modicum of remorse — could make it hard for Merchan to find a way to avoid giving Trump at least some period behind bars without acknowledging that Trump is getting special treatment, Roiphe said. “It almost makes it difficult for the judge to be as lenient as the defense might want,” she said. If convicted on the Jan. 6 charges in either federal or Georgia state court, Trump could receive decades in prison. A separate federal prosecution based on his refusal to turn over secret documents he took with him to his South Florida country club upon leaving the White House could also result in decades in prison time. If Trump manages to win back the White House, however, he could order the Justice Department to dismiss any federal charges against him that remain unresolved and likely win a delay of the Georgia state prosecution until he is no longer in office.

    "article_content": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost TAMPA, Fla. — As Democrats gear up for yet another run against Florida Republican Rick Scott, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell hopes the fourth time is a charm. In three statewide campaigns over eight years, Democrats have racked up three maddeningly close losses against the former governor and current U.S. senator. “I know I can beat Rick Scott,” the former congresswoman from Miami told a room of supporters this week. “This is a real unique opportunity that we have here in Florida, and we can’t miss this opportunity.” She and other Democrats have a whole list of reasons why they can finally beat Scott this time. In his three previous general election races, his margins have gotten progressively thinner: from 1.2 percent against banker Alex Sink in the 2010 governor’s race to 1 percent against former governor and Republican-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist in 2014 to just two-tenths of a percent against then-incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson in 2018. They point out that Scott has never had to run in a presidential election year, when Democrats in Florida have done a better job turning out their voters than in midterm years. And they argue that Scott is uniquely vulnerable this time, given his public support for both strict abortion limits as well as a phaseout of Social Security and Medicare. “These are really losing issues for him,” said Nikki Fried, chair of the Florida Democratic Party . “The issues important to Floridians today are going to harm him.” On top of that, Mucarsel-Powell’s life story — born in Ecuador, put herself through college, fluent in Spanish — not only make her a perfect fit for a race against Scott, but her presence near the top of the ticket will help Democratic candidates across Florida, Fried said. “We have a really good opportunity to get into the Hispanic communities,” she said. If Scott truly is in trouble, though, his campaign is not displaying any signs of it. The former head of Columbia/HCA made his hundreds of millions of dollars running the for-profit hospital chain, which by 2003 had paid a record $1.7 billion in fines for Medicare fraud after coming under federal investigation. Scott personally claimed the Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself 75 times during his deposition with investigators — a fact that every opponent since Republican Bill McCollum in the 2010 primary has used against him without success. Chris Hartline, who has been working for Scott since his time as governor and is now with the reelection campaign, said Scott and his team are taking the race seriously, but disagree that Florida’s new six-week abortion ban and the constitutional amendment question on the ballot that would restore abortion rights in Florida present a particularly grave threat to him. Nor are they concerned about a second ballot question that would legalize marijuana, and the voters it might draw to the polls. “It’s possible that both amendments pass and that (presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald) Trump and Rick Scott and a lot of down-ballot candidates have big wins,” he said. On a two-day swing through Tampa earlier this week, Mucarsel-Powell has gathered a dozen activists at the Hillsborough County Democratic Party office a few miles north of downtown on the topic of abortion rights. On one wall is an enlarged quotation from President Joe Biden ’s State of the Union speech this year when he quoted the Supreme Court Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade: “‘Women are not without electoral or political power.’ You’re about to realize just how much you were right about that.” Just below is a framed pink poster ― “Protect Freedom: Vote Yes on Amendment 4” – decorated with a pair of Biden-style aviator sunglasses. If one single issue can lift someone who lost reelection after a single term in Congress to the point of beating an incumbent senator in Florida, it could well be abortion. While Florida’s voting population has produced Republican governors and a solid GOP legislature for nearly a full generation now, it has never been strongly anti-abortion. Now, with a six-week ban newly on the books and a constitutional amendment that would undo it on the November ballot, Mucarsel-Powell believes she can ride the hoped-for surge of voter enthusiasm for the amendment into an upset win over Scott. “This is a fundamental civil right for a woman,” she told her guests, who included leaders of local party committees as well as advocates who try to arrange for Florida women to have abortions in other states like North Carolina. “I remember what it was like, pre-Roe versus Wade,” said Gail Gibson, an officer with the South Tampa Democratic Club. While Scott had nothing to do with the six-week ban, which was signed into law by his successor Ron DeSantis, he did approve a 2015 bill that required women in Florida to wait at least 24 hours to obtain an abortion after deciding to have one. What’s more, he told an Orlando TV station in April that he would have signed the six-week ban, too, had he been governor. Mucarsel-Powell told the activists that she often muses about organizing a march the length of the state to rally women to action. “I’m ready to march from Key West to Tallahassee and have women join along the way,” she said. “We’ll call it the El Camino. The El Camino for women.” Some seasoned Democratic consultants in Florida, though, remain less sanguine about Mucarsel-Powell’s chances. One, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that as good a contrast as Mucarsel-Powell, 53, might present against the perennially awkward Scott, who is 71, he retains the advantage that has pulled him through each of his elections: an effectively bottomless bank account. In his three campaigns thus far, Scott has spent $150 million of his own money. If things start looking bad in any of Florida’s 10 television markets — including one of the nation’s most expensive in Miami — Scott has both the ability and the proven willingness to write a seven-figure check to make things better, the consultant said. A recent imbroglio on the issue of in vitro fertilization provides an example. Scott, like all but two Republican senators, voted against a bill last week creating a national right to the procedure. Almost immediately afterward, he introduced a new television ad proclaiming his support for IVF as part of a previously reserved seven-figure buy. Mucarsel-Powell and her staff doggedly point to the apparent hypocrisy — but the reality, the consultant said, was that far more voters in Florida will see the ad than will likely learn that he voted against the legislation. “It’s good to be able to stroke a check,” the consultant said. “Scott voted against a bill last week creating a national right to in vitro fertilization. Almost immediately afterward, he introduced a new television ad proclaiming his support for IVF as part of a previously reserved seven-figure buy.” A second consultant, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said beating Scott would likely take $100 million in a state whose size and population and wildly disparate demographics by region still require loads of expensive television advertising. “I just don’t see where that $100 million comes from,” the second consultant said, particularly when there are Senate races in other states that Democrats must win to retain control of the chamber, like Montana, Nevada and Ohio. Hartline, Scott’s campaign adviser, said he agreed that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and other outside groups are not likely to help Mucarsel-Powell. As to her campaign’s charge of hypocrisy on IVF, Hartline said those types of voting decisions happen all the time in Congress. “He voted no on the Democrat bill and supported a different version of that bill. Not uncommon,” he said. In an interview with HuffPost, Mucarsel-Powell said that Scott’s fundamental problem is that voters in Florida already know him. “They know him, and because they know him so well, they don’t want to vote for him,” she said. “So a lot of that work has already been done for me. Now, what I need to do is make sure that I have the resources to be in front of Floridians that don’t know me yet, so that they can get to know me and I can earn their trust and their vote.” And that, she said, will not require $100 million. “I don’t need all the money that Rick Scott has,” she said. “I know that I need a certain amount to make sure we beat him.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Former president Donald Trump has a lot of thoughts about Taylor Swift, including whether she’s just pretending to be a liberal. According to an upcoming book, “Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass,” Trump thinks the singer is “beautiful,” but has problems with her politics. “I think she’s beautiful — very beautiful! I find her very beautiful,” Trump told author Ramin Setoodeh in an excerpt shared by Variety . ” I think she’s liberal. She probably doesn’t like Trump. I hear she’s very talented. I think she’s very beautiful, actually — unusually beautiful!” But Trump’s praise of Swift stops at her looks. He told Setoodeh, who is the co-editor-in-chief of Variety, that he “[doesn’t] know [her music] well,” and also expressed dismay at her politics. Swift famously called out Trump in 2020 for “stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism” during his entire presidency, and also endorsed Joe Biden . “She is liberal, or is that just an act?” Trump asked during his interview with Setoodeh. “She’s legitimately liberal? It’s not an act? It surprises me that a country star can be successful being liberal.” While Swift got her start in country music, she fully crossed over into mainstream pop in 2014 with her album “1989.” Plus, several country artists have spoken out against Trump over the years, including Maren Morris , Willie Nelson , The Chicks , Kacey Musgraves and Jason Isbell . Trump’s tone in the interview suggests he’s familiar with Swift, but not a full-blown Swiftie. However, The Daily Beast noted that Trump has been thirstily seeking attention from Swift since at least 12 years ago. He even congratulated her when she broke up with Conor Kennedy. And while Trump claims he’s not familiar with Swift’s music, that’s not the case with other members of his family, as this Instagram video taken by his wife Melania that shows him and son Barron listening to “Blank Space” amply demonstrates. A post shared by @nonstop.archived Swift’s lack of support may be weighing heavily on Trump. Back in February, he claimed Swift should be grateful to him for making her “so much money,” and said she would be “disloyal” if she supported Biden again. He also has argued to members of his camp that he is more popular than the singer, so any endorsement of Biden will mean nothing at the polls. “Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass” will be published June 18.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dr. Anthony Fauci , the infectious disease expert who advised the federal government on its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, detailed his whiplash-inducing relationship with Donald Trump in his new memoir. Excerpts from the book, “On Call: A Doctor’s Journey in Public Service,” were shared Thursday by several media outlets the week before its scheduled release. The book’s chapter about Trump, titled, “He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not,” recounts the doctor’s time working as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ― a position he held for nearly 40 years before retiring in 2022. About 70 of the book’s 450 pages are focused on Trump, the New York Times reported . Much of their relationship, Fauci wrote, involved Trump alternately praising him then excoriating him for things he’d said about the COVID-19 pandemic. In one June 2020 phone call from Trump, the former president unleashed his fury on him for saying the virus’ vaccine was unlikely to provide lifetime protection and would probably require boosters, according to book excerpts obtained by the Daily Beast . “The president was irate, saying that I could not keep doing this to him. He said he loved me, but the country was in trouble, and I was making it worse,” Fauci reportedly wrote, noting that the then-president’s comments to him were often laden with expletives. “I have a pretty thick skin, but getting yelled at by the president of the United States, no matter how much he tells you that he loves you, is not fun,” he recalled, according to excerpts quoted by the Times . In his last conversation with Trump shortly before the 2020 election, Fauci reportedly wrote, Trump insisted he’d beat now-President Joe Biden and used some some colorful language to describe the Democrat. “I am going to win this election by a fucking landslide,” Trump said, according to Fauci’s book. “Just wait and see. I always did things my way. And I always win, no matter what all these other fucking people think. And that fucker Biden. He is so fucking stupid. I am going to kick his fucking ass in this election.” The longtime scientist went on to serve as Biden’s chief medical adviser until his retirement. Fauci also said Trump’s vice president, Mike Pence , was abnormally deferential to Trump. “Vice presidents are almost always publicly loyal to the president. That is part of the job. But in my opinion, Vice President Pence sometimes overdid it,” he wrote, per the Times. “During task force meetings, he often said some version of, ‘There are a lot of smart people around here, but we all know that the smartest person is upstairs.’” Fauci recently appeared before the House COVID-19 committee, whose Republican members have repeatedly suggested he masterminded a cover-up of the virus’s origins. Those claims, Fauci told the lawmakers, are “absolutely false and simply preposterous.” His book is out on June 18.

This little light is awesome - slim, sturdy, and slides easily onto hardbacks and paperbacks alike. You have 3 light color options, and different levels of brightness. I honestly love how adjustable the light itself is- it tilts side to side as well as up and down. I also like to use it when my partner is trying to sleep, and I’m not quite ready to put down my book yet. Also, re-charging is a breeze, since the USB port is built right in. You don’t even need to keep track of a wire. Also? It’s cute. Highly recommend! ” — Caitlyn “I like how how I can change the brightness. I have very sensitive eyes.

I LOVE the fact that I can easily adjust the way that the light shines on the pages and it stays that way. My previous book light never stayed twisted into the position that I had placed it for long, and it often didn’t illuminate the whole page. With this light, I’m able to put the light into position and leave it there for the entirety of my reading session. It’s been easy to find a light position for both small books and larger books. I will be gifting this to the other readers in my life. ” — Kyle Killeen"

    "article_content": "General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday that Donald Trump got the notion to push hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment from none other than Fox News host Laura Ingraham . (Watch the video below.) Fauci, a White House coronavirus task force member during the pandemic, said the former president fixated on so-called miracle cures with “no basis in science.” Trump yelled at Fauci for openly dismissing the supposed effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that was promoted by conservatives as a COVID treatment without any real evidence. “I’m telling the American public the facts,” Fauci said he told Trump. “Hydroxychloroquine doesn’t work.” Fauci, who describes his complicated relationship with Trump in his new book “ On Call ,” told MSNBC ’s Ari Melber what he speculated was the reason for Trump’s insistence on the drug’s ability to quell the outbreak. “I believe he wanted so badly for this to go away the way influenza goes away, and when he saw it was not going away, then he was hoping for some magical solution, and he even used those words, ‘It’s going to go away like magic,’” Fauci said. “And then when that didn’t work, then we had to have these miracle cures like hydroxychloroquine, which he got from Laura Ingraham on Fox News.” Claims about the drug’s purported usefulness against the coronavirus were bandied about through right-wing channels before Ingraham visited the White House in April 2020 to sell Trump on the drug. Ingraham, who had already been touting hydroxychloroquine on her show along with other Fox personalities, brought cardiologist Dr. Ramin Oskoui, who was included in a New York Times opinion piece about “ dangerous doctors in a pandemic ,” and Stephen Smith, an infectious disease specialist, to the meeting, The Wall Street Journal reported . Smith said in April 2020 that he thought the drug combined with an antibiotic was “ the beginning of the end of the pandemic .” Trump was sold. In mid-May 2020, he announced that he had been taking the drug for weeks . “I’ve heard a lot of good stories,” he said. But a study published in June 2023 by the National Institutes of Health highlighted the futility of the medicine as a pre-exposure treatment for COVID-19. It noted no significant difference between a placebo and the actual drug in preventing infection. A study released in January 2024 determined that the drug Trump championed as a silver bullet actually increased the mortality rate by 11% among those who took it to treat COVID-19. It was linked to nearly 17,000 deaths in six countries during the pandemic’s first wave.

    "article_content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Willie Mays raced at top speed toward the center-field wall at the spacious Polo Grounds and somehow managed to track down and corral a fast-traveling ball with an over-the-shoulder catch that became the most iconic moment in the Hall of Famer’s decorated career that featured 660 home runs. It simply became known as “ The Catch .” But there was little simple about it. The Say Hey Kid’s superb grab of a drive hit by Cleveland’s Vic Wertz in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series against the favored Indians will always be one of his finest moments, also a key in the New York Giants’ 4-0 sweep to win the championship. “It wasn’t no lucky catch,” Mays emphatically noted years later. Not at all. The play showed off the mesmerizing skill of one of the most talented players ever to step on a baseball field and was considered by many to be the Greatest Living Ballplayer before he died at age 93 on Tuesday. In the top of the eighth inning with runners on first and second in a 2-2 game, Mays took off running straight back toward the wall, head looking at the outfield rather than tracking the ball, and snared it before instantly releasing a fabulous throw that gets far less attention than the catch itself. “Yeah, that was the key right there, I thought,” Mays recalled in April 2014. “Because if I hadn’t caught that, you gotta get three runs some kind of way. Vic would have been on third some kind of way and the other two would have scored. So I think that was the key to the whole World Series.” It was a play that is as famous as any in the grand history of baseball and was memorialized at the time by the Hall of Fame broadcaster Jack Brickhouse, who said: “Willie Mays just brought this crowd to its feet with a catch which must have been an optical illusion to a lot of people!” To Mays, it was just another play that happened to come on the game’s biggest stage. “I usually catch fly balls like that all the time,” he said. “But you’re talking about a World Series. You’re talking about something that doesn’t happen all the time. Even if you make a catch like that, which I did, in the regular season — but to catch it in a way that the world is looking at you — it’s remarkable, I think.” Mays never wanted to say where that play stood on the list in his career of brilliant catches — and there were many for a player who won 12 Gold Gloves as one of the game’s greatest fielding outfielders. “I never ranked catches,” he said. “It’s important to make sure to try to catch everything out there. This is my theory, I don’t know how other people think. I just feel if I started ranking them, you guys would have nothing to write about. I never did worry about things like that.” No one knows for sure how far from home plate the drive by Wertz carried, with best estimates at perhaps 425 feet. It’s all part of the legend of Mays. Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson said in 2018 that it still should be viewed “as the greatest catch ever.” “Today’s player has gone up and over the fence, climbed the wall, and that’s pretty cool,” Jackson said. “But I still think we all go back and the greatest outfielder ever is Willie Mays. “There were guys that covered more ground and ran this fast, he had some angle. But I think Willie will be recognized as maybe the greatest athlete that ever played, arguably the best player falling with (Hank) Aaron, (Babe) Ruth, (Lou) Gehrig and those guys. It’s just kind of the epitome of his career.” Mays’ godson, Home Run King Barry Bonds, said years ago that he wants to make sure people appreciate more than just that one moment in a remarkable 23-year career. There were the two MVPs, the Rookie of the Year Award, the 24 All-Star games, the 660 home runs, and the 3,293 hits. It all added up to Mays being widely considered the game’s greatest all-around player. “There’s a lot of people who made great catches in the game of baseball. But he happens to be one of the best baseball players. That does make it seem a lot better,” Bonds said. “I think we’ve had our moments in catches. I think his longevity of his career is more important than just the catch to anyone who’s played the game of baseball. To play 20-something years in the game of baseball is an accomplishment in itself. Longevity is way more important than a single catch. “There’s a lot of guys that have made single great catches and played one year, or two years or five years. You don’t know who those people are but to do it for the amount of time that he’s done it in his career and played as long as he has in his career, that’s another level. That’s way bigger.” ___ AP Sports Writer Josh Dubow contributed to this report.

    "article_content": "Trends Reporter The year’s most anticipated sporting event continues to spawn triumph and tragedy . French swimmer Rafael Fente-Damers successfully qualified for the Paris Olympics on Tuesday, but while punching the pool waters in joyous celebration at the French Championships in Chartres, the 17-year-old athlete reportedly dislocated his shoulder. Fente-Damers had just secured his spot on the team by placing second in the 100-meter freestyle final behind Maxime Grousset, when, as seen in footage of his reaction that has since gone viral on social media , he winced in pain before pointing to his shoulder. While the swimmer has yet to comment on the incident or disclose an exact diagnosis, French outlet L’Equipe reported Tuesday that he dislocated his shoulder. Grousset, who naturally wants the second-best Frenchman by his side at the Olympics, remains hopeful. “I hope it goes well for him because we’re waiting for him for the relay,” said Grousset, who helped Fente-Damers out of the pool and flagged down medics, per Reuters . “He’s a bit crazy, that’s why he’s good. He’s not afraid of anything and I think he’s going to progress.” HuffPost has reached out to the French Swimming Federation for comment. Fente-Damers was certainly all smiles in photos taken later at the winners’ podium despite having his left arm in a swing. L’Equipe reported that his dislocated shoulder — an injury in which the upper arm bone pops out of its socket — had been treated at a local hospital. Fente-Damers, who completed the freestyle final in 48.14 seconds after Grousset’s time of 47.33 , isn’t the first athlete to injure himself ahead of the Olympics. WNBA star Cameron Brink tore her ACL on Tuesday after making the U.S. 3x3 basketball team. While the injured Los Angeles Sparks rookie is officially getting replaced, Fente-Damers is currently still expected to compete. The swimming portion of this year’s Olympic Games are scheduled to take place from July 27 to Aug. 4 at the París La Défense Arena.

    "article_content": "Associate Reporter In one of the more heartbreaking moments in Netflix’s docuseries “America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders,” Victoria Kalina, a four-year veteran of the squad, says that cheering for the Dallas Cowboys is her dream. But it’s also “the thing that hurts me.” Kalina was opening up about her yearslong battle with disordered eating alongside anxiety and depression, all of which flared during her time on the squad. Comments about her weight — from the cheer squad’s directors as well as her own Instagram followers — led Kalina toward depression and a complicated relationship with her body image. “When I look [at myself] in the uniform, I’m always like, oh, man, I need to lose at least three pounds,” Kalina said on the Netflix docuseries, which was released today. She added that to deal with her depression, she binges and purges food. “It’s a binge to get that feel-good, that empty feeling filled again, but then game time comes, so then you just gotta get into those baby clothes, get into that baby uniform and that cycle just keeps going.” Kalina’s experience isn’t new. She and other women on the squad dating back to the ’70s have experienced eating disorders, been victims of sexual harassment, and dealt with low pay that made it hard to justify being an NFL cheerleader. In conjunction with the Netflix docuseries premiere, HuffPost spoke to two former Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders and one woman who tried out for the team twice. Cheering for the Cowboys and wearing the iconic uniform is a dream, the women said, but their experiences with the Cowboys included all the pitfalls that generations of cheerleaders have faced since the cheer squad’s inception in its current form in the ’70s: body and weight issues, disordered eating, sexual harassment, and low pay. Body image issues and eating disorders have long plagued cheerleaders across the NFL. An old rulebook for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders from the ’90s forbid gaining weight . Other teams have reportedly put cheerleaders through a “ jiggle test , ” which judged their body firmness at the risk of fines and penalties. Tami Barber — a cheerleader in the ’70s known for her pigtails — said she developed anorexia because of the expectations the organization put on her. “The self-image [issue] never ends,” Barber said in a 2018 documentary about the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders titled “Daughters of the Sexual Revolution.” “I will always see the fat girl in the mirror,” she continued, echoing Kalina’s sentiments in Netflix’s new series. Squad veterans aren’t the only ones who say they’ve been harmed by the organization’s unrealistic standards. Merely trying out to be one of “America’s Sweethearts” is a grueling process and often requires applicants to upend their lives just for the opportunity. Vivian Williams might know that better than anyone. She auditioned to be a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader in both 2013 and 2014, and prior to her first attempt, she lost 30 pounds in anticipation of what judges were looking for in a cheerleader’s body. Her audition process was documented on CMT’s “Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader: Making The Team,” a reality show that ran for 16 seasons from 2006 to 2021. During an episode that aired in 2013, four veteran cheerleaders are put on probation because they’ve gained what they’re told is too much weight. Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders Director Kelli Finglass reveals that the cheerleaders are obligated to maintain their audition weight. “If not, they’re in breach of contract,” Finglass tells the camera. Later in the episode, the cameras turn toward Williams when she tries on the famous Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders uniform: White shorts and boots, blue top tied in a knot and a white vest. Finglass, outside of Williams’ earshot, tells others in the room that Williams looks “short and thick,” that her white cowboy boots are almost to her knees, and that she has “huge quads, like a drumstick.” “You stop thinking about food as something that nourishes your body.” Williams didn’t know what Finglass had said about her body until she saw the episode air on TV. “I think that’s when my anxiety started to develop,” she told HuffPost. “And I had struggled with panic attacks and anxiety attacks after the fact all the way up until now. I haven’t had very many this year, maybe three, but I still have them.” A former Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader, who was on the squad roughly 10 years ago and asked to remain anonymous, told HuffPost that the organization was meticulous and even aggressive about cheerleaders’ weight. She and Williams said they were subjected to random weigh-ins, a practice that a Cowboys spokesperson said has not been in play for “a number of years.” The former cheerleader said they were required to stay within five pounds of their audition weight at all times or face consequences that included full-game suspensions. “To make that even worse, they would post the results in the locker room the next day after we would weigh in,” she said. “So you would walk in and just be so afraid that your name was going to be on this list that was just posted in the locker room for everyone to see.” Williams said she weighed 120 pounds when she first tried out for the squad in 2013. But she didn’t make it — she was told she needed to lose an additional 10 pounds before the next season’s auditions. Determined to impress Finglass and make the team, Williams under-ate, over-trained, and sat in the sauna for hours at a time. She lost more weight and tried out again for the 2014 season, three pounds lighter than when she first auditioned. But her personal training regimen led to what she called an “unhealthy relationship” with food. “You stop thinking about food as something that nourishes your body,” she told HuffPost. “When I’d have a ‘cheat’ meal, I’d have to punish myself by going to the gym for an extra hour or not eating for an extended amount of time. And it was just because I had to be a certain weight. And I didn’t care how I got to that weight.” Both Williams and the anonymous former squad member said the Cowboys offered them little to no resources to maintain healthy nutrition or weight. On the CMT show, there’s a segment in which some cheerleaders were offered a partnership with My Fit Foods, a meal prep company ostensibly there to help cheerleaders build healthy meal plans. But Williams said she wasn’t invited to take part, and the former squad member claimed the entire program was bogus. “They just do stuff on the show to look like they’re doing the right thing,” the former squad member said. “But in reality, no, there’s no nutritionist for us to speak with. There’s no trainer.” In a statement to HuffPost, a Dallas Cowboys spokesperson said the team offers cheerleaders access to independent fitness and mental health consultants, a dedicated athletic trainer, and credits for a meal program. When Williams returned to audition in 2014, she said Finglass told her she was “inconsistent” with her weight and dancing and that she was “self-consumed with the mirror.” She didn’t make the team for a second time. Finglass didn’t respond to HuffPost’s request for comment, but on Monday, in an interview with Entertainment Tonight , she said the squad doesn’t talk about weight anymore. Williams said her experience trying out for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders — plus having those efforts documented on reality TV — caused her to struggle with body dysmorphia and bulimia for a few years, something she said she has since recovered from. “I felt like I needed to get the bad stuff out, in a sense,” she said. “And that was the only way that I could cope with it at the time.” The anonymous former cheerleader said the random weigh-ins gave her anxiety and strained her relationship with food. She remembers that one time, just before a practice that lasted at least three hours, she ate half a turkey sandwich in the car while her then-boyfriend dropped her off in the parking lot, and she was filled with anxiety. “I was freaking out, and he’s like, ‘What’s wrong?’ I’m like, ‘I don’t know if I should eat the other half of the sandwich; we might have a weigh-in. I don’t know what to do.’ I was still hungry, so I ate the other part of my sandwich, and I remember just crying,” she said. “And he probably thought I was a crazy person, but I can just remember him being like, ‘It’s OK. You just ate a healthy turkey sandwich.’ And I was like, ‘No, you don’t understand. If they weigh us in, and I’ve eaten today, and if I’m up, I’m gonna get in trouble.’” She said consequences ranged from not being allowed to make appearances in the uniform to not being allowed to cheer in a game. In 2019, after NFL players spoke out about their mental health struggles, the NFL and the players union agreed to employ a behavioral health clinician for each team. NFL cheerleaders, meanwhile, aren’t unionized and have no governing body beyond whatever oversight and resources their football team gives them. Many squads are independent of their respective teams, and some teams consider their cheerleaders to be contractors. Most NFL cheerleaders have to work an extra job; an issue that gained publicity earlier this year when several squads participated in a social media trend revealing their day jobs . With little outside advocacy, it’s been up to individual cheerleaders to fight for better pay. In 2018, Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader Erica Wilkins sued the Cowboys organization, claiming that she was paid less than minimum wage and that the football team’s mascot made more than the cheerleaders. No other cheerleaders joined the suit. Still, the Cowboys settled out of the suit, and the cheerleaders’ game-day pay was reportedly raised to $400 per game . In a statement to HuffPost, the Cowboys organization said the cheerleaders’ compensation has increased over the years, but the rates are not public. However, cheerleaders say low pay remains an issue, including in Dallas. In the Netflix docuseries, Kat Puryear, a cheerleader who was on the squad from 2019 to 2023, said she was paid about the same as a substitute teacher or a full-time Chick-fil-A employee. The team’s response: Cheerleaders work for the sisterhood and the passion for dance, not the money. “It’s unfortunate that with how much they pretend or say that we are important and the face of the organization, the way they treat us and pay us does not come near to equal that.” “There’s a lot of cynicism around pay for NFL cheerleaders, and as it should be,” Charlotte Jones, chief brand officer of the Dallas Cowboys, said in the docuseries. “They’re not paid a lot. But the facts are that they actually don’t come here for the money. They come here for something that’s actually bigger than that to them.” Another woman who started to cheer for the Cowboys in 2021 and asked to remain anonymous told HuffPost she was paid $12.50 per hour for practices and $400 for each game. Cheerleaders only perform during home games, but each one requires a commitment of more than 12 hours, she said. Appearance rates went up each year a cheerleader was on the team, so she was paid $100 for appearances her first year and it increased $100 every year after that. While football players cash in on sponsorships with companies like Nike, Dallas’ cheerleaders aren’t allowed to use their titles to secure their own sponsorship deals, nor can they sign with social media influencer agencies, the former cheerleader said. With limited opportunities to make money as a squad member, she had to work an additional full-time office job every weekday. “It’s kind of a running joke for the girls on the team: The guys on the practice squad , who don’t even touch the field half of the time, getting 80 grand more than we do a year. And I’m at every single game, dancing my ass off, and every other appearance, and my face is all over The Star,” she said, referring to the Cowboys’ headquarters and practice facility. “You don’t even know who these guys on the practice team are.” She continued: “It’s unfortunate that with how much they pretend or say that we are important and the face of the organization, the way they treat us and pay us does not come near to equal that.” While the cheerleaders are working for the same pay as a fast food employee, they are also subject to stalking, sexual harassment and assault. In “Daughters of the Sexual Revolution,” cheerleaders from the ’70s said fans would call their homes and send threatening letters. Those threats still exist today. Kelcey Wetterberg, a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader from 2019 to 2023, said on the Netflix docuseries that someone placed an AirTag on her car, and police weren’t much help. The incident left her paranoid, looking over her shoulders and writing down the license plate numbers of cars she thought might be following her. “I couldn’t live that anxious all the time,” she said through tears. “Like, not sleep, not eat because I was so scared of what was going to happen. I had to just pray and say, if this is something that’s going to happen to me, it’s going to happen to me, but I can’t live in fear all the time.” In 2016, the Cowboys settled with four cheerleaders for $2.4 million after they accused a senior team executive of taking photos of them in the locker room undressing. The exec denied the allegations , and the Cowboys said they found no proof of any wrongdoing. Afterward, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the settlement showed that the team took the allegations seriously. But cheerleaders say they continue to experience harassment. In the Netflix docuseries, a cheerleader files a police report after saying that a game-day photographer touched her inappropriately. Her fellow cheerleaders rally around her, hopeful that her speaking up might give other victims of sexual assault and harassment the courage to do the same. In a statement to HuffPost about the incident, the Dallas Cowboys said, “ Safety and security are always a core imperative for us with the Cheerleaders. In this specific situation, on-site Arlington Police Department officers were immediately engaged. A thorough review of the incident was initiated quickly. Any contact was determined to be unintentional and no charges were deemed to be appropriate by APD.” The cheerleader who joined the squad in 2021 told HuffPost that she also dealt with inappropriate touching. She remembers a man tickling her down her back at an appearance. She said the squad didn’t have its own security at that appearance because it was outside of Dallas, and she didn’t tell a Cowboys staff member at the event because she didn’t feel like there was open communication between staff and the cheerleaders. “But it could have been my own fault for not saying something [to staff],” she said. Then she corrects herself. “It’s hard, because we are itemized sometimes as an object instead of a human, and we start to almost believe that ourselves.” While the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders say they are still experiencing the same issues they were 50 years ago, few are willing to speak out. After some of the cheerleaders on the Buffalo Bills’ cheerleading squad, the Buffalo Jills, sued for wage violations and poor working conditions in 2014 , the Bills shut down the squad entirely. They have yet to make a return. Cheerleaders are taught that they are replaceable and that it’s a privilege to wear the uniform. “They don’t care about you,” said the former cheerleader who was on the Cowboys squad a decade ago. “You’re a number to them and they don’t care. You just show up and look good and do what you’re supposed to do, and they don’t really care how that happens.” The former cheerleader who joined the squad in 2021 echoed that sentiment. “People refer to you as an ant on the field, and sadly, that’s how it feels,” she said. “You do not feel valued or cared for, or important in any way financially, physically, emotionally, mentally. I felt like when I left, it meant nothing to them, which is unfortunate for how much I poured into the years that I was there.” The cheerleader said there are pros and cons to every job, and a higher wage could make it easier to be a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader. “I think there’s a give and a take, but there’s not enough give for what’s being taken,” she said.

    "article_content": "Assignment Editor, HuffPost Safe to say it wasn’t a close one. Swim champ Katie Ledecky won the 1500-meter freestyle race at the U.S. Olympic trials in Indianapolis on Wednesday, with a full 20 seconds to spare. In a clip shared by Team USA , Ledecky chills at the end of the pool, removes her swim cap and goggles and checks out the screen as she waits for the runner-up to arrive. “Katie Ledecky doing @katieledecky things in the 1500m,” Team USA wrote, using a goat emoji on the video to indicate “greatest of all time.” In a longer video of the race , Ledecky can be seen nearly a full pool length ahead of her competition as she starts her last leg. “If there wasn’t a caption, I would have thought it was a clip of her practicing by herself,” one commenter wrote with a laughing emoji. “Lol she had time to go win a whole different event,” wrote another. “She got out, took a shower, ate dinner, took a nap, came back and the other swimmers were just finishing,” a third person joked. She finished the 1500 in 15:37.35, the fastest time in the world this year. The previous fastest time? Also Ledecky. She set the current world record of 15:20.48 in 2018. Even with such a decisive win on Wednesday, the seven-time Olympic gold medalist felt she could do better. “I was just expecting a lot faster. The 39 yesterday felt really easy. So, I think that just set my expectations pretty high,” she said of the race. “It’s not like I completely died or anything, so I held it together, and can take some positives away, but definitely have some things I want to do better in five weeks,” she added. Ledecky had already punched her ticket to Paris in two other events, with wins in the 200 and 400 freestyle trials. She has indicated she doesn’t plan to compete in the 200 individual freestyle event at the Olympics.

    "article_content": "Trends Reporter Travis Kelce says he doesn’t “give a shit” about a typo on the Kansas City Chiefs’ new Super Bowl ring. The tight end, who received his third ring after defeating the San Francisco 49ers at this year’s Super Bowl, hilariously reacted to the error on Wednesday’s episode of his “New Heights” podcast . “One major little goof on the ring: Miami is listed as the seventh seed,” brother Jason Kelce noted on the show, using the term for a team’s spot in the NFL playoffs. “Miami was actually the sixth seed.” Travis Kelce appeared indifferent to the Miami Dolphins mistake, which had been identified by social media users last week as Chiefs players received their $40,000 rings in a Missouri ceremony. “I don’t give a shit,” he told his sibling. “I like it that we didn’t give a fuck about what seed Miami is. Fuck it! Yeah, they were the seventh — who cares? They could’ve done no seeds on the side of them [the rings], I would’ve been fine.” He added: “I think it makes it more unique, like, ‘Oh, yeah, we made it really detailed and, oops, we screwed up.’ Just makes it more exclusive, like we screwed up about something that means nothing.” Each ring contains 529 diamonds and 38 rubies, with a total of 14.8 carats . Nineteen of the diamonds celebrate the Chiefs as the first team in as many years to win back-to-back Super Bowls, while four marquise stones symbolize their total victories at the annual event. Travis Kelce didn’t argue when his brother said the jewelry has gotten more “ostentatious” over the years. When asked which of his three rings is his favorite, he said “the one from last year,” as “it has a clasp where you can wear it in different ways.” The tight end notably defeated his brother at the 2023 Super Bowl , in which the Chiefs faced off against the Philadelphia Eagles . Travis Kelce also said that last week’s ring ceremony in Missouri was “fun,” but noted that the Chiefs are “focused to keep our eyes on the prize” — hinting that they hope to become the first team in NFL history to win three back-to-back Super Bowls.

    "article_content": "Assignment Editor, HuffPost It was an eventful day for Lilly King . The Olympic swimmer’s boyfriend, James Wells, proposed on Thursday, minutes after she qualified in Indianapolis to compete in the 200-meter breaststroke events at the Paris Olympics. Wells told her it had been “so awesome” to watch her grow, both in and out of the pool, over the past four years. “I don’t regret for a minute dropping my job and moving halfway across the country for us to move in together,” Wells said, in a video shared by NBC Sports . “It has been awesome, and I am very excited to see where this goes from here on out. So, dear, I was wondering, Lilly Camille King, will you marry me?” “Yes, yes,” King said, as they embraced. In an interview afterwards, King said she wasn’t expecting it at all. “I was really confused,” she said, mentioning that someone “told me to put my hair down before I walked out instead of having it in my cap, and I was like, ‘OK, sounds good,’ and then I was just confused because you were down here.” She placed second in Thursday’s 200-meter breaststroke event after Kate Douglass. The five-time Olympic medalist had already landed a spot on Team USA for the 100-meter breaststroke. She will be the first U.S. swimmer to compete in both the 100 and 200-meter breaststroke events at three consecutive Olympics, according to NBC News . Wells, also a former Indiana University swimmer, said he chose this moment to propose because “having this be in her home state is so incredible.” “All of us that swam at IU together, that did all of this stuff together, this is such a powerful swimming state, and it just means so much for her to be here in front of this crowd,” he said. “That’s the perfect opportunity.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost British Olympic cyclist Katie Archibald literally got a bad break ― all for simply walking around at home. Archibald, 30, announced on Instagram Thursday that she broke her leg tripping over a step in her garden. She also dislocated her ankle and tore ligaments “off the bone.” “What the heck,” she wrote. Indeed. Archibald suddenly won’t be competing in Paris. “A hundred apologies for what this means for the Olympic team, which I’ve been told won’t involve me,” she wrote. “I’m still processing that bit of news, but thought I better confirm it publicly instead of leaving it to the grapevine (trip hazard and all that).” The track-cycling star shared a rueful selfie from her hospital bed and a snap of her cast on her lower left leg. She had surgery to pin the bones back together and reattach the ligaments, and reported that it took some doing to realign her ankle as well. “Ciao for now,” she said. A post shared by Katie Archibald (@_katiearchibald) British Cycling on Thursday cited “ the cruel manner in which she has been denied the chance” to compete in the Games. Archibald can at least take solace in her previous two Olympic gold medals ― 2016 in Rio in the team pursuit and 2021 in Tokyo in the women’s Madison. She also has company when it comes to pre-Games bad luck. French swimmer Rafael Fente-Damers had just qualified in a race for his home country’s Games this week when he punched the pool water in celebration. He dislocated his shoulder in the process .

    "article_content": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — After a long layoff and all the doubts about whether he’d reclaim his place as one of the world’s greatest swimmers, Caeleb Dressel is beginning to look like himself again. Dressel earned his first individual race of the Paris Games, powering to a relatively easy victory in the men’s 50-meter freestyle at the U.S. Olympic trials Friday night. One of the biggest stars in Tokyo with five gold medals , Dressel finished third in the first individual event, the 100 freestyle, which relegated him to the relay at that distance. But he’ll get a chance to defend his 50 free title in Paris, blowing away the field in the frantic dash from one end of the pool to the other at Lucas Oil Stadium. “Sometimes it’s easy, sometimes it’s tough. That was a tough one,” Dressel said. “I was not super-confident until I got up on that block. There’s only so much you can do in the 50. It’s head down and go fast.” Dressel did just that to touch in 21.41 seconds — not as fast as his winning time (21.07) at the last Olympics, but still a performance that would’ve been good enough to win gold in 2021. Chris Guiliano claimed his third individual race in Paris with a runner-up finish of 21.69. In the aftermath of his Tokyo success, Dressel stunningly walked away from swimming during the 2022 world championships. He later revealed what a toll the sport had taken on him, saying he needed an extended break to rediscover his passion at the pool. Dressel failed to even qualify for the 2023 worlds, and his mental fragility is still a work in progress. “There’s parts of this meet that I’ve had some very low lows,” he conceded. “There’s parts that I have when I’m in my hotel room that are not on camera, talking to my wife, talking to my therapist. It has not been smooth sailing this whole meet. I know y’all get to see the smile, and I’m working on it. I’m trying to find those moments and really relish in them.” About 35 minutes after his victory in the 50 free, Dressel returned for the semifinals of his final event, the 100 butterfly. The tattooed Floridian showed more impressive speed, posting the fastest time of 50.79 to stamp himself as the favorite in the final Saturday night. Dare Rose was next at 51.11. If Dressel can finish in the top two of that race, he would likely swim up to five events in Paris counting the relays — not far off his six-event program in Tokyo. “I really feel like I’m loving this sport,” he said. “I’m not going best times. I haven’t gone a single best time, but just when I’m walking out, not even performing, feeling the love from everyone, it’s really special.” Like Guiliano, Regan Smith will also be swimming three individual events at the Olympics after winning the 200 backstroke. Smith was under world-record pace through the first two laps, but faded a bit at the end to touch in 2 minutes, 5.16 seconds. She finished more than a second ahead of Phoebe Bacon, who grabbed the second Olympic spot in 2:06.27. She chased down reigning world champion Claire Curzan, who missed out on a berth in Paris with a time of 2:06.34. Smith previously won the 100 backstroke in world-record time, along with a victory in the 200 fly. She just missed a fourth individual race in Paris with a third-place showing in the 100 fly. Still, it’s been a dynamic meet for the Minnesota native, who has endured plenty of ups and downs since setting her first world record in 2019. “I’m incredibly proud of this performance,” Smith said. “I ran out of gas in that last race, but its been a great meet for me.” Guiliano edged Matt King for an Olympic berth by a hundredth of a second, with Jack Alexy taking fourth in 21.76. Guiliano has emerged as a big star of these trials, heading to his first Olympics with three individual events on his plate. He won the 100 freestyle and was runner-up in the 200 free and now the 50 free. Guiliano, who competes collegiately at Notre Dame, will be the first American male to swim those three events at the Olympics since the great Matt Biondi in 1988. Carson Foster will be doubling up in Paris, adding a victory in the 200 individual medley to the title he won in the 400 IM. Shaine Casas was under world-record pace through the first two laps, but Foster chased him down on the freestyle leg to win in 1:55.65. Casas grabbed his first Olympic berth in 1:55.83 — a huge relief for a swimmer who was billed as a rising star ahead of the Tokyo Games but failed to qualify in either of his events at the 2021 U.S. trials. “This means everything,” Casas said. “Since I was a kid, it’s all I dreamed about. Now, I won’t have to pretend to be an Olympian. I am an Olympian.” Kate Douglass turned in another strong performance in the semifinals of the women’s 200 individual medley. She finished in 2:08.53 to edge Alex Walsh (2:08.74) for the top spot. Douglass has lived up to her billing as one of the world’s most versatile swimmers, having already claimed victories in the 200 breaststroke and 100 freestyle. She also remains entered in the 50 free, though he’s expected to scratch that race. “That was really hard,” Douglass said after the 200 IM. “I’m tired. But I am really happy with the meet so far. I feel like I’m excited to have one more race tomorrow and see how it goes.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "My wife Sam and I recently had the luxury of watching an entire movie in one sitting. After getting our boys to bed early on a Sunday night, we tucked into “The Idea of You,” starring Anne Hathaway and Nicholas Galitzine. Our expectations were not excessive: We assumed the film would be sexy, a little dramatic and kind of cheesy. If nothing else, the leading man and leading lady are both achingly beautiful. We were not disappointed. (Note some spoilers below). The premise begins as follows: When 40-year-old mom Solène accidentally mistakes 20-something boy-band heartthrob Hayes Campbell’s trailer for the bathroom at Coachella, sparks fly. But she’s way too old for him, right? Over the course of a tumultuous few months, the pair fall madly and inconveniently in love. When Solène secretly joins Hayes on his European tour, the couple get handsy all over Barcelona, Rome and Paris. But it’s not long before their age difference, coupled with Hayes’ global fame, causes some friction. Solène is ridiculed by Hayes’ bandmate and his thong-clad girlfriends, while back in LA, her cheating ex and teenage daughter are ignorant of her romance. Even Solène’s dreamy little Silver Lake bungalow is no match for the harassment of the paparazzi and high school bullies, and she ultimately decides to put her daughter’s needs before her own. Solène breaks things off with Hayes. As the credits rolled, Sam and I agreed: It didn’t have to be so dramatic. “If she really wanted to get her daughter through high school, she only needed to wait a couple more years,” Sam pointed out. But why did she have to wait at all? Why was heartbreak the only solution? Was Solène right to end her relationship to protect her daughter, I wondered? This idea that we have to give up our own desires to ensure the happiness of our children is tired — and frankly, incorrect. Moms especially are held to a harsh standard of selflessness when it comes to our kids. Samantha Tinter, a licensed clinical social worker and owner of Hudson Valley Counseling, believes that it’s essential for parents to prioritize themselves. “When we give everything we have to our children, and forget about ourselves, we become irritable, exhausted, resentful and easily overwhelmed. All in the name of dedicated parenting.” she said. Taking time away from our kids and spending it with adult friends, getting a manicure or exercising can all be necessary elements of self-care, Tinter argues. “All of these things matter and are important in not getting swallowed up into your role as a parent until you become unrecognizable to yourself,” she added. Hannah Samaha has experienced this push-and-pull both as a child therapist and as a mother. “The only situation to not prioritize your own needs is when it comes to situations that are dangerous or harmful to your child,” said Samaha, a child psychologist in private practice. “Our kids look to us for safety and security, and they’re very perceptive. If our behaviors are indicating that we don’t feel safe and secure, they’re going to perceive the world as a dangerous place,” she added. “Moms especially are held to a harsh standard of selflessness when it comes to our kids.” In my own home, my wife Sam and I have started reminding ourselves, “We are people, too.” Sometimes we say this aloud and let our children hear us — let them know we are flawed humans with wants and needs. I am multifaceted: I have good days and bad ones. I make mistakes. I get excited. I have interests outside of my children. I certainly don’t have all the answers. Why should I pretend otherwise? According to Tanika Masse, a psychologist who specializes in working with children, parents prioritizing their own needs is beneficial to their children. “Taking care of yourself is essential, and it is not a luxury or option, but rather a vital means of ensuring one’s own survival and well-being,” she said. She implores parents to give themselves some grace as a starting point. “Practice self-compassion, be kind to yourself and recognize that it’s okay to prioritize your own needs sometimes. Let go of any guilt or pressure to constantly put your children first, and remember that taking care of yourself ultimately benefits them, too.” In the case of “The Idea of You,” Solène’s choice to end a relationship with a pop star isn’t a realistic example of the challenges of parenthood — that’s why this is a movie — but it does highlight an important issue. Even though Solène has friends, she feels emotionally isolated. Like her, there are many parents who don’t have the support of a community who can help them make “self-care” a reality. But removing guilt from the equation, like Masse suggested, is emotionally beneficial and available to everyone. When my wife and I care for ourselves as individuals and for our relationship, we are able to be more present for our kids. We are able to bring our emotionally healthiest selves to motherhood. So instead of constantly worrying about what’s best for our kids‚ like Solène does in the film, it’s time to consider our own needs. When we’re able to do that, we can make better decisions for our kids and find balance for our families.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer I couldn’t get anyone to go with me. As a writer about pleasure, I felt compelled to experience a cuddle party, and I learned about one in New York City that claimed to be “a warm evening of connection, cuddles and consent.” My husband of 25 years, Mark, said the thing sounded “weird,” and my most daring friend simply wrinkled her nose. So I bought a single ticket on Eventbrite, as if this event was just another conventional form of entertainment, like a concert or a play. A cuddle party is a “social event where participants engage in consensual, non-sexual touch and affectionate physical contact,” or so says my new best friend ChatGPT4. Despite the bland description, just reading those words set my senses aglow. For $69 (oddly enough), I would soon be cuddling with strangers in a NYC loft. At 77, I’m fairly old, but I’m very fit, and I think I’m quite cute. My husband says I’m the most beautiful woman in the world, so I assumed I was cuddle-worthy. I do like a good cuddle, but I’ve only cuddled with people I know well: boyfriends, husbands and my sons when they were children. Now I nuzzle my granddaughters, ages 3 and 7, but only briefly, because unless they’re sleepy, they don’t stay still for long. I’ve rarely felt the urge to cuddle a friend, but I now wondered what it would feel like to cuddle a woman. What about two women? Possibilities expanded. How about cuddling two men and a woman at once? Cuddling is defined as hugging, embracing, nestling, stroking. It’s not sexual, although it can easily become so, but not at the cuddle party. The website for the event was clear: “THIS EVENT IS NON-SEXUAL, DRUG AND ALCOHOL FREE, AND LIMITED TO PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE 18+.” The site also posted a list of rules, including: “You don’t have to cuddle anyone... ever” and “You must ask permission and receive a verbal YES before you touch anyone. (Be as specific in your request as you can.)” Before we’d get to cuddle, there would be a one-hour workshop on consent. Consent is important, but I wondered why such a simple concept warranted an entire hour of discussion, and I fretted this would give us less time for the main activity. The website advised us to bring “comfy pajamas” (not lingerie) to change into and noted that pajamas were to remain on for the entire event. I wanted to wear my best PJs — teal blue trimmed with white rickrack — but they were short, possibly immodest, and my arms and legs might be cold, so I chose a long pair instead (a wise choice because the venue ended up being chilly). In the days leading up to the event, I kept daydreaming about the cuddle party. I imagined a sensual paradise — a radiant garden where attractive and open-minded people playfully intertwined. One person would stroke my hair. I would caress somebody’s shoulder. Somebody else would be pressed against my back, spooning me. My new friends and I would be touching right up to the sexual line (the collar bone but not the breast), and our restraint would be erotically charged. All would be guileless and guiltless. Pleasure in public with strangers! An extended sensuous carnival! What joy lay ahead! At the last minute, as I was packing my pajamas, Mark said, “Maybe I’ll come with you, after all,” but by then the event was sold out. So I went alone, just as I’d gone solo to Burning Man 15 years earlier (and what a time that had been!). This particular cuddle party keeps a low profile. There was no sign for the event in the lobby, and the address, which was in Manhattan’s financial district, wasn’t provided to me until shortly before the event. When I got into the elevator, a young man was already inside and pressing the button for the cuddle party floor. If it’s usually awkward to be sharing a small elevator car with a stranger (you may nod in greeting, but you basically wall yourself off), it’s twice as awkward when you are both going to a cuddle party, where you might soon be touching. As we ascended, the young man and I avoided looking at each other. The elevator door opened directly into a loft. The foyer area was small and crowded, with many people in line for the single bathroom. A woman with a clipboard signed me in, and then I proceeded to the big room, where about thirty people were lolling about on couches and futons and pillows. I went into a screened-off cubicle, changed into my pajamas, and joined the others. I was impressed by how racially diverse the crowd was — just like Manhattan. Most people were in their 30s and 40s. I did see a few in their 20s and two or three people around my age. One woman was there with her daughter, who looked to be about 45. The facilitator, with his balding head and graying beard, also appeared to be around my age, which put me at my ease. I chatted with him as more people arrived and we waited for the program to start. He was genial, enthusiastic and kind. He’s been doing this work for years, and he told me his father is a cuddle party facilitator as well. I made a quick calculation. That meant his father must be at least 90 — how great that he was still working! “How old is your dad?” I asked the facilitator. “73,” he replied. I realized this man whom I thought was my age must be in his 40s. How could I be so far off? Perhaps I was this far off about many things. I looked around the room trying to decide if these folks were hot or not. The couple closest to me was definitely attractive, but most of the people in the room were of average appearance. There were a few participants I thought most people would happily pursue and a few most would not, and about 20 people in the middle. There seemed to be an equal number of women and men, a few of whom probably identified as LGBTQ+. “We did exercises where we asked for the kind of touch we wanted and were turned down, and we did exercises where we turned down others’ requests. This seemed silly at first, but the simulations achieved the goal of making us comfortable both requesting and turning down cuddles — and also getting rebuffed.” Although the website emphasized strict punctuality and said the doors would be locked at 7 p.m. sharp, we waited half an hour for the latecomers to straggle in. As we waited, I couldn’t help noticing the general grubbiness of the venue. I wish the organizers had hired a cleaning service or rented a higher-end loft. More disturbing was the huge window on the south wall of the space. It had no blinds or drapes, so people on the upper floors of the building across the street could look right in. Anybody with a telephoto lens could see and photograph any of us. Finally, the welcome circle was formed and the workshop began. We were told how to ask for and refuse consent. We did exercises where we asked for the kind of touch we wanted and were turned down, and we did exercises where we turned down others’ requests. This seemed silly at first, but the simulations achieved the goal of making us comfortable both requesting and turning down cuddles — and also getting rebuffed. They helped us verbalize our requests and responses frankly, without fear, and I realized that this experience could affect us well beyond cuddling with strangers. What seemed like a dreary preamble to the evening was actually providing us with a useful skill. Of course, there was the usual workshop jargon I’d encountered in similar situations. We were in a “safe space.” The room was our “container.” We should respect people’s boundaries. We should practice mindfulness. (And I should probably practice being nonjudgmental!) Finally, the workshop was over, and, as the website promised, we’d have “a couple of hours for free-style cuddle time” which we could use to “relax, chat, cuddle, have a snack, or just hang out.” I didn’t want to have a snack or just hang out. I looked longingly over at the attractive couple who had been sitting near me when I first arrived but now were further away and facing another direction. Was I paranoid or had they taken evasive action? I looked elsewhere. No one was looking at me or waving me over, but the exercises had emboldened me. I asked the person closest to me, a tall fellow of about 35, “Could I stroke your forearm?” He gave his consent, so I stroked his forearm. It wasn’t especially pleasurable, and it didn’t lead to further touch. After a while, I thanked him and moved on to a woman who agreed to let me caress her cheek. My few requests were never denied, but no one ever asked to touch me. After about half an hour, I began to feel — to misquote Nora Ephron — like a wallflower at the non-orgy. I noticed that many people were not cuddling, just awkwardly chatting with each other. I found the absence of alcohol or, for me, pot, made it harder to be sociable. Perhaps newbies to cuddle parties are often inhibited. I ended up on a banquette with another first-timer, a German woman around my age. We spoke about ourselves. I told her I was happily married. She said she was looking for a partner and showed me her “dating cards,” which she proactively gave to men who interested her, a gambit I admired. The cards contained only her first name and her phone number. She said she didn’t want prospective dates doing internet research on her (I wish I’d asked why!), and she didn’t want emails. She wanted calls. She wanted voices. She wanted true connection. She had come to the cuddle party for some touch, yet like perhaps half the people in the room, she wasn’t cuddling, she was talking. Maybe she and I could have cuddled, but at the time it didn’t occur to me. I moved toward the crackers and cheese. I did see some cuddling going on — a few people on the rug were hugging a pretty woman of about 30 — but I was never part of such a poly pile. I saw no people I wanted to embrace, and no one seemed eager to embrace me. My warmly envisioned garden was drying out and withering. Or maybe only I was. Is any experience as thrilling as one’s fondest expectations? Perhaps only being a grandparent. And what did I expect — that I, a granny, would come to this party and be the belle of the ball? My loving husband had made me ridiculously self-confident. I slunk out before the closing circle. “I have to catch my train,” I said at the door, revealing myself as a suburbanite. I was suddenly eager to return to the man who’d cuddle me whenever I wanted, no consent required. Mark was asleep when I crept into bed, with his back facing me, which I prefer. I snuggled against his back and put one leg over him. In his sleep, he held my foot. I was home. A few days later, I got a message from the German woman. She’d come down with Covid and asked how I felt. Wouldn’t it be ironic if I’d caught Covid at a cuddle party… without having done any cuddling? But I hadn’t caught Covid. I’d gotten my booster shot and I was fine. The only thing I caught at the cuddle party was a blow to my vanity ... and I was already beginning to recover.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life For Elizabeth Williams , one of the three courtroom artists inside the Manhattan courtroom for former President Donald Trump ’s trial, every day is a new challenge. Take last Tuesday, when defense attorney Todd Blanche cross-examined Trump’s fixer-turned-enemy Michael Cohen on the witness stand. She nailed the former president’s facial expression. “He tends to purse his lips forward when he gets really pissed off. And he was doing that,” Williams told HuffPost on Sunday. But on that particular drawing , she was less satisfied with how Cohen turned out, even though she felt she got his energy down. “Did I get a really great likeness of him? No, but that’s what the back-and-forth [between Blanche and Cohen] looked like.” That’s the daily challenge of a courtroom artist. “It’s not like you can say, ‘I’ve been doing this for so long. It’s just so easy now.’ That’s just unfortunately not true,” Williams said, noting that she goes through “a lot of paper.” Trump is on trial in New York for allegedly covering up hush money payments Cohen made on his behalf to Stephanie Clifford, an adult film star who goes by Stormy Daniels, ahead of the 2016 presidential election. And unless you’re a juror or journalist, you’re most likely only seeing the trial through Williams’ and other courtroom artists’ sketches. New York remains one of the only jurisdictions that bans cameras in most courtrooms. In this high-profile criminal trial, as with many others where photography, broadcasting and livestreaming is limited or banned , courtroom art is one of the only ways that the public can see how the proceedings unfold. These artists become responsible for conveying what it’s like to be in that room. It’s their job to capture the colors, moods and participants’ gestures, however fleeting. What sets courtroom art from other mediums is how it can distill a scene into “the key most important elements and put them into an image. And it’s representative of the day’s story,” said Christine Cornell , one of the other courtroom artists covering the Trump trial. Cornell noticed that her first drawings of Daniels made her simply look pretty, but she was later struck by a moment during Daniels’ testimony when she was making a face with her jaw. “You want to just get it enough to show the agitation and that she’s expressing herself,” Cornell told HuffPost about why she chose that moment to zoom in on. In one of her own drawings of Daniels, Williams highlighted how closely the jury listened to her testimony. She could not get the jurors’ faces, but she made sure to draw their hands jotting down notes. “They were very attentive to her,” Williams said about the moment. “She’s talking to them. ... Some witnesses don’t really address the jury. She did.” Each day, the three veteran courtroom artists –– Williams, Cornell and Jane Rosenberg –– are seated in the third row on the right side of the courtroom. They rotate spots daily. Williams was scheduled to sit on Tuesday on the far right next to the wall, which she said would give her a chance to see the jury and what they’re doing, for example. Between them, the three artists have covered many famous cases, such as Tom Brady’s “ Deflategate ” saga, Harvey Weinstein’s 2020 rape trial and the trial of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein’s associate, Ghislaine Maxwell . However, all three said this trial stands out for the intense security presence around the proceedings, including from police and the Secret Service. “They won’t even excuse us to leave until all the prosecutors are gone and Trump’s been gone for 20 minutes,” Cornell said. Court artists are used to being able to draw people in seconds, she said. But it’s been hard to even catch a good glimpse of the star of the case, Trump, who is often blocked from view by court officers. “Every day, I have to wait till [the officers] move or squeeze a peek in between them,” Rosenberg told HuffPost. “But [Trump]’s really fun to draw. He’s got great expression on his face, that pouty look. He’s got great bushy eyebrows and his helmet hair.” Williams, who works with the Associated Press, said she has to adhere to strict AP editorial guidelines. “I can’t take a picture of Donald Trump and ram him up next to the witness box,” she explained. Some of her work does not include Trump, simply because she cannot see him. As the weeks-long trial nears its conclusion, the artists have been pulling long hours to complete four to five sketches a day, which they shoot off to wire services or news outlets on breaks. Cornell said she’ll email her drawings in the bathroom. “There’s a nice big window there with a counter. I set my drawings down, take a photograph and email it in. Very glamorous,” Cornell said. The long days can be “physically draining,” Rosenberg said. To get the best view, Rosenberg, who is right-handed, has to work with her left hand at times, which hurts her back. To help, she wakes up at 4 a.m. and does back exercises and meditates. “I’m exhausted right now, because I get up so early and I have such a long day, of course, but I don’t start drawing until like 9:30 [a.m.], when [Trump] walks in the room,” Rosenberg said. Cornell said for her job, she uses a “couple hundred” pastels, binoculars and a seat cushion to help her see over people. She estimates that her portfolio and art supplies weigh more than 20 pounds. And on the world stage, you have to be ready to face everybody’s opinion about your work. Critics often accuse courtroom artists of unfairly editorializing about the people they draw. At this year’s White House Correspondent’s Dinner, comedian Colin Jost said the artists were trying to make Trump look “like the Grinch” and “as bad as possible.” Rosenberg said that this critique is “ridiculous.” She said she’s has gotten more praise than criticism for her sketches during the trial — her arraignment sketch of Trump became a New Yorker magazine cover — but she does occasionally read negative feedback. Recently, she got an email from a person that said she inaccurately portrayed Cohen “as an old, sad, sick man” and Trump as “a strong middle-aged man.” She replied, saying that she was sorry that her work had let the person down. “It does make me feel bad,” she said of the criticism. “But I have to keep going.” Being a courtroom artist requires quick thinking and the ability to start over instantly if there’s a better scene to capture. It’s an “adrenaline rush,” Rosenberg said, noting that she sees her job as a “service for the public.“ But it’s a shrinking profession. Williams, who started doing courtroom art in 1980 after working as a fashion illustrator estimates there are only about 10 courtroom artists working across the nation right now. She said courtroom art is not her full-time job and she draws weddings and events on the side. Cornell and Rosenberg both said they would not recommend the profession to others, because it can be hard to find steadily paying gigs. Even though she is well established, Cornell said she can go weeks without work. “I don’t think it’s a good way to earn a living,” Rosenberg said. But if you want to learn how to draw like one, grab a sketchbook, head to your local criminal courthouse and go to arraignment or a hearing. They are often open to the public and are the “bread-and-butter” assignments for courtroom artists, Williams said. “A lot of artists feel like, ‘Oh, I can draw from photographs, so I can do all this.’ ... Going from a photograph and drawing from life are totally different,” she said, noting how she has to deal with subjects who are constantly moving. “Draw a lot and draw quickly and look at the scene — the scene is the drawing,” Williams advised aspiring courtroom artists. “Do it a lot and then you’ll finally start to get ... something that you feel like, ‘Yeah, this is pretty good.’” It can be hard work, but for courtroom artists, the enduring appeal of their job is getting to draw people. “I don’t really want to draw trees and flowers,” Williams said. “A seascape is only interesting if it has people in it.” “People are so interesting. Just never boring,” Williams said. “A face has a multitude of muscles. That’s one of the things about Cohen, is that he has all these expressions, and just to grab one is really important. The eyebrows do all sorts of things.” Soon the demanding days of the Trump trial will come to a conclusion. Both Cornell and Rosenberg said they are looking forward to the end. On a recent day off, “I got up at 7:30 a.m. So late for me, I was so happy,” Rosenberg said. “It’s a luxury.” “My dog misses me,” Cornell said. “It’s going to be fabulous when it’s over, and I’m just really interested to see what happens.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer I grew up believing that being pregnant would be one of the best experiences of my life. I heard about the glow and all that bliss that comes with it. I expected nothing less than the pure joy of anticipating a baby, and I never imagined that my pregnancy could be brutally different from the way I had always imagined. Things began fairly typically. At first I got sick riding in a car and then I threw up again when I got home. The next morning, the nausea was back and remained with me throughout the day. I had been trying to get pregnant for three years, and, after being disappointed so many times, I put off taking a test for several days. When I finally did, the test was positive. Still, I was unconvinced, so my husband and I visited my OB-GYN. My doctor performed an ultrasound and confirmed I was eight weeks pregnant. When we heard our baby’s heartbeat, I burst into tears and finally let myself embrace what was happening. My husband and I were ecstatic. We hugged and laughed through our tears. Suddenly I got sick and threw up in a plastic bag. My doctor assured me I was just experiencing morning sickness. “Just make sure you drink enough liquids and eat,” she said. “You should be fine by the second trimester.” Just a few more weeks , I thought to myself as I tried not to vomit again. The situation escalated dramatically in the following days. I was severely sick all day every day — not just in the mornings. I could barely eat anything. Whatever I put in my mouth came back up and was flushed into a toilet just a few minutes later. My nausea was so extreme that it wasn’t long before I completely stopped eating. Within a week I was so weak that couldn’t even get out of bed. My husband took me to the ER, where they hooked me up to IVs because I was dehydrated, and my ketone levels were elevated due to the loss of fluids. I was starving and in pain and my mind was foggy. I felt like I was dying, but everyone around me kept telling me “This happens all the time” and “Unfortunately, this is just a part of being pregnant.” The fluids only offered temporary relief. I sensed that what I was experiencing was different from what others typically went through. Could morning sickness be this brutal? By 12 weeks, I had dropped 9 pounds. There was no sign that my condition would subside by the second trimester, as my doctor had assured me. Instead of feeling better, I was bedridden and depressed. I couldn’t do anything without my husband’s support. I hadn’t showered once since the day I heard my baby’s heartbeat. I couldn’t brush my teeth. I cried all of the time. Not only was I severely nauseated, I also constantly felt dizzy. Almost anything — watching TV, listening to music, reading books or walking — could make me vomit. Sometimes I threw up 20 times in a single morning. I tried everything the nurses suggested: bed rest, acupuncture, breathing exercises, herbal tea, ginger chews and therapy. A shelf in our kitchen was overrun with Pepto and Mylanta bottles. Nothing helped. I felt betrayed by my body. Food, which has always been a significant and joyous part of my life, became my worst enemy. I could barely eat. A few sips of water and a couple of crackers throughout the day was all I could manage to keep down. Our apartment — filled with piles of dust, unwashed bedding and dirty dishes — reflected my misery. I was locked in our home and I felt as though I had become one with our dreary bedroom. Unable to interact with anyone but my husband, I morphed into a sad gray creature who crawled out of bed only to use the bathroom. Days turned into weeks, and I just tried to hold on until I gave birth and hopefully my nightmare would be over. Outside, the seasons changed and the world went on without me. When I was about 18 weeks pregnant, after nothing had changed, my obstetrician suggested I might be suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, a “ potentially life-threatening pregnancy disease that may cause weight loss, malnutrition, dehydration, and debility due to severe nausea and/or vomiting, and may cause long-term health issues for mother and [babies],” according to the Hyperemesis Education and Research Foundation (HER). It’s estimated that 1% to 3% of pregnant people suffer from HG, but it could be as high as 10% . At first I was relieved to have a name for what I was going through. It made me feel less alone, knowing that other women also experienced this hell. I could finally stop blaming myself for being so flawed. I naively believed that having a diagnosis meant I could be treated, but my obstetrician crushed my hopes when I learned there wasn’t much she could do, that my HG would probably last my entire pregnancy. I did not know how — or if — I could survive five more months of misery. My doctor offered me a combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine, which didn’t stop my nausea or end my vomiting, but it did knock me out for 20 hours a day. While I slept, I kept having the same dream: I was at a table filled with delicious food, and I kept trying to reach it, but it was just beyond my grasp. I would begin to howl in desperation, and then I’d wake up — ravenous and nauseated again. After several days of deep sleep, the drugs seemed to have an effect. I woke up one morning, tried a piece of bread and didn’t vomit. I asked for another piece and then another. Eating bread and not throwing it up right away was the highlight of my pregnancy. The list of foods I could successfully keep down then widened to include boiled macaroni, potatoes, lemon sorbet, pastries and tomatoes. All other food still made me retch. Though I could eat, my life was stagnant. I was still too sick to do much of anything but doom-scroll between bouts of vomiting. I read about other women’s experiences with HG to feel less alone. I learned that many experts believe my favorite writer, Charlotte Brontë, died of hyperemesis. I tried to find out as much as I could about Kate Middleton’s HG journey, but the only information about the Duchess of Wales’ treatment was a vague statement about how she “may require supplementary hydration, medication and nutrients.” For some women, HG was so unbearable and life-threatening that they terminated their pregnancies, and others said they contemplated suicide . I was despondent thinking about how many scientific breakthroughs we’ve achieved, but when it came to hyperemesis gravidarum, medicine seemed to be stuck in medieval times, when women with morning sickness were treated with candied orange peels or advised to sniff a violet. It wasn’t just my physical misery that was taking a toll on me; it was living in a world that refuses to see HG as the debilitating and traumatizing condition it truly is. People around me, except my husband and parents, didn’t truly believe how dire my condition was. They thought I was being overly dramatic and seeking attention. One acquaintance told me I was “too sensitive” and another suggested I must have had problems with my liver and that next time I should “do some cleansing and proper preparation before getting pregnant.” The therapist I contacted insisted that my extreme nausea and vomiting were due to my subconscious rejection of a baby. “You just don’t want to be pregnant, and your body is manifesting this,” she said with unshakable confidence. One of my pregnant friends who didn’t have HG told me she started thinking positively the day she learned she was pregnant, and, thanks to her affirmations, her whole experience was smooth. So many of the people I knew persistently told me that good nutrition was the most critical thing in pregnancy — as well as “peace of mind.” I had neither. Instead, I constantly worried about my baby, and every trip to the doctor’s office was filled with tremendous anxiety. Was the baby OK? Was she growing? Was the bread I was eating enough to sustain her? I had been so excited to finally be pregnant, but this kind of pregnancy wasn’t my choice. I wasn’t glowing or feeling as cheerful as I had always imagined I would be. There is no room for my hyperemesis in a space that too often demands the illusion of perfection. There are no movies with a protagonist who has hyperemesis gravidarum and few mainstream articles about trying to survive this condition. Nobody wants to talk about it. I was so grateful to have my husband and my family, but still I felt completely alone — trapped in a body that I wanted to love for creating my baby but that I hated for torturing me. My HG stopped the moment I gave birth to my daughter at 41 weeks. I suddenly didn’t feel any nausea, and the first thing I craved was the meat that I couldn’t even look at for more than half a year. Motherhood — even with all those sleepless nights, endless breastfeeding and everything else that was demanded of me — seemed so easy after being locked in my rebelling body for 33 long weeks. When I look at my beautiful daughter, who is almost 3 now, I know it was all worth it. I’ve always wanted three children, but my mind and body recoil at the mere thought of being pregnant again, and I do not know if I would willingly accept the nightmare of HG again to have another child. I hope that if I did face HG again, the experience would be different, thanks to recent research discoveries. In December 2023, a study published in Nature identified a specific hormone, called GDF15, as the probable cause of morning sickness. Researchers suggested that “blocking GDF15 action in the pregnant mother should be a highly effective therapy for women suffering from HG,” which means better treatments for HG could be on the way. When I read the news, I was overwhelmed with a lot of competing emotions — elation, sorrow, wonder, solace. After suffering so deeply and for so long, I finally felt a shimmer of hope for myself and the countless other women who are battling or will battle HG. I’m optimistic that this new research and other studies will change how we deal with HG, but I worry about how long it may take before a viable treatment is available. I want to believe the urgency to provide relief to patients is finally recognized, but I also know how frequently women’s medical concerns are ignored or dismissed. We need more clinical trials, faster research-to-medication pathways and multiple approaches to relieving HG so that the needless suffering of pregnant women may finally be eased. I can picture a better reality where no mother suffers what I endured. I desperately hope it comes soon.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer From coffee shops to dive bars to restaurants with white table linens, I found a kind of joy that’s hard to put into words. It’s a joy that’s woven into the fabric of shared meals, echoing laughter and the exchange of stories that flow as easily as the wine in our glasses. This journey, affectionately known as my “ 50 States Project ,” morphed from a simple goal into a profound exploration to find happiness, belonging, connection and a deeper understanding of myself — a narrative deeply entwined with my unique heritage. Adopted from South Korea by a Japanese American couple, I’ve always lived at the intersection of multiple identities. My father was born in 1922 in the basement of a rental home on Main Street in Seattle, while my mother’s roots trace back to her birth in 1929 on Bainbridge Island, a 30-minute ferry ride from Seattle. Their lives, and in turn, mine, were forever altered by the events of Dec. 7, 1941. The bombing of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent internment of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans under Executive Order 9066 cast a long shadow over our family narrative, embedding a sense of cautious belonging that followed us through generations. For my family, travel was tinged with the remnants of these fears. The echoes of internment camps, World War II and its lingering aftermath shaped a world where movements were guarded and the concept of belonging was complex. My childhood was thus a small universe anchored to the West Coast, with my dad feeling that we weren’t welcome in much of the U.S. due to being Asian. His beliefs were based on his own experiences, both during and after the war. As a child and young adult, I had unconsciously adopted these beliefs as my own. The inception of the 50 States Project was a declaration of my desire to transcend these inherited boundaries. It was an ambitious quest to forge connections across America and to discover that the essence of belonging is not about the physical spaces we occupy but the moments we share and the communities we build. As the United States grapples with its place on the global happiness scale , sliding in the rankings of the world’s happiest countries, this journey felt even more poignant. This wasn’t just about personal exploration; it was a reflection on what binds us in the pursuit of happiness. Diving into this journey — and finding a connection in each state — was a daunting task. I started with familiar faces from my inbox: podcasters, vendors, the kind of people you feel like you know because you’ve traded emails or shared a laugh over a call. Yet, we’d never actually seen each other — not in the real, stand-in-the-same-room kind of way. Then there were the blasts from my past: friends who had drifted into the background noise of life, voices I hadn’t heard in over three decades. Reaching out to them felt like unearthing a time capsule buried in the backyard of my youth, dusting it off and peeking inside with bated breath. From this mix of the known and the long-lost, I connected with 27 women from 27 different states who were willing to take time out of their busy lives to share a meal with me. During the next phase, I turned to the digital world and threw out a call for connections in the gaps of my map in a professional group I frequented online. The response was heartwarming, with strangers reaching out to help me achieve my goal and sending well wishes for my endeavor. Social media was my last stop. Within a month of beginning my project, I had a beautiful, complete roster of women across all 50 states ready to break bread with me. This group of women — ranging in age from their 20s to their 60s and differing in race, education level, political and religious beliefs, sexual orientation and household income — provided the perfect mosaic for my journey. The individual stories I encountered on this journey painted a vivid picture of America’s heart. In Connecticut, I met Kate, whose resilience in the face of her husband’s terminal illness underscored the strength found in community support. Her story, set against the backdrop of hospice care and the tireless web of friends and family that supported her, reminded me of the profound impact of human connection. Maine introduced me to Cameron, whose life, marked by numerous relocations, had found joy in the community she built around her, wherever she found herself. Our time together, which included collecting lobsters from local fishermen for a shared meal at her home, was a lesson in the art of creating a home wherever you are — a testament to the idea that belonging is about people, not places. As beautiful as my experiences were, I was also confronted by the darker threads of our nation’s fabric. On one part of the journey, just after I landed in Ohio, I passed a white supremacist rally that was taking place. Seeing it was a jarring reminder of the deep-seated divisions still present in our country. This encounter, as unsettling as it was, emphasized the significance of my project in navigating these divisions. Despite its challenges, the project was a beacon of hope and understanding. Farrah, who was born and raised in Ohio, felt like a long-lost friend from the moment we met. She and I sat for hours at a restaurant she chose, and the waitress even commented that she thought we were best friends, not strangers who had just met. Afterward, I kept thinking about how amazing it was that I initially felt so uncomfortable in that state, only for someone from there to make me feel so at home and welcome. So much so that I found myself already making plans to return to Ohio to visit her. Then, traveling to meet Twanna, who grew up in the only Black family in her town in West Virginia, expanded my understanding of connection beyond race. Her perspective on seeing friends as family — on the power of deep connections that transcend superficial differences — was a lesson in the joy of inclusivity. These are just some of the women who shared their experiences with me — and changed my own life in the process. This journey wasn’t just about ticking off states on a map. It was a heart-opening trek across the emotional landscapes of people’s lives and a deep dive into the corners of my own heart that I hadn’t explored. It taught me something vital: the places I longed to see were merely backdrops to the true adventure — connecting with others, hearing their stories and sharing moments of genuine laughter and companionship over meals. I transformed my belief from a fearful “I am not welcome” to a confident “I can find people everywhere who will welcome me.” More importantly, I learned that happiness and a sense of belonging sprout from these shared experiences, from understanding and acknowledging our collective past as we weave our present and future together. Bringing this spirit of discovery home, I’ve made it a point to reach out to old friends and invite new acquaintances to sit down and share a meal. There’s a unique magic in breaking bread with someone, whether they hold the same beliefs as you or see the world through a different lens. Every invitation is extended with genuine curiosity — an eagerness to understand and connect that turns a simple meal into a bridge between hearts. This practice, this simple act of gathering and sharing, doesn’t require an ambitious project or extensive travel. It’s something we can all do in the communities we live in with each other. Imagine if each of us took the time to invite a neighbor over to share a meal and stories — how much richer and happier our collective lives could be. In these times, when so much in our society feels strained or even broken, this act of reaching out and fostering connections is more important than ever. The women of the 50 States Project are now connected through this experience, and we have Zoom calls every two months as they get to know one another virtually with hopes of one day meeting in person. My experience is a call to action for all of us — an invitation to create connections that can bolster the happiness and sense of belonging in our country. So, I encourage you, in your own way, to start this journey in your own neighborhood, one meal at a time. Together, we can create a ripple of connection that just might turn the tide, making our community and country a little happier — one shared story at a time.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer Some people may believe that the end of Roe v. Wade was simply a matter of luck: Following the then-black swan event of Donald Trump winning the 2016 election, Trump got to appoint two Supreme Court Justices in his first two years and a third after an octogenarian passed away weeks before the 2020 election. The court then had a 6-3 conservative supermajority, and that was that. But the project to overturn the federal right to abortion was much more calculated, involving an alliance of Republican groups aiming to reshape Congress, the courts and American life. And while conservatives may have won a huge battle, it’s not the end of their unholy war. That’s the story New York Times reporters Elizabeth Dias and Lisa Lerer tell in their new book, “The Fall of Roe,” a deeply reported accounting of the machinations of anti-abortion activists and lawmakers to reverse the 1973 ruling that reshaped both society and women’s lives. The book recounts the conservative network’s past victories, yes, but is also a window into the future, highlighting just how crucial November’s elections are for our rights and freedoms. That’s because if Trump wins a second term, this conservative coalition will bring even more litigation to strip away people’s rights — and would likely face a Supreme Court that’s even more untouchable than it is now. The group most connected to Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe, is Alliance Defending Freedom, a far-right Christian advocacy group. But ADF certainly didn’t do it alone, per Dias and Lerer — correspondents on religion and politics, respectively. In many ways, two other organizations laid the groundwork for this victory: The Federalist Society, a judicial group that drafted a list of Trump’s Supreme Court nominees, judges Trump said were all opposed to Roe ; and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion political group with an affiliated PAC. And they’re all funded with massive amounts of dark money , including from billionaires like the Koch brothers . The 30,000-foot view is that these groups worked together to draft and pass unpopular state laws and have conservative lawyers defend them in front of friendly judges who had been confirmed to lifetime appointments by Republican senators. The network could use this playbook on any number of issues in the future. ADF wrote Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban at issue in the Dobbs litigation. Dias and Lerer report that a conservative Wisconsin lawyer suggested crafting a ban at exactly 15 weeks basically as a dare for abortion rights proponents to challenge it, believing the Supreme Court would find the ban reasonable and gut Roe without fully overturning it. The lawyer, Misha Tseytlin, allegedly floated the idea at a Trump victory party hosted by Federalist Society Chair Leonard Leo , and then someone connected to ADF heard it, and the organization had Tseytlin present his theory at a July 2017 ADF summit. (This story shows that conservatives picked 15 weeks not because of emerging medical research, but because abortion rights advocates had chosen not to sue over previous 20-week bans designed to challenge Roe .) ADF drafted a model bill, identified states that might pass it and that had anti-abortion attorneys general who would defend it, and started talking to lobbyists. Then-Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) signed the 15-week ban into law in 2018, and litigation began. By the time the Supreme Court was considering taking the case, it was early September 2020. Then Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, and Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett, giving a 5-4 court a 6-3 conservative supermajority, with three Justices appointed by Trump — a president who lost the popular vote. The court agreed to hear the case in May 2021, and the rest is history. That playbook worked for striking down Roe , but the coalition is not done. Dias and Lerer write that ADF, in particular, will “work to restore an understanding of marriage, the family and sexuality that reflects God’s creative order.” First, abortion opponents think Dobbs is not enough; they want a nationwide ban starting at egg fertilization. ADF is involved in two abortion-related Supreme Court cases this term, and Kristen Waggoner, its CEO and general counsel, admitted in March that its lawsuit over the abortion pill , mifepristone, is part of a long-term strategy to restrict abortion at the federal level because Dobbs was never the end goal. What is? A nationwide abortion ban rooted in the view that life begins when an egg is fertilized. “We believe that human life is precious, that it deserves protection from conception until natural death,” Waggoner told Politico this past March. “We believe that the 14th Amendment protects persons and that includes unborn persons, and that the right to life is protected in the Constitution and in our founding document.” The legal theory of personhood from fertilization could also be weaponized against the right to use contraception established in 1965’s Griswold v. Connecticut — a precedent Justice Clarence Thomas called on the court to overrule . Though many anti-abortion activists falsely claim that certain methods of birth control are abortions because they prevent fertilized eggs from implanting in the uterus, Waggoner chafed at the suggestion that ADF’s positions could lead to restrictions on contraception. She told Politico that “ADF has never advocated for limitations on access to contraception” while later conceding that it’s all about how you define abortion and contraception . “I’m getting uncomfortable with the way you’re asking questions, because the mechanism of action for birth control is different depending on what that birth control is,” she said, per Politico . “For example, Ella would be considered an abortifacient.” Ella is emergency contraception , and no credible doctor thinks it causes abortions, yet multiple states are already trying to legally reclassify emergency contraception as abortion. (Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst even explained her vote against the Right to Contraception Act by saying that she introduced a separate bill that doesn’t protect emergency contraception .) This is an area to watch in the coming months and years. But getting the court to declare fetal personhood might take a while, and a backup plan appears to be trying to resuscitate the Comstock Act of 1873. ADF is arguing in the abortion pill case that the long-dormant anti-vice law means no one can mail abortion pills to other states, even those where abortion is legal. And in arguments, two justices seemed open to the idea . Anti-abortion lawyer Jonathan Mitchell — the man who wrote the Texas bounty hunter law that nullified Roe months before Dobbs — is working with activist Mark Lee Dickson to pass local ordinances claiming Comstock bans the mailing of abortion pills. And he’s deploying the same tactic of pro-bono legal representation that ADF used in Mississippi. Mitchell told The Nation he hopes to get lawsuits over the measures in front of the Supreme Court “as quickly as possible.” (Mitchell, I must note, is also litigating a case that gutted minors’ access to birth control in Texas.) ADF also has its sights set on reversing the 2015 ruling establishing marriage equality , but Waggoner also seems to resent when journalists ask her about Obergefell v. Hodges . (That ruling was 5-4, and two of the Justices in the majority are no longer on the court — you only need four votes out of nine to take a case.) “I’m worried you’re gonna just use a choice little quote, and anybody that reads the article is going to think I’m abandoning Obergefell , and I am not,” she told The New Yorker . “I think it is wrong and it should be reversed, but I don’t wake up in the morning thinking about how to do that.” The group wants to roll back transgender rights in employment ( Bostock v. Clayton County , 2020) and expand parental rights ( Troxel v. Granville , 2000) so that parents can override the medical needs of their children with gender dysphoria, The New Yorker reports. ADF is also behind the rash of state laws banning gender-affirming care for minors and trans kids’ participation in sports — the group wrote model legislation. W e’re watching a redux of the anti-abortion battle plan in real time. “It’s not that the Court is going to say, ‘Gender ideology is bad,’” Waggoner told The New Yorker . “But I do think the Court could say, ‘Parental rights are fundamental rights.’” This far-right Christian coalition is coming for practically every civil right people in the U.S. have gained since the 1960s. It wants to oppress queer people, young people and women, and there are very few obstacles in the way of it getting everything it wants. That’s the larger message of “The Fall of Roe” — that religious conservatives are extremely organized and see their work as far from over. The next president could appoint multiple Supreme Court justices who may be asked to rule on cases challenging the precedents in the crosshairs of ADF, the Federalist Society and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito could retire, cementing a 6-3 court for another generation — or the balance could tip even further to 7-2 should tragedy befall a liberal Justice. Our freedoms in this country currently depend on the life expectancy of nine unelected people in robes, and the court absolutely needs reforms, including term limits. Keep all the right’s larger project in mind when you vote this fall, because this network of groups is counting on people to tune out."

    "article_content": "Assignment Editor, HuffPost Julia Louis-Dreyfus has again pushed back on the idea that political correctness is killing comedy after her longtime friend, Jerry Seinfeld, recently suggested that’s the case. In an “On with Kara Swisher” podcast interview released this week, the “Veep” star was prompted to talk about the topic by host Kara Swisher. “I’m not going to wade you into the Seinfeld controversy because I think it has nothing to do with you, but I’d love to know what you think is funny now ... I think there’s a lot of talk about how comics can’t be funny now,” Swisher said. “I think that’s bullshit. Physical comedy and intellectual comedy, political comedy — I think, has never been more interesting because there’s so much to do,” Louis-Dreyfus said. “Comedy is risky, and it can be offensive, but that’s what makes it so enjoyable,” she added. “I personally don’t buy the conceit that this is an impossible time to be funny,” she continued. “Maybe some people aren’t laughing at your jokes, but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be made.” Louis-Dreyfus did not mention her former “Seinfeld” co-star while making the remarks. Seinfeld’s comments in an April New Yorker interview made headlines that month. In the interview, he asserted that the “extreme left and P.C. crap” was hurting televised comedy. In a New York Times profile published earlier this month, Louis-Dreyfus was asked about the controversial take, and she pushed back , saying it was a “red flag” to hear people complain about political correctness.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer My first sexual intercourse, just before I started college, was unplanned. It would have been largely forgettable if we’d used birth control. Looking back, it’s hard to admit to my own foolishness. I’d had the same boyfriend for 18 months. While our Catholic upbringings were a factor in this long period of chastity, my unpreparedness was also due to my mother’s admonition that a girl using birth control is sinning by anticipating sex. Five years before, my parents relentlessly belittled my older sisters after finding out that they were sexually active. Our household exploded in screaming and lectures on the “type of girl no decent man wanted.” Drawers were regularly searched. “I’d feel better if you weren’t using birth control and got pregnant,” our mother yelled. “At least your intentions would be good.” My sisters gave our mother’s advice all the consideration it deserved, but as a slowly maturing 12 year old, I took it seriously. Desperately wanting to please my parents, I took their words as a viable ethical position. By the time I was 17, my parents’ dysfunctional marriage had become a vicious, albeit silent, war. My philandering father often stayed out all night. My mother lost so much weight that her co-workers thought she had cancer. Yet she would stand in the doorway when Mitch dropped me off from dates, making sure I didn’t linger in the car parked in the driveway. She had begun emptying my drawers. I matriculated at the University of California, Los Angeles, a few months after my 18th birthday and about a month after I first had intercourse. I ended up on a waiting list for student housing. Since I lived too far away to commute, I stayed for the first quarter in the home of well-to-do family friends, taking a public bus to school. The family’s eldest daughter, Laura, was a high school senior. Grateful that she’d agreed to share her room with me, I was also indebted to her for her understanding of moral ambiguity. “I’m on the pill,” she said. “You can think about whether sex is right or wrong, but use birth control while you decide.” Meanwhile, my irregular periods were usually about 45 days apart, but I hadn’t menstruated in over two months. A few nights later, Laura crept into the kitchen to empty and wash a glass mayonnaise jar. The following morning, I peed in the jar, placed it in a brown paper bag and carried it on the bus, perfectly upright, hoping it looked like a bag lunch and that it wouldn’t leak or break. I waited two days for the negative results. I’d set up a simple cipher for the conversation with Mitch because I’d have to call him on a very public pay phone. He was a sophomore at a college across town, far enough that there would be a charge for “local long distance.” I brought a coin purse full of quarters and dimes. When Mitch answered the phone, I said, “I’m not going to the mountains.” “Wait,” he said. I could hear him moving across the room, pulling the phone cord into the hallway. “What?” he finally asked. “I’m not going to the mountains.” “Are you pregnant?” “I’m NOT pregnant,” I exclaimed in frustration, my three minutes coming to a close, the automated operator’s voice giving me my first warning. A girl standing in front of a vending machine turned to look at me. “Congratulations,” she said. I think she meant it. When she left, I got some chocolate chip cookies with change left over from the phone call. That was the beginning of my freshman 10, the anxiety pounds. I didn’t have a period until the academic quarter was over, and I’d moved into the dorms. As if all three missing periods had accumulated until the dam burst, I woke in the middle of the night slick with blood. Fearful of disturbing my new roommate, I found a towel without turning on the light and puttered to the restroom. At that hour, no one was in the hallway to see my blood-soaked pajamas. I cleaned up under one in a row of showerheads separated by white curtains. Multiple thoughts occurred to me: This could have been a miscarriage; I’d failed my mother’s strict chastity standard; Mitch and I were gambling with our futures. And still, I hesitated to act. Mitch was unwilling to buy condoms because it was embarrassing. His interest in a girl he’d met at work blossomed, and he sometimes treated me with cruelty, a thing that mimicked my father’s behavior. Despite the dysfunction of our relationship and my guilt when I came home and caught my mother searching my bathroom cabinets, Mitch and I occasionally ended up in bed when one or the other of our roommates went home for the weekend. I missed another period. Sin or not, I was pressing my luck. Now that I was on campus, the student health clinic was within walking distance. I made an appointment for the birth control lecture, a requirement before being prescribed the pill. At the student health center, I filled out a long, invasive questionnaire about my sexual activity. I found it humiliating, as if an unseen judge was now my in loco parentis. H aving never developed boundaries, I answered honestly. After completing the survey, I sat with a group of girls watching a film. One memorable scene had a woman talking about how she was never without her “condominium” — an embossed leather pendant pouch, worn like a necklace, which she squeezed open, and from which she pulled a wrapped condom. Tooled leather had been wildly popular a decade earlier, but this effort to make birth control hip felt flat. All the girls snickered, shook their heads — and put up with it. Because at the end of the film, we got what we came for: permission. Though I finally had monthly pill packs in hand, I’d been instructed not to start them until the end of my next period, which showed no sign of arriving soon. Mitch’s parents were going away for a weekend, so we were meeting at their house for our next date. Five days before, I figured I’d waited long enough. With no way of knowing when my next period would start, but certain that we would have sex that weekend, I started taking the pill. I figured it would make my periods regular, and my constant state of anxiety about the possibility of pregnancy would disappear. When I met Mitch at his parents’ house, we had a typical afternoon. A meal, sex, some TV. I started to feel cramps low in my abdomen. They quickly increased in strength. I went to the bathroom, sat on the toilet, and doubled over. A mass of blood flowed out, heavy, full of clots, pocked with fibrous strings. I wanted to tell Mitch I might have miscarried a pregnancy. That it was in the toilet and I wasn’t sure what to do. But Mitch didn’t like talking about the female body, waving off what he felt had an “ick” factor. All I could manage to say was that I’d passed a lot of blood. He stared a moment, shrugged his shoulders and turned back to the TV. I returned to the bathroom and flushed the toilet. Decades later, I still think back on that moment, my denial of reality. It was clear that Mitch’s affection for me had waned. My convenience as a sex partner was my primary appeal to him. He wasn’t someone I could have an honest conversation with, much less a baby, and I knew it. But I persisted in my hope that he would love me again, and imagined a future together. He was, after all, in the model of my father. It’d be a lie to say that day haunts me. And I imagine if someone asked Mitch about it, he wouldn’t be able to recall it. But I do think of it periodically, knowing that if I did accidentally terminate a pregnancy, I altered the course of my life. My parents died during the COVID-19 pandemic. My father had been declining for a few years. That, combined with my mother’s increasing dementia, brought my sisters and me into caregiving roles. With our father’s death, we were packing up what remained at their assisted-living apartment and moving our mom to more intensive care. I found a box of papers in the back of the closet. During the first move we’d pulled these papers from a safe bolted to the concrete floor, boxed them, and took them with us. Now, I was flipping through them. “Mom and Dad’s wedding certificate,” I said. None of us had ever seen it. My sisters peered over my shoulders. “April 18, 1954.” Four months before my oldest sister was born. We’d always been told our parents were married in September 1953. All of us were coming to the same realization at once. That was why they’d been married in the rectory rather than the church, our mother in a blue tailored suit. “I’m so angry,” my second sister said, visibly shaking. “I’m not kidding, I’m mad.” Our parents had been cruelest to her, telling her that, having slept with her boyfriend, he would then bring his friends over to have sex with her in front of him. There was no way to talk with our mother about this. Deep into her dementia journey, she was forgetting our names. Our sister conversation pinged. Was this purely hypocrisy? Did our parents think they were doing us a favor, hoping to shame us into not doing what they did? The only lesson I’d learned was how to lack agency. An old joke of my mother’s came back. “You can eat an apple for birth control.” “Before or after?” “Instead of.” My sexual decisions were not my parents’ to make. Nor did they belong to the university with its lecture, invasive questionnaire, and film. And though the country should have progressed on the matter in the decades since then, the U.S. is now hurling toward a dystopian invasion of women’s privacy and negation of their autonomy. My adult career choices always had me working with teens, first as a teacher and later as a high school librarian. When I read “ Girls & Sex” by Peggy Orenstein to see if it was a fit for our library collection, I wasn’t surprised to learn that research shows teens who take purity pledges are more likely to get pregnant than those who don’t. Along with other informative sex ed titles, I featured the book in my library and reviewed it on my school library blog because I am certain of this: Shame is no more an effective method of birth control than it ever was. Girls should know that the only permission they need is their own.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer Do you know any 9-year-olds on cannabis? I didn’t either, until recently. It wasn’t something I ever expected, just like much of my current life. When my daughter was less than a year old, I sat on a hard plastic chair at our local children’s hospital as the doctor told my husband, Cedar, and I that she had a rare genetic deletion — so rare it had no name. Our beautiful girl was missing DNA — unfortunately, a lot of it. Under the harsh fluorescent lights, the geneticist explained that our child’s future was largely unknown. There were too few people with her condition to know how the genetic difference would affect her, but it would likely have a significant impact. Reality began to seem more like a dream as the doctor revealed that our child might not walk, talk or eat by mouth and could experience any number of medical issues, including a major heart problem or progressive hearing loss, along with moderate to severe developmental delays and behavioral challenges. Soon after, our daughter endured multiple digestive problems, which required corrective intestinal surgery and a feeding tube. She could not eat orally and suffered profuse vomiting and chronic pneumonia. Nothing we tried seemed to help. No matter how many specialists and clinics we visited, we were unable to keep her well. Despite countless medical interventions, hospitalizations and procedures, her weight was abysmally low. This child, whom I loved wildly, was at risk for death. Witnessing my beautiful, bright-eyed daughter suffer was, and still is, the most excruciating thing I have faced. I stumbled through various permutations of grief: a lot of crying alone in the car, self-blaming and comparing myself to other mothers — the kind of mothers I thought I would be. These mothers considered everyday parenting questions, like how much Halloween candy to allow. Meanwhile, my child couldn’t eat much of anything. Therapy helped me process my feelings and experiences. As a relationship therapist myself for 15 years, I strongly believe that every good therapist needs a good therapist, especially when life veers far off plan. We had another child at home who was three years older, and we worked to keep his life as steady as possible. My parents helped us immensely with the load of childcare and logistics of running a slightly disorganized home hospital. Over time, we were able to develop strong connections to buoy us, including an amazing nurse and her husband, who became family to us. Miraculously, my girl got older. She learned to walk and talk on her own timeline. She read as well as any elementary schooler, frequently flapped her hands with glee and pressed her face against my cheek as a kiss. My daughter has a smile like a summer day and adores pop divas and any movies meant for tweens. Even when she was a toddler, we watched “Teen Beach Movie” snuggled together in the hospital crib I climbed into to be with her. When possible, we dance in nearly every room of our house. We sing together too; somehow, my daughter knows the words to almost any song played on the radio and can identify a tune based on just a few beginning notes. Her vomiting slowed but never stopped, and her behavioral challenges began to escalate, matching the genetic profile for the SYT1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder that was discovered since the initial diagnosis, which correlated with her missing DNA. SYT1 symptoms include aggression and self-injurious behavior like head-banging and hitting one’s self. When my daughter was in kindergarten, I sat on another hard plastic chair as a different provider handed my husband and me a stack of pamphlets to accompany her diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. I wasn’t at all surprised. She had the limited social skills and the specific set of interests typical of an ASD diagnosis. (If my kid was going to have a deep passion, I was grateful that it was pop music and its requisite divas.) She is far from alone. A utism affects one in 36 children in the United States; about 50% of children and adolescents with ASD have behavioral challenges . Cedar and I found a special helmet to protect our child. She did not mean to hurt herself or others; because of her cognitive impairment, she becomes easily flooded with emotion. We tried many therapies — physical, occupational, applied behavior analysis and early intensive behavioral intervention — and so many drugs prescribed by psychiatrists. It wasn’t our daughter’s neurodiversity that we were trying to change. Her brain is cool and unique, and she is more fun than anyone I have ever met. We needed something to treat the volatility that caused her meltdowns, both to help her feel better and to keep her and everyone else in our family safe. We first tried medical cannabis when our daughter was 5 years old, during the height of the pandemic. Our local public school district had recommended a level four placement in special education, which is a more restrictive environment than what a typical school offers. At home, we mostly kept our children apart; an adult was next to our daughter at every waking moment for safety reasons (not easy while sheltering in place in a rambler house). Most parents are trying to keep their children away from marijuana — that is certainly our perspective for our older child — but it wasn’t a stretch for us to try anything to help our daughter. I knew that medical cannabis was sometimes prescribed for autism, so my husband and I asked our daughter’s psychiatrist about it. We also asked our pediatrician and several other providers about the safety and effectiveness of the drug. Eventually, we were referred to a neurologist, who provided information and answered our long list of questions. I also pored through research studies on the subject. Because there was a reasonable chance that medical cannabis could help with our daughter’s ongoing discomfort, nausea and, most of all, aggression and self-injurious behavior, my husband and I agreed we needed to try it. The cannabis seemed to help with our child’s anxiety for a bit, but not enough to justify the intervention. We stopped the treatment and shifted to an antipsychotic medicine approved for autism, which initially reduced the meltdowns and eased her impulsivity. But three years later, we found ourselves desperate again. Our daughter’s anxiety was at full throttle, and her meltdowns were fierce and frequent. Because of her unique genetic makeup, many of the prescription drugs we hoped would calm our child instead elicited a paradoxical effect and increased her agitation. We decided to try medical cannabis again because of a limited yet growing body of research suggesting it can be helpful for ASD, as well as studies that link CBD-rich cannabis to a reduction in aggression in high-severity cases of ASD. With the expertise of a skilled pharmacist at a nearby medical dispensary, we landed on a small dose of a tincture with as little THC (the psychoactive component in cannabis) as possible to treat her specific medical concerns. We administer the liquid through a feeding tube, which is where our daughter gets all of her medications. So far, after nearly two months, our daughter’s anxiety appears somewhat lower, and her nausea seems less acute. It is not a panacea; she still has meltdowns that can escalate. But she has vomited less since starting medical cannabis, which is a huge deal for her. We plan to try other formulations (there are various approaches with different combinations of CBD and THC) to target those symptoms. If those are not effective, there are other interventions we intend to try too. Like any medication, there are risks and side effects. Cannabis use is linked to psychosis and learning difficulties , among other dangers. And while medical cannabis is now legal in 38 states , including Minnesota, where I live, it is still against the law in a dozen of them. More research is needed on medical cannabis, especially for use by children. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended it for life-limiting or vastly debilitating conditions when other therapies have been insufficient, the Autism Science Foundation has stated , “To date, there is limited research, and no evidence, on the potential short-term, long-term or neurodevelopmental risks and benefits of medical marijuana or its related compounds in ASD.” Because of the emerging nature of cannabis, it should only be administered after a thorough conversation with a trusted doctor who weighs the risks and benefits of the treatment. There are about 500 children who use medical cannabis in Minnesota. I haven’t yet faced judgment about the choice to try medical cannabis to treat my child’s incapacitating symptoms. I’ve been open about what we’ve been through with those we are close to, as well as in my memoir, “The Unlikely Village of Eden.” Many people have a sense of how hard my husband and I, and our entire extended village, work to help our daughter. This is not about getting her high, and they know that we don’t take a decision like this lightly after already exploring so many options. If I do end up getting the side eye, I likely won’t have the time or energy to worry much about it. In my role as a mom and caregiver, I am used to standing apart from the crowd. Over the past almost a decade, my daughter and I have gotten countless stares in the grocery store and at the park. In those moments, I try to remember that we are far from the only family coping with a chronic, incapacitating condition and facing a life that did not go to plan. Telling our story serves as a reminder to me, and hopefully to others dealing with something similar, that we are not alone. I’ve heard plenty of jokes lately, too, such as, ” Maybe you adults are the ones who need weed ,” given our caregiving requirements. What I really need, most of all, is a miracle cure to take away my girl’s suffering. Short of that, I need to continue to feel hope, which includes access to innovative treatments. Now, it’s medical cannabis. In a few months, seasons or years, it will likely be something else. Like any fierce, lovestruck mother, I am determined to try everything and will never stop advocating for my gorgeous, one-of-a-kind daughter. Emma Nadler is an author, speaker and psychotherapist. Her memoir, “ The Unlikely Village of Eden ,” is about learning to adapt and accept when life doesn’t go to plan, redefining community and creating your own imperfect path.

    "article_content": "Director of Corporate Relations at CancerCare I am 43 years old and, until recently, I was seriously considering a fourth round of orthodontia. I was born with a severe overbite and deformed jaw, a condition known as a Class II malocclusion and skeletal imbalance. I had standard metal brackets placed on my teeth when I was 12. The second round of treatment involved sturdy plastic trays — popularly known as Invisalign — at 25. With the third round at 33, I wore metal brackets again , only this time it was topped off with orthognathic (double jaw) surgery and my jaw was wired shut for weeks. By then, I’d spent nearly $15,000 and almost one-third of my life actively trying to reshape the lower half of my face. Ten years later, I still believed that my teeth were not socially acceptable or eye-pleasing and that I needed to undergo more dental work to fix them. My teeth have always looked as though they were running a race against my face and, because of it, the bullying I’ve endured has been relentless. It was so bad that sometimes, when I was out doing errands for my mom in our Brooklyn neighborhood, kids would shout at me from their windows as I passed. It was traumatizing. What I didn’t understand until many years later, when I began writing books for children, was just how life-altering some of those experiences were. Something changes in you when an entire neighborhood of children chants cruelties in your direction every time they see you leave your front door. As a child, I’d done what many children do to cope: I escaped into books — “The Babysitters Club,” Nancy Drew mysteries, the Hardy Boys, and Beverly Cleary’s novels. I enjoyed these books, but was never fully able to connect with the babysitting or mystery-solving or fun-loving adventures in them. My adventures were less wholesome and centered on navigating what the other kids (and even some adults) were going to say about my face. My peers often called me “bucky beaver” (a nickname that was coined — and circulated — by a close family member) instead of my name, and the adults (including my parents and some of my teachers) laughed when they heard it. I still have dreams about these experiences, and wake up unsettled each time. As I crept toward my 20s, I was shocked to learn that not even adulthood would shield me from scathing — and unsolicited opinions — about my teeth. When I was 23 (two years before my second round of orthodontia), I made a routine trip to the dentist. I was new to the area and had made an appointment with this particular office based on a recommendation. At the end of the visit, my new dentist said that everything looked great on the X-rays and that my home care was superb — a habit I’d picked up from my father, whose bathroom cabinets were always stocked to the hilt with dental floss and gum stimulators. “Except for this,” my dentist had said, tapping on my front teeth with his fingers. “This doesn’t look very nice.” His critique was strictly based on aesthetics and the extent to which I was considered visually pleasing to others. Trips to the dentist aren’t designed to be fun, but they shouldn’t be dehumanizing, either. That dentist certainly wasn’t the only adult to express concern over the position of my top teeth. Once a music teacher told me my teeth were a “distraction” from my singing. Even strangers on the street felt justified in offering their critiques. Not long after that experience at the dentist, I was substitute teaching in New Jersey. After I’d been to one parochial high school several times, I’d gotten to know a handful of students. Before long, they began to loudly mimic a horse’s neighing whenever they saw me coming down the halls. The irony of the school’s Jesus-centric décor and its messages about loving “thy neighbor” that adorned the halls and classrooms were not lost on me. I’ve spent my life contending with an unfortunate reality: like opinions about money, jobs, education, relationships, and a seemingly endless collection of other issues, most people have ideas about what others should be doing with their teeth. What I didn’t know then is that America has a long, manufactured history with perfect teeth — an obsession that began in the 1800s with the country’s first dental college. When I had my third round of braces, I was seeing an orthodontist who mainly catered to adolescents. At each visit, I sat among mostly middle schoolers in the waiting room who were there to be seen by our doctor. Though I was usually the only adult patient present, photos of smiling, middle-aged celebrities (like Gwen Stefani ) wearing braces adorned the office’s walls. The intended message, I think, was, “Look at how brave she is to walk around as an adult with all that metal hugging her teeth. See? She doesn’t care what people think. This could be you.” The message I received was, “This should be you. In case you aren’t aware, there’s something majorly wrong with your face — you’re an adult. Fix it! Fix yourself! What are you waiting for?” I have spent almost as much on trauma-informed therapy as I have on orthodontic care, and it’s helped. But you know what might have been even better than therapy? Creating a fictional character who struggles with the possibility of jaw reconstruction surgery. Writing my children’s book truly helped me heal from the trauma of my own experiences. In “ Jawbreaker ,” my debut novel, the main character watches her parents wage war over their money issues and her dad’s excessive drinking. She feels tremendous guilt about her expensive facial condition, even though it’s not something she can control, because she knows her parents are barely able to stay afloat financially. On top of all of all of that, the bullies at school are relentless — and her own sister is the cruelest of them all. It took nearly 30 years, but writing this book and, in the process, processing everything I have been through, finally allowed me to truly understand that others’ opinions about my teeth — my entire face — are no longer a crisis that I need to fix or even address. I’ve realized maybe it’s actually these other people who have said these things — and inflicted such profound emotional abuse — who are the ones in crisis. For those with mouths like mine, smiling can be an act of resistance. When I recently caught a glimpse of myself laughing in a mirror, I knew that I’d turned a corner. I was struck by how nice my smile looked. Despite my three rounds of braces and double-jaw surgery, my teeth and jaws are still not perfect, but they’re healthy, and they’re mine . I no longer feel the contempt for my face that I’d gotten so used to feeling when I saw my reflection. Learning how being comfortable in your own skin is life changing. I’m now more inclined to smile at strangers. I’m more willing to be in photos (assuming that I’m having an OK hair day). And although most photos of me are all teeth, I’m OK with it. That’s me. In fact, I’m starting to like those pictures. My current dentist also loves my teeth. She has never once suggested that I need to change them in an effort to be more accepted. Best of all, as an author and teacher, I get to talk to classrooms and auditoriums full of children who I know may be going through similar difficulties. Not too long ago, I would have declined those opportunities because I was too overwhelmed by the negative ideas about my teeth and face that have been imprinted on me since I was young. I no longer pine for the chance to confront those who’ve hurt me as a child or as an adult, as I now know it won’t do me any good. There are so many reasons why someone might choose to be cruel, but none of them have anything to do with me. I want to spend my time and energy on all of the incredible people in my life, everything I want to see and do and create, and all of the beautiful chances I have to smile. Christina Wyman is a USA Today bestselling author and teacher living in Michigan. Her debut novel, “ Jawbreaker ,” is a middle-grade book that follows a seventh-grader with a craniofacial anomaly that’s caught the attention of school bullies — including her own sister. “Jawbreaker,” published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, is a Publishers Weekly Best Books of 2023 and is available wherever books are sold, including through local independent bookstores .

    "article_content": "Guest Writer This man is a survivor , I kept telling myself, despite all evidence to the contrary. His face was gaunt, cheeks pale, hair threadbare from the most recent rounds of chemo. They had removed the lower left half of his jaw, searching for remnants of the disease, and his mouth hung slack and uneven. Even so, he kept trying to smile, to lighten the mood. His brown eyes danced when no other part of him could. A gurgling came from his tracheotomy — a gaping hole in his gray-stubbled throat — so I cleared it, dipping a suction tube into the chasm of his neck, watching the phlegm rise up and into the machine. It was satisfying, hearing the tone change as the tube hit pay dirt and sucked the mucus from his body. It felt like I was helping. His feeding machine whirred and hissed, pumping liquid nutrients into another tube in his stomach. Another breach in his body. The open wound that had blossomed on his neck was now quarter-size and white with discharge, somehow smelling both sour and sticky-sweet. I dabbed at it with gauze, sapping away the pus. A survivor , I told myself again and again and again. *** Only a few months before that, my father told me he had cancer, which was discovered during an innocuous visit to the dentist. “I’m sure it will be no big deal,” he said, believing that what they found in his jaw could be dealt with, like so much else. Within weeks he was in the hospital, hooked up to tubes, a hole punctured in his throat, six of his teeth and a quarter of jawbone pulled from his skull. It was one of the fastest-moving head and neck cancers that his doctors had ever seen. I remember pulling up to the hospital, expecting to find him in recovery. Instead, I saw my two brothers and my mom crying outside. “There was a bunch of beeping and then they kicked us out of the room,” my oldest brother told me. “They were able to revive him, but we’re still waiting to see what happens.” He was an active 78-year-old with an incredible life behind him, hopefully more in front of him, and he wasn’t going out without a fight. A survivor . *** My father was born Jewish in Berlin in November of 1938. Let that sink in. He liked to joke that it was one the dumbest decisions of his life, and he had several “stern conversations” with his parents about the timing. In the years after his birth, a barrage of laws and actions were unleashed to curtail German Jews’ participation in social and economic life: restrictions on transport, shopping, culture, travel, work. Bombings of his city. War. Then deportations. An uncle to Auschwitz. His grandparents to Theresienstadt. On Feb. 22, 1943, a hammering at my grandparents’ door echoed through their small apartment. They expected the worst — the heavy boots of the SS, perhaps — but it was a neighbor with a warning. “The Gestapo are at the corner,” she told them. “They are rounding up Jews. They are coming for you.” In that instant, my family made their decision: Ripping the yellow stars from their outercoats, they scooped my 4-year-old father into their arms and escaped into the cold Berlin night, to go underground as Jews hiding inside Nazi Germany. The hunt was on. *** I got married a few months into my father’s illness. We wanted him to be a part of the ceremony, before it was too late. It was a family-only affair that took place under a borrowed chuppah in front of the fireplace in my parents’ living room in Colorado. My father threw up halfway through the vows. Our wedding photos, though precious, show him looking 20 years older than he was, his face crooked and incomplete, his legs so weak that he could barely stand, a bow tie loose above the tubing of his trach. Toward the end of the night, he pulled me aside. “You should stay in the country,” he said, a reference to my wife’s Chilean heritage and our talk of living abroad, “and take care of your mother.” My parents had married 47 years earlier, posing for their wedding photos in the cherry-red interior of my dad’s 1969 Mercedes SL convertible. He still owned the car, so my wife and I re-created the photos, matching their gaze and positions. Then my parents eased in and did the same, an aged and misshapen version of the happiness of their youth. He said he wanted to drive the car one last time. I sat in the passenger seat with a hand on the wheel and we let him circle the driveway at 5 mph, white-knuckling it the whole way. *** My father’s 5th birthday, on Nov. 27, 1943, marked one of the heaviest days of Allied bombing in the entire war. His family had been living in the cellar of a shack in a farming community outside of Berlin when nearby explosions knocked trees onto the house, trapping them inside. Knowing that rescue would come with discovery, they came up with a new backstory and identity — the Berger family — and practiced telling their story until they were rescued two days later. The deceit worked. As the Bergers, they were given new identity cards and sent to live in Lückendorf, near where the Czech and Polish borders met in the East. They shared a house with other bombed-out families, including the wife of a Nazi officer. My dad went to school, where he learned to “heil Hitler” and sing Nazi chants. There was constant fear, as well as the stress of daily deception, magnified by a war raging around them. But their new identities allowed them to survive the following years within Nazi Germany, while losing some of their closest friends and family members to the horrors of the Holocaust. Their struggles were not over yet. When the Russians launched an invasion of East Germany, most Germans fled in horror, but to my family the Russians were saviors. It meant they had survived the Hitler time. Little did they know how brutal those forces would be. Over time, Russian troops gave way to a newly installed government, and communist East Germany was born. At the communists’ behest, my grandfather rebuilt a textile factory into one of the area’s largest employers. When the government later wanted to nationalize the factory, they arrested him and his co-directors for treason. (The charges stemmed from not handing in precious metals following the war.) After a public show trial, my grandfather was sentenced to six years in communist prison. My grandmother received word that she too was to be arrested. My grandfather told her: “If you have a chance to get to America, go! When I get out, I will find you.” So she rode a borrowed bicycle to my dad’s school and pulled him out of chemistry class. Once again they were on the run, this time attempting to escape the authorities as they made their way to West Berlin. *** The cancer spread and spread, and within a few months the treatment options were wearing thin. The chemo had helped but hadn’t eliminated the disease, and my father was weaker as a result. A radiation face mask left him burned and overwhelmed. At a low point, he brought up Colorado’s legislation on the right to die, an idea previously unfathomable for someone who had lived through so much. Meanwhile, we spent the time together as best we could. Friends and extended family came to visit, ostensibly to say goodbye. We watched movies at night. I tried to keep it light — dumb humor, new Pixar films — but he was finding little joy. He wanted to travel but there was just no way. Our conversations became deeper. His options were narrowing. He was running out of time. *** My dad knew only four words of English when he arrived in America: “cowboy,” “sweetheart” and “chewing gum.” He was a skinny 15-year-old who had spent the previous year in a refugee camp, but when his mom found work as a live-in housekeeper in Los Angeles, he was suddenly a junior at Beverly Hills High School. He went to an after-school program to improve his English. He got a job at Henry’s Camera to support the family. He helped run the photography club at BHHS. He graduated with the grades, but not the money, for college. After two years at Los Angeles City College, he became student body president. He won a debate with the line “Maybe you can’t understand my accent, but you know the other guy is full of shit.” He was then able to transfer to the University of California, Los Angeles, and received a degree in nuclear engineering with a minor in philosophy. He spent the next 25 years in varying executive roles for IBM, before transitioning to a new company in Colorado. I was 5 when we moved to Boulder. His new venture was a computer storage startup, and he molded it into one of Forbes’ fastest growing companies in America, with more than 1,000 employees. At the height of his newfound business success, my mother made a deal with him: Every time he appeared in a newspaper or magazine, he had to take out the cat shit. “It keeps you humble,” she liked to tell him as he bent over the litter box. “Keeps you humble.” *** As his health continued to fade, I stayed in my parents’ home, helping my mom care for him. I took three months of family leave from my teaching job, and we started in-home hospice care shortly before that time was up. On the night before I was set to head home, he looked at me intently. “I’m fading, Andrew,” he said. I didn’t have the heart to lie. To tell him otherwise. “Are you scared?” I asked. He paused, looking away. Evaluating. “No.” We shared a hug, a long look into each other’s eyes. Once so full of wisdom and joy, his brown eyes now held only pain. I kissed his forehead, and we hugged again. I think we both knew it would be our last. It was time. Two days later I got the call. *** In the weeks before he died, my dad managed to sit at his desk one last time, tasked with writing what would be his own eulogy. He typed slowly, deliberately, one finger at a time, eager not to have to make edits. At his funeral service, attended by hundreds, I read the words he had written for himself. Through my tears I heard the laughter and applause. His self-eulogy began: “Some time ago, someone asked me what I would like to hear at my own funeral. After thinking about it, my answer was: ‘Look, he’s moving!’ That seems not to have happened, and here we are.” Later in the speech, he mentioned what he was most proud of: his family, his marriage of 47 years, his three sons. But in his own touching way, he couldn’t resist a joke: “I’m proud of raising three kids who don’t know the meaning of binge drinking or the inside of a jail, or the meaning of excessive drug use. Of course, they don’t know the meaning of a lot of words, but I’m proud of them anyway.” We were proud of him, and always will be. He will live on through the memories we share, and the stories we tell. A survivor , through and through. *** I wouldn’t change a thing. Not even the suffering. In a weird way, I’m not sure he would have either. I think he understood the incredible life lessons it taught me. I think he felt proud of the life he had lived. All of the hardest moments — the barrage of bodily failures, the toughest conversations, the harrowing decisions to make — left a lasting impression that will forever shape me into a better man. A better father. I’ve learned that the nature of life is you have to expect things to go wrong on occasion. You have to be prepared to encounter suffering. Certainly aging. Definitely death. I had always imagined my father dying of old age, and it scared me as much as any illness did. His was a fast burn instead of a slow fade, and at least we had a timeline. It helped us put our priorities in order. It helped us laugh a little harder when we could. I have two daughters now. I wish he could have met them. I wish they could have met him . That is one of my biggest regrets. I brought them to visit his gravesite recently. The flatirons of Boulder loomed over his name, etched into granite. “Beloved Husband, Father, Opa, & Mentor, known for his leadership and quick wit. A Holocaust survivor, world traveler, and photographer, who lived in the present and looked to the future.” Because of him, the future is bright. Andrew Behrendt is a writer and teacher in Colorado.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost As someone who likes to be prepared for anything, I typically travel with a full purse. I fill my tote bag with a spare sweater in case I get cold, a large water bottle so I’m never thirsty, sunscreen for reapplying, a makeup bag for touch-ups, plus all the usual suspects including my wallet, sunglasses, keys and more. When I worked in an office, I also toted a laptop daily (in addition to everything listed above). My recent conversations with spinal doctors have me rethinking this strategy, however. “Overloading a bag with heavy items can be damaging to wrists, elbows, shoulders or back, depending on where it’s carried,” explained Dr. Kevin Lees , the director of chiropractic operations at The Joint Chiropractic in Scottsdale, Arizona. “Carrying less weight is always the priority. While you can change your bag to help distribute weight more evenly and comfortably, added weight will ultimately affect posture and gait.” Apparently, the fact that I tend to stuff all those items into a one-shoulder tote bag makes matters even worse. In an effort to shoulder better bag-carrying habits, I spoke with three spine doctors who set the record straight on the best and worst habits for your body. If you suffer from back pain, neck pain or stiff traps, your bag might be to blame. “When people wear an inappropriate bag, especially one that places undue strain on the spine, they will frequently develop shoulder pain along with lower neck and upper back pain,” said Dr. Luke Macyszyn , a board-certified and fellowship-trained neurosurgeon specializing in the surgical treatment of complex spinal disorders at DISC Sports & Spine Center. “These structures are all connected through the large trapezius muscle that runs from the base of the skull to the shoulders, and then to the mid-back. Sometimes, this can arise at the end of the day, but frequently these symptoms begin to develop after days, or even weeks, of using an improperly fitting bag.” You can cause long-term damage, too. “Many musculoskeletal conditions can arise from improperly carrying bags,” Lees said. “Upper or lower back pain can arise if the gait is changed, or if the person is altering their posture due to an imbalance of weight. Nerve damage can occur if straps are narrow and dig into a person’s skin. Someone consistently miscarrying items may develop back and shoulder fatigue, headaches, back pain and stiffness. Nerve damage can result in tingling or numbness and may lead to weakness or loss of grip strength.” Even if your bag isn’t causing you pain now, you could be laying the foundation for problems down the road. “Often, physical injuries take a while to become symptomatic, and once they become evident, they can take even longer to heal,” Lees added. “Be aware of your posture and use bags or backpacks safely to avoid long-term damage.” When it comes to bags that are terrible for your back, spine doctors agree that tote bags and shoulder bags are the worst culprits. “I never use a large tote or shoulder bag,” Macyszyn said. “Not only does this lead to strain on that given shoulder, but it leads to an imbalanced load that is placed directly on the neck as well as [the] thoracic spine. Except for short, necessary periods of use, it’s best that these bags be avoided, especially if prolonged use of a bag is required.” Dr. Jordanna Clarfield-Henry , a doctor of chiropractic with Health Haven Clinic in Toronto, echoed those sentiments. “The worst characteristics for a bag, leading to potential damage to your back, often involve poor ergonomic design and improper weight distribution,” she explained. “Carrying a bag over one shoulder rather than evenly distributing the weight across both shoulders can cause spinal misalignment and strain.” If there’s a lot of weight in your one-shoulder bag, that’s even worse. “Heavy bags exacerbate the strain on your back, especially if the weight is unevenly distributed or concentrated in one area,” she added. “The ideal bag should be lightweight to lessen the overall burden on your back. … If you must have a single strapped bag, then look for one that has a long strap [that] you can wear across your chest and back, making the weight better distributed over a larger area of your body.” Although a backpack worn on both shoulders is generally better for your back, you still shouldn’t overload it. “With the ideal bag that fits well, the weight should not exceed 10% of a person’s body weight,” said Lees. When choosing a backpack, look for an ergonomic design. “Adjustable and padded shoulder straps are essential to evenly distribute the weight of the bag across your shoulders and upper back, reducing strain,” Clarfield-Henry said. “Additionally, a padded back panel provides cushioning and support, preventing discomfort from pressure points. A waist strap or chest strap can further stabilize the bag and alleviate strain on the shoulders.” Then, you need to position it correctly. “In general, if the backpack is properly fitted (which includes shoulder straps on both sides of the body with proper padding), these bags place a relatively modest strain on the upper back,” said Macyszyn. “It is especially important to ensure that when wearing a backpack, the backpack remains level with the shoulders or a few inches below. In other words, it should not dangle below the waist, as that places increased strain on the upper back musculature.” Fanny packs and belt bags are popular these days, which is good news for your aching back. “These are usually small and very well supported, [therefore, they’re] not likely to cause any back pain,” Clarfield-Henry said. Crossbody purses are OK too, “if you have a thick strap and the purse is not too big and full,” as this “distributes the weight over a larger area of the body,” Clarfield-Henry added. In addition, Lees recommends alternating shoulders with each use. Similarly, “clutches or lightweight purses also pose minimal increased strain for the spine and can be used routinely without worrying about damage to the spine,” Macyszyn added. If you carry a wallet in your pants pocket, put it in the front pocket or make sure to remove it when you sit. “Not only does [sitting with a wallet in your back pocket] place pressure on the sciatic nerve, but it also leads to poor posture when sitting,” he explained. Of course, sometimes you’ll need to carry more belongings than a fanny pack or a small crossbody can hold. In those cases, consider a backpack on wheels or small rolling luggage, said Macyszyn, as they place “no load on the spine.” Need a small crossbody bag? Try a couple of our favorites below.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Many of us seem to forget that our scalp is an extension of our skin — until we’re faced with signs of distress in the form of itchiness, flakiness or even worse ... hair loss. “The scalp is the bedrock of your hair follicles and your hair’s support system,” said London-based trichologist Anabel Kingsley . “Poor scalp health, such as flaking and inflammation, can increase hair fall and also weaken hairs as they grow from their follicle.” Scalp health can impact the overall health and appearance of your hair, and ensuring it’s in prime shape means less chance of hair loss, thinning or unruly scalp conditions. To learn all about how to properly care for this often underlooked area, we interviewed several trichologists about the habits and behaviors they absolutely avoid. Like the skin on your face or body, the condition of your scalp should be considered when using any hair care or styling products. “As a trichologist, I would steer clear of using harsh hair products that may exacerbate a scalp condition,” said Anna Astarte , a Los Angeles-based trichologist. Common scalp conditions include dandruff, psoriasis, folliculitis and seborrheic dermatitis. Astarte recommended avoiding products with sulfates, as they can strip off your scalp’s natural moisture, as well as synthetic fragrances, which can lead to further irritation if you’re already struggling with a scalp condition. Instead, opt for soothing ingredients like aloe vera, anti-inflammatory tea tree oil and chamomile, which can help calm scalp irritation. Scalp massages may be non-existent in your routine, but Astarte said they can work wonders for your scalp’s overall health. “Scalp massages help stimulate blood flow and nourish the hair follicles,” she said. To perform an at-home scalp massage, use circular motions to massage your scalp for five to 10 minutes, two to three times a week. You can also use a scalp brush with soft, rounded bristles if you don’t want to use your hands. “I would never wear tight hairstyles like ponytails, braids or buns more than twice a week,” said Kayla Jones , a Dallas-based certified trichologist. “These hairstyles contribute to hair breakage and traction alopecia along the hairline due to pulling,” she said. They can also create soreness and tenderness on the scalp due to the constant tension. Limit how often you don this hair style and be mindful of your hair ties; Jones recommends avoiding traditional elastic hair ties and rubber bands and opting for satin scrunchies or “no tension” hair ties instead. Conditioners are often made with heavy oils, silicones and thickening agents. When applied on your scalp, which already naturally produces oil, the combination can lead to buildup, greasiness, itching and flaking. “Conditioner belongs on the hair strands, as it’s meant for moisturizing,” Jones said ― it doesn’t belong on the scalp. Notice hair thinning? Set up a time to visit a trichologist. “I’ve had clients who have experienced hair loss for 30 years and we achieved hair growth in four months,” Jones said. “I wouldn’t advise anyone to suffer in silence or suffer longer than they have to.” Hair thinning can begin as early as 20 years old, with common signs being bald patches, excessive shedding and changes in hair texture and quality. “A trichologist, similar to a dermatologist, can help create a treatment plan consisting of therapies geared toward hair growth,” Jones said. According to Tiffany Young, certified trichologist of Thin Hair Thick , a hair topper brand, hair styling products should be used for just that: hair styling. “I have seen overzealous and well-meaning people assume that if a product could potentially help their hair, it must also be great for their scalp, and this is simply untrue,” she said. “Hair styling products commonly contain alcohol, which tends to irritate and dry the scalp tissue, as well as silicones, which although may help the hair appear soft and shiny, can act as a moisture barrier on the scalp.” If you thought the skin on your face and body were the only areas requiring sun protection, think again. “It is often misunderstood that we can’t get skin cancer on our scalps, but our scalp is made of the same skin as our faces,” said Gretchen Oligee , a Colorado-based trichologist and hair stylist. “I have found on the scalp what turned out to be skin cancer on a number of my clients.” Whether it’s actual sunscreen or a hat, UV protection is important for scalp health. Especially if you’re one to extend time between washes, a clarifying shampoo can help aid in scalp health. “Clarifying shampoos not only help remove buildup on the hair, but they help remove oils, residual product and debris from the scalp, which can clog hair follicles and possibly lead to hair loss,” said Oligee. “I recommend [double-shampooing] with a clarifier and following up with either a hair mask or a good moisturizing conditioner.” Chelcey Salinger , Australian-based trichologist of Australian Trichology Centre, said she’d never go longer than three days between hair washes, as extending the period of time between shampooing increases your risk of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. “This is because the particular yeast involved in these conditions is sebum-dependent, and not washing your hair gives a greater opportunity for an overgrowth of this ‘bad’ yeast,” she said. This is especially true for men, as they’re more prone to oilier scalps and scalp conditions like dandruff, Kingsely said. “Fiber is key to maintaining a healthy gut microbiome, which is directly related to the scalp microbiome,” Salinger said. “When there is dysbiosis and an imbalanced scalp microbiome, that’s when yeast and bacterial infection are most likely to occur in the scalp.” Ensure your diet is full of fiber-rich fruits and vegetables like pear, apple, blackberry, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and leafy greens. Potential Hydrogen (pH) plays a crucial role in maintaining scalp health. “When the pH balance is off, meaning surface products are too alkaline or too acidic, we can experience a wide array of scalp issues like irritation, dryness and inflammation,” said Washington-based trichologist Jess Poynter . “Knowing and using the products that optimize pH ensures the scalp remains in its highest-functioning state.” Poynter notes that the optimal pH for hair, skin and nails is between 4.5 and 5.5. Although there’s no way to test the pH of your scalp, pH strips are available over-the-counter and allow you to test your products at home. Dry shampoo can be a savior for extending the days between washes, but overusing it can have detrimental effects on your scalp. “The buildup of dry shampoo residue can clog hair follicles, leading to inflammation, itching and even hair loss over time,” said Poynter, who recommends using dry shampoo no more than three to four days in a row. To properly use dry shampoo, Poynter says to apply two to three spritzes at the hairline, crown and nape of the neck to address where you’d commonly notice the excess oil. Be sure not to touch your hair with your hands after spraying (to avoid any natural oils on your hands from transferring to your hair) — instead, use a wide tooth comb or a detangling brush to disperse the product.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost If you look at social media, the life of a makeup artist or hair stylist seems glamorous. But have you ever had any insight into how much money they actually make? The beauty industry is filled with freelance creatives who, more often than not, are not paid fairly ― which makes pay transparency more important than ever. We spoke to Mira Parmar , a freelance international makeup artist, hair stylist and content creator based in London who revealed her fees and explained how she makes a living in the industry. In addition to her freelance work, Parmar also creates content for her 23,600 followers on Instagram . She has more than 15 years of experience in the beauty industry, working with talents and publications including Suki Waterhouse, Cara Delevingne, Vogue, Elle and others. The life of a freelance creative has its ups and downs, so income isn’t standard in a year. But Parmar shared that in an average year, she makes upward of $95,600. Here’s how it all adds up. Parmar doesn’t have an agent, so she has to set and negotiate all her fees by herself. The rates listed below refer to her work as a makeup artist, but because she’s also trained in styling hair, she offers her clients the option to add that to booked jobs. This is negotiated beforehand, and on average she adds $440 to the rate. Parmar always charges a full day’s rate, even if the job lasts for a couple of hours. She does this because she won’t be able to book another client for the rest of the day, so she will essentially end up losing money if she agrees on a half-day rate, she explained. This fee is a day rate, which is either 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Parmar will work on one or two models. “Sometimes editorial rates are lower or for free, which I think should be banned!” she said. “I like that some agencies are saying their artists will not be working for free from now on.” Parmar explained that for the red carpets, the fee changes depending on which celebrity, actor or talent she is working with and for what brand. This is a set rate, and it’s usually a “glam and go,” she said. This means that after the makeup is done (which normally takes about 1 1/2 hours), she leaves. If there is an after-party following an awards ceremony, Parmar stays around to do the touch-ups, and she negotiates the rate beforehand. This fee is makeup for one person (the bride), and it varies. For example, if Parmar has to do a bridesmaid’s makeup as well, she will charge around $380 extra. If there are more bridesmaids needing to get their makeup done, Parmar will bring an assistant who is paid their own rate. Parmar usually leaves after the makeup is done, but if the wedding is within London, she might stay around for touch-ups. For destination weddings, Parmar charges the above plus accommodation and expenses for all travel days. This is a day rate (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.) for teaching makeup application. Parmar works with a makeup school in London and often goes in to teach a small class of people. She explained that it’s a bit like a makeup master class, where she talks about products, the beauty industry, and how to get started as a makeup artist. She also does how-tos on specific techniques, like skin correcting or a trend-led technique like Pat McGrath’s base. Brand campaigns include their lookbooks — everything you see on a website has usually been done in a studio with a full team. Here, Parmar charges a day rate, and she usually does makeup for one or two models. Sometimes the rate can include very minimal hair styling. Generally two makeup artists work on the campaign. Advertising here is usually what brands will put on billboards. For TV ads, the fee is higher since they take longer to film, more touch-ups are needed, and makeup needs differ between filming and still photography. This is a day rate, and it’s usually from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. in a studio, working on one or two models. In terms of her content creation, she has set rates but negotiates a bit. She is specific in which brands she works with, and ensures they’re always brands that she loves. “The prices vary depending on whether the brand is a startup or a big business,” she added. Reels: From $1,070. Stories: From $315. Grid post: From $370. Since she started in 2008, the industry has changed a lot, Parmar said, with decreasing budgets and the implementation of artificial intelligence, both of which affect the jobs that a freelance creative books. The COVID-19 pandemic was a huge blow to the work of freelance makeup artists, Parmar explained, as brands chose artists willing to work for free or for the “exposure,” which is often used to justify unpaid work. “During and post-COVID-19, brands started using influencers to sell their products rather than booking makeup artists for campaigns, as it was better for them in terms of budgets, overheads, studio costs, lunches, studio equipment,” Parmar said. Brands were focused on sales and their social media reach, which made Parmar feels like they didn’t even care if the influencers they hired for a campaign even liked their product. Compared with years ago, most brands can no longer afford international photoshoots and are trying to achieve the same results with a lower budget. “Makeup artists are being asked to work for free when this job is a skill and should be paid. We all have to stick together in the industry, but sadly there will always be someone who will do the job for free, or for a low rate,” Parmar said. “I’d like people to change the way they perceive creatives. We have to pay our bills and mortgages and keep ourselves afloat just like everyone else. Just because we are not in an office 9-6 doesn’t mean we are not working,” Parmar told HuffPost.

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost It’s always a safe bet to look to the past for style inspiration: You can’t go wrong if you’re borrowing Brigitte Bardot’s patented cigarette pants and cat eye look or channeling Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy’s sleek white blouses and minimal color palette. Still, it doesn’t hurt to draw inspiration from younger generations from time to time. Sure, some of their street-style trends may give you bad Y2K flashbacks, but Gen Z is fast emerging as a high-style fashion force to be reckoned with, said Elizabeth Kosich , an image consultant and founder of Elizabeth Kosich Styling. “Think Hailey Bieber’s statement-making minimalism, Gigi Hadid’s freewheeling freestyle looks and fashion darlings Molly and Reese Blutstein’s signature DIY creations, which ooze with homespun charm,” she said. “Gen Z-ers might just be onto something.” And they’re onto something that could easily work for older gens, too. (Yes, you as well, millennials. Stop clinging so hard to those skinny jeans.) Below, stylists like Kosich share 11 trends beloved by Gen Z that older generations should consider adopting. Skinny jeans are out and have been for some time,” said Chelsea Volpe , a fashion stylist and consultant. “Gen Z has embraced loose-fitting and flare pants, which can be made modern for the mature buyer,” she said. Reformation, AGolde and Aritzia are all brands Volpe turns to for this trend. “My favorite pairs include Reformation’s Val ’90s mid-rise straight jeans in the Colorado colorway, A Golde’s dame high-rise wide leg in fortune cookie , and Aritzia’s Babaton satin high-waisted wide-leg pants in limited edition Saville.” There’s nothing wrong with a little athleisure ― especially when it’s deceptively presentable . The tennis-core/pickleball-core trend is that but with more tennis skirts, vests and low-top sneakers. “The great thing is, you can look like you’re just out of the country club and also give off a cool-girl vibe without the tennis lesson price tag,” said Kendra Sharpe , a commercial and personal stylist based in Raleigh, North Carolina. Try a pleated tennis skirt with a cable knit sweater and some Superega sneakers to create the perfect tennis core look, Sharpe advised. Equal parts timeless and trendy, platform loafers are dominating the under-30 street style scene. “Comfy, chic and classic, what’s not to love?” Kosich said. To adopt this trend, avoid super-sized platforms and opt for an appropriate lift at an appropriate scale instead. “Also make sure the hardware is not an exaggerated size, color or finish to ensure the look skews more timeless than trendy,” the stylist said. A recent Pew study shows that 76% of Gen Z-ers are worried about climate change, with 37% saying it’s their biggest concern of all. “I think perhaps they’re the generation that’s most acutely aware of the impacts of pollution, overconsumption and overproduction ― something the fashion industry plays a huge role in ― because they’re the generation that’s going to have to actually live through many of the problems caused by climate change,” said Sophie Strauss , a personal stylist based in Los Angeles. They’re into thrifting because shopping second-hand lowers carbon emissions, water usage, physical waste and more ― all things that genuinely matter to young people, even when they’re trying to look cute, Strauss said. Plus, it’s a lot cheaper. “Young people generally don’t have a ton of disposable income, so thrifting is a way to participate in fashion ethically without spending a ton of money,” Strauss said. “Shopping second-hand also allows you to develop personal style instead of chasing trends and helps you discover brands and designers you might not have known about otherwise.” When it comes to personal style, Gen Z is going to dress based on how they feel in the moment, regardless of gender expectations, said Beverly Osemwenkhae , a personal stylist based in New York City and London. For women, the gender-fluid trend is a blend of sportswear with an unfinished look, she said. “Shopping in the men’s department has never been sexier! Trousers and denim sit at the hip, white shirts are left unbuttoned, sweatshirts that are perfectly over-sized and everything is styled with a sneaker,” she explained. “This trend focuses on comfort and versatility, which is a shift in fashion that’s here to stay!” Gone are the days of having to match all your jewelry and hardware to either gold or silver. “While silver and metallics have been on the rise for the last few years, mixing both together in your jewelry stack or adding gold jewelry to a silver coated denim outfit is sure to get you some style points,” said Ashlyn Greer, the founder of Fashivly , an online personal styling service. Gen Z-ers are growing up in a much less formal society, Strauss thinks, especially in the post-pandemic world where a lot of offices went a lot more casual as they switched to hybrid/work-from-home models. “That means there are fewer stringent dress codes to stick to and a little more room for experimentation,” she said. That means unexpected combinations of clothes from across different categories of dress. “Big chunky dad shoes with a hyper-girlish dress and an oversized work jacket. Baggy jeans with a sexy halter top and pointy heels. Track pants with a leather bomber and a crop top,” Strauss said. “There’s a real ‘why not?! there are no rules!’ attitude to this approach that’s liberating and fun.” The classic slip dress has become a fan favorite with burgeoning fashionistas, thanks to its versatility. “Striking a stylish high-low balance, Gen Z-ers layer the slip dress with T-shirts,” Kosich said. “For anyone who thinks she’s matured beyond a skimpy slip dress, think again. Consider pairing it with a long-sleeved bodysuit, oversized boyfriend blazer and chunky Chelsea boots for a chic, age-appropriate adaptation of the same look.” Whether they’re wearing them in their hair or as an appliqué for their outfits, Gen Z loves a good oversized bows ― or as Volpe likes to call them, “baddie bows.” “Mega bows are super chic, super Jackie O, super lady !” she said. “They give prep-school posh and I’m living for them.” Volpe’s favorites include Gigi Burris’ Indre dusty rose bow and Urban Outfitters’ statement long lace hair bow barrette in light blue and this one in pink. Greer said one of the tell-tell signs of being of a certain age these days is no-show socks. “I tell clients to have fun with lots of ankle, crew or quarter crew socks in colors, patterns, and textures and pair them with everything from sneakers and jeans to a pair of ballet flats or Mary Janes and a skirt,” she said. Or swap out your workout socks for a quarter crew pair worn over leggings. “It’s a great way to add something more trend-forward to any outfit at a low cost,” she said. The ultimate in off-duty quiet luxury, the matched loungewear set is back on-trend. “Who doesn’t love a fancy sweatsuit? Gen Z’s minimalist interpretation embraces rich neutrals like camel, cozy fabrics like velour and comfy details like wide legs and hoodies,” Kosich said. “This trend is doable at any age, though the older you get the darker the neutral should be.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Everything has gotten more expensive , and our money just doesn’t go as far as it used to . This means many of us are inclined to cut back and curtail our monthly expenditures — and an easy luxury for many of us to cut back on is dry cleaning. Do you really need to take your clothes to a professional? Couldn’t you effectively (and much more economically) clean your garments at home? The answer is yes, maybe, but with a few caveats, and as long as you don’t submit your favorite silk dress or that fancy pair of pants you bought for more than half its retail price at Century 21 or Saks Off Fifth to some of the most common — and destructive — faux pas that people make when attempting to clean their own clothes. We talked to two dry cleaners about the mistakes they would never make with their beloved laundry and what they really wish the rest of us would stop doing. You know when you’re out to dinner or lunch, and you spill olive oil or some kind of red sauce on your clothes, and you ask the waiter for some tonic water? And as you rub it into the spot and it disappears, you think, ‘Oh cool, I just got that out.’” Before you do that, make sure it’s not actually tonic water, says Michael Jackson , franchise consultant at CD One Price Cleaners, a dry cleaning chain in the Midwest. “What people fail to realize,” he said, “is that [tonic water] is full of sugar, so it oxidizes. ” When you clean with tonic water, it pulls color from the fabric because of oxidation. Then, when you take the garment to the dry cleaner, the machine removes the color from the oxidized sugar, making the stain reappear — even though it was never actually gone. “What happened is that sugar oxidized over the stain. That’s why it disappeared,” Jackson explained. “One universal rule is to never rub at a fresh stain,” said Matt Connelly of I Hate Ironing, an on-demand laundry and dry cleaning service in New York City. This includes all modes of rubbing, whether with a cloth, sponge or your hands. You’ll most likely end up spreading the stain further into the fabric fibers, making it harder to remove. Another thing to avoid, according to Connelly, is hot water, which can set some stains into the fabric, rendering them next to impossible to get rid of down the line. Instead, blot the stain with a cloth that’s damp with cold water. If you’re using a washing machine, spray your stain remover onto the stain, and then wash it in cold water. Do not throw it into the dryer unless it emerges from your washer stain-free. If the stain is still there after washing, repeat the process (again, avoid hot water or heat of any kind) or take it to a professional. Number two on Jackson’s list is that many people don’t clean their clothes often enough. “They think they’re saving money,” said Jackson, “but body oils and dirt (a lot of which might be invisible to the eye) gets in between the fibers.” This causes wear and tear, so your clothes wear out much faster. Button-front shirts often suffer from this, especially in the collar and cuff areas, which will become discolored over time from sweat and general dirt, often to the point where it’s difficult to remove the soil. Jackson recommends cleaning any article of clothing that touches the skin after each wear; this goes for underwear and most shirts. Clean garments like pants or sweaters after a couple of wears. Jeans are the exception and should be washed after every six to 10 wears. If you use more than the recommended amount of laundry detergent, the released dirt and oils just swirl around in the soapy water in your machine and then land back onto the very clothes you’re attempting to clean, Jackson told me. You can listen to more details in a brilliant episode of HuffPost’s podcast, “Am I Doing It Wrong? ” “I think you only need about two tablespoons of detergent [for a load], so a bottle of laundry detergent might last you a year because you only need a couple of tablespoons for your clothes to come out clean,” said Patric Richardson, aka The Laundry Evangelist. Most people typically do not read care labels. “A lot of things can go wrong during the cleaning process,” said Connelly, “ if you don’t follow care labels.” Washing or drying something at too high a temperature can cause it to shrink beyond repair, especially if it’s made from cotton, wool or silk. Mixing colors during your wash can also result in dye transfer, where color seeps from certain garments onto others, and you end up with pink or gray socks instead of white ones (this is one most of us are likely quite familiar with). “Most laundry accidents that come through our doors can be completely avoided by following the right cleaning instructions,” Connelly said. If you’ve removed the cleaning tag and are not sure how to wash it, you can usually still find instructions on the manufacturer’s website. “Nobody reads cleaning labels,” Jackson said. “They throw whatever it is in the washer and the dryer, and then all of a sudden, it doesn’t fit anymore, and they’re unhappy.” Jackson says he would never use a lint roller (the kind with the masking tape type substance on it) on a wool suit. This is because they leave a bit of residue behind, which, he says, can lead to discoloration. Instead, use a lint brush . Lint brushes have a velvet-type surface that attracts and picks up dust, lint and fur. Suede and leather are difficult materials to clean, and Connelly says some companies lack the required tools and expertise for the task. They’re extremely porous and absorbent, which means spills and other foreign substances soak in easily, and lengthy exposure to water (or heat) can cause damage like cracking, shriveling or shrinking. It will bake in! “The most difficult stain to treat is one the customer has messed with,” Jackson said. This includes washing a garment and then tossing it into the dryer without seeing if the washing removed the soiled spot. If you still see the stain after a spin in the washing machine, do not put that article of clothing into the dryer! The heat will just bake the stain into the fibers. Don’t wait to take your clothes to the dry cleaner, either. If something sits in your clothes or hamper for two weeks, whatever substance you dropped on it (pesto sauce, red wine, butter, mustard, whatever) will have all that time to embed itself into the fibers, making it more difficult for your dry cleaner to extract. “It’s best to act fast when you have a stain,” Connelly said. “When in doubt, always take it to a professional to fix it.” Despite all the horrific things Jackson has seen people do to their clothes and all the mistakes he and his colleagues have fixed as a result of these things, he loves working in the industry. He explained that the most rewarding part of the industry is that they take something dirty, stained and/or spotted and that often looks as if it would be beyond salvaging, process it, clean it, press it and then present it back to the customer. “And it looks good, right? And that makes everybody feel good. Makes us feel good, and it makes the consumer feel good,” he said. Our advice? Find a dry cleaner like Jackson, and the next time you spill an entire glass of red wine on your lavender silk dress, get it to that cleaner as quickly as possible. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article erroneously indicated that club soda has sugar in it. Club soda is sugar-free; tonic water has sugar.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost You probably thought your days of getting pimples were behind you once you reached adulthood, but acne is incredibly common for adults, and some of your skin care habits could be causing it or making it worse. Acne is the most common skin condition in the U.S., according to the American Academy of Dermatology . While about 85% of teens get at least minor acne, it can happen at any age. “Acne is surprisingly common in adult women,” said Neil Farnsworth , a board-certified dermatologist with Westlake Dermatology in Houston, Texas. About half of women in their 20s are affected by acne, and the number goes up to 35% for women in their 30s. It’s also prevalent for women during menopause. There are several reasons you might see more breakouts as an adult. While many factors are outside of your control, you might be inadvertently making your blackheads, whiteheads and pimples worse by how you’re caring for your skin. Dermatologists explain what you should and shouldn’t do for your skin if you have acne. Acne occurs when your pores become clogged with dirt, oil and dead skin cells, which can cause whiteheads, blackheads and other kinds of pimples, according to the Cleveland Clinic . As adults, acne breakouts are often triggered by fluctuating hormone levels, according to the AAD . Women tend to see their hormones shift around their periods, after taking (or stopping taking) birth control pills and during pregnancy, peri-menopause or menopause. Stress, a family history of acne, certain medications and some skin and hair products can also cause acne. If you’re dealing with acne and can’t seem to get rid of it, dermatologists say your skin care routine could be to blame. Here are some habits to break: One of the most common acne contributors is using skin care products that are “too heavy and rich,” said David Kim , a board-certified dermatologist at Idriss Dermatology in New York City. Hair care, skin care, and makeup products with a “high comedogenic index,” meaning they’ll likely clog your pores, can cause or worsen acne, Farnsworth said. This includes items containing ingredients, like shea butter, cocoa butter, petrolatum or mineral oil, which can clog pores. Choosing oil-free products or ones labeled as “non-comedogenic” will minimize breakouts, Farnsworth said. Getting excessively sweaty can cause oil, dirt and bacteria to build up on your skin, and that might trigger acne. Farnsworth said showering after a sweaty workout can minimize the effect. It may be tempting to scrub your skin when you have acne, but Kim said it can actually cause more irritation. “Scrubs are harsh on the skin, and no one really needs a facial scrub because gentle facial cleansers are sufficient,” he adds. If you do want to use a scrub, he recommends a mild one, such as Tatcha’s The Rice Polish , but only use it about once a week. Sleeping in your makeup or wearing it during a sweaty workout can trigger an acne breakout, as cosmetics can clog your pores, according to the AAD . Be sure to wash your face before going to sleep or use oil-free makeup remover wipes to lower your risk for breakouts. Browsing Sephora or following advice from skin care TikTokkers might inspire you to stock up on lots of different products. But layering on these items can break out your skin, Kim said. “People have more disposable income in their 30s and 40s and tend to buy more skin care products they’ve seen in ads,” he said. “As a result, their skin can get irritated from using too many different types of products.” A basic skin care routine only needs three items: a gentle cleanser, a noncomedogenic moisturizer and sunscreen. It’s tempting to try the latest trendy skin care items, but switching things up too often also might irritate your skin. Kim said it could take a couple of months for your skin to respond to products, especially if you’re using acne treatments. Even when you start an acne-fighting skin care routine, you might see a breakout, but it should resolve in a week or two, Farnsworth said. “Clogs are freed, and the materials trapped beneath are finally extruded from the skin.” You can usually treat mild acne at home using over-the-counter products. Here’s how: If you’ve tried acne products at home for about two months with no improvement, see a dermatologist, especially if you notice scarring. Depending on what’s causing your acne, Farnsworth said doctors could prescribe oral or topical antibiotics, oral or topical retinoids, or hormone-effect modifying agents to help control acne. Laser treatments to reduce redness and scarring are also available, Kim said. “There is a lot we can do that you can’t achieve with at-home devices or skincare products alone.” Dermatologists can also guide you on a proper skin care routine to prevent acne, Kim said. “Acne is not all about treatment, but actually all about prevention. You want to get ahead of it so you can treat and prevent acne.” Looking for some acne-clearing products? Check out these top picks below.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost There are new products on the market that are once again aimed at women’s bodies. They’re “vulva balms” with names like VMagic , Revive-A Balm and Comfy Cream , and they’re popping up in the health and beauty space with increasing regularity. But even with the fun packaging and empowering marketing messages, are products to moisturize the vulva really necessary? We talked to several doctors, who fell into two clear camps: “Never, ever, ever” and “Sometimes, maybe, but be careful.” “Honestly, I worry that vulva balms and similar products are predatory,” said obstetrician and gynecologist (OB-GYN) Dr. Kristyn Brandi . “They’re trying to target people who may be insecure about the appearance or smell of the vulva. Most vulvas are totally normal, but women are getting so many messages that their bodies are gross and they need to alter them to meet a beauty standard. When it comes to the vulva and vagina, a lot of those beauty products and techniques leave people with problems they didn’t have before.” “I think it’s important for people to know that there is a huge range of ‘healthy’ in terms of vulvar appearance,” said OB-GYN Dr. Amie Leaverton . “You don’t need to use fragrance to make vulvas smell a certain way. In fact, products with fragrance will likely cause burning, itching and discomfort from vulvar dermatitis.” Leaverton’s concern is shared by many of her colleagues. “I wouldn’t recommend using any vulva balm product at all,” said Dr. David Matlock , a cosmetic surgeon and gynecologist. “Using them could result in infections and allergic reactions. And they could potentially mask more serious gynecologic conditions.” Doctors struck an overall cautious tone about interfering with the function of this particular body part. “The vulva is a very sensitive organ with a thin dermis and dense innervation,” said OB-GYN Dr. Tarek Khalife of the Mayo Clinic Health System. “It’s one of the most anatomically and physiologically intricate body parts, which makes irritation and allergic reactions to foreign topical substances significantly uncomfortable.” While noting that the necessity of a vulva balm or moisturizer can depend on individual needs and circumstances, he added, “Healthy vulvar skin doesn’t need any special treatment or application.” “Most people don’t require products that make the vulva skin softer or more moist, because the body naturally does that on its own,” Brandi said. “These products are not regulated by any organizations, so there is a chance that harsh chemicals can be used. Also, if you’re using these products in or near your vagina, they could potentially alter its pH and break down its natural protection, causing increasing chances of infection.” Brandi spoke up about vulvar balms’ promotion as a relief for irritation after waxing and shaving. “One way to avoid irritation like this is not to use those hair-removal techniques at all,” she said. “OB-GYNs like me recommend clipping hair, not pulling it out through waxing or shaving, which can irritate the sensitive skin of the vulva. If you avoid waxing and using these balms, you’ve solved two problems at once.” Others don’t rule out their use entirely. “While not necessary for everyone, they can be helpful for individuals experiencing dryness, irritation or discomfort in the genital area,” said plastic surgeon Dr. Usha Rajagopal , founder of the The V Suite , which specializes in female rejuvenation. But she added, “Hydrating the vulva isn’t necessary as long as it feels normal. And normal hydration or creams applied to the thigh area can suffice, without the need for additional hydration in the vulvar region.” Dr. Jill Krapf is an OB-GYN and director of the Florida location of the Center for Vulvovaginal Disorders . “Vulvar moisturizers can be helpful for people with vulvar dryness in times when estrogen levels are low, such as perimenopause, menopause, and after childbirth or while breastfeeding.” On her Amazon storefront , she offers a list of vulva balms “that my patients really like,” adding that, “In general, I recommend products with natural ingredients and no known irritants and allergens.” “Some skin conditions or urinary incontinence, which requires the use of sometimes-irritating pads, may be helped by barrier creams on the vulva that may help protect from irritants and provide relief,” Leaverton said. “But my concern is that some products marketed for the vulva can be irritating, making these conditions worse. They also make people feel they need to be doing an elaborate vulvar care routine.” If you really want to use one of these products, shop carefully. Khalife suggested reading labels closely and avoiding products that contain estrogen, fragrance, soy, steroids, synthetic preservatives, dyes, petroleum and/or parabens. “And it’s always a good idea to test a small amount of a new product on a patch of skin to ensure you don’t have an adverse reaction,” he said. “Each person’s genitals are unique, and what works for one person may not work for another.” “If you insist on using something, I recommend plain coconut oil,” Whitney said. “It can go on the vulva and in the vagina, so it works great as a lubricant during sex.” Leaverton suggested petroleum jelly, which “is a great barrier ointment that doesn’t have any potential allergens or irritants.” “I’ve seen vulvar products that are way too harsh, including things like sugar scrubs,” said dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon Dr. Kristina Collins . “Not only would something like a sugar scrub worsen vulvar micro tears in the skin, but sugar would seriously offset the microbiome.” “Vulva itchiness or dryness could be signs of a skin condition,” Brandi said. “Diseases like lichen sclerosis can present as itchiness or dryness that develop rashes. Conditions like vitiligo or other skin changes can happen on the vulva. Other skin disorders like psoriasis can present on the vulva, too. It’s important to get evaluated to figure out what’s going on instead of buying something on the internet and hoping your condition gets better from a product that isn’t backed up by science.” “A common condition I treat is self-inflicted irritant and contact dermatitis among women who are using over-the-counter products that they don’t need,” said OB-GYN Dr. Margaret Whitney , a menopause and vulvar specialist. “Many of these women have been treated repeatedly for things like bacterial vaginosis, or yeast infections. Frequently, they aren’t getting better because no one has considered it could be because of a product they’re using.” “Most products that market themselves as being designed for female genitals are preying on patriarchal ideals that many women have internalized,” she continued. “If you’re having bothersome vulvar symptoms, find a vulvar specialist. A good place to start is the Health Care Provider List of The National Vulvodynia Association .” Also, if you’re already using these products, it’s a good idea to mention that to your health care professional. “Anyone using a vulva balm should check with their doctor to assure safety during pregnancy, if they are planning a pregnancy, or safety with contraception if they want to prevent pregnancy,” Collins said. “ Not all vulva balms are a good choice for lube, because some could interfere with condom efficacy.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Hair care is inching toward becoming as popular as skin care . With talk about the “ skinification ” of hair, brands are coming out with products to aid the health and growth of hair , from scalp scrubs to brushes that claim to stimulate growth. With all of these products out on the market, are we neglecting the one thing we can do at home virtually for free ― brushing our hair? You may remember the episode of “The Brady Bunch” where Marcia suggested that 100 brush strokes per night kept her hair looking beautiful. But is there any truth to this? According to the American Academy of Dermatology , that level of dedication may not be necessary. But we spoke with two experts — a trichologist and a dermatologist — who have some good guidelines to follow. There are many positives when it comes to hair-brushing, apart from just removing tangles. “Brushing your hair gently can stimulate blood circulation beneath the scalp and increase oxygen and nutrient intake of the follicle,” explained trichologist Shab Caspara . Brushing also helps distribute natural oils to the follicles, said Dr. Jody Levine , a board-certified dermatologist based in New York. Essentially, Caspara explained, the increased blood circulation and stimulation of the scalp encourage hair growth with a boost of nutrients and oxygen. “Brushing the scalp can also help exfoliate and dislodge any hair growth hindering buildup,” she added. Levine agreed. “Brushing, when done correctly, can support hair health by increasing blood flow and oil to the scalp, and prevent hair loss ,” she said. Excessive hair-brushing can cause breakage, thinning and even hair loss, Levine said. A 2009 study concluded that hair loss in women was reduced when they brushed their hair less. You have to pay attention to your technique, explained Caspara. “Brushing hair incorrectly, like starting at the top and brushing down, can create more tangling, compared to brushing from the ends and working your way up,” she said. When the hair is wet, it’s very fragile and more susceptible to breakage. “The hydrogen bonds of hair is temporarily broken [when wet], leaving the hair vulnerable to damage,” Caspara explained. You should also avoid using a brush with sharp bristles if you have a sensitive or sore scalp, Caspara told HuffPost. Do all types of hair require brushing? “Yes — however, it is important to consider the type of hair and adjust the brushing technique accordingly to prevent further damage,” Levine said. How often people brush their hair can depend not only on their hair type but also certain skin conditions, Levine said. “If you have eczema or dermatitis, brushing gently once or twice a day with a soft brush can be beneficial, but avoid any inflamed areas or open wounds,” said Levine. “Brushing regularly can distribute oils throughout your hair, lessening flaky dandruff,” Levine said. “However, you shouldn’t brush harshly or excessively, as that can lead to more dandruff and inflammation.” Gently brush (with a wide-tooth comb) when the hair is damp or before hair-washing to avoid distribution of a curl pattern. “ Using a wide-tooth comb can also help maintain the texture of your hair, maintain curl definition and prevent breakage,” Levine explained. “Those looking to wear their hair natural and enhance their texture should avoid dense brushes and tension while brushing hair to prevent disrupting their curl pattern and creating frizz,” Caspara said. However, if you are looking to smooth the hair while blow-drying, you can use a dense brush with natural bristles, Caspara noted. “ You shouldn’t brush braided hair, as that can lead to damage,” Levine said. “But you can gently brush the ends if they are not braided, to avoid knots.” Those with frizzy hair can also benefit from the use of a wide-tooth comb or an anti-frizz brush to prevent breakage, said Levine. Brushing oily hair too much can overstimulate sebum production. Levine said that brushing once or twice a day is fine. “Straight hair tends to be prone to knotting quicker than other hair types, so it should be brushed more often,” Levine advised. “However, you should still brush it gently to avoid breakage.” For those with a shorter hairstyle or no hair, “occasional brushing and massaging of the scalp is beneficial, especially for blood flow,” Levine said. “While there are variations based on individual hair and scalp needs, it is generally recommended that individuals stimulate their scalp at least a few times a week with a brush that has soft bristles or even with their fingers, massaging gently,” Levine added. For optimal hair health, brushing the scalp is overall more essential than brushing the hair. Depending on how tangled your hair gets, you can adjust your brushing. In any case, if you are experiencing excessive hair loss, you should speak to an expert for guidance on the best treatment.

    "article_content": "QUITO, Ecuador (AP) — A failure in an energy transmission line on Wednesday produced an unexpected blackout throughout Ecuador, the government said, days after announcing that there would be power outages in the country due to production problems. Ecuador’s Minister of Energy Roberto Luque said in a message posted on X, formerly Twitter, that the failure was reported by the country’s National Electricity Operator and caused “a cascade disconnection,” leaving the nation without energy service. He added that efforts are being made to solve the problem and repair faulty power lines as soon as possible. In some sectors of the country the outage lasted 20 minutes, but media outlets and social media users reported that the problem continued in most cities. Emilia Cevallos, a waitress in a restaurant north of the capital, Quito, said the blackout was surprising. “We thought it was only in this sector, but when we left we realized that while some stores had connected generators, the majority did not have electricity,” she said. “The traffic lights were not working either.” The Quito municipality said on X that traffic agents were mobilized to coordinate the flow of traffic. Quito Metro, the company that operates the city’s subway system, said service was suspended as a result of the electrical failure. Since last year, Ecuador has faced an electricity generation crisis that has led to rationing throughout the country. In April, the government of President Daniel Noboa began to ration electricity in the country’s main cities as a drought linked to the El Niño weather pattern depleted reservoirs and limited output at hydroelectric plants that produce about 75% of the nation’s power. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost It’s no secret feeling drained has become the status quo, one that leaves us overexerting ourselves just to get through the necessities of the day. This leads us to lean on any energy booster we can think of to help us make it through. However, we also should suss out the energy sappers lurking in our daily habits. Think of your energy as water in a cup that has a hole in the bottom. There are two ways to ensure the cup always contains enough water: pour more water into it or make the hole smaller. “Finding ways to boost your energy is analogous to filling the cup and focusing on ways to make tasks less draining to making the hole smaller,” Tyson Lippe, a psychiatrist at Heading Health in Austin, Texas, told HuffPost. “Both are equally important, yet we often underestimate what can drain our stamina.” So continue doing what’s necessary to boost your energy (eating healthier, exercising, getting enough sleep, setting boundaries) — and make sure that process includes finding and quashing the sneaky energy saboteurs on your plate. To get you started, here are 12 easily overlooked things that can drain your energy (and how to turn things around): One of the ways binge-watching emotionally charged TV shows can lead to mental exhaustion is through trait identification, which refers to the process of temporarily imagining yourself experiencing the same feelings and events of a specific character. “The experience allows individuals to perceive the world differently and acquire and gain access to various emotional capacities they were formerly unable to experience,” said Leela R. Magavi , a psychiatrist and regional medical director for Community Psychiatry and MindPath Care Centers in California. In excess, however, sustained high-intensity emotions can result in a state of heightened arousal and overstimulation. “It then takes additional mental effort to dampen these signals with emotional regulation strategies,” Lippe said. This is the case for both positive and negative emotions, he added, as they activate similar pathways in the brain, ultimately leading to mental fatigue, difficulty focusing and poor energy levels. The fix: Be mindful about the entertainment you consume. Take note of how it makes you feel and impacts you throughout the following hours and days. “You may find that some themes are particularly triggering and best avoided,” Lippe said. Other strategies might include setting a weekly time limit for emotionally charged viewing, consuming neutrally toned shows to balance the scales or restricting intense TV shows to days off, in order to control the cumulative emotional load sustained on any given day. The body scores energy from the foods we eat, and relies on a steady supply of it. “Each macronutrient — protein, carbs and fat — provides energy, but carbs are the body’s primary and preferred fuel source,” Caroline Lacey, registered dietitian and owner of Nutrition Rerooted , told HuffPost. Some parts of the body, such as the brain, can only use carbs (in the form of glucose) for energy. “The body can store some carbs in the liver for later use, which acts as an energy reserve for the body to use when blood sugar levels are low, such as between meals,” Lacey said. “But there’s a limit to the amount that can be stored, and eventually, the supply becomes depleted.” This backup energy supply only lasts about three to six hours, so going too long without food sets off biological and psychological mechanisms that turn on our eating drive — usually, this can lead to strong cravings for processed carbs, which are foods with a high-glycemic load. “As we eat more carbs, especially simple ones, our insulin levels climb,” Uma Naidoo , nutritional psychologist and author of “ This Is Your Brain on Food ,” told HuffPost. “Once our insulin levels peak after eating, our blood sugar can subsequently crash and lead to a distinct feeling of being physically drained.” The fix: In general, the recommendation is to go no longer than five waking hours without eating, “but this is highly individualized and dependent on a variety of factors,” Lacey said. “Some people may need to eat more frequently and may benefit from going no longer than three to four hours without eating.” The best way to counter your eating schedule being thrown off is to always have a shelf-stable snack on hand (in your purse, briefcase, gym bag, car, desk or locker) that doesn’t require refrigeration. Think: protein bars, snack-sized bags of trail mix, mixed nuts or squeezable peanut butter packets. “You want something that will hold you over until you can eat your next meal, but not something so large and filling that you’re not hungry at mealtime,” Lacey said. Working in a cluttered environment may increase distractibility and inattentiveness. The result? Tasks take longer to complete, requiring you to use up more mental focus and energy over time. The fix: Maintaining a structured and planned environment, where everything you need is in its place, can help reduce this particular energy drain. “I advise individuals to spend 10-15 minutes each day tidying up their work area while listening to calming music,” Magavi said. “This can create a positive pattern of behavior.” Planning is helpful up to a point. “By scheduling in advance, you ensure you’re allocating time to a task without forgetting or double-booking yourself,” Lippe said. “But if done in excess, it can leave you with too little flexibility and force you to live in the future instead of the present.” Being constantly exposed to a full calendar of obligations can cause an uptick in anticipatory anxiety and adversely affect working memory and processing speed. “This can impede your ability to remain mindful and efficiently complete tasks in the moment,” Magavi said, resulting in poor motivation and mental exhaustion. The fix: Consider planning out the mandatory (work deadlines, meetings and appointments, family-related activities), then leave the remaining pockets of time as commitment-free as possible. “Consistently leaving time open for hobbies, relaxation and nothing at all provides a sense of freedom and control for yourself,” Lippe said. Setting limits with how far in advance certain things are planned out can be helpful too, allowing for more spontaneity and flexibility. Not only are you overwhelming your laptop’s battery by having 25 tabs open, you’re putting your brain into overdrive too. “Bouncing from tab to tab gives your ego the misconception you’re getting an incredible amount of work done,” said Rana Mafee, chief neurologist at Case Integrative Health in Chicago. “In reality, you’re not fully processing anything you’re trying to efficiently consume.” Cue mental fatigue. The fix: Instead of gradually sucking up your mental energy by leaving an ungodly number of tabs open, try asking yourself every hour or so: What do I actually need in front of me right now? What purpose is this tab serving me? “Any tab that doesn’t relate to what you’re working on in the moment can either be bookmarked for when it does or exited to save your brain,” Mafee said. “Phone calls can be exhausting,” Mafee said. “Your nervous system has to not only process a task change at the flip of a switch, but try to process the conversation you’re having without facial cues and body language, forcing your brain to work overtime.” To top it off, once the call is finished, it can take you over 20 minutes to fully regain your focus . The fix: Before hitting that green “accept” button, take a few seconds to check in with yourself and ask: Is this really a good place to stop? Do I legit have the capacity for this particular conversation right now? “A simple habit to implement might be to ask colleagues and loved ones to shoot you a text first to see if you have the capacity for a random call,” Mafee said. “That way you can stop feeling like you have to create availability in an already busy moment.” For those calls you don’t have the bandwidth for in the moment, blocking a set amount of time each day to tackle unexpected phone calls can alleviate the pressure and keep you on task. Thanks to things like time constraints and incessant interruptions, it’s not uncommon to find yourself setting aside half-completed tasks in order to deal with something urgent that’s come up or has to take priority. A small piece of your attention is left with the unfinished task, known as attention residue. “When you experience attention residue, your brain is working overtime by thinking about the task you’re now on, as well as ruminating about the previous task you had to leave unfinished,” Mafee said. The more often this happens, the harder your brain has to work to stay focused, chipping away at your energy reserves in the process. The fix: No day will ever be totally free of interruptions, but there are a few easy tricks that can help. “The easiest one is to modify the notification settings on your computer and phone and then manually check for messages when it’s truly best for you to do so,” Mafee said. Another is to overestimate the time it will take you to finish something — if interruptions do happen during the task, you’ll stand a better chance of getting to finish it anyway before having to move on to the next one. And if you do have to stop work on a task prematurely, you can decrease the amount of attention residue by writing down the specifics of what’s left to finish. “This can help decrease rumination and allow you to clear your mind,” Magavi said. “Poor posture can deplete your energy levels by putting more pressure on your body’s muscles, joints and ligaments,” said Naueen Safdar, medical director at EHE Health . “Your body has to use more energy to compensate, leading to fatigue.” The fix: If maintaining good posture isn’t your forte, using various posture-correcting products — an ergonomic office chair or cushion, a posture-correcting brace or RockTape — can help you get into the habit by offering your body gentle reminders, Safdar said. Adding posture-correcting exercise moves to your workouts that straighten your shoulders and strengthen your core are also paramount to the de-slouching process. Even though breathing is thought of as an unconscious activity, we tend to breathe incorrectly when we have a lot on our mind. “Shallow breathing reduces the amount of oxygen the body takes in and the amount that can be transported in the blood to our organs and cells for optimal function,” Naidoo said. (It can also trigger pathways in the brain that exacerbate anxiety and trigger fatigue, Magavi said.) The fix: Any time you notice yourself feeling particularly tense or stressed, use that as your cue to take several deep breaths to combat shallow breathing. Deliberately penciling in diaphragmatic breathing — say, during work breaks or at the beginning and end of the day — can keep your penchant for shallow breathing in check while balancing out your nervous system and increasing your odds of better energy. Diaphragmatic breathing can be performed by placing one hand on the upper chest and the other right below the rib cage. “Take deep breaths through your nose so your abdomen moves toward your hand and your chest remains still,” Magavi said. “Then exhale through pursed lips as you tighten your stomach muscles and allow them to fall inward.” Texting someone back. Changing a lightbulb. Booking your pet’s wellness visit. The cumulative mental load of unintentionally stockpiling tiny tasks like these can be distracting and mentally draining. “Even manageable duties start to feel overwhelming and suffocating due to their sheer number,” Lippe said. “The constant and unsolicited ‘I should do task X’ thoughts also creates a sense of shame and buildup of anticipatory anxiety.” The fix: Ideally, any task that takes less than five minutes should be done right away, as it’s the most energy-efficient option — but when this isn’t practical, don’t rely on memory. “Immediately write it down on a to-do list,” Lippe said. “This strategy provides peace of mind and reassurance that it will be dealt with eventually.” Allocating 30 to 60 minutes each week to tick off the accumulated small tasks helps compartmentalize the stress — and fatigue — associated with a never-ending to-do list. “It transforms a negative feedback loop of shame into a positive one of accomplishment and productivity, converting a draining experience into an energizing one,” Lippe said. Exposure to bright lights at night signals it’s still daytime to the brain. “This inhibits the brain’s release of melatonin, a sleep-promoting hormone,” Lippe said. “This can disturb the sleep-wake cycle and lead to insomnia, poor sleep quality and fatigue.” The fix: As the sun sets, use the opportunity to do your circadian rhythm a solid and dim your lights or turn them off — or consider investing in smart bulbs that automatically dim your home at specified times. “Research shows exposure to red light , rather than blue light, has less of a negative impact on our sleep-wake cycle,” Lippe said. “It’s worth configuring your devices to automatically shift into night mode, which uses warmer colors to emulate the benefits of red light.” Using another person’s advice can help provide a framework to build on, but if you don’t personalize recommendations, you run the risk of falling short of your goals. “This wastes time as well as energy, and can cause energy-sapping emotions such as frustration, disappointment and resentment,” Lippe said. The fix: When you’re given or are researching advice, it’s important to critically appraise it. “Consider how applicable it is to your specific context and what may differ,” Lippe said. For example, the advice that it’s not good for your health to work in bed doesn’t take into account that for people with a chronic illness, chronic pain or severe anxiety, working in bed is often a necessity — and forcing yourself to take this advice as is can drain your energy even faster than customizing (or discarding) it to suit your situation. “If you want similar results as somebody else, always remember that how you get there can be different,” Lippe said. “Prior to taking any guidance, define your starting point and where you want to be.” Once you decide to move forward, experiment with how you apply the advice and adjust course as you go along. “Regularly evaluating the outcome mid-process is important,” Lippe said, as is recording your results. “It’s easier to adjust based on a written account, rather than relying on memory alone.” This story was previously published on an earlier date.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost The wellness world has always been rife with questionable-sounding trends, and the rise of TikTok has only added fuel to the fire. The latest wellness trend everyone’s talking about on the social media platform is okra water, which promises smoother and clearer skin , a more efficient digestive system , better lubrication , a more balanced vaginal pH, and the ability to nourish the body with vitamins and minerals that it can be difficult to get enough of. But how legit is okra water, anyway? Does this slimy liquid really have health benefits, or is it just the latest “here today, gone tomorrow” wellness trend? We asked registered dietitians — here’s what they had to say. First, what is okra water, and how do you make it? “Okra water is water you drink after soaking okra for 24 hours,” explained Amy Goldsmith , a registered dietitian at Kindred Nutrition. “To make okra water, you cut five to six pieces of okra into smaller pieces and add them to an airtight container, like a Mason jar, with 16 ounces of water.” After letting it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours, you can strain it and drink it. Sophie Lauver , a registered dietitian at Aeroflow Diabetes, added that while Goldsmith’s recipe is a great blueprint, okra water is very new, and there’s not necessarily an “official” recipe. “The goal is for it to take on a thicker, gel-like texture due to okra’s mucilage,” she said. Like most trendy wellness waters, proponents of okra water claim it can do everything from balancing vaginal pH to curing acne. It’s hard for registered dietitians to say what the exact benefits of okra water are because it hasn’t been around long, but Lauver said the only evidence we really have about okra water’s benefits has to do with the health benefits of okra as a vegetable. “We do know that okra is a very nutritious vegetable and is rich in soluble fiber, which can help improve blood glucose and reduce cholesterol,” Lauer said. “Its insoluble fiber helps keep things moving through our digestive tracts, reducing the risk of colon cancer, constipation and other gastrointestinal problems.” Lauver added that some studies have shown that the consumption of okra or okra capsules can improve blood sugar control and that it’s a superfood when it comes to the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants namely, vitamin K, C, magnesium, calcium and B vitamins. “There’s also substantial evidence to show adequate hydration and a high intake of fiber-rich vegetables reduces the risk for chronic disease, so consuming more vegetables is only beneficial for overall health,” Lauver said. With that in mind, Goldsmith pointed out that it’s unlikely you’re getting many of the benefits of okra from okra water since you’re not actually ingesting the vegetable. “A lot of the nutrient properties reside in the skin and cells of the vegetable,” she explained. “However, since you are drinking the water it does have a positive effect on your daily hydration goals.” As for the claim that okra water can balance vaginal pH and make you more lubricated down there, Goldsmith and Lauver don’t see a lot of evidence to support that. While okra water is unlikely to have tons of health benefits, it probably won’t hurt you either — unless you’re allergic to okra, that is. And if you’re using it as a type of “cleanse,” that can cause problems as well. “It’s important to note that this drink provides very few calories,” Goldsmith said. “If you’re drinking okra water as a meal replacement or in an attempt to reduce calories you will put yourself at risk of not getting enough fuel in a day, which will negatively affect your mood, cognition, focus, sleep and more.” Another risk, according to Lauver, can come from adding sweeteners to your okra water in an effort to make it more palatable. “The added sugars and calories could have an unintended effect, especially with implications for weight management and glucose control,” she said. “And as with any dietary changes, contact your doctor and a registered dietitian to see whether this choice is right for you.” If you’re thinking about adding okra water to your regimen, both Lauver and Goldsmith will be the first to tell you that in general, it’s probably a safe choice. But if you expect it to transform your life and health, you’re probably better off holding out until more research emerges before spending hours chopping, soaking and straining okra. In the meantime, go ahead and roast it or throw it into a stir fry —you’ll probably end up reaping more health benefits that way.

    "article_content": "Crime fellow A Florida man is accused of fatally shooting his friend on Saturday after the two got into an argument over a pool pump, Osceola County Sheriff Marcos Lopez said Monday at a news conference . Joseph Beck, 29, was inside his parked car in the driveway of a home in St. Cloud, in central Florida, when a man whom authorities identified as 28-year-old Joshua Miller walked up and repeatedly yelled, “Where’s my pool pump?” Lopez said, citing video of the interaction that was captured by a surveillance camera. Miller’s mother gave deputies the surveillance footage and identified her son as the suspect, according to an arrest warrant obtained by HuffPost. The gunman is seen in the video kicking the driver’s side door before opening it and striking Beck in the head multiple times with the butt of his gun, Lopez said. The gunman then fired one shot into Beck’s torso. According to the arrest warrant, surveillance footage from another camera showed the gunman running into a shed behind the home, wiping “an object” with a towel, then running into a wooded area, empty-handed. The sheriff’s office has not released the footage to the media. An unidentified caller reported Saturday that someone had been shot in a vehicle in the driveway of the home. When first responders arrived, Beck was found in the vehicle and taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Deputies looked for Miller throughout the night, and the sheriff’s office released a photo of him as it sought assistance from the public, Lopez said. After receiving a number of tips, Miller was found early Sunday morning and arrested. Lopez said that Miller confessed to the shooting following his arrest and is facing preliminary charges of murder with a firearm and burglary. When Lopez was asked at the news conference if Miller might not have intended for the pistol to go off, Lopez responded, “That’s not for me to decide. There’s a lot of different possibilities that could have happened during this incident, but the moral of this story is don’t pistol whip somebody.” “This isn’t a mobster movie or Grand Theft Auto or a video game,” Lopez added. “This is real life, and if you don’t know how to properly handle a firearm, you shouldn’t be holding one, especially beating someone with it.” According to court records, Miller has not yet entered a plea on the charges, and no court date has been set. Miller is being represented by the public defender’s office, which did not immediately respond to a request from HuffPost for comment. Brittany Harrell, Beck’s ex-wife and the mother of his three children, told WESH-TV in Orlando that the incident did not make sense to her since Beck and Miller had been close friends. “They’ve actually been really close, hanging out every other day, taking photos with my children together,” Harrell told the TV station. “We just saw Joey two days ago, and he didn’t mention nothing, and he normally would when something — he would blurt it out like, ‘I’m having a problem.’” Harrell told WESH that their children are struggling to come to terms with Beck’s death. She has launched a GoFundMe campaign to offset funeral expenses.

    "article_content": "Crime fellow A former Georgia police officer was convicted on Wednesday of kidnapping and murdering a 16-year-old girl who went missing as she was walking home from a friend’s home. Miles Bryant, a former police officer in Doraville, a suburb north of Atlanta, was found guilty of malice murder, felony murder, kidnapping and a false report of a crime in the death of Susana Morales, who disappeared in 2022. Her body was found months later in the woods, WXIA-TV in Atlanta reported . Bryant was found not guilty of attempted rape. In an email following the verdict, Tracy Drake, Bryant’s defense attorney, said the former police officer “still maintains his innocence in causing [Morales’] death or kidnapping her.” Drake added that while she and Bryant respect the jury’s verdict, they “have good issues for appeal.” Morales was initially reported missing in July 2022 by her mother, who said her daughter never returned to their Norcross home from a friend’s house nearby, according to an incident report obtained by HuffPost. The family said they last heard from Morales at 9:40 p.m. on July 26, 2022, when she messaged her mother that she was on her way home, according to a news release from the Gwinnett County Police Department . Her mother told officers that Morales did not pick up her phone after that text, though her sister was able to track her phone’s location through an app until 10:30 p.m. that day Morales’ body was not located until Feb. 6, 2023, when the Gwinnett County police responded to a report from a passerby who said they found skeletal remains while walking in a wooded area about 20 miles east of her home, according to an incident report. Dr. Carol Terry, Gwinnett County’s chief medical examiner, testified that the cause of death could not be determined due to decomposition of the body, according to WXIA-TV. Bryant’s gun was found near Morales’ remains, the Gwinnett County police said at the time . On the night she was reported missing, the then-officer with the Doraville Police Department had made a report to Gwinnett County police that someone had gone into his truck and stolen his wallet and handgun, according to a police incident report. He was arrested in February 2023 on charges of concealing the death of another and false report of a crime in connection with Morales’ death. According to an arrest warrant cited by Atlanta News First , police said that Bryant lived “in close proximity to the victim” at the time of the killing “and dumped her naked body in the woods.” Speaking at Bryant’s trial, Avyonne Smyre, his ex-girlfriend, told the court that she and Bryant had gotten into an argument on the night of Morales’ disappearance. She testified that she noticed suspicious scratches on his truck, WXIA reported. Since her disappearance was reported, Morales’ family has demanded justice, saying that police ignored their initial fears for her safety and wrote her off as a runaway . “Throughout the entire investigation, the police dismissed us and said that she was a runaway when we knew she would never do that,” Morales’ sister wrote in a now-deleted online petition. “How could she run away when she was on her way home?” On Tuesday, Gwinnett Police Detective Angela Carter testified that Bryant’s cellphone data revealed that he was in the area where Morales’ body was dumped on the night she went missing, according to reports by Atlanta’s WSB-TV. Carter also said Bryant had conducted several internet searches related to Morales’ disappearance, including one using the phrase “How long does it take a body to decompose?” according to WSB-TV. “He took his power, and he took his badge, and he used that to murder. He is a cop turned killer,” prosecuting attorney Brandon Delfunt told the court in his closing argument Wednesday, according to WXIA. In a statement shared with HuffPost following the jury’s verdict, Gwinnett County District Attorney Patsy Austin-Gatson said her office is “profoundly sad for the Morales family.” “The despicable nature of the defendant’s acts is compounded by the fact that he was a police officer at the time,” Austin-Gaston said.

    "article_content": "Crime fellow An 8-year-old Minnesota boy died on Sunday after shielding his mother from a shooting allegedly committed by his father, his family said. Danair Harden, 30, allegedly shot his son, Amir Harden, on June 5, according to the Star Tribune . The boy was rushed to a local hospital in Hennepin County but days later died of his injuries. According to the Star Tribune, Harden was in Dakota County District Court earlier that day on domestic violence charges. He’d allegedly choked Cherish Edwards, Amir Harden’s mother, in their home days before the shooting. Edwards had told police that she was concerned that Harden would assault her again, as there had been been several other domestic disputes between them years ago, according to a charging document cited by the outlet. She also told officers that Harden had a permit to carry a gun and often had one with him. A spokesperson for the Burnsville Police Department told HuffPost in an email that “authorities believe there was a family situation that led up to the incident,” adding that there other people inside the home at the time. Edwards provided more detail on the shooting in a GoFundMe. She said she was Harden’s initial target, but her son tried to wrestle the gun out of his father’s hand and was shot instead. “I screamed for him to leave and go to the neighbors, he refused & said ‘mommy, im not leaving you here’,” Edwards wrote. Harden shot himself in the head immediately after shooting his son, according to the fundraiser. In an interview with local news station KSTP , Edwards said that Amir’s four siblings were home at the time of the shooting and witnessed their brother getting shot. She opened up to the outlet about the guilt she feels as well as grief following Amir’s death. “That bullet was for me and not my child,” she said. Burnsville Police responded to the shooting at around 11:48 p.m. on June 5 and found a child and an adult in critical condition, according to a press release shared with HuffPost. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office later identified the boy as Amir Harden. Police said in the release that the adult suspect is being treated for injuries from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The spokesperson told HuffPost that “no arrest have been made because the suspected shooter is still in critical condition.” Amir was “known for his infectious smile and kind heart, and his presence,” Logan Schultz, the principal of his elementary school, told HuffPost in a statement. “Our heartfelt condolences go out to Amir’s family, friends, and the entire Echo Park Elementary School community as we mourn this tragic loss together,” Schultz wrote. In an interview with KSTP, Edwards had a message for other mothers who are living with domestic violence. “I know a lot of women try to see the good, especially when you have children with that person. Or, you think you’re alone or you don’t have help, and you can’t leave, you feel stuck,” Edwards said. “I didn’t want my family to be the example of what can happen. But unfortunately, we are,” she added. According to research published by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, one in three women have experienced some form of physical violence by an intimate partner. The organization also cited the presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation as increasing the risk of a homicide by 500%. Need help?

    "article_content": "Crime fellow A Wisconsin woman who moved out of the state after her husband’s death in 2020 pleaded not guilty Monday to a homicide charge after evidence, including DNA from a McDonald’s cup, allegedly linked her to his fatal shooting. A crime lab report linked DNA found on a straw in a fast-food cup near the body of Jose Santiago to his wife, Cassandra Hult, according to court documents, which also said fingerprints on the cup appeared to be hers. Hult also allegedly made statements to a roommate in Arizona and a new boyfriend in Las Vegas that helped lead to her arrest four years later. Hult is in a Milwaukee jail as she faces a charge of first-degree reckless homicide with a modifier for use of a dangerous weapon in the death of Santiago, who was found on the night of March 23, 2020, with a single gunshot wound to his head, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . Police went to St. Adalbert Cemetery that night after a jogger noticed that Santiago’s black Lincoln LS had been parked there for two days, according to a criminal complaint obtained by HuffPost. The jogger told officers she had gone up to the vehicle and discovered that an unresponsive man was inside. When detectives arrived, they found Santiago in the driver’s seat and a spent shell casing in the rear of the vehicle, with a bullet hole that went through the driver’s head rest, according to the complaint. Two McDonald’s cups containing orange juice were also found in the sedan. A McDonald’s receipt near the body showed a purchase made the day before, according to the complaint. Detective Jake Puschnig of the Milwaukee Police Department testified in court on Monday that forensic testing on the McDonald’s cups indicated fingerprints and DNA were linked to Hult and her husband, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Detectives interviewed Hult the day after they found Santiago’s body, according to the complaint. Hult allegedly told officers that she and Santiago had been married for about a year and half but were “on and off recently.” Hult allegedly told detectives that she’d gotten into an argument with Santiago in the car after she found messages between him and another woman, according to the complaint. The detectives reported that she told them the argument ended when Santiago “became violent” with her and pushed her out the car. Hult said she was then driven to her grandmother’s house by a friend, according to the complaint, and denied going to McDonald’s with Santiago that day. However, Hult’s cellphone data indicted she was near St. Adalbert Cemetery and the McDonald’s on the day police believe Santiago was killed, the complaint said. Police said Hult, in later interviews, gave “inconsistent accounts of where she was and what she was doing,” according to the complaint. Hult eventually left the state for Buckeye, Arizona, where she moved in with a woman and her daughter for a brief period, the complaint says. In September 2021, Arizona police interviewed the woman Hult had lived with, according to the complaint. The woman reportedly told officers that she kicked Hult out after living with her for about a month. The Arizona woman reportedly told police that she and Hult continued to argue over FaceTime and that Hult “threatened to kill her” during a call, according to the complaint. She reportedly told police that Hult confessed she “had killed her husband in Milwaukee.” Hult then met a man in Las Vegas in January 2022, and they became romantically involved and settled down in Sacramento, California, according to the complaint. Detectives reported that they interviewed Hult’s new romantic partner in May 2022 and that the man claimed she had confessed multiple times to killing Santiago, according to the complaint. The man reportedly told detectives that Hult provided details about the killing. Hult, who was arrested in May, is set to return for a court conference on July 10. The Wisconsin State Public Defenders Office, which appears to be providing her defense, did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for a comment.

    "article_content": "Crime fellow A Texas man was arrested outside his Fort Worth home on Thursday after federal prosecutors said he made threats to an FBI agent involved in the investigation of Hunter Biden’s laptop. Timothy Muller, 43, left threatening voicemails on the agent’s FBI-issued phone hours after Biden was convicted in Delaware of three federal gun charges on Tuesday, according to a criminal complaint obtained by HuffPost . Muller is charged with making interstate threatening communications and influencing, impeding or retaliating against a federal official, according to a Department of Justice release. A jury found Biden guilty on Tuesday of unlawfully possessing a firearm despite his drug addiction and of lying to obtain the gun, HuffPost previously reported. The federal agent had been named in what the criminal complaint described as “open source reports” and was involved in the investigation connected to data recovered from Hunter Biden’s laptop, which had been left at a repair shop. Muller allegedly told the agent, “You can run, but you can’t fucking hide,” according to a transcript of a minute-long voicemail cited in the complaint. He also reportedly accused the agent of covering for pedophiles. ″[T’s] gonna win the re-election, and then we’re gonna fucking go through the FBI and just start throwing” agents in jail, Muller said, per the transcript, likely referring to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump . “Or you can steal another election, and then the guns will come out, and we’ll hunt you ... down and slaughter you like the traitorous dogs you are,” Muller added, using a homophobic slur. Prosecutors alleged that Muller then also sent the agent a series of three text messages peppered with slurs and threats. “You’re going to jail- if you’re lucky. But I suspect you won’t be,” read one. “How’s the family? Safe?” If convicted, Muller faces up to 10 years in federal prison. An attorney listed as his counsel did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for a comment. According to federal court records, a judge ordered him to remain detained pending a hearing on June 18 after prosecutors said he posed a threat to community safety. Earlier this week, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland raised concerns in a Washington Post op-ed about threats that FBI agents face, some fueled by conspiracy theories.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Maneet Chauhan is an Indian American celebrity chef, restaurant owner and cookbook author. She launched the first ever Indian dining concept at a Disney park in Orlando, eet by Maneet Chuahan , and became the first two-time champion of Food Network’s highest-rated culinary competition series, ” Tournament of Champions .” In this edition of Voices in Food , Chauhan explains how she takes issue with people who question “authenticity” in her cooking. She advises chefs and diners to loosen the criticism of authenticity, and have more fun through personal expression. I grew up in a small town in Ranchi, India. The community that I grew up in had people from all over the country. Each region of India — Punjab, Andhra, Bengal, Rajasthan — has a distinct cuisine of its own. I was that obnoxious kid who would eat dinner at home and then go to my neighbor’s home and tell them that my parents did not feed me so I could try their regional food, too. As I got older, our family friends started asking me to come to the dinner parties earlier, to help cook with them. It was fascinating, because I got to learn about different ingredients and techniques from these aunties, which was “authentic to them” home cooking. I myself started playing around with combinations and textures that I enjoyed. I would take my own cooked food to my older sister in college and became the most popular kid on campus. I realized I could have a conversation with anyone over food. Instead of following the common professional aspirations of becoming a doctor or engineer, I wanted to be a chef. My parents encouraged me. I went to the best hotel management school in Manipal, India. Then, I had my eyes on the best culinary school in the world – Culinary Institute of America (CIA). When I got there in 1998, I was the only Indian student at the CIA for a long time. The awareness of Indian food in the U.S. was the dismal all-you-can-eat, $10-or-less lunch buffets. It was shocking because I had grown up with seasonal ingredients and many evolved flavors. “When diners or the media attack me that my food is not authentic, I tell them that authenticity is an opinion and it is OK to have a conversation around your experiences.” But instead of feeling pigeonholed, I was excited to learn new techniques. At CIA, when we had to make focaccia with our own signature topping for our bread-making class, I [used] bhindi bhaji (Indian-style okra) and chana daal (chickpea curry) toppings. Everyone loved the flavors and the chef-instructor encouraged me to express myself in my cooking. After graduating, I couldn’t get anyone to sponsor my work visa, so I worked for my uncle and aunt’s restaurant outside Philadelphia. We were serving what people thought of as authentic Indian food, and it gave me insight into what Indian food could be if it was treated with respect. I introduced the diners to dishes they had never even heard of before, or would write off as “unauthentic.” For example, most people associate chaat with northern India and expect certain ingredients in it. I traveled around India to research for my cookbook and found there were so many versions of chaat – including idli chaat from southern India. Even today, my chicken tikka poutine is controversial, but my most popular dish. When people come to my restaurants and remark that my food is not authentic Indian, I ask them: What is authentic? India, as a country it is today, is an aggregation of cultures. Chicken tikka masala is not authentic Indian; it is a British invention. Goan Vindaloo has vinegar from Portuguese influence. Indo Chinese comes from the Chinese migration of Tangra cuisine. Most people associate naan with Indian food, but that came from when Persian kingdoms settled in India. Even key ingredients used in everyday Indian cooking, like tomatoes and chilies, originally came from Mexico. If you go further back in history, Indian food was Dravidian or Satvik (ayurvedic), and back in time, we were all hunters and gatherers cooking on fire. In fact, no cuisine in the world can be called authentic. If so, we would say there was no authentic French cuisine prior to Auguste Escoffier documenting mother sauces. Authentic is a weak word. It is open to personal interpretation. Authentic is what is authentic to me — what I have grown up with, been influenced by, or want to create. There are thousands of ways saag paneer is made across India. Even my maternal and paternal grandmothers from the same region made it differently. So, am I confused about my authenticity? I am not an historian, I am an artist. Cooking is open to my interpretation of flavors. And there are different kinds of artists — some are great at copying exactly, others interpret something from real life. At the end of the day, chefs are artists, some put their own flavor and design, others do it as they see it. My food is authentic Maneet. And when chefs claim that their recipes have been passed down through generations or “this is how my grandmother made it,” I can promise you that the recipes within the family evolved as they immigrated, as farming techniques changed, as cooking techniques modernized, and ingredients became available. Your nonna was probably using a mortar and pestle instead of a grinder, and cooking on an open fire instead of a temperature-controlled commercial oven. There is charm in knowing where we came from, but also excitement in where we have come. Change is a part of our evolution. Chefs may start with the romanticized idea of cooking what their grandmother made, but every generation adds its own signature on the dish. Instead of hanging on rigidly to the word “authentic,” you can be open to translation. Authenticity is a vague word that comes down to personal perception. Each restaurant concept is authentic to the chef who created it. Chefs should stop calling their food “authentic” and should stand behind their own celebration of flavors they have been inspired by, and how they want to transfer their own emotion and passion across to diners through their creations. When diners or the media attack me that my food is not authentic, I tell them that authenticity is an opinion and it is OK to have a conversation around your experiences. You don’t need to be right or wrong. It is often people who have limited knowledge who dig their heels in to assume and criticize. Food is a powerful connector — it emotes love, and provides nourishment. I became a chef to make people happy. Naysayers will always be there. But if as a chef you are true to yourself, that’s all that matters.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost If you have plans to eat at a Mexican restaurant for dinner in the States, you probably have a few expectations — complimentary baskets of golden tortilla chips and salsa, tacos, burritos, enchiladas and a whole section on the menu devoted to margaritas. Oh, and you expect it to be cheap . While many Mexican restaurants in the U.S. certainly deliver on all those fronts, it’s a giant misconception to believe a Mexican restaurant must check off all those boxes in order to be good or authentic. Mexican food is a lot more varied than many Americans realize, and numerous top Mexican chefs told HuffPost that there are a few myths — six big ones, in particular — many people believe that simply aren’t true. Rick Martinez , a Mexican chef living in Mazatlán and the author of “Mi Cocina,” told HuffPost that one misconception many Americans have about Mexican food is that it essentially comes down to five dishes: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, nachos and quesadillas — often with rice and beans being the core ingredients. “There is so much more diversity in Mexico and its food than people realize,” he said. José Cepeda , the executive chef at Quixote in The Lafayette Hotel and Club in San Diego, California, added to this, saying, “In the U.S, when [many Americans] think about Mexican food, it’s always tacos and burritos, cheese, chips and salsa with margaritas. I’m not saying it’s wrong, but Mexican food is a lot more than that.” For example, Martinez shared that many Americans don’t realize that seafood is a big part of Mexican cuisine, including lobster, clams, shrimp and oysters. “Many [Americans] have a limited view of what Mexico has to offer by way of seafood and produce. For example, Mexico has amazing citrus fruits and coconut,” Martinez said. Martinez pointed out that Mexico is a big country and the cuisine varies by region — something many Americans may not realize. He explained that Mexican cuisine uses fresh ingredients native to the local region, which is different based on where in Mexico you are. Mely Martínez, author of “Mexico in Your Kitchen,” expressed a similar sentiment, saying, “The idea that Mexican food is just what we usually see in the United States is not right because the food from Mexico has a lot of different styles and varieties. Mexico is formed by 32 states, each one with its own distinct gastronomy formed by local ingredients, cooking techniques and cultural influences.” She added that the cuisine can differ significantly from one region to another, showcasing a wide spectrum of flavors, textures and dishes that extend far beyond the limited offerings typically seen in American representations of Mexican food. “In the U.S., the exposure to Mexican cuisine often revolves around a handful of popular dishes that may not fully capture the extensiveness and complexity of Mexico’s gastronomy,” Mely Martínez said. Related to the myth that Mexican food primarily consists of rice and beans, Julian Medina , the owner and chef of Toloache , which has locations across New York City, said that many Americans expect that all Mexican food should be cheap. “Generally, I think Americans typically expect Mexican food to be cheap because it often features less expensive ingredients like rice and beans. However, upscale Mexican food centers around high-quality, fresh ingredients, with an extensive amount of time and labor going into making sauces like mole, which in some cases can take days to prepare,” he said. If, for you, Taco Tuesday means a tub of Daisy sour cream and yellow cheese are front and center in the kitchen, your meal may taste great — but it isn’t exactly something you’ll come across in Mexico. “The use of sour cream and yellow cheese is not as common in traditional Mexican cuisine as it is in the ‘Mexican’ food found in the United States,” Mely Martínez told HuffPost. She explained that in Mexico, dishes might be topped with fresh local cheeses such as queso fresco or Mexican crema, which is a thinner, more flavorful counterpart to American sour cream. Medina added to this, saying that sour cream is not typically part of Mexican cuisine. “It’s America’s take on Mexican crema, which has a different flavor profile. It’s more sweet than sour,” he said. Again, totally fine if you like these ingredients on your tacos or in your quesadillas. Just expect something a little different if you go on vacation in Mexico or a Mexican friend invites you over for dinner. Osiris Hoil, the co-founder and CEO at District Taco , with locations in Washington, D.C., Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, said that one common myth he’s often confronted with is that Mexican food is inherently unhealthy. “I want people to know that Mexican food can be balanced and healthy,” he said. Rick Martinez said this too, saying that there is so much amazing produce grown in Mexico like sweet potatoes, corn and berries. Hoil said that as Mexican restaurants gained popularity in America, many of the dishes adapted to include high-calorie topping and heavy sauces. “There’s also the idea that more is better — portion sizes have increased. When you add it all up, it gives people the impression that Mexican food is unhealthy,” he explained. But he emphasized that delicious Mexican food doesn’t require these extra, high-calorie ingredients. “You can have a taco with nothing more than lean, marinated grilled chicken, which we call pollo asado, freshly prepared pico de gallo — which is simply tomato, onion, lime juice and cilantro — and top it with roasted tomato-based salsa. You will be blown away by the flavor,” he said. If you’re someone with a low-threshold for spice, you may think Mexican food isn’t for you. But Mely Martínez told HuffPost this isn’t the case. “One common misconception about Mexican food that many Americans might have is the idea that all Mexican dishes are naturally spicy,” she said. “In reality, the flavors and ingredients in Mexican food are diverse and balanced. While it’s true that chili peppers, either dried or fresh, play an important role in Mexican cooking, they are often used merely to enhance the complexity and flavor of a dish, rather than to add heat. Not every Mexican dish is spicy, and many can be enjoyed by those who prefer milder tastes,” she explained. Medina shared a similar sentiment, saying, “Chilis are commonly used [in Mexican cuisine], but this is more so for flavor than spice.” Hoil echoed this, saying, “There are definitely some spicy options, but you can always adjust it to your preference.” If you’re eating out at a Mexican restaurant and can’t do spice, just tell the waiter. You’ll still end up with a delicious meal. If you go to a Mexican restaurant and see ingredients like kibbeh and tabbouleh (traditional Lebanese dishes) on the menu, you may think you’ve ended up in a “fusion” restaurant and not an “authentic” Mexican one. But Rick Martinez told HuffPost that it’s completely natural for Mexican food to change over time as people migrate to Mexico from other countries, including Lebanon and Haiti . These migrations change what Mexican food may look like, he said, but it doesn’t make it any less authentic. Martinez said the same is true of the evolution of Mexican food in the U.S. It’s only natural for second- and third-generation Mexican chefs to draw upon the types of foods they’re exposed to in America and integrate them into their Mexican cooking. “Kitchens in general are in constant change. There are exchanges and adaptations of both Mexican cuisine in the U.S., as well as U.S. cuisine in Mexico,” said chef Enrique Olvera , who lives in Mexico City. Here’s what all the chefs say should be unchanging about Mexican food: It’s made primarily from fresh, local ingredients and not processed ones, combined in simplistic ways and not overdressed with heavy sauces or toppings. None of the chefs say there’s anything wrong with enjoying cheesy quesadillas topped with sour cream or paying a few bucks for tacos from a local food truck. But Medina did say that if you want to seek out Mexican food in a way that truly honors the culture, he recommends going to restaurants in neighborhoods where Mexicans live that are smaller and family-owned. And maybe extend your palate past rice and beans. There’s so much more to Mexican cuisine to discover.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Hot dog season is officially upon us. As the weather warms up and we weigh the pros and cons of stuffing our faces with salty hot dogs on perfectly toasted buns with ketchup, mustard and sauerkraut, we have to wonder: How much better are those hot dogs and sausages at the grocery store that include labels like “low fat,” “organic,” “vegetarian/vegan,” “low-sodium,” “natural” and the list goes on? Are they really that much healthier than a traditional hot dog? In our never-ending quest to consume hot dogs all summer without wreaking havoc on our health, we consulted nutritionists to find out — here’s what they had to say. We have good news. According to the nutritionists we consulted, healthy hot dogs do exist. “ LightLife hot dogs are my favorite,” Amy Goldsmith , a registered dietitian and owner of Kindred Nutrition, told HuffPost. “They taste great, and since they are plant-based, they have 0 grams of saturated fat and total fat while still providing 8 grams of protein.” Marissa Meshulam , a New York-based registered dietitian, loves Applegate Organics Turkey Hot Dogs . “They’re made with great quality ingredients like organic turkey meat and simple spices. All of the meat is humanely raised, which is healthier for the consumer as well,” she said. In general, humanely raised animals have better access to nutrient-dense food , thus delivering more vitamins and minerals to consumers. Additionally, meat products from humanely raised animals typically contain less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fat. Registered dietitian Stephanie Dunne is also team Applegate Organics. “I love that I understand every ingredient in the list, that they are organic, and the animals are humanely raised,” she said. “Additionally, they don’t contain any gluten or casein, so they can be enjoyed by those who have allergies or sensitivities to those proteins. They also have delicious turkey and chicken hot dogs for those looking to reduce their overall or saturated fat intake.” Long story short: There are good “healthy” hot dogs out there, but also imposters. You should be wary of hot dogs marketed as healthy that are anything but. “Many packages have claims like ‘no fillers!’ and ‘no MSG!’” Dunne said . “While both of these facts are good, people should always read the ingredients and nutrition facts label to be sure they are making the healthiest selection possible. For example, a sausage package might claim ‘no fillers!’ on the front but still contain 26 grams of fat and multiple preservatives.” Goldsmith added that just because a hot dog is made from chicken or turkey doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthier. “ I think people tend to think that hot dogs that are labeled as organic or made from chicken or turkey are naturally healthier,” she said. “Although they may have less fat and a little less saturated fat, they are still high in sodium.” Excess sodium intake ( more than 1,500 milligrams per day ) increases the risk of life-threatening health issues like high blood pressure, kidney disease, stroke, stomach cancer and more, according to the American Heart Association . Just because a hot dog is organic or made with chicken doesn’t mean it’s automatically lower in sodium, so always check your labels. At first glance, vegan and vegetarian hot dogs might appear healthier than meat. Plant-based products are always better, right? Not necessarily. “Plant-based hot dogs are a great alternative for people who prefer to avoid meat, for whatever reason,” Dunne said. “However, regardless of the source of filling, the healthiest hot dogs will be those with low sodium content, reasonable fat content and natural ingredients. From a health perspective (rather than a moral one or based on taste preference), I do not recommend substituting a plant-based hot dog that is high in sodium, added sugar, and has a long list of ingredients that I don’t understand.” Goldsmith agrees, saying that although, in general, plant-based hot dogs will have less saturated fat, that’s not always the case — and other ingredients matter, too. “There are specific things you want to assess,” she said. “First, how much saturated fat and total fat does it have? How much sodium, and what is the protein amount?” As with any hot dog you purchase, reading the label on vegetarian and vegan hot dogs will always be important. A sodium-packed vegan hot dog isn’t necessarily better than a turkey or chicken hot dog that packs less salt. The good news is that you can buy hot dogs that are somewhat healthy. The bad news? You still probably shouldn’t eat them every day. “ Like all food groups, everything is fine in moderation,” Goldsmith said. “As a dietitian, I recommend focusing on a variety of protein sources. This can vary between poultry, pork, beef, fish and plant-sourced protein. My rule of thumb is to not repeat a source more than twice a week.” Dunne gets more specific, saying that when packing her daughter’s lunch, hot dogs make it in her lunchbox — but not every day. “I give my daughter a hot dog once per week in her lunchbox, as it is a source of protein that I know she will consume, and I wouldn’t hesitate to give her another on the weekend if I needed to,” she said. “However, because it is slightly higher in sodium than other protein sources, I ensure that I balance it out with crunchy snap peas or creamy homemade coleslaw.” When making decisions about food frequency, Dunne emphasizes that it’s always important to consider the big picture. Even though certain hot dog picks at the grocery store are healthier than the “real thing,” eating them every day would still probably pack too much sodium into your week. So, if you want to eat them a few times a week, make sure you balance them with lower-sodium choices. To answer the initial question posed, yes — there is a point in eating healthy hot dogs. They’re a good source of protein, and some brands are significantly lower in saturated fat and sodium than the real thing. You probably still shouldn’t eat them every day, but hey — we’ll take our wins where we can.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost The sommelier is heading over to your table and you panic, jabbing your finger on the second-cheapest bottle . Someone gives you a good bottle of red wine, and you decide to store it in the closet for the day you finally retire. Or you’re at a party and someone hands you a bottle of Champagne, so you give it a good shake and point it into the crowd. Are these great ideas or egregious errors? Experts know, and they have thoughts. We asked winemakers, wine sellers and sommeliers to tell us the biggest misconceptions they notice among us non-wine-world civilians. Follow their advice, and you’ll never hyperventilate at the approach of the sommelier again. Let’s start addressing the myths ... “Don’t think that paying more means you’re getting better wine,” said Rodolphe Boulanger , vice president of wine merchandising at Total Wine & More. Many factors go into the pricing of a bottle of wine, including quality, availability, demand and production cost. According to BinWise , a wine industry beverage management platform, retail wine prices are typically marked up 50% over wholesale prices. So, a wine that costs $7 from a wholesaler will be about $11 at a wine shop, it notes. But with so many variables at play, some less expensive wines can taste terrific, and there are many hidden gems to be found. “One of my favorite wine experiences in the past month was enjoying a $12 French Pinot Noir from Cambos Feret ,” Boulanger said. “It surprised me by overdelivering on quality.” Wine critics and publications usually use a 100-point wine rating scale, so a wine rated 80 is considered good, and one rated at 95 or higher is exceptional. But, as with reviews from any subjective critic — such as in the realms of food or theater — those numbers represent informed opinions, not absolute facts. “The concept of critics’ ratings and scores can create a false sense that there’s only one true hierarchy of wine, or that a 100-point wine is objectively the best,” Boulanger said. “Ratings can be helpful when making a selection, but sometimes what’s more important is what you and your guests like.” “No judgments, but if you truly want to enjoy a wine the way the winemaker intended, ice isn’t a good idea,” said Dana Spaulding , level 2 sommelier and CEO of single-serve wine brand Wander + Ivy. “Ice cubes will dilute the wine and water it down.” There are other options, she said. “A trend I’ve been noticing is keeping wine glasses in the freezer before serving, which is not only a smart idea, but very Instagrammable,” she added. “I also love the idea of using frozen whole grapes instead of ice cubes. As they thaw, they won’t change the composition of the wine.” “The fridge is a good place to store any wine leftovers, because cooler temperatures slow down chemical processes, including oxidation,” said Michelle Feldman , the co-founder of Good Clean Wine. “A re-closed bottle of red or white wine, refrigerated, can stay relatively fresh for up to five days.” If you’re thinking red wine shouldn’t go near the fridge, you can let that idea go, because leftover red actually does fine under chilly conditions. “Storing opened and recorked red wine in the refrigerator doesn’t alter its profile,” Feldman said. “While the cool temperature can’t prevent oxidation, it significantly slows the process. It’s standard practice among restaurants, sommeliers and winemakers to store wine this way.” Even better, she pointed out that your leftover reds won’t need to be brought to room temperature before serving. “Once poured into a glass, refrigerated red wine will quickly reach the desired temperature,” she said. Spaulding noted that, especially in warmer months, you should bring any wine bottles into the house as soon as possible. “Once wine is above 70 to 75 degrees F, it will start to spoil, which means, in the case of wine, that it will start to turn to vinegar,” she said. So, don’t stop by the wine shop and then keep the bottle in your trunk all day while you run errands. “Unless you’re buying a specific wine that’s meant to be aged, don’t save your wine,” Feldman said. “Not all wines get better with age, and most wines should be opened and enjoyed now, or within a year of purchasing. Sparkling wines are meant to be enjoyed fresh, so go ahead and pop the bottle now. Still wines tend to reach peak maturity around two years after bottling.” Feldman pointed out that only 1% of all wine produced is intended for aging, so very few bottles actually benefit from the process. “Generally, wines with high acidity, tannins, sugar and alcohol content such as fortified wines, as well as complex premium wines, benefit from aging,” she said. Cameron Nadler , whose Instagram handle is “ everyday_sommelier ,” is wine director for New York’s Zero Bond and Sartiano’s at The Mercer . He said a flute is not required when you’re popping a bottle of fizz. “A good all-purpose wine glass is a great vessel for drinking champagne, because it really allows you to get all the flavors and experience the wine as the producer intended,” he said. “Champagne flutes are not a thing of the past, but I do find that it’s better to drink Champagne from a larger glass.” There’s a little more to it. Florent Latour is CEO of Maison Louis Latour , a merchant and owner of red and white wines in Burgundy, France, which has been independent and family-owned since 1797. “The proper temperature to serve red and white wines is often misunderstood, and people serve red wine too warm or white wine too cold, which can dull the flavor of the wines,” he said. “I’d recommend chilling red wine for 20 minutes before serving. On the other hand, pre-chilled white wines should be taken out of the refrigerator about 25 minutes before serving for optimal enjoyment.” Nope. “A common mistake people make is overthinking their food and wine pairings, or being a little too by the book,” said Linda Trotta , director of winemaking at Bread & Butter Wines and vice president of global winemaking and sourcing at WX Brands . “If done correctly, you can enjoy a red wine with seafood or a high-end Champagne with fast-food french fries.” Latour said there’s no need for the dramatic pop and subsequent gusher. “As fun as that may sound, it results in a huge, messy spray and, most importantly, a loss of wine,” he said. “When it comes to removing sparkling wine corks, I’d recommend carefully holding the cork and then slowly rotating the bottle with a kitchen towel covering the top of the bottle. This way, you’ll still hear the satisfying ‘pop,’ but you won’t make a mess.” “I think our jobs as sommeliers is to teach guests some of the basics so they understand next time they’re ordering,” Nadler said. “I would never try to make a guest feel like they don’t know what they’re talking about, and there’s always a nicer way to teach them than to just clearly state, ‘You’re wrong!’” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost If you’ve been experiencing sticker shock at the grocery store checkout counter, it’s not necessarily because you’re adding more to your cart than usual. The entire country is confronted with the rising cost of groceries , which is only expected to continue. It really makes you think about just how badly you want those avocados , right? Though you can’t do anything about inflation, you can slash your grocery spending by making a few changes to the way you shop — while still enjoying your favorite meals and not going hungry. The secret is shopping smarter. Experts who have mastered food shopping for cheap know the biggest pitfalls that trap people into overspending. Want to avoid them? Here are seven grocery mistakes to keep in mind the next time you do your weekly food haul. If you want to reduce your food costs, the first step is to figure out how much you’re currently spending, family budgeting expert Rob Bertman told HuffPost. “Sometimes, people will pick an amount out of thin air that they want their grocery budget to be, but that can be challenging to stick to if you don’t know how much you’re currently spending,” he said. For example, Bertman said if your goal is to spend $400 a month on groceries, and you guess that you’re typically spending $600 when you’re actually spending $1,000, your budget is unlikely to stick and could require some bigger changes. Once you know how much you’re currently spending (by keeping the receipts from your grocery trips in the past month), Bertman said the next step is to think about the choices you can make to reduce that amount. Instead of trying to drastically cut your spending all at once, Bertman recommends making small, incremental changes — similar to how someone with a goal of eating healthier may find longer-lasting success by focusing on little adjustments at first, rather than suddenly adopting a super restrictive diet. This is where knowing some other common shopping mistakes can come in handy. Budget Bytes founder Beth Moncel told HuffPost that one of the most common grocery shopping mistakes is not creating a meal plan , or a guide for exactly how you’ll use everything you buy. Especially with produce, many people buy food that they aspire to eat but don’t end up doing so, Moncel said. “For some people, making sure you eat all the food you’re buying means writing on your calendar when you are going to prep and cook it,” Moncel added. Bertman is a big believer in meal planning too, but he emphasized that you should be realistic about it. “You can have a great meal plan in place for the week, but if you get home from work and you’re too tired to cook, you end up ordering in,” he said. “It’s important to be realistic about your time and ambition.” Before you walk out the door with your meal plan and grocery list, “Save Money on Groceries Without Losing Your Mind” author Tiffany Doerr Guerzon recommends doing yourself a solid by checking your refrigerator, freezer and pantry first. That way, you don’t end up with three half-used jars of salsa or other multiples at home. “Another way to cut waste is to challenge yourself to use only the groceries you already have at home every couple of months,” Guerzon told HuffPost. “You will probably need to pick up fresh items such as eggs and milk, but most people are surprised by what they have in their pantries, fridge and freezer.” Not sure how to combine what you have? Apps like SuperCook and Cooklist can give you some ideas. If you don’t want to reduce your meat consumption for ethical or health reasons , do it for your wallet. Even if you don’t give up meat completely, both Moncel and Guerzon said that cutting back can help save you money. Moncel pointed out that plant-based proteins such as lentils, chickpeas and beans are less expensive than meat. “One easy way to save money is to cut back on the amount of meat you use in a recipe,” Guerzon said. For example, if a casserole or stew calls for 1 pound of ground beef, you can use 3/4 of a pound instead, she said. “No one will notice the difference,” Guerzon explained. “If you buy ground beef in 1-pound packages, freeze the extra quarter-pound that you saved. And after you’ve prepared that recipe three times, you will have enough in the freezer for an extra meal.” Fruits and veggies are delicious and good for you, but some can spoil quickly. (Side-eye glance to mushrooms, berries and peaches.) For produce items that might go bad before you can eat them, Moncel and Guerzon recommend buying them frozen. “Freezing does change the texture of berries, but this isn’t noticeable when incorporating frozen berries into smoothies, baked goods [or] even for topping your breakfast oatmeal or yogurt,” Guerzon noted. When buying produce in the frozen section, Moncel recommends looking for them in their simplest form. Anything that’s covered in sauce or packaged in a microwaveable bag is likely going to cost extra. It bears repeating that if you are buying fresh produce, you should know exactly how you’re going to use it before it goes bad. Moncel said to keep this in mind when doing your meal planning and to focus on versatile veggies that can be used in various ways. Guerzon suggested buying spices in bulk when you cook with them regularly. “Buying spices in bulk is my number-one [money-saving] tip because those little jars are expensive,” she said. “You can just reuse an empty spice jar and refill it from the bulk bins, or some stores that offer bulk spices even sell empty spice jars. I once refilled a $6.50 jar of dried basil from the bulk bin and it cost me less than 50 cents.” Other pantry items to buy in bulk include grain products like dried pasta, rolled oats and rice, Guerzon added. It’s natural to glance down at your shopping list, see what’s on it and grab the first version of it you see. But Guerzon said that simply checking the prices of items above and below eye level could save you money. “Human nature and a desire to get the shopping done quickly causes us to be more likely to reach for items at eye level,” she said. “Stores know this and place the more expensive items there. Next time you are in the store, take note of where items are placed. You may have to reach up or down for better deals.” Avoiding this mistake and others will surely save you money on groceries, but sometimes that’s simply not enough. If you aren’t able to afford food for you or your family no matter how many money-saving tricks you try, Bertman said to consider what kinds of assistance are available to you. In addition to seeing if you qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, he recommends doing a Google search for food banks in your area, as well as local nonprofits dedicated to helping families in need. Grocery inflation is no joke, so you aren’t alone in seeking to save money on food. Put the experts’ tips into practice and reach out for supplemental support if you need it. With a plan in place, you’ll still be able to keep your kitchen stocked.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Summer celebrations can be some of the best times of the year, but warm temperatures also bring an increased chance that some of the food being served could contain dangerous bacteria. “The peak timing for foodborne illness is during the summer months, particularly in July and August,” said Dennis D’Amico , an associate professor in the department of animal science at the University of Connecticut. “This is the time of year associated with increased cases of listeriosis, campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections.” The connection between warm weather and food problems happens because the creepy critters love a warm place to settle in and multiply. Food scientist Bryan Quoc Le explained it this way: “ As temperatures become warmer, the rate at which microorganisms grow speeds up. While most spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms have very slow growth rates at refrigerator temperatures, they accelerate to 10 to 100 times the growth rate per hour at temperatures that reach 80°F to 85°F. That means the number of bacteria that can cause food poisoning will double at a much greater speed.” We asked food scientists to pinpoint some of the biggest potential dangers at outdoor events. They told us where to look for trouble — and how to avoid it. Glenn Morris , director of the University of Florida Emerging Pathogens Institute, said that bacteria like Salmonella and Campylobacter, which cause the greatest problems with foodborne illness, tend to be associated with raw meat and poultry. The best way to prevent sickness is to make sure all of your meat is heated to the right temperature. “These foodborne disease bacteria are killed by cooking, so make sure your chicken and hamburgers are well-cooked,” Morris said. When you’re grilling, keep a thermometer near, D’Amico said. “Color and texture are not reliable indicators of food safety or doneness. Meats must be cooked to the proper internal temperature and verified using a food thermometer.” Ground meats must be cooked to 160°F, chicken to 165°F and fresh steaks and chops to 145°F. When the meat is cooked, don’t put it back on a plate that still has juices from the raw meat, Morris said. “Even though the meat is cooked, you can recontaminate it with bad bacteria from raw meat and poultry juices that linger on a platter.” The danger zone in which bacteria multiply is between 40°F and 140°F, so your food should always be either cooler or warmer than that. “Food that needs to stay cold needs to remain below 40°F, with plenty of ice and proper insulated storage, like coolers and Styrofoam chests,” Le said. “Food that has been warmed up should be kept over 140°F. You can keep it warm using the side of the grill rack or an alcohol burner.” A good rule of thumb is to leave food out at room temperature for no more than two hours. Le explained why: “Bacteria can divide at room temperature every 15 to 20 minutes. So one single pathogenic bacteria can become 16 within the first hour, 256 in the second hour and over 4,000 in the third hour. Some species and strains can multiply at an even faster rate, depending on conditions in the food.” Depending on the toxins produced by the bacteria, some microorganisms can cause food poisoning with as little as 10 individual bacteria cells, while others require hundreds or thousands in number to cause sickness, Le said. If you’re more vulnerable, the risk is greater, and he noted that children, pregnant women and elderly individuals can have a weaker immune system that might be more severely affected by contaminated food. “Listeria monocytogenes can cause additional complications in pregnant women, and listeriosis can induce abortion, stillbirth, or meningitis in newborn babies,” he said. That’s why food cleanup should start when the meal is finished, not after you try one more round of volleyball with the fam. “The last thing you want to do is to leave food sitting out in the heat for a couple of hours, allowing the bacteria that may be present in them to grow luxuriantly,” Morris said. Items that contain eggs — including homemade dressings, mayonnaise or dishes like deviled eggs or egg salad — are a concern, because eggs can be contaminated with the bacteria Salmonella or Campylobacter, which can cause serious illness. “Both are inactivated if ingredients are cooked properly, but they could remain present if the eggs are used raw or are undercooked,” D’Amico said. Another issue is premade or prepared salads like coleslaw, chicken, tuna, egg and potato salads. “They’re popular during the summer, but there’s a concern due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes,” he said. “This bacterium can be found in processing and deli environments and can contaminate prepared foods and their ingredients. Listeria can grow in the cold, so if a food is contaminated [with] Listeria, its numbers can increase even during cold storage at the deli.” The experts also noted that you need to make sure your cooler is working correctly. For that, you’ll need plenty of ice. “A full cooler will maintain its cold temperatures longer than one that is partially filled, so it’s important to pack plenty of extra ice or freezer packs to ensure a constant cold temperature,” said Mary Anne Amalaradjou , associate professor of food microbiology in the University of Connecticut Department of Animal Science. Other cooling tips from her: “Keep the cooler out of the direct sun, and keep drinks in a separate cooler from foods. The beverage cooler will be opened more frequently, allowing the food cooler to stay cold.” Drink-worthy ice is not cooler ice, Morris said, noting that dirty coolers or cross-contaminating food juices could make a cold drink dangerous to consume. “Whenever you plan to serve drinks over ice, use clean ice in the glasses,” he said. “While it may be convenient to just reach into the cooler and pick up a handful of ice, think about what that ice has touched. It doesn’t belong in a drink. Instead, pack a zipper bag of drink-worthy ice cubes in the cooler and use that for your beverages.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost If you’ve ever headed to a restaurant in the Little Italy section of an American city and sat down at a checkered tablecloth, there’s a good chance the dish you ordered wasn’t Italian at all. Instead, it likely fell into a culinary category known as “Italian American.” Beloved dishes like chicken Parmesan, baked ziti, and basically the entire Olive Garden menu all qualify as Italian American. This cuisine focuses on dishes invented by Italian immigrants using ingredients readily available in the United States. “ When Italians began to immigrate to the U.S., most hailed from poor, rural backgrounds and their cooking was leaner with few ingredients, dishes were mostly vegetarian, and they basically used whatever was available to them,” explained Gennaro Contaldo , a celebrated London-based chef and cookbook author best known for mentoring Jamie Oliver during his Italian cooking education. He explained that when Italian immigrants made it to the United States “a nd saw the abundance of ingredients available to them, the dishes they had learned to cook back home began to stray from the ‘cucina povera’ into a richer, often meatier cuisine.” Let’s be clear: Many people love Italian American cuisine and believe this type of dining created by Italians in the U.S. is completely authentic to its own history, its own creators, and its own culture. Giuseppe Gentile , executive chef of L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele in Naples, Italy, and its four U.S. locations in California and New York, also understands the appeal of Italian American cuisine, acknowledging that these dishes “ seem to be more comforting in some ways” than many dishes created in Italy proper. That said, if you want to dine the way Italians do in their home country, it’s important to understand that Italian cuisine follows very different rules than its Italian American counterpart. “The principle of Italian food is freshness. We like to keep recipes simple and want the customer to taste the ingredients, not have them camouflaged by heavy butter and cream,” explains Pietro Gallo , executive chef and co-owner of Civico 1845 in San Diego. Giuseppe Gaeta , executive chef of Cipriani Las Vegas, also points out the importance of fresh and local ingredients to Italian food. “W e grew up eating what the field would provide that season in addition to what you farmed, hunted and fished,” Gaeta said. “By utilizing fresh ingredients, the flavors are more intense. Everything has a purpose.” By contrast, Italian American food “ often amps up the garlic, sauce and cheese, plus the portions are much bigger!” said Fabio Pizzigoni , executive chef of Ambrogio15 in Phoenix. Fabio Viviani , a “Top Chef” alum and prolific restaurateur, noted that “many Americans still expect a plate of pasta to be smothered in sauce, whereas in Italy, the pasta itself is the star, and the sauce is just there to enhance the flavor of the pasta.” When visiting Italian restaurants in the United States, these Italian chefs agree that certain menu items either can’t fulfill their Italian origins or don’t exist in Italy at all (and therefore don’t play a role in authentic Italian cuisine). These seven dishes serve as prime examples. When we surveyed this group of Italian chefs for the Italian American dish that most violates their Italian ideas of “good food,” they overwhelmingly agreed on the consistently popular fettuccine Alfredo. “ For an Italian, fettuccine Alfredo is a big no in the rule book!” said Jacopo Falleni , owner of Nonna in Westlake Village, California. “In Italy, pasta dishes are all about keeping it simple and letting each ingredient shine. But Alfredo is loaded with cream and butter, which is way too heavy. It really misses the mark on what Italian pasta is all about, which is simplicity and elegance. And then there’s the chicken — total disaster! It’s like putting ketchup on risotto. Just ... why? I wish I could use a hand gesture to show how wrong it is!” While marinara sauce is an item you can find in Italy, our chefs warn that the Italian version of marinara bears little resemblance to the American spin. “ I consider myself to be an open-minded chef, but when I go out, I cannot stand to order American marinara sauce or even make it at home, as there is usually a unique sweetness with flavors of fake oregano and garlic peppered in,” Gentile admitted. “ Unlike American marinara sauce, normally a good tomato sauce [in Italy] is a bit sour.” These Italian chefs generally acknowledge that America has something to contribute to the pizza conversation (much to the relief of pizza snobs in New York, Chicago, New Haven and other pizza hot spots). But when it comes to “creative” toppings, the chefs find themselves no longer on board with the United States’ pizza innovations. “American pizzas have become too much, and some are too ‘out there,’ so I recommend sticking with simple ingredients,” Gaeta said. A specific American pizza topping that Italian chefs don’t appreciate is pineapple. “Pineapple doesn’t go on pizza. It’s a fruit that doesn’t match with Italian flavors. It’s too strong and the finish will cover most of the delicate flavors of the other ingredients,” said Matteo Venini , executive chef and co-owner of Stellina Pizzeria in Washington, D.C. He’s not entirely against fruit on pizza; Venini says that “at Stellina, we serve pizzas with figs or pears, which have a more balanced flavor profile, but not pineapple. I wouldn’t order pineapple on pizza at a different restaurant for the same reasons as above — it’s too sweet and overwhelms the other flavors.” It’s hard for many Americans to acknowledge that spaghetti and meatballs is frowned upon by actual Italian chefs. But Viviani said, “A n Americanized Italian dish I would steer clear from is spaghetti with meatballs. In Italy, meatballs, or “polpette,” are typically served on their own, perhaps with bread or a side salad, but never over spaghetti. The combination is distinctly American, catering to the desire for protein-packed, substantial meals. While it’s popular and can be comforting, it’s something I wouldn’t cook or order because it lacks the authenticity and the balance of flavors that traditional Italian cooking is all about.” According to Italian chefs, “Italian” restaurants in the U.S. really like to put chicken in places where it doesn’t belong. For example, you’ll never find chicken Parmesan at a restaurant in Italy; it’s an Americanized spin on “ Parmigiana di melanzane,” or eggplant Parmesan. Italian American restaurants also like to “add chicken to a pasta dish that already has many components,” said Stefano Carniato , chef and owner of Piola Restaurants in Miami. He explained that “for [Italians], a few fresh, local ingredients suffice.” “A pasta al pomodoro with fresh basil and tomato is sublime and doesn’t need anything else. Less is always more,” he added. Italian bread toasted in the oven after being slathered with butter, garlic and herbs is a staple of Italian American cuisine (and is the inspiration for Olive Garden’s famous breadsticks). But Contaldo says that “a s for garlic bread, this is stodgy and sickly and has absolutely nothing to do with delicate bruschetta, which is served in Italy with a light rubbing of garlic drizzled with extra virgin olive oil on slices of grilled rustic bread.” We’ve all seen “Italian” dressing in bottles at the supermarket and assumed it had some connection to dressings available in Italy. But Maria Liberati , author of “The Basic Art of Italian Cooking,” insists these oregano-packed bottled dressings bear no resemblance to dressings traditionally served on Italian salads. “In Italy, dressing for salads is usually just extra virgin olive oil and wine or balsamic vinegar,” she said.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost If you’re a meat eater shopping for dinner ingredients, heading to the butcher counter or refrigerated aisle at the grocery store is often the most convenient and affordable way to stock up on proteins. But according to professional butchers, the meat quality available in a grocery store or supermarket often falls below the standard that you’ll find at butcher shops that specialize in well-sourced animal products. “ The main difference between a butcher shop and a grocery store is the attention to detail that a butcher shop provides, beginning with prioritizing sourcing quality over the price,” said Mike Saperstein , co-owner of Sunshine Provisions in South Florida. As Saperstein suggests, buying meat from specialty butchers can be a pricey endeavor. However, James Peisker , co-founder of Porter Road, reminds us the higher price tags exist because “small butcher shops all over the country do a lot of extra work to seek out farms that take care of the land and the animals, which makes a better-for-you and better-tasting product.” Specialty butchers also have the skill set to cut meat more precisely than their grocery store counterparts. “The skilled tradespeople have worked hard to know and understand the different cuts,” Peisker said. “That knowledge and quality should be worth paying a little extra and supporting.” When we spoke with professional butchers, they generally acknowledged that most American shoppers will buy meat at the grocery store at some point, and that they can generally get satisfactory products that way. But for the following five meat cuts and meat-related items, butchers urge you to steer clear of the supermarket and visit a butcher shop instead. Because ground meats tend to be lower-cost than premium cuts and are usually used for dishes like burgers, meatloaf and meatballs (which involve other ingredients and toppings that obscure the meat’s flavor), we assumed that our experts would say it’s fine to purchase them at grocery stores. But butcher Luis Mata said, “G round meat products, particularly ground beef and chicken, are items I would avoid purchasing from grocery store butcher counters. The bulk of these products come pre-ground from large meat processing facilities, where the risk of contamination is significantly higher.” Mata tells us these contamination risks can cause foodborne illness and have, in some cases, “led to widespread recalls of products across vast geographic regions.” By purchasing ground beef and poultry from butchers, you can both “reduce the risk of contamination but also ensure freshness and quality,” Mata said. Specialty butchers source their meat from smaller vendors, so they know how the animals are raised, how the meat is processed, and exactly what goes into each ground blend. “ Grocery store ground beef typically arrives pre-ground directly from slaughterhouses, where a mixture of various cuts — and not necessarily the best ones — is used. This process can compromise the flavor and quality of the meat,” Mata said. He pointed out that quality butchers usually grind their own meat and use “trimmings of premium muscles.” “This method allows them to control the quality and fat content of the ground beef, ensuring a superior product,” he said. Grocery stores have been upping their game in the seafood department lately, with plenty of in-store butcher counters offering fish and shellfish that they advertise as “fresh.” But unless you’re buying from a grocery store that’s very close to a body of water, Rusty Bowers , owner and master butcher of Pine Street Market in Decatur, Georgia, warns that it’s worth questioning the “freshness” of grocery store seafood. “My general rule of thumb is that if you cannot do a quick 20-minute drive from the beach to that store, then buy your seafood from the freezer case” instead of the meat counter, Bowers said. He told us that, if visiting a dedicated fishmonger isn’t an option, frozen seafood is a better purchase because “most frozen seafood (as stated on the label) is processed and flash frozen on the boat to preserve its freshness shortly after being harvested from the sea.” “We have all walked past that land-locked grocery store fresh seafood case that smells like low tide on a hot day,” Bowers added. “Please be careful.” Aged beef is beloved among meat eaters for its tender texture and robust flavor. Artisanal butchers have used aging processes for centuries, and as conversations about beef aging move into the mainstream, we now see grocery stores trying to get in on the game. But according to Rich Silverman , head butcher of The Lambing Shed Farm Shop & Kitchen in Cheshire, England, supermarkets don’t have the time, equipment or setup to age their meats in a beneficial manner. “Local butchers have the time and space to dry-age the meat by hanging it on the bone as a full carcass. This is a far superior way of aging meat and gives a much more superior taste to the product. There is a lot less moisture in it, so it cooks better. This is a tried and tested method, done by butchers all over the world for centuries,” Silverman explained. Grocery stores, however, tend to age their beef using “wet aging.” Silverman describes this process as involving “meat [that’s] pre-cut in packaging and then aged in that packaging.” “So when you see a label saying ‘21-day-aged’ in the supermarket, it’s not done on the carcass, so it’s not dry,” he said. “It’s done so the moisture can’t escape, so when you are cooking it, the moisture will steam the meat from the inside, making it chewy.” Cuts of meat sold on-the-bone are a treat for flavorful braising, and the leftover bones can be used for homemade stock. However, Jerry Rempe , master butcher at Omaha Steaks, mentions that bone-in meat available in grocery store meat cases “tends to ‘sour’ more quickly than boneless products depending on the age of meats and how they’re stored.” The presence of the bone affects the meat’s pH, which can lead to “ a foul smell, slimy texture, and sometimes a change in color,” he said. “The sour smell often comes from the production of organic acids by the bacteria as they break down the proteins and fats in the meat.” Rempe told us meat can go bone sour “ due to the amount of air, enzymes and other compounds that affect it if the bone is in a region of the carcass that is not reached quickly and effectively by the refrigeration.” Because grocery store meat cuts typically aren’t flash-frozen, the clock begins to tick down on their freshness the moment they’re cut and packaged. Meat cases at supermarkets don’t have exact temperature precision, and packaged meat can sit there for more than a day, so the odds of bone sourness are higher than they’d be at a smaller craft butcher who replaces meat daily or at a larger operation that engages in flash-freezing. Some upscale grocery stores now carry liver, kidneys, sweetbreads and housemade pâté and terrine, which may seem like good news to those of us who love the richness and funk of organ meats. But Rosangela Teodoro , owner and butcher of Teodora’s Boucherie in Cohasset, Massachusetts, encourages shoppers to consider visiting a butcher who specializes in these tricky-to-prepare cuts. “ As a specialty gourmet butcher, I also have trained expertise in customization and trimming required for specific cuts of meat. I use specialized equipment and maintain the meats at a consistent temperature to prevent spoilage. [That’s why] I would never purchase p âté and terrine from a grocery store butcher, as they require specialized equipment and expertise to prepare properly,” Teodoro said. When it comes to organs, executive chef Jeanne Oleksiak of Herd Provisions Restaurant and Butcher Shop in Charleston, South Carolina, also points out that “they’re usually frozen [at grocery stores] and are not in high demand, so they spend a lot of time moving from freezer to freezer, especially if they’re on sale.” At an artisanal butcher shop, organs are more likely to be freshly sourced and stored in optimal conditions.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost When you have a few too many drinks, you might expect to wake up with a hangover and have nausea, a headache and extreme thirst. But you might not expect to experience these symptoms — along with flushed cheeks and a stuffy nose — after a single alcoholic beverage. It can happen, however, and it might signal that you’re developing an alcohol intolerance, which doctors say can arise seemingly out of nowhere. Even if you’ve never had a problem drinking a couple of glasses of wine or a martini or two, one day you might find that these drinks hit a little differently. “It comes up a fair amount,” Jeffrey Factor , an allergist-immunologist and fellow of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, told HuffPost. “In reality, an alcohol intolerance is different from an alcohol allergy. Alcohol intolerances are much more common than a true alcohol allergy.” Your symptoms could be triggered by the alcohol itself, or by other ingredients or chemicals found in alcoholic beverages, like wheat, barley, yeast or histamine, explained Rani Maskatia , an allergist-immunologist and medical director of Latitude Food Allergy Care. “This is even further complicated when you talk about cocktails, which can be mixed with anything,” said Trevor Craig , corporate director of technical training and consulting at Microbac Laboratories, an independent testing lab. If you start feeling unwell after drinking just a small amount of booze, you might want to get to the bottom of what’s going on. The only way to truly know is to see an allergist, Maskatia said. Here are some things to know about the difference between an alcohol allergy and an intolerance, why you might suddenly experience symptoms after drinking, and what to do about it. An alcohol allergy and an intolerance are sometimes confused, but they’re not the same, Factor said. With an alcohol allergy, your immune system reacts to something in an alcoholic beverage, like an ingredient, preservative or chemical, according to the Cleveland Clinic . The immune system then triggers cells to release immunoglobulin E antibodies to neutralize the allergen, and that causes allergic symptoms, according to the Mayo Clinic . Factor said true alcohol allergies are pretty rare. An intolerance, meanwhile, is any other type of reaction to alcohol that doesn’t involve the immune system, Factor explained. For instance, some people might not be able to metabolize alcohol properly. Intolerances can be genetic and are much more common than allergies, and may be more likely to affect people of East Asian descent , Factor said. What’s confusing about the two conditions is that their symptoms can overlap, Maskatia said. An alcohol allergy can cause a rash, swelling, vomiting and anaphylaxis in extreme cases. Flushing, nausea, vomiting, heart palpitations, headache, fatigue, stuffy nose and diarrhea are signs of intolerance, according to the Cleveland Clinic. “ So, you can’t look at a particular reaction and say, ‘Oh that’s definitely an allergy versus an intolerance to alcohol,’” Factor said. It can be tricky, Factor said. “There’s really no good testing available for allergy to alcohol.” Unlike other kinds of allergies, a skin test won’t specifically reveal an alcohol allergy, he explained. However, doctors will talk to you about your symptoms and when you experience them, Maskatia said. “A clinical history is usually sufficient for an allergist to distinguish between a suspected intolerance and a suspected IgE-mediated allergy.” A doctor might also do a blood or skin test, which can reveal allergies to substances in alcohol, such as yeast, barley, histamine, dairy or fruits, she explained. You can develop allergies to these substances at any age . It’s common for patients to come in describing symptoms or reactions to drinking alcohol that they only just developed, Factor said. It’s not clear why some people suddenly start experiencing these intolerances or allergies later in life. Some people may be predisposed because of the onset of other medical conditions, like asthma, sinus diseases, medication allergies or changes to the body’s immune response, he explained. Genetics and environmental exposures are another factor, Maskatia said. There’s also new research suggesting such changes could be COVID-related. In a small case study published in the journal Cureus in 2023, four patients with long COVID self-reported new alcohol sensitivities following their infections, with symptoms including headaches, grogginess, anxiety, mood changes, flushing and fatigue. Under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 , the Food and Drug Administration requires packaged foods to list allergens like milk, egg, wheat, fish, shellfish, nuts, soybeans and sesame. But Maskatia said this doesn’t apply to alcoholic beverages. That’s because the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, not the FDA, oversees alcohol , and it makes allergen labeling on booze voluntary , Craig said. So i t’s not always evident what’s in the alcohol you’re drinking. “It’s tricky since there isn’t a requirement for a label, so it’s not always easy to look at it and decipher,” Craig explained. “Plus, you might be ordering from a bar and not even have access to the bottle.” Still, if you know that consuming grapes triggers symptoms for you, staying away from wine is a good idea, and if wheat or barley cause you problems, beer is best avoided. “If you don’t know what’s in your drink and your allergy is serious, then skip it,” Craig said. There’s no treatment for alcohol allergy or intolerance, so Factor’s best advice is to avoid drinking it if you react to it. You can adopt a dry lifestyle or just avoid certain drinks that cause your symptoms. “The bottom line is this: There’s no treatment, no testing of any significant value, and the solution is really just to avoid that alcohol, or alcohol in general,” Factor said. “It’s not a very pleasing solution for a lot of people, but that’s what it is.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this article identified Craig’s employer as Microbac Technologies, a food-safety consultant brand. In fact, it is Microbac Laboratories, an independent testing lab.

    "article_content": "My vegetarian brother hovered over the stove, staring at a package of uncooked beef hot dogs that he graciously planned to cook for the rest of us, his omnivorous family (he was eating Beyond Brats). “What do I do with these?” he asked, and I chuckled to myself at his naiveté. But two days later, my meat-eating, hot-dog-loving friend asked me the same question, and I realized: Does no one actually know how to cook hot dogs? First of all, most processed hot dogs are precooked, so you won’t likely give anyone food poisoning if you serve them cold, straight from the fridge in all their slippery, rubbery glory. (Reheating them, however, does ensure that you’ll kill any listeria that could potentially be lurking.) But you shouldn’t do that. The ideal hot dog is heated up until it’s nice and plump on the inside and golden (or even charred) on the outside. However, if you ask someone about the best way to prepare a hot dog, you should get ready for a fight. Few people agree on whether you should grill them, pan-fry them, microwave them, roast them in the oven or boil them. You can even spiral-cut them or cook them up into creepy little octopuses . Food writers have tested every which-way in the name of science , but there’s still no consensus. However you want to cook your dog, there’s a simple technique for each method that you should master before cookout season approaches. Check them out below, ranked from our favorite to least favorite methods. This ensures a plump interior and a crispy exterior, and allows you to control the level of golden brown on the outside. Don’t let the word “frying” fool you ― there’s no oil involved. Put half an inch of water in a frying pan and let it come to a simmer on medium-high heat. Add the hot dogs to the pan, a few at a time, and pop a lid on the pan for about 2-3 minutes to let them steam. If the water boils off and the bottom of the pan is dry before the 2-3 minutes are up, just add some more water, a little at a time. After 2-3 minutes of steaming, remove the lid from the pan and let the water boil dry. Now roll the hot dogs around for a few minutes to get them browned on all sides. This’ll give you great char marks and a nice smoky flavor. Turn on your grill. You want one side of your grill to be hotter and one cooler. Start cooking the hot dogs on the cooler side of the grill (this prevents the outsides from burning too quickly). Cook them for one minute on each side. Move the hot dogs to the hot side of the grill until they reach the color you desire. This method is ideal if you’re making a big batch for a crowd. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Put hot dogs on a cookie sheet that’s been lined with foil (this makes cleanup super easy!) and cook for 15 minutes. They’ll sizzle and start to turn brown, so keep an eye on them until you get your desired outcome. The folks at Leite’s Culinaria have shared an essential hot dog microwaving trick that uses a paper towel. To microwave a better dog, just wrap it in a paper towel before nuking for 30 seconds at 80% power. Covering it with a paper towel holds in the steam ensuring a plump, juicy dog. Easy and delicious. Just don’t do it. As the folks at Nathan’s Famous say, “Honestly we just don’t recommend it. We didn’t back in 1916 when Nathan Handwerker started it all, and we still don’t today. When you boil a Nathan’s, all that special flavor rushes out into the water. And let’s be frank: who wants to eat a watered-down hot dog?” (But if you insist, you should bring your water to a rolling boil and cook the hot dogs for 5-6 minutes.)

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Nutrition experts caution against grocery shopping when you’re hungry, but that advice relates to making healthy food choices. It has little to do with a different, more polarizing issue: snacking in the supermarket. As some people wander the aisles, they might grab a small bag of pretzels and start munching. Or maybe they eat a handful or two of grapes, just to “test the ripeness,” of course. Some do it, and others find it unfathomable. But as long as you intend to pay for the food, snacking while grocery shopping is no biggie, right? Well, i t depends on who you ask. Shoppers on X (formerly known as Twitter) find the common practice “ wildly irritating ” and, based on their use of an “ Abbott Elementary” meme , cringe-inducing as well. Under a video that shows TikToker @cecilybauchmann handing a cashier an empty food container after eating in a store, commenters are divided. Some say it is “embarrassing” and “feels so illegal,” while others believe that it’s no problem if you eventually pay for them. But grocery store employees themselves are here to provide clarity on the practice. I’Talia McCarthy, the general manager of Dill Pickle Food Co-Op in Chicago, has worked in grocery stores since 2007. She says it’s acceptable to munch on nonweighted items (like a carton of Goldfish or a box of cookies) if you pay for them before you leave. That means you generally won’t get flak for cracking open a bottle of pop and enjoying it as you stroll through the bread aisle, she said. However, foods that interfere with other shoppers’ experience, such as those with strong smells or those that create a sticky, crumby mess for employees to deal with later, shouldn’t be consumed in the store, she added. From a legal standpoint, eating before you buy could be problematic. As private entities, grocery stores have the right to establish their own policies on consuming products prior to purchase, and if a store has a regulation against it, doing so could technically be considered theft, said C.L. Mike Schmidt , an attorney at Schmidt & Clark LLP. “Until you’ve paid for an item, it still belongs to the store. It’s akin to using someone’s property without their permission,” he explained. “While this might seem trivial when it comes to a few grapes or a bottle of soda, the principle remains the same.” That said, not all supermarkets have these policies or actively enforce them, Schmidt noted. The best rule of thumb is to pay for your low-profile food or drink before you enjoy it, said Mary Mullally, the interim general manager of Hunger Mountain Co-Op in Montpelier, Vermont. “You can get a ‘paid’ sticker from the cashier and continue to eat and shop — that’s totally fine,” she said. Just make sure to clean up after yourself and throw away any trash; don’t place your wrapper on a random shelf or hand it to an employee and expect them to toss it, she added. It’s particularly important to pay upfront for weighted goods, such as produce and bulk-bin items, according to the co-op employees. It’s all right to sample one strawberry or grape in the produce department to choose the best container for your taste buds, but wolfing down half of a package before you head to the checkout is a major no-no, McCarthy said. “We’ll have lots of people be like: ‘Oh, well, I ate half of this bag of grapes before I got to the registers. Can you charge me for that?’ And we’re like, ‘Well, how do you know you ate half?’” she said. “Our cashiers will try and find a nice medium for the customers because we still want them to come [back]. But for the most part, we’re just like: ‘Try one or two. Please don’t eat the whole bag.’” Revenue loss from these incidents may seem insignificant for large grocery chains. But consider the effect on your small, local co-ops. For these markets, the loss incurred from shoppers eating weighted foods before purchase will ultimately impact the business owners in your community, Mullally said. Not to mention that taste-testing from various produce bags — which other people may have also rifled through — is unsanitary, and fruits and veggies in the store are generally not washed and ready for consumption, McCarthy said. (It’s recommended to rinse fresh produce under running water to remove dirt, bacteria, garden pests and residual pesticides.) The bottom line? Do your grocery store employees a favor and pay for your mess-free, low-key snack before you start scarfing it down. And if you really want to try an item before purchase, whether it’s a new trail mix in the bulk department, an interesting jam or a unique cheese, don’t be afraid to ask an employee for a sample. “We’re really happy to open up a product for customers if they haven’t tried something, for example, as a way for them to test it out and see if they like it or not,” Mullally said. “And there’s no obligation on their part to buy it.” For more invaluable grocery store hacks and tips to save money while shopping, listen to HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast episode on grocery shopping .

    "article_content": "On Assignment for HuffPost In the ’90s, choosing a box of macaroni and cheese was simple: Kraft reigned supreme . It wasn’t the only brand on the market, but those blue boxes were synonymous with the neon-orange delight. Today, the macaroni and cheese landscape has vastly transformed. Options abound with well-known brands like Annie’s and Cabot Creamery going up against up-and-comers like Goodles. When it comes to choosing a boxed mac and cheese now, it can be a little overwhelming: Which one is both healthy and delicious? We spoke with experts to help figure that out. First things first: No matter how great a boxed macaroni and cheese may seem, it’s important to remember that it’s an ultra-processed product, said Cayla Bousaba , a registered dietitian in Richmond, Virginia. “We still use it,” she said. “My family is like, ‘Oh my gosh, we have to eat something.’ At least add some protein to it and hopefully some fiber. The reality is, sometimes life makes it hard to avoid the delicious, typically affordable product (like, say, you have kids or you lack energy to cook yourself a full meal) — but it’s all about balance.” One way to boost the nutritional profile of boxed mac and cheese is by adding veggies to it (spinach or frozen peas incorporate nicely) or swapping out the milk with plain yogurt (which also makes it creamier). Proteins like chicken or tuna also kick it up a notch. “The important part is looking at the bigger picture, and if you’re serving mac and cheese, you want to serve it with other nutrient-dense foods, like a side of fruit,” said Charleston-based dietitian Lauren Manaker . “We don’t just want to eat mac and cheese all day every day with nothing else.” Here are the brands registered dietitians and nutritionists prefer to keep in their cabinets. Pasta: wheat flour with chickpea protein Protein per 1 cup prepared: 15 grams Fiber per 1 cup prepared: 7 grams Aimee Gershberg, a clinical dietitian at NYC Health , opts for this brand, which was founded in 2021. “Goodles has additional protein because they use chickpea protein in their noodles. That also gives them some more fiber,” said Gershberg. “It’s going to keep you satiated. It’s going to prevent you from overeating.” She also appreciates that the noodles have nutrients extracted from different vegetables like broccoli, spinach, kale and pumpkin. “It would be great to get those nutrients from foods, but for someone that might be a picky eater, or with little kids where it’s hard to get these nutrients into them, this would be a great product,” Gershberg said. Pasta: chickpea Protein per 1 cup prepared: 16 grams Fiber per 1 cup prepared: 5 grams Gershberg also appreciates Banza, the brand known for its chickpea flour pasta. Not only does she like the texture of the pasta used in the macaroni and cheese, but it has other positive aspects, too. “I like that they have the protein and the fiber added in there. I think that’s something that’s missing from a lot of the different mac and cheeses,” Gershberg said. “Especially with prepackaged foods in general, it’s easy to miss out on some of those things.” Pasta: wheat Protein per 1 cup prepared: 12 grams Fiber per 1 cup prepared: 8 grams A mom to an 8-year-old, Manaker is no stranger to the various macaroni and cheese brands at the grocery store. While her daughter loves Annie’s, Manaker is a fan of fibrous GoodWheat , which makes its pasta with semolina flour produced from their specially grown breed of wheat , and she appreciates its protein content. “My daughter doesn’t eat a ton of meat, so that’s something that’s appealing to me. I also like that it has 8 grams of fiber and that fiber seems to hold her over, so she’s not asking for tons of snacks before bedtime,” Manaker told HuffPost. “She’s not eating the bean-based or the chickpea-based pasta as much as I would love her to. She just isn’t doing it. So this is a nice option that tastes very similar to the Kraft or the Annie’s with some extra nutrients that helps her feel more satisfied.” Pasta: brown rice Protein per 1 cup prepared: 9 grams Fiber per 1 cup prepared: 2 grams For those turned off by the texture of chickpea pasta but looking for a gluten-free option, Boubasa suggested Jovial. “I’ve just found that some kids don’t always like the chickpea pastas and it had a really good texture for gluten-free,” she said. “It’s not as gummy.” The cheese blend for Jovial is also pretty simple, Boubasa found, which bumped up its favor in her eyes. Pasta: wheat Protein per 1 cup prepared: 9 grams Fiber per 1 cup prepared: 3 grams As a single mom to three girls, in addition to being a registered dietitian, Malina Malkani knows a thing or two about the convenience of boxed macaroni and cheese. “My girls love the rich cheesy flavor of the white cheddar versions of Annie’s and I love that the brand offers whole-grain macaroni options with more fiber and protein to help keep them satisfied and energized for longer,” Malkani told HuffPost. When she serves Annie’s, it’s usually not the only thing on the table, however. “Sometimes I prepare it as a side for dinner and pair it with baked chicken and a vegetable, or I’ll add peas and carrots and send it to school in a packed lunch,” Malkani added. Pasta: wheat Protein per 1 cup prepared: 9 grams Fiber per 1 cup prepared: 2 grams Are you surprised to see Kraft on a list of dietitian-approved macaroni and cheeses? As Gershberg points out, most of the “healthier” macaroni and cheese brands are pricier, which is why she wants people to know that if Kraft is the best box within reach, that’s totally fine. “There’s nothing wrong with Kraft or your basic mac and cheese. It’s not so much taking away those types of things, but maybe looking at what we can add to those. So if we can add some protein, if we can add some fiber with vegetables or another protein or something, then anything can be part of a well-balanced diet,” she said.

    "article_content": "On Assignment for HuffPost Kitchens are inherently smelly areas. Whether in the midst of cooking, preparing to empty out the fridge, or simply getting ready to clean up after having made dinner, you are likely smelling something in your kitchen. Given all that, it’s important to note when a smell should be cause for concern. We spoke to experts about which odors could indicate that your food isn’t safe to eat, which ones can signal that the safety of your home is in danger, and which mean it might be time for an appliance upgrade. And even better, we got tips on how to eliminate those odors. When dealing with leftovers, or even fresh produce or meat products, one rule tops them all: If it smells bad, throw it out. When it comes to cheeses, though, a food that’s inherently smelly, the guidelines aren’t as straightforward. According to chef Kevin Ashton , the culinary adviser at Restaurantji, there are three ways to determine whether cheese has gone bad: the presence of abnormal mold, a change in color, or a strong smell. He notes that identifying a bad smell is the best way to determine whether cheese is safe for consumption. “If a mild cheese such as American or Jack smells strong like Limburger or blue cheese, you should throw it away,” Ashton explained. “Naturally pungent cheeses like Camembert will have a relatively strong ammonia smell when they go bad.” Overall, Ashton says, if you are familiar with the scent of a specific cheese and the one you have smells “like a more concentrated version of what you’re used to,” then you should avoid eating it. But why, exactly? Well ... “Spoiled cheese can harbor different types of foodborne bacteria, each of which can cause specific illnesses,” Ashton explained, specifically mentioning salmonella, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Each bacteria may lead to different issues. Salmonella infections, for example, are “characterized by abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea and fever,” he said. These symptoms aren’t immediate but can take between six hours and six days to show up. They may last up to a week. “Escherichia coli can cause various forms of gastroenteritis, including hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS),” Ashton added. Symptoms of such illnesses include bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps and vomiting. In extreme cases, they may lead to kidney failure. Ashton says young children and older people are most at risk when it comes to E. coli. Pregnant women, newborns and the immunocompromised, on the other hand, are the category of people susceptible to listeriosis, which is caused by Listeria monocytogenes. “Symptoms include nausea, muscle aches, fever and diarrhea,” Ashton said. All things we’d rather avoid! According to energy company ConEdison , if you smell an odor that is similar to rotten eggs or gas in your home, you should leave and call the authorities — particularly if you have a gas stove or oven in your kitchen. “The reason for quick action is the possibility of a gas leak, which is always dangerous and can be life-threatening,” said Hendrik Van De Poll , co-owner of Service Force Plumbing in Rockville, Maryland. Keep in mind, though, that if you smell gas but your stove’s burner is on, the odor might actually be nothing to worry about, especially if it seems to be fading away. Usually, the presence of a flame indicates that the gas is being burned. However, the smell could suggest a potential leak in the system. ConEdison advises turning off the burner, ventilating the area, checking for leaks and, of course, calling a professional no matter what. There might be other culprits behind the odor as well. “Another more innocuous reason for a rotten egg smell is sometimes the anode rod in your water heater reacting with the water from incoming city or well water connection,” Van De Poll said. If that’s the case, he suggests replacing the standard anode rod with an aluminum-zinc one that “does not have the same type of reactivity.” Sometimes, the unpleasant food-like odor may not emanate from your fridge but your kitchen drain. This usually happens as a result of a buildup of food particles, grease and other debris . “Food particles that accumulate in the kitchen drain will eventually turn into a clog if not addressed promptly,” explained Justin Cornforth , owner of Ace Plumbing in Anderson, South Carolina. “The smells coming from the kitchen drain indicate that it’s time to do thorough drain cleaning, which typically involves using an enzymatic drain cleaner. Enzymatic drain cleaner are effective and safe for pipes compared to off-the-shelf cleaners that contain harsh chemicals.” If you avoid using chemicals and enzymatic cleaners in your kitchen, you can pour some vinegar and baking soda into the drain, let it sit for a few minutes or even overnight, and then follow it with a pan of boiled water, Cornforth outlined. The process may work well as a preventive measure, dissolving minor clogs and buildup on the walls of a drain, so you might want to go through the process once a week. That said, Cornforth warned that bigger clogs might require more than the vinegar and baking soda mixture. If you just can’t seem to get rid of the odor, you might want to consider removing the drain completely and replacing it with a new one. “If the odors are caused by severe clogs or extensive buildup, cleaning products won’t help because they cannot penetrate or dissolve the thick layers of accumulated debris and decaying organic matter,” Cornforth said. He warns against trying your hand at the installation yourself, though. It’s best to reach out to a professional before doing anything. The more you leave an unpleasant odor unattended, the harder it will be to find the source and get rid of it. Cesar Fernandez , the culinary manager at Miele Great Britain, has a few tips to keep in mind. When dealing with food-adjacent stenches — whether post-cooking or related to cheese gone bad, for example — it’s important to note that neutral odors can overtake stronger ones. “So, if you’ve finished cooking and you want to get rid of the smell, simple actions such as boiling water with some lemon or white wine vinegar or freshly brewing coffee will remove any other smells,” he said. Lemon is your friend even when trying to clean out an actually smelly kitchen device or product. “If you’ve used your microwave and there was a little accident with food splattering all over or even leaving a lingering smell if food had a strong smell, the only thing that you need to do is to place half a lemon with a little water in a bowl and microwave on a high setting for a few minutes,” Fernandez said. “Then, leave the door closed for at least 10 minutes, and afterward your microwave will smell like new all over again.” Overall, though, Fernandez says, the most reliable way to avoid a smelly kitchen is the use of a proper cooker hood. “It’s very important that the ducting is the right one when maximizing for efficiency,” he said.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Julia Child famously said, “People who love to eat are always the best people.” And studies show that Americans really love to eat pasta. We consume almost 6 billion pounds of pasta per year, proving that a heaping bowl of noodles is one of life’s great pleasures. The shapes, sizes and sauce combinations are endless, from spaghetti to rigatoni to cavatelli. But are some shapes better than others? We interviewed Italian chefs nationwide on what you should and shouldn’t order when pasta cravings come calling. Arguably the world’s most popular pasta shape, there’s a reason it’s a carb lover’s go-to. “Spaghetti is definitely the best to order at a restaurant because it is a world-renowned shape. Many restaurants make their spaghetti in-house because of how iconic the shape is, making it very high quality,” said Nadia Caterina Munno , a chef and author known as The Pasta Queen . It’s also incredibly hard to mess up when cooking. “I usually order a longer noodle pasta like spaghetti. They’re usually more difficult to overcook, and generally, there’s a little more sauce to work with,” said Craig Richards , chef and owner of Lyla Lila in Atlanta, Georgia. This northern Italian egg pasta is known for its long ribbon-like strands. Folklore says a chef created it to honor the golden locks of his soon-to-be-wife. Although history has since debunked that romantic tale, the pasta shape remains incredibly popular paired with meaty sauces like bolognese. “Anything labeled tagliatelle will denote a hand-cut noodle. It is a great way of gauging a restaurant’s noodle quality and is generally worth the price tag because of all the labor and love that goes into it,” said Natalie Gullish , culinary director for the Sesame Collective in Portland, Oregon. Ancient grains take on a new meaning with paccheri. This large tube-shaped pasta can be traced back to early Neapolitan times when it was considered peasant food. “It holds a nice fresh tomato or bolognese beautifully, and the al dente bite is amazing and easy to execute,” said Joey Maggiore , executive chef of The Maggiore Group in Scottsdale, Arizona. Gianluca Gugliemi , executive chef of Donato & Co . in Berkley, California, echoes why paccheri is so beloved. “ I believe those cuts of pasta are very hard to overcook, so you will get your pasta al dente like the Italians prefer,” he explained. This relatively new pasta shape was invented sometime between World War I and II. Its name comes from its shape, which resembles a radiator. This small, rippled pasta is a sauce magnet and ideal for a fresh summer pasta salad. “Radiatori is my favorite and arguably the most versatile,” said Michael Kramer , the chef/owner Jianna in Greenville, South Carolina. “It can work well with light sauces like for vegetables or seafood but also works well with heavy meatier sauces like a short rib ragu or a bolognese.” Believed to be one of Southern Italy’s oldest pasta shapes, cavatelli means “little hollows.” Take one look at its small caved-in shape, and you’ll understand why. When you see it on a menu, there’s one big reason chefs say you should order it. “This pasta can only typically be made fresh, so you know it’s house-made,” said David Gross , executive chef at Panzano in Denver, Colorado. “The pasta dough contains ricotta cheese and can be made with different flours to keep it adventurous. Soft in texture, this pasta can go with many different sauces.” Meaning “little spindle” in Italian, this beloved Southern Italian shape is made from spaghetti strands rolled around a wire to dry. “Fusilli is a great pasta shape because its unique texture allows the sauce to coat it evenly, making every bite enjoyable and delicious,” said Barbara Pollastrini , executive chef of Restaurant Da Barbara in Los Angeles, California. Ideal in soups, pasta salad or with a creamy, buttery sauce, its adaptability is another reason it’s a go-to in Italian restaurants around the world. This legendary pasta shape traces its origins back to a small town near Bologna in the 1500s. Legend says it was created after an innkeeper spied on weary mythical guests Zeus and Venus, he shaped this pasta after Venus’ navel. It is the only stuffed pasta to make the list; chefs recommend it for a very specific reason. “I think the notion of stuffed pasta can be such a blank canvas for creativity,” said Dane Baldwin , the chef/owner of The Diplomat in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. “The tortellini can be such a great vehicle for the sauce or broth, getting caught in the crevices of the pasta shape, and when paired with a harmonizing filling, wow, that is true synergy.” Also known as angel hair, this is a much thinner and more delicate form of spaghetti. But for diners, it’s almost always a letdown. Difficult to perfect in a busy kitchen, it’s often found to be overcooked and clumpy. “ Cappellini is used only in soup in Italy due to it being an extremely thin and delicate pasta,” said Marcellino Verzino , chef and co-owner of Marcellino Ristorante in Scottsdale, Arizona. “Because of this, when served with any type of sauce, the pasta can “glue” together, and it is impossible to keep its identity.” Often seen gracing the kids’ menus or accompanied by an a la vodka sauce, its inclusion on the list of worst pasta shapes to order may surprise you, but chefs agree: It doesn’t hold sauce or its shape well. “This tubal-shaped noodle can often collapse for many different reasons, such as over-hydrated dough or not a long enough dry time,” Gullish said. This Northern Italian pasta is actually made from potatoes. While it’s meant to be light and pillowy, it’s often served to diners thick and starchy, resulting in an extremely filling bowl of pasta. “ While the ingredients are simple (flour, potato and egg), gnocchi is a challenge to make well and is often bought ready in a bag,” Gugliemi said. “Unfortunately, if not made fresh or with a skilled hand, gnocchi can be gluey and unpleasant to eat.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "soulful vegan author/advocate Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. You’ve heard it, I’ve heard it, my stomach’s heard it, too. But my stomach doesn’t care, and I’m not alone. According to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, a quarter of Americans skip breakfast . So what are we doing to ourselves? Well, it depends on whom you ask. According to Dr. Emily Cooper of Cooper Center for Metabolism, you aren’t doing yourself any favors by skipping breakfast. “When people skip breakfast, a good percent will start disruption in insulin secretion,” Cooper said. In other words, low blood sugar, which can cause fatigue, brain fog and “exaggerated emotional response,” also known as a crappy mood. Having a meltdown? Maybe you just need a smoothie, according to Cooper’s thinking. People have many reasons for skipping breakfast — they’re rushing to get out the door in the morning, they don’t have reliable food access or maybe, like me, their circadian rhythm is such that their ghrelin — that’s the hunger hormone — doesn’t kick in till later. Cooper doesn’t care. Skipping breakfast is a deal-breaker for her patients. She practices what she preaches. She’d already had “two pieces of good local bakery sourdough whole grain toast with tahini and apricot jam” and was enjoying a bowl of raisins before 7 a.m. when I spoke to her. That’s complex carbs, protein, iron and healthy fats. But not every breakfast choice wears that kind of halo. Sugary cereal and processed meats, for example, deliver calories but few nutrients. Even so, Cooper says bad breakfast beats no breakfast. “If you don’t get enough to eat early in the day, ghrelin levels rise later. Your body is trying to make up for all the stuff you’ve missed,” she explained. You’re hungry, even hangry, which can lead to making poor choices. You’re liable to grab something that gives you the immediate lift you need, maybe an iced Frappucino, extra whip. So here you are mid-morning, loaded with calories, fizzing with caffeine and sugar, but without enough nutrients to sustain you. You’re a hot mess for your 3 p.m. Teams meeting. Keep that roller-coaster pattern up, and, studies indicate, including one from Cleveland Clinic, you’re looking at potential weight gain and diabesity — obesity-caused diabetes. That morning toast sounding better to you? Dr. Jonathan Rosand has seen those studies, too. As co-founder of Massachusetts General’s McCance Brain Care Center and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, it’s his business to understand factors that may lead to depression, stroke and dementia. Does skipping breakfast make the list? When I spoke to Rosand, he had eaten his oats this morning but said it’s OK that I hadn’t. He said, “I don’t know. There’s not a lot of evidence” between missing breakfast and cognition. In other words, skipping breakfast won’t make me stupid. Unlike Cooper, he focuses not on the when but the what: “Getting more stuff that’s good for you — a diet rich in vegetables and leafy greens,” as well as other foods linked to brain health, including fatty fish, berries and walnuts, which are rich in omega-3s and — caffeine fans, rejoice! — coffee and tea. Check in with yourself, Rosand advises. “How do you feel? Are you cloudy? Clear?” If you’re feeling fine, don’t worry. But Rosand suggests that breakfast isn’t a bad idea for children, teens and anyone with health issues. Science backs him up on this . The American Academy of Pediatrics has found that kids who eat breakfast typically learn better at school, have fewer behavior issues and buck the teen obesity trend by maintaining a healthy weight. Despite that, many of Yasi Ansari’s younger patients regularly skip breakfast. For Ansari, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Los Angeles, it’s a concern. “The problem with not getting our needs met, especially in the adolescent years, is that it can lead to unhealthy eating habits, unhealthy relationships with food,” she said. “Not getting their needs met during this time period can also put individuals at risk of stunting their growth and not being able to perform their best in the classroom or out on the field.” But, she admitted, the data is inconclusive. When working with patients, she considers other factors: “ Are they meeting enough of their nutrition needs throughout the rest of the day? Do they make time for movement in their day? Are they getting enough sleep? Is there a work-life balance? What do foods at lunch and dinner look like?” Ansari advises eating “ at regular intervals,” but just as important is to “listen to what your body needs.” Rosand agrees. “L istening to your appetite — that’s helpful,” he said. “Much of what you’re inclined to do for your body is probably OK.” And now the big IF is intermittent fasting . This eating trend du jour indicates fasting, skipping meals or stretching out the time between them forces your body to work more efficiently, so you’re running on ketones and fatty acids for energy, not glucose (sugar). Most people choose to stop eating around 8 p.m. and not eat again until noon the following day, meaning they skip breakfast. Intermittent fasting isn’t proven for weight loss, but studies like one in the New England Journal of Medicine show it can benefit the body. It decreases the risk of major diseases, including diabetes, reduces inflammation, and potentially leads to living healthier and longer. Does skipping breakfast mean you’re in the ketone-burning club? Quite possibly. And it’s the most common way to practice intermittent fasting. Just don’t tell Cooper. “I’ve never been a fan. All these kinds of trends people get into — nothing good comes of it. It doesn’t make metabolic sense.” If you’re a member of the breakfast-skipping tribe, you’re in good company. St. Thomas Aquinas wasn’t a morning meal fan either. He believed breakfast led to gluttony, one of your seven deadly sins, and was immoral. Pete Wells , the New York Times restaurant critic, doesn’t think breakfast is immoral, but he just doesn’t eat it. Stands to reason. He tastes food — a lot of it — for a living. It’s not what he wants to do on his time off. If you’re expecting a lecture from nutrition and public health expert Marion Nestle , guess again. Nestle doesn’t do breakfast, either. “I prefer eating when I’m hungry, and I rarely get hungry before 10:30 or later,” she said. As for all those studies talking about breakfast being the most important meal of the day, Nestle advises reading the fine print. Who’s funding the study? Money for The International Breakfast Research Initiative, an exhaustive database of breakfast patterns and outcomes, came from Cereal Partners Worldwide in the U.S. and Canada by General Mills. To eat breakfast or not to eat breakfast? “O ne of the challenges when counseling people on a diet is our all-or-nothing culture,” Rosand said. “That’s not how we live.” Do you want to start eating breakfast? Great! “Make small changes over the course of weeks, months,” Rosand added. “Look for ways to improve.” Still not sold on the benefits of breakfast? That’s fine, too. “The goal is to feel comfortable, take better care of ourselves,” Rosand said. “Let’s give ourselves a break.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost If there was an “it girl” food of the summer, this year, a Caesar salad, a side of fries and a dry martini would easily secure the spot. As one viral meme about the restaurant order goes, “Are you depressed or do you just really need a dry martini, a Caesar salad and a side order of fries?” Sometimes, people sub in a diet or regular Coke, but the salty, umami-laden Caesar, and the carby goodness of the fries are always the anchor of the meal. “The new live laugh love just dropped,” Vox writer Rebecca Jennings joked of the meme last week on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. new live laugh love just dropped pic.twitter.com/56CuqErubT On TikTok , a search for “Caesar salad and fries” yields more than 60.3 million posts with people ― mostly young women ― singing the praises of the “elite” meal: “The feminine urge to get a Caesar salad with a side of fries,” one women says while she eats in a clip that has over one million views . “I need an espresso martini, Caesar salad, truffle fries, and a forehead kiss with $10k and some peonies on the side. Nothing too crazy,” another woman joked on X . Why are we all collectively yearning for this relatively basic restaurant order? To some extent, it’s a continuation of Girl Dinner , the trend from last year in which women cobbled together a few items ― a little wedge of parmesan reggiano, some olives, some chips and salsa leftover from your last Trader Joe’s run ― and calling it a meal. (As some noted, some version of “Girl Dinner” has existed in other cultures ― tapas, mezze and banchan ― for centuries.) men will never understand the chicken caesar salad, diet coke and french fries combo Like Girl Dinner, this trend is weirdly gendered . Old stereotypes die hard and salad is traditionally associated with women in the same way a good steak is associated with dudes. Though fun fact: In the post-war 1940s, there was a moment where salad-making was considered quite masculine , at least by some food writers. “A good salad maker must have meticulousness, patience, cleanliness and a very alert sense of touch and taste,” Mario Thomas, Playboy magazine’s food and drink editor, wrote in his column around that time. “For some reason, it takes a man to master this really fine art.” Also like Girl Dinner, the Caesar/cocktail/fries meal has cost-effectiveness going for it: Generally speaking, it’s cheaper to buy a side salad and side fry versus an entree. “I don’t want to spend $30 or $40 on a main I might not like and likely won’t fill me up,” said Emily Lycopolus , an olive oil sommelier and cookbook author. “If I’m out with a few girls, we’ll often order a few different salads (iceberg wedge, Caesar, Cobb), then share the fries, and then share a dessert,” she said. “We all get what we want, and the night can linger on.” Caitlin PenzeyMoog , the author of the book “ On Spice: Advice, Wisdom, and History with a Grain of Saltiness,” thinks people gravitate to the Big Three because the order is hard to screw up, even at mid-tier restaurants. “I’m talking about the mediocre gastropub restaurants that are ubiquitous,” she said. “The ones where you can always get a table, where maybe there’s a nice outdoor patio, where it’s not amazing but not terrible, and its main draw is convenience.” Restaurants like that may struggle to cook your burger medium rare, but they can generally throw french fries in a deep fryer and whip up a decent Caesar dressing, PenzeyMoog said. And obviously, there’s the flavor profile: This “meal” packs so many outsized flavors and textures, it puts in work to be your favorite order: the brininess of the martini’s olives, the umami and tanginess of the anchovy-forward Caesar dressing, the fattiness of the fries, the crunch of the croutons ― it’s got it all. “The dressing is assertive so the salad feels like a main component of the meal rather than an afterthought, the fries dipped in some of that dressing is what dreams are made of,” said Laura Vitale , a cookbook author and host of the YouTube channel “Laura in the Kitchen. ” “Plus, I don’t leave the table feeling overly stuffed, I always feel satisfied and the flavors always hit the spot,” Vitale said. I love having a caesar salad and fries because it is objectively so unhealthy but i’m like wellllll there’s lettuce… it’s literally a salad umm health goddess!!! The dryness of the martini pairs perfectly with this meal because it cuts through the fat of the salad dressing and the fries, said Skyler Mapes, the co-founder of EXAU Olive Oil and author of “ The Olive Oil Enthusiast.” “Gin also often has very earthy, peppery or even nutty flavors which pair perfectly with freshly grated parmigiano reggiano in the salad,” she told HuffPost. In short, it’s the epitome of balance . Though she’ll never quit Caesars, Mapes has a similar meal she loves eating come summer: grilled eggplant (her southern Italian mother-in-law’s recipe), fresh whole Italian anchovies from a tin with fresh bread and butter, and an extra dirty martini with extra olives. “It’s so good for summer because everything can be eaten at room temperature and picnic style if you want to share,” she said. If you’re looking to get adventurous, you could also do a tahini Caesar salad, said Edy Massih , a chef and owner of Edy’s Grocer in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and the author of “ Keep It Zesty: A Celebration of Lebanese Flavors & Culture from Edy’s Grocer.” “I’d do that with Aleppo sesame breadcrumbs, which adds a bit of spice and bigger flavor to an already perfect salad dish,” he told HuffPost. “I always pair it with some mezze dips and pita, and of course a martini, my go-to drink in any and all situations.” If you’re more of a whiskey person than a gin or vodka martini girlie, Lycopolus recommends subbing the Caesar for a wedge. “I love blue cheese, so I often go for a blue cheese wedge, yam fries and an old-fashioned,” she said. “Bourbon, the sweetness of yam fries, salty bacon and tangy blue cheese are so good together.” If she’s at a good Italian restaurant, Lycopolus said she’ll do a burrata or caprese salad, some Carpaccio (the meat dish usually has enough arugula on it to pretend it’s a second salad) and a Manhattan. “The complexity of the sweet and dry vermouth is the perfect balance to creamy cheese, sweetly acidic tomato, salty parmesan, melt-in-your-mouth beef, bitter arugula, and that squeeze of lemon,” Lycopolus said. “I’d top both dishes with a healthy drizzle of beautifully fragrant olive oil, like a Tuscan Frantoio or Andalusian Picual,” she added. But of course, you could always keep it classic and just order a side of fries, a vodka martini and a Caesar. And you have extra reason to do so this summer: The humble Caesar salad ― invented on a whim in the 1920s by an Italian chef in Tijuana, Mexico ― celebrates its centennial this upcoming July 4 .

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Nothing quite ruins a nice night out like a meal where you have to shout to talk to your dinner mate. And as it turns out, there’s scientific proof that loud noises aren’t just drowning out your conversations — they may also be influencing your meal choices. “There’s not a very high level of awareness and education about what comprises a dangerous sound environment,” said Gregory Scott, founder of SoundPrint , a smartphone application that allows users to measure and track decibel levels (dBA) in public places. Dealing with hearing loss, Scott created the app after his own frustration of not being able to have conversations with people in public spaces. People have “never been exposed to sound level guidelines or they misunderstand them,” Scott noted. While he is not a health professional or researcher, SoundPrint data provides a snapshot of U.S. restaurants and other public spaces, including cafes and movie theaters. From the data collected in 2023, SoundPrint found that 63% of restaurants were too loud for conversation. SoundPrint categorizes the sound levels of public spaces in four categories: quiet (under 70 dBA), moderate (71-75 dBA), loud (76-80 dBA) and very loud (over 81 dBA), which means that a majority of restaurants tested with the app were categorized as loud or very loud. Loud noise can have a deleterious impact on people’s hearing. The National Council on Aging reports 70 dB is the threshold for healthy sounds; below 70 dB is safe, over 70 dB can be harmful. 60 dB is a normal conversation and 120 dB is an emergency vehicle or saw mill. Researchers point to recent changes in restaurant architecture, where sound-softening curtains and fabrics are replaced with bare wood and walls that amplify sound. These loud restaurants and public spaces may cause long-term hearing loss for both customers and restaurant staff. But that’s not all. Researchers over the past few decades have been studying the impact of sound — everything from music type, loudness and tempo — on food. “What we hear has a much bigger impact on our eating and drinking behavior than any of us realize,” said Dr. Charles Spence , head of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at Oxford University and pioneer of the field of gastrophysics, a growing area of interdisciplinary research that looks at physics and chemistry of food and cooking. “In some sense, [we are] being manipulated without our awareness,” Spence said. Studies have suggested that people tend to drink more in louder environments than less noisy ones. People drink more in a shorter period of time and increase table turnover, both of which can increase profits overall. That can have an impact on people’s health since people may consume more than they need. Similar studies with rats have shown comparable results. “If it’s very loud, it’s almost the opposite of mindful eating,” explained Dr. Qian Janice Wang , associate professor of consumer psychology at the University of Copenhagen. The louder music may distract people from how full they are feeling and cause them to consume more than they need or intended to consume. Overeating may be a way of dealing with the awkwardness of not being able to talk to your companion, Wang explained. Another possibility is that the louder noise may result in shorter decision-making and may result in folks choosing unhealthier options, explained Dr. Anna Brytek-Matera , professor of medical and health sciences at the University of Wroclaw, Poland. But that’s only one part of the sound and food story. Further research has suggested that people may experience tastes differently based on the pitch of the sound. Spence noted the experiment where people try dark chocolate while listening to both high- and low-pitched music. With the higher pitches, people experienced the chocolate as sweeter; with lower pitches, the chocolate tasted more bitter. Findings like this could potentially influence people’s health; they could perceive something is sweeter with a high-pitched sound without having higher sugar content. Spence called the impact of sound on food taste “sonic seasoning.” That’s only a tip of the proverbial iceberg (lettuce). Other studies have shown other ways sound changes our perception of food, such as loud noises enhancing umami while decreasing other tastes , or that the type of music can impact the enjoyment of wine . Brytek-Matera also cited a study where people who listen to nature sounds were more likely to choose healthier foods over unhealthy ones. But sound may not be the only factor. One’s mood may also impact taste perception as well as individual preferences. Some people want noisier environments; Scott noted that some people used the SoundPrint app to find places that were noisy. Other senses besides taste and sound can also influence the meal, from the color of the plating, the feel of the food, as well as the smell. But there’s also room for more research in the field, such as looking at individual preferences, cultural and national differences. Brytek-Matera noted that there are some contradictions between studies that require further investigation as well. While some people may not realize the influence of sound has on food, some chefs are paying attention. High-end restaurants have been integrating soundscapes with their food for a while now. For instance, Federico Rottigni’s Milan-based restaurant Sensorium has a tasting menu with a soundscape synchronized for the entire meal with music ranging from Icelandic rock, opera, nature noises and more. Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck restaurant in the U.K. served a dish called “The Sound of the Sea” where patrons were served a seafood dish along with a conch shell containing an iPod and headphones that play the sounds of the sea. Some high-end restaurants have gone the other extreme and are not playing any music, letting the food speak for itself. What can customers do to have a better night out? Consider using apps like SoundPrint to find quieter places or feel empowered to say something to management, who may not even know there is an issue, Scott said. He noted that the percentage of restaurants that were too loud did drop during the pandemic, from 67% in 2019 to 63% in 2023, but that’s still a majority of restaurants tracked on the app. Other options include going to restaurants during off-peak hours or asking for a table that’s shielded from the noise, Spence suggested. Wang recommended figuring out what you want beforehand and/or setting a limit in terms of beverages consumed, which is probably a good strategy regardless of the sound environment. But it’s also OK to enjoy some level of noise. People’s expectations about an eating facility are also important. “If it’s a fine dining restaurant, there’s probably expectations around what you’re going to hear in terms,” Steve Keller , sonic strategy director at SiriusXM, said. “If it’s a bar environment, you have the expectation that you’re going to hear louder conversations. That’s part of the ambience that you actually like, and that’s OK too.” But like everything related to food, the old saying goes — everything in moderation. Sound, too.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost ADHD aside, sometimes concentrating long enough to finish a work or school task feels impossible. You sit down at your computer with the best of intentions only to end up toggling between 10 different tabs because your focus is anywhere except on the task at hand. Anxiety, depression, not getting enough sleep and boredom can all cause trouble concentrating. But diet can also play a role. When it comes to this connection, registered dietitian Yaa Boakye told HuffPost, “It’s important to remember that individuals have different reactions to food and could be dealing with underlying health conditions.” With that disclaimer in place, there are some foods and drinks that scientific research shows can really mess with your concentration. Here, doctors and dietitians reveal the biggest culprits. If you have a big muffin or slice of toasted white bread for breakfast, you aren’t exactly starting the day with brain food. Neurologist Dr. Arif Dalvi shared that simple carbs — like the aforementioned examples — can lead to a blood sugar spike, which in turn can cause trouble concentrating. Boakye agreed, explaining that when blood sugar is too high or too low, it can cause trouble concentrating, and simple carbs can jump-start this unfortunate roller coaster. Boakye explained that while glucose — a type of carbohydrate — provides energy to brain cells , when glucose is absorbed in the bloodstream quickly (which is what happens when you eat foods like pastries and white bread) it creates a blood sugar imbalance. Scientific research shows that a side effect of this imbalance is … yep, trouble concentrating. Here’s the good news: Boakye says you can still enjoy pastries and bread without worrying if they’re going to get in the way of your productivity as long as you pair them with a healthy fat and protein source. “Healthy fats and proteins mitigate the extreme effects simple carbohydrates can have on blood sugar,” she said. So pair your pastry or toast with some avocado and smoked salmon and you’ll be good to go. Blood sugar levels aren’t the only thing that can cause trouble concentrating. Dalvi shared that salty foods can, too. That means if you have instant soup, french fries, potato chips, or a sandwich with cold cuts for lunch, you might struggle to power through the afternoon. Foods high in salt “can trigger an electrolyte imbalance,” he explained. When this happens, it causes inflammation in the brain , which can interfere with short-term memory and concentration. To avoid this from happening, stick to consuming less than 3,400 milligrams of sodium a day and remember it can creep up in surprising places , like salad dressings, condiments and processed cheese. Some people reach for a can of soda for a jolt of energy, but the doctors and dietitians we spoke to all said this is one drink that’s bound to backfire in the concentration department. That is because it impacts the brain similarly to eating pastries, white bread and other simple carbs. “Sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and juice can cause rapid increases in blood sugar, followed by a decline in blood sugar. So while these drinks initially flood the brain with glucose, which theoretically would aid in concentration, the subsequent sugar crash negates this brief benefit and actually makes it harder for us to maintain focused concentration,” said registered dietitian Claire Rifkin . If you want what you’re sipping on to work for you and not against you in the brainpower department, Dalvi says not to overlook regular old H2O. Fun fact: Water accounts for 75% of brain mass . “When you’re dehydrated, you’re disrupting the electrolyte balance in the body as a whole, including within brain neurons, so not staying well-hydrated can certainly affect your concentration,” Dalvi said. Even being just 2% dehydrated can negatively impact brain function . To keep your concentration up, aim to drink between 11.5 and 15.5 cups a day , depending on your gender and activity levels. Coffee is another drink many people turn to — even depend on — for brainpower, but Dalvi and Boakye both say that too much can make concentrating worse. “There’s certainly a U-shaped curve with coffee. If you drink a little bit, it can make you more alert, but if you keep drinking more and more of it, the benefits fade,” Dalvi said, noting this is because too much caffeine can make someone feel jittery or anxious. Boakye said it’s important to remember that caffeine affects people differently. For some people, even a small amount of coffee can cause them to become jittery, which can then cause them to have trouble concentrating. If you’re eating anything that’s causing you to experience gastrointestinal issues, all the doctors and dietitians interviewed said that is bound to mess with your concentration. After all, dealing with diarrhea is pretty distracting. Dr. Kevin Cooke , an internal medicine doctor at Aviv Clinics, told HuffPost that one common culprit is dairy. “When someone with a dairy intolerance consumes dairy products, it can trigger an inflammatory response in the body. This inflammation may affect cognitive functions, leading to symptoms commonly associated with brain fog such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness and confusion,” he said. If you experience gastrointestinal issues frequently and have a hunch that it’s food related but aren’t sure what the cause is, Dalvi recommends keeping a food diary, logging what you eat and how you feel afterward, including mentally. When it comes to diet and brainpower, Rifkin and Boakye emphasize that maintaining a balanced diet is key. This, both explained, will help prevent the blood sugar ups and downs that can come with just eating simple carbs and also ensure the brain is getting enough nutrients to function. Dalvi added to this, saying that brain cells need energy to function just like the rest of the body does. When you don’t get the nutrients you need, you’re bound to have trouble concentrating. So if you’re hungry, eat! Just make sure it isn’t something loaded with sugar or salt, or something that will give you tummy troubles. That way, your food really does serve as brain fuel and not something that will slow you down.

    "article_content": "Staff Writer You don’t need a cafe-level setup to make quality iced coffee and cold brew at home. In fact, a coffee expert recently spilled the beans on a surprisingly simple trick to upgrade your morning cup. In a recent interview with HuffPost, expert barista and coffee consultant Laila Ghambari recommended storing your brewed coffee in a well-sealed container, so your other food can’t contaminate the flavor. “If you have fish sitting in your refrigerator, it will permeate and get into your coffee,” she said. Whether you’re making hot coffee that’s going in the fridge or doing the barista-approved “ flash brew ” method, Ghambari (who won the United States Barista Championship in 2014) says to get your coffee in the fridge quickly (after it’s completely brewed) to ensure freshness. You’ll also want to drink your iced coffee soon after you make it, as “[f]resh-brewed coffee is going to have the most intense aromatics.” If you want your cold coffee to last through the week, Ghambari recommends making cold brew (which is easier than you think). It requires steeping grounds in room temperature water overnight, then storing the coffee in a sealed container. To help you upgrade your home ice coffee and cold brew, we rounded up some highly-rated sealed containers and cold brew brewing vessels that also work as containers.

    "article_content": "Head of Life and Commerce Culinary school successfully brainwashed me to believe that when it comes to blenders , Vitamix reigns supreme. And in many cases, that’s true ― especially if you’re blending things in large batches. But if you primarily use your blender for single servings of smoothies , you’re well aware of how much space a dirty blender container takes up in your sink, taunting you as you procrastinate washing it. If only there were a tiny blender that could whip up smoothies in single batches! With a dishwasher-safe jar! And imagine if that blender jar could flip upside down, transforming into the cup from which you drink your smoothie! And then imagine if there were a lid you could screw on top, so you can take your smoothie with you to go. Good news: There is one. You can get it for under $90 right now , and I own two of them. I’m always skeptical of anything with the word “foodie” in the name, but a couple years ago I tried out the Ninja Foodi Smoothie Maker and Nutrient Extractor . I expected very little, but from the moment I gripped the suction cups of the machine’s tiny base to my countertop and turned it on, I could feel the blender’s sheer force as it sent vibrations through my entire kitchen. Air shot out of the bottom, sending random garlic peels flying across the countertop. And when the smoothie was finished, my protein powder was whipped into a delightful cloud and the seeds from the raspberries were so highly pulverized, they were nearly undetectable. I was sold. This particular model takes up just a few inches on your countertop, and it comes with a host of attachments and whirligigs that can make not only smoothies, but frozen smoothie bowls, pestos and nut butters, just to name a few examples. And frankly, I’ve been preferring the Ninja over my Vitamix for all these uses. I love it so much, I bought a second one to keep at my mom’s house for when I’m visiting. If you’re making a smoothie or a frozen bowl (an acai bowl , for example), there’s absolutely no guesswork involved ― just press the corresponding button on the machine, and it knows exactly how long to blend it ― the machine will turn off when it’s done. (Just one warning: the machine isn’t quiet!) But if you want a more manual option, the “pulse” button allows you to control exactly how long the blender runs. When it’s time to clean up, it couldn’t be easier ― just fill the blender jar halfway with water and a few drops of soap, and turn it on for a few seconds. It’ll come out perfectly clean after a quick rinse, and you’re good to go. If you or someone you know is constantly complaining about cleaning a giant blender, or simply can’t manage to get the chunks out of smoothies, I highly recommend this one, even though I still don’t like the name of it. And Amazon and Target reviewers agree about its performance. Although it’s currently sold out at Amazon, it is on major sale at Target right now for $30 off. This tiny blender will almost literally blow you away. It has a 4.6-star rating at Target and a 4.5-star rating at Amazon. The set contains a 14-ounce smoothie bowl maker with built-in tamper that easily powers through frozen ingredients, two 24-ounce nutrient extraction cups to blend smoothies and other liquids, plus lids for all three containers. The 1,200-peak-watt motor has suction cups at the bottom to firmly attach to your countertop, and offers six programs for one-touch blend, pulse, smoothies, extractions, bowls and spreads. To make life even easier, all the parts (aside from the motor) are dishwasher safe. Promising reviews: “I bought this blender about 9 months ago - after I had already bought - and returned - FOUR other blenders. All but one of those other blenders had significantly more wattage - 1400, 1800, and even 2200 - but NONE could handle blending my smoothies as well as this one ! Not only that, but this model is far more compact and lightweight than all the others - some of which were quite heavy. So this Ninja is easily storable in the cabinet and takes up little room.” — Batlady at Amazon “I purchased this back in the spring of 2021. I had tongue cancer and could only do smoothies once I started eating again. I used this a few times a day for months. Then I had issues with my jaw due to radiation and had my mouth wired shut, then a full jaw replacement. For the first 6 months of this year, I could have nothing but smoothies. I used this at least 5X a day. Now I use it twice a day. Still going strong. I love this smoothie maker!!! It blends up ice, ice cream, even used it to purée up soups. I highly recommend this product. ” — Tiffany at Target “ Nothing could’ve prepared me for how powerful this blender was . Decided to buy this as I needed a new blender. Am shocked at how powerful this thing is. ... Super powerful was actually almost a little scared haha. It is loud though but what blender isn’t and that’s fine with me. It has suction cups on the bottom so it stays in place really nicely . It also has its own self timer/ setting for smoothies so can walk away and let it do it’s thing. No annoying missed chunks that didn’t get blended. Super quick. Love the clickable/lockable top piece to make sure top doesn’t fall off.” — A at Amazon By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life From the Hugo spritz to the espresso martini , many cocktails have vied for the title of drink of the summer over the years. As we approach the official start of the season, another beverage has emerged to compete for the title. A fairly simple but perfectly balanced cocktail called the batanga might be the next hot summer cocktail, with fans ranging from TikTok-famous bartenders to the team at Martha Stewart . So what exactly is a batanga, and what makes it worthy of being the drink of the summer? We asked some cocktail experts to break it down. “The batanga is a simple yet refreshing cocktail made with tequila, fresh lime juice and cola, served in a glass with a salted rim,” said bartender Lynnette Marrero, who is a partner and chief mixologist at Delola and co-founder of the speed bartending competition Speed Rack . To make a batanga, you must first cut a lime and use a wedge to coat the rim of a highball glass before dipping it in salt (some versions call for an added pinch of salt directly in the glass). Next, squeeze fresh lime juice into the glass and add ice and tequila blanco. Top it off with cola and stir to combine. While the recommended ingredient portions vary depending on who you ask, we found many bartenders go with half an ounce of lime juice, or the juice of half a lime, and about 2 ounces of tequila blanco. One of the benefits of this drink is that you can tweak the ratio to your personal taste without compromising its overall identity. Many describe the batanga as a take on a cuba libre with tequila instead of rum or a paloma with cola instead of grapefruit. The concoction is also sometimes called a charro negro, though the batanga differs in its specific inclusion of salt. Aficionados also recommend using Mexican Coke in keeping with the cocktail’s origins in the Jalisco region of Mexico. “The batanga is a very famous cocktail in the town of Tequila, and it was created by Don Javier Delgado Corona, who was the founder of La Capilla,” said Steffin Oghene, the vice president of international sales at El Tequileño . Frequently named one of the world’s best bars , La Capilla is the oldest cantina in Tequila, and it was there in 1961 that Corona served his first batanga ― made with tequila blanco from the nearby distillery El Tequileño. Another important feature of the batanga is the way it’s mixed. Corona famously stirred the ingredients with the same bar knife he used to cut the limes, infusing extra flavor into the cocktail. According to some accounts, that same knife was also used to cut tomatoes, onions, peppers and avocados for salsa and guacamole. The batanga is in the “changuirongo” category of cocktails, a Mexican term referring to tequila mixed with any type of soda and sometimes citrus. As for the name, batanga was slang for “stocky” or “thick in the middle,” and the cocktail’s inventor reportedly drew inspiration from an inside joke involving a certain rotund friend, the glass used to serve the drink and/or a type of canoe. Although he passed away in 2020 at the age of 96, Corona’s family has continued the tradition of the batanga. “For all the global bartenders, tequila lovers and tourists who go to the town of Tequila, it’s a right of passage to have a batanga,” Oghene said. “Much like the paloma variation of tequila, citrus and sweet soda, the ‘changuirongo’ style cocktails reached peak popularity in the 1940s and throughout the midcentury,” said Bradley Thomas Stephens , vice president and education chair of the United States Bartenders’ Guild board of directors. More than six decades after its invention, the batanga remains a changuirongo staple for many. “It’s such an iconic cocktail within the town of Tequila,” Oghene said. “It tastes really great, and on very hot days, it’s very refreshing and delicious.” Although the batanga has long been famous with Tequila locals, the cocktail’s reach beyond Mexico has been rapidly expanding in recent years. “The drink has been popular in Europe and other regions around the globe since the ’90s, but has never fully reached the American fame it deserves,” Stephens said. “Recently, there has been a spike in American bartenders discovering the drink, and even a tequila brand named Batanga on shelves in many states in recent years. There is a strong chance many of us will start seeing variations on menus soon.” There are many potential reasons for this spread of batanga awareness. Perhaps the Coca-Cola and tequila lobbies are cornering the TikTok market, or maybe we’re just seeking an uncomplicated alternative to all the expensive, elaborate cocktails out there. “Tequila is having a major moment, and its growth and popularity have continued to soar,” Marrero said. “Naturally, more and more consumers will turn to classic cocktails featuring the spirit.” For novice mixologists dabbling in at-home cocktails, perfecting tequila-based drinks like margaritas might require a bit more work. But Marrero believes the batanga offers an easier alternative. “The batanga is simple, requires only a few basic ingredients and it’s incredibly simple to make,” she said. “The rise of better-for-you colas and craft ‘soda’ can also contribute to this growth.” Marrero pointed to an increase in tequila lovers traveling to Jalisco as well. “These trips often include visiting La Capilla, the bar where the batanga was created, resulting in the passing on of the cocktail to a wider audience,” she said. The travel aspect speaks to a larger interest in food and beverage traditions from other cultures. “People like stories ― they like history, they like heritage, and this drink has a lot of history and heritage,” Oghene said. “And it’s a favorite amongst locals, so people want to be involved in that experience.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost When you’re craving a quick and easy iced coffee , you can get away with brewing your favorite roast, pouring the java over ice, stirring in your choice of milk or sweetener and calling it a day. The no-frills method gets the job done, sure. But if you want to get the most out of your caffeinated beverage, you’ll need to put a bit more forethought and effort into your technique. Here, professional baristas share the mistakes you’re making when creating iced coffee at home — and what you should do instead for a balanced brew. With any iced coffee, the ice in your beverage will inevitably melt, leading to a diluted drink that may taste too weak, too watery, too warm or a combination of all three, said Kathleen McCarthy , a corporate trainer at Lavazza. The good news: You can reduce the odds of this unpleasant drinking experience by accounting for ice melt during the brewing process, she said. To do so, brew your coffee with a stronger grounds-to-water ratio. The typical recommendation is 1 gram of coffee to 16 grams of water, but when you’re planning to drink your coffee iced, use a slightly stronger ratio of 1:12 or a double-strength 1:8, McCarthy suggested. That way, your beverage will still taste strong even when the added ice begins to melt. Make sure you’re not using too little water while brewing, either, which could lead to a sour cup. Compounding the dilution problem is the common practice of pouring a freshly brewed cup of joe directly over ice — without allowing it to cool first. “If your hot brew is poured directly over ice, that simply adds more water to your ratio when the ice melts,” leading to a weaker drink, McCarthy explained. Instead, chill your coffee in the fridge before you pour it over ice. Just know that your final beverage could still be diluted if you aren’t adjusting the strength of your grounds-to-water ratio, too. “The ice will eventually melt and, depending [on] how quickly you drink, the last half or so of your cup could be watered down,” McCarthy said. If you simply can’t wait for your coffee to cool, swap your traditional ice cubes with coffee-based ones; fill an ice cube tray with coffee and freeze. When used, your beverage will stay cold without the risk of it becoming watered down, McCarthy said. The one exception to this rule: You’re making a flash brew, a favorite iced coffee method for two of the baristas we interviewed. You’ll brew your coffee — the pour-over and AeroPress techniques are most commonly recommended, but a drip machine works just fine — with less hot water than usual. You might brew with just two-thirds of the water you typically use. Then, replace the remaining one-third of water with ice, McCarthy explained. You can brew directly into your glass filled with ice or add the ice to your coffee later. “This is my preferred method because it doesn’t require any advanced prep and thought like cold brew does, and unlike a standard brewed hot coffee poured over ice, it won’t be diluted or weak,” McCarthy said. The final beverage won’t be incredibly cold, but the flash brew method is ideal for satisfying that iced coffee craving quickly, said Laila Ghambari , the 2014 United States Barista Champion . Plus, compared to other iced coffee techniques, “ it locks in the aromatics and results in a much more flavorful coffee,” she said. If your standard brew ratio for hot coffee is 1 gram coffee to 16 grams water, adjust it to: 1 gram coffee to 12 grams water to 4 grams ice. You might brew 20 grams of coffee with 240 grams of hot water and serve it over 80 grams of ice, for example, McCarthy suggested. Don’t just pop a glass filled with java into your fridge and wait an hour or two for it to chill. Coffee stored in an open container will inevitably take on some funky flavors, Ghambari said. “Even if you have fish sitting in your refrigerator, it will permeate and get into your coffee,” she added. Instead, pour your brew into a sealed vessel — and avoid leaving it on the kitchen counter, where it’s likely to mold more quickly than the cool fridge, Ghambari explained. Even if your brewed coffee is stored properly, you’ll want to use it soon after it cools. “The longer your brewed coffee sits before you drink it, the more it will acquire stale flavors,” McCarthy said. “The longer your cup of coffee sits, the more the natural oils present in your brewed coffee will develop unpleasant and potentially even rancid flavors.” Not to mention, aromatics contribute heavily to your drinking experience, Ghambari added. “Fresh-brewed coffee is going to have the most intense aromatics, and so the fresher is probably going to result in the better taste,” she noted. Can’t be bothered to brew a fresh batch every day? Try prepping cold brew instead. The coffee is brewed at a cool temperature, so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly, develops fewer acidic flavors, and can be stored for one to two weeks without a significant change in taste, McCarthy said. Each brewing method brings out a different flavor profile in your coffee. The pour-over technique tends to result in clearer, lighter coffee that’s typically best for lighter roasts and more acidic, fruity flavors, McCarthy said. Use this method if you’re searching for a refreshing flavor profile or you’re in the mood for a fruitier drink, McCarthy recommended. It may particularly appeal to folks who enjoy their iced coffee black, she noted. Make sure to wet the filter before adding your grounds (then dump that water out of your vessel) to remove any stray dust or paper particles and unpleasant paper taste, added Yoshawn Smith , the 2023 Barista League Champion and a barista with Califia Farms and Patria Coffee Roasters. The French press, however, generally produces coffee with a full, heavy body, so it syncs best with darker roasts and chocolatey, intense flavors, McCarthy said. This brewing technique will give you a strong coffee base that can be softened with milk and ice, she said. The general advice for delicious coffee-making still applies to the iced beverage: Make sure your coffee is used according to the roast date for the best result, brew with filtered water, and stay focused so you don’t forget pulses for your pour-over or miss the time to plunge your French press or AeroPress, Smith said. As you fiddle with your brewing practice, McCarthy suggested making just one change at a time; that way you can tell what’s actually improving your cup. Treat it like a science project and even take notes if you feel inclined to. Your perfect cup should be something you can enjoy and replicate on a daily basis, she added. Remember, making iced coffee shouldn’t be a stressful experience. “Experiment a little bit and find that perfect method for you,” Smith said. “Taste and smell are subjective, and with that being said, enjoy your iced coffee any way you like to. It’s yours, no one can tell you how to enjoy it but yourself.” Want to make a batch of iced coffee? These are our favorite tools.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Much of the cultural discourse around this time of year revolves around the “song of the summer,” as music lovers debate which new ditty will follow in the footsteps of hits like “Despacito,” “Butter” and “In My Feelings.” (For the record, my vote is Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso.”) But the warm weather also ushers in another important superlative in the food and beverage world: “drink of the summer.” It seems every year there’s a particularly delicious cocktail that the masses crave as they enjoy the season of outdoor bars, backyard barbecues and fabulous vacations. To inspire your seasonal sipping, we’re looking back at some of the cocktails that have been dubbed “drink of the summer” in recent years (and a couple of current contenders). Cheers! This zingy cola-based cocktail is vying for the title of 2024′s drink of the summer. The batanga is a refreshing drink made with fresh lime juice, tequila blanco and cola, served in a highball glass with a salted rim (and occasionally a pinch of salt directly in the cocktail). The simple yet perfectly balanced libation is often compared to a Cuba libre with tequila instead of rum, or a paloma with cola instead of grapefruit. Although the ratios can vary, many bartenders stir half an ounce of lime juice and 2 ounces of tequila blanco in a tall glass filled with ice before filling the rest with cola. As the story goes, the iconic bar owner Don Javier Delgado Corona invented the batanga in the 1960s in the town of Tequila in Jalisco, Mexico. That’s why aficionados recommend using Mexican Coke and tequila blanco from the distillery El Tequileño to make a truly authentic version. Crucially, Don Javier also stirred his signature cocktail with the same bar knife he used to cut the limes, infusing extra flavor. “People like stories ― they like history, they like heritage, and this drink has a lot of history and heritage,” Steffin Oghene, the vice president of international sales at El Tequileño , told HuffPost. “And it’s a favorite amongst locals, so people want to be involved in that experience.” Another cocktail that people have heralded as the defining drink of summer 2024 is the porn star martini . Despite its name, the beverage is not a true martini at all, but rather a very sweet concoction served in a chilled martini glass. The ingredients are: Two ounces of vanilla vodka, half an ounce of passion fruit liqueur, half an ounce of fresh lime juice, half an ounce of vanilla syrup and an ounce of passion fruit puree. The drink is traditionally accompanied by a decadent shot of chilled prosecco or champagne. Invented by London bartender Douglas Ankrah in 2002, the porn star martini has experienced waves of popularity across Europe, but recent years have elevated the cocktail to new heights of notoriety. Perhaps the raunchy, conversation-starting name as something to do with it. “Now it’s definitely catching on here in the U.S. ― just like how the espresso martini made its comeback,” said Adam Delaney, a cocktail and bar consultant and beverage director at John Sparr Tavern in Glendale, California. Also known as a Hugo spritz, the Hugo was the prevailing choice for summer 2023′s signature cocktail. Exact ratios vary, but this refreshing beverage is often made with four ounces of prosecco, half an ounce of elderflower liqueur (usually St-Germain), two ounces of soda water and fresh mint, and is served over ice. Some also garnish with lime and/or add a dash of gin. “While it is technically an aperitif, and intended to be sipped on before a meal, it is easily enjoyed at any time, especially dining al fresco in warmer months,” cocktail expert Rysse Goldfarb told HuffPost last summer . A lighter answer to the bitter Aperol spritz, the Hugo was reportedly invented around 2005 at a bar near the Austrian-Italian border. The cocktail quickly spread throughout Europe, and finally made a splash in the U.S., amid the rise of low-ABV drinks and renewed zest for international travel after the pandemic. Summer 2022 was a big time for the Dirty Shirley ― a grownup take on the Shirley Temple. Named for the non-alcoholic drink (named for the iconic child star), this cocktail offers a way to get tipsy while getting in touch with your inner child. Although there are many variations, the basic gist is you take the traditional Shirley Temple (8 ounces of ginger ale or lemon-lime soda, plus 1 ounce of grenadine and a maraschino cherry, over ice) and add a shot or so of vodka. “It’s a big seller with the 25-to-35 age demographic, I think because it’s nostalgic, fun and just flat-out tastes really good,” mixologist Lauren Pellecchia told HuffPost in 2022. “It’s not a serious drink, and after the last few very serious years we all deserve some lightheartedness. A Dirty Shirley is something that anyone can make at home and confidently order out at the bar — which is not always the case for other drinks that have been popular over the past few years.” The sweet but refreshing drink is a crowd pleaser, but if you aren’t a fan of vodka cocktails, you can opt for a version with dark rum and call it a Shirley Temple Black (a nod to the child star’s married name). Following the exhaustion and burnout of life amid the COVID-19 pandemic, perhaps it is unsurprising that many people were craving the jolt of an espresso martini in 2021 . That summer, the New York Times declared, “The espresso martini is everywhere (again).” Like the porn star martini, this cocktail was reportedly invented by a London bartender — but more than a decade earlier in the late ’80s. Espresso martinis were all the rage throughout the ’90s before the hype died down, as people seemed to become fatigued with sweet libations in V-shaped stemware. The 2020s revival was strong, however. Some point to the influence of reality shows like “Below Deck,” which frequently featured cast members drinking espresso martinis. Whatever the reason for the trend, there’s no denying we’re all the more caffeinated for it. To make an espresso martini, pour 2 ounces of vodka, half an ounce of coffee liqueur, 1 ounce of espresso and half an ounce simple syrup into an ice-filled shaker and give it a good shake before straining it into a chilled cocktail glass. Don’t forget to add a few coffee beans as a garnish. The Aperol Spritz has long been a signature summer drink in many parts of the world, but the simple ingredient list and lack of skill needed to make the classic aperitivo gave it a particular prominence in 2020, when most people were mixing up their own cocktails at home. “My go-to classic recipe for an Aperol Spritz is two half moon oranges, 2 ounces Aperol, 1 ounce soda water, 3 ounces prosecco, crushed ice and a fresh orange peel,” said Christina Demas, the beverage director of Maple & Ash + etta in Scottsdale, Arizona. Experts recommend choosing an extra dry or dry prosecco but not a full-on brut. Make sure to add the prosecco after the soda water and Aperol. “It’s the summer of hard seltzer!” declared countless publications in 2019 . Indeed, it was hard to go anywhere without spotting one of the many canned offerings from White Claw and Truly. In fact, Nielsen reported that the alcohol sales for hard seltzers at bars and restaurants grew by 73% between the spring and fall of 2019, and White Claw sales were were up about 250% that year compared to 2018. The trend has carried on into subsequent years as big brands like Budweiser and Corona capitalized on the low-ABV craze. Not everyone craves an ice cold beer on a summer day, but that doesn’t mean they have to forego the joy of cracking open a can of something boozy to quench their thirst. Black cherry, passionfruit, lime, peach, raspberry ― whatever your flavor preference, there’s a spiked seltzer for you. As with the Aperol Spritz, rosé has long been a summertime sipping staple. But a frozen take on this pink-hued wine came into fashion in the 2010s. It was summer 2016 when the Washington Post declared: “Frosé is taking over D.C.” Frosé is typically made with rosé wine, strawberries, vodka and lemon juice or sugar blended with ice into a frozen slushie treat. Think sophisticated Slurpees for adults. Just be sure to sip carefully to avoid the dreaded brain freeze!

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Maren Morris is celebrating LGBTQ+ Pride Month with a clarification about her own sexuality. The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter revealed on Instagram Sunday that she is bisexual. “happy to be the B in LGBTQ+,” she wrote alongside a carousel of photos from the Phoenix, Arizona, stop on her RSVP Redux Tour . “happy pride.” In two of the photos, Morris can be seen holding a rainbow flag while onstage. By Monday, the post had received a plethora of supportive comments from fans as well as some of Morris’ famous pals. “HAPPY PRIDE!!!!! thanks for being an inspiration and what a special pride this one is,” fellow singer-songwriter Allison Ponthier wrote. Added Scott Hoying of the famed acapella pop group Pentatonix: “Love you so much Maren!!!!!” Morris split from husband Ryan Hurd , a fellow musician, in 2023 after about five years of marriage. The former couple share a 4-year-old son, Hayes Andrew. In the past few years, Morris has emerged as one of country music’s most outspoken LGBTQ+ rights advocates , often denouncing homophobic and transphobic legislation, both in interviews and while performing onstage. In 2022, she traded barbs with Brittany Aldean, the wife of country singer Jason Aldean, online over the conservative couple’s comments about transgender children. Last September, Morris said she planned to exit the country music genre because of its failure to become more accessible to female artists, LGBTQ+ musicians and performers of color. “After the Trump years, people’s biases were on full display. It just revealed who people really were and that they were proud to be misogynistic and racist and homophobic and transphobic,” she told the Los Angeles Times in September. “All these things were being celebrated, and it was weirdly dovetailing with this hyper-masculine branch of country music. I call it butt rock.” “I thought I’d like to burn it to the ground and start over,” she added with regard to country music specifically. “But it’s burning itself down without my help.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer My father was gay. He was born in 1918. In my 20s, he started telling me stories about his early life. He was out in the 1930s at a time when it wasn’t common. He had dreams that most would not believe he dared to dream. The problem with my dad telling me all of this was that he was still married to my mother. In 1939, at a party in the Hollywood Hills with gay filmmakers and musicians, he was arrested. Police officers handcuffed the men, herded them into a van, and took them to jail. The following morning, he appeared before a judge for sentencing. Because the arresting officer couldn’t swear that he saw him touching his dance partner, he was released. Then he was caught up in an illegal sting operation in Pasadena that targeted gay men. They were extorted by the police for cash payments in return for conditional release. His dreams of being a schoolteacher and living with his boyfriend were destroyed. As World War II loomed, he attempted to enlist in the U.S. Navy, but he was rejected when his record revealed that he was gay. The Army eventually accepted him, perhaps because war was imminent and able-bodied men, even gay ones, were needed. Before my father shipped out for war, he attended a USO dance on the San Francisco Peninsula. When he and a fellow soldier arrived, his buddy yelled over the loud music, “Hey, Hall, let’s get outta here. There aren’t any girls to dance with.” My mother, still in high school, was dancing with the company cook at the time. She looked up and saw what she described as “a handsome soldier with big blue eyes and white teeth,” and said, “I’ll dance with you.” My parents would retell this origin story for the rest of their lives. Granted a furlough in September of 1942, Dad sent a telegram to my mom that read, “Arrive in Frisco tomorrow. Marry me dearest.” To my grandmother’s horror, she accepted his proposal. She was only 18. When the war ended, four babies followed. I was the second born. By the time I was 6, I was aware of how friendly my father was with my mother’s friends. The dinner parties they hosted in the 1950s and ’60s were glamorous affairs. Women vied to dance with my father, and told my mother that his smooth moves and good manners made him unlike the other men they knew. During some of those parties, I snuck down the hallway late at night and saw women that were not my mother sitting on my father’s lap. I was infuriated. When I reached my early 20s, I found myself juggling partners. I was not proud of this. One day, on a hike in the hills above the family home, I confronted my father about what I assumed were his affairs. If he had dabbled with infidelity, maybe I wasn’t such a bad person after all. When we reached the top of the hill, I came right out and asked him if he had ever been unfaithful to Mom. His face flushed. After a pause, he told me the truth. It wasn’t what I expected. “Honey, I’m gay,” he said, adding, “I’ve always been gay.” I was shocked, though I knew he wasn’t a stereotypical dad in the neighborhood where I grew up. He selected my siblings’ and my clothes. He cut and styled our hair, one time giving me what he called a “Mia Farrow.” I didn’t even know who Mia was and I did not appreciate the fact that he had lopped off my ponytail. He did a better job styling my mother’s hair. He taught me how to crochet, needlepoint, and make paper chains out of his cigarette packs. He created beautiful table centerpieces and whipped up fancy desserts for dinner parties. One of his fancy frozen desserts included sliced grapes that appeared to be floating in ice cream, which impressed us kids. He took us to operas, musicals, plays, and museums in San Francisco. He was a cool dad. There were no guns, roughhousing, hunting, or violent football games for our family. His stories poured out of him once he came out to me. When I asked him if my mother knew, he said she discovered he was gay in the 1950s after finding revealing photos of him with other men. I was 6 at the time. She called him at work, hysterical. He sped home, thinking one of us kids had been hit by a car. When he found out what had happened, he offered to leave so she would never have to see him again. He promised to support her and us for the rest of his life. He packed up his things that night after my siblings and I were asleep. As he backed out of the driveway, Mom ran toward him, pleading with him to stay and telling him that she still loved him. So, he stayed. He stayed forever. For years after he shared these stories with me, I felt sorry for my parents. I doubted they had the marriage they wanted, though neither of them ever let on to me that they were unhappy. Decades later, I asked my mother if she wished they had split up when she found out he was gay. “Oh, nooo, Laurie,” she said, drawing out the word no. “I love your father.” The years passed. As far as I could tell, they didn’t have an open marriage. But my mother supported my father when he created the first LGBT section in the local library and volunteered as an AIDS buddy for the Shanti Project in the 1990s. On the night before my mother died in 2006, she lay unconscious in bed while my father hosted relatives in the kitchen. I sat at my mother’s bedside, wondering if he might let her final moments slip away without saying goodbye. I wondered if I had been wrong all along about their relationship being a loving one. I wasn’t wrong. At one point I left her room, and to my surprise, I watched as my father lumbered down the dark hallway toward her room. He was 88. I wondered if he had been waiting for me to leave. I stood at her bedroom door like an insecure child, hoping to hear that she had been happy with the life she had chosen. “Rus-ty,” he said in a sing-song voice, calling her by the nickname she went by when they first met, “I’m so glad you said yes.” Mom, who had been unconscious the prior 24 hours, responded, “I’d do it all over again.” Dad looked stunned and asked her to repeat what she’d said. I guessed he was as surprised as I was. In the end, though, that was all I longed to hear. I left them alone to say their final goodbyes. My mother died the next morning, five months shy of their 65th anniversary. My father lived for another two years. He often spoke of my mother, one time telling me he heard her calling his name from another room. He thought she’d be pleased with the way he decorated his new place. After all, she had always been his biggest fan. Theirs was an unconventional love — but love just the same — and one they chose under trying circumstances. After my father’s death, I began to write about my family and speak publicly about us. I gave my first talk in San Francisco’s famed Castro District, one of the most historic gay neighborhoods in the U.S. I was surprised when I received pushback from two men in attendance. One declared my father was a traitor to the gay movement. Another accused him of being cruel to my mother for hiding his sexual orientation from her. I was speechless and uneasy — ashamed might be a better word — and it hurt. I didn’t know how to respond, so I didn’t. Had I been wrong about my dad — this man I knew to be so wonderful and caring and loving, not only to my mom and my siblings and me, but seemingly to everyone he knew? I grappled with these thoughts and feelings for years. Then, a few months ago, I watched “Maestro,” Bradley Cooper’s biopic of Leonard Bernstein, and something shifted in me. The film tells the story, in part, of the famous conductor’s marriage to Felicia Montealegre while he also pursued relationships with men. At one point, Bernstein tells Montealegre that he found it deplorable that the world wanted their marriage to be one thing, when it wasn’t just one thing. Though Bernstein and Montealegre’s relationship was obviously much different from my parents’ relationship, I felt like I had been hit by a lightning bolt. I began to rethink and re-feel what I had been carrying inside of me since that day in the Castro. At the time, I didn’t speak up for my father as he had always done for me, which pains me. Watching “Maestro” allowed me to articulate what I had been feeling all these years: a deep regret that judgment from others led me to question my father’s integrity. I am happy my parents found each other and I don’t doubt the love they had — or what I heard that night just before my mother died. The environment in which my father was raised isn’t good for anyone. My father didn’t get to live the life he should have been able to live. But despite what he faced, what he lost, and what was taken away from him, he did what he could with what he had. He loved fiercely and his love allowed me to be who I am. I’m grateful for that, and still my heart breaks for him. What happened wasn’t fair to my mother, either. I don’t pretend to know exactly what she felt, but I believe it must have been unthinkably difficult to be in her shoes. And yet, I also know she experienced great happiness and much of that was because of my father. I never once heard her criticize him in my presence. Ultimately, my parents’ story is complicated. To even begin to try to understand it requires context and nuance and a consideration of the time in which it happened. But I’m not sure that’s the point. For me, the point is that love comes in all different forms, and my parents’ lives, as imperfect and unfair as they may have been, were filled with love and, thanks to them, so was mine. As my father lay dying in his hospital room in 2008 at the age of 90, he uncharacteristically barked out an order to me. He pointed to the large plastic clock on the wall. “Turn the clock back, Laurie,” he said, adamantly. “Turn it back!” Those were his final words to me. I was bewildered. But I told him I would, even though I had no idea what that meant. Maybe he wanted more time with my mom and his children. Maybe he wanted another chance to live his life as an openly gay man. Maybe he meant something else entirely. I can’t turn back the clock — for him, for my mother, or for myself. But, going forward, I can promise that if I ever hear another negative word about my father, I will stand up for him without shame or regret. There are and were many men and women who faced situations like the one my parents faced. Their stories deserve to be told and heard. They may not fit neatly into a particular box, but what love story does? Laura Hall was born on the San Francisco Peninsula to a closeted gay dad and a straight mom during the post-WWII baby boom. She came of age during the rebellious ’60s just as the Summer of Love kicked off in San Francisco. Her award-winning memoir, “Affliction: Growing Up With a Closeted Gay Dad,” was published in 2021.

    "article_content": "HuffPost Director of Voices When we relaunched HuffPost Voices about a year ago, I felt exhilarated about a whole site dedicated to the experiences, struggles and joys of structurally marginalized people. And because many of us occupy more than one space, we wanted to emphasize intersectionality. Today, Voices is bursting at the seams with nuanced stories about everything from how anti-LGBTQ+ policies affect us to accurate racial representation on shows we love (or love to hate). Voices is a place where you can connect with your most genuine self, where the cultural stories you consume come thoughtfully from people within the community. That should be the standard, and we’re hoping to set it. Another intention that guides us at Voices is to give you important stories that don’t exist anywhere else (I mean, other than TikTok). That was the impetus for launching our new Indigenous Voices section. Much of the journalism regarding what it means to be Indigenous today is all too reductive, relying on tropes or tragedy. And while you better believe we will address the historical and persisting attempts at erasure of Indigenous people, there’s also a lot of joy — an act of resistance in itself — that the world needs to see. Our stories will examine the complexities that tribal communities and those with Indigenous backgrounds experience today, while reflecting on what it means to survive and thrive in this cultural, geographical and inherently political identity. We’ve been dropping some jewels along the way, and I’m thrilled to announce the (ethically sourced) diamond in our crown: a stunning photo essay, coming next week, exploring the impact of “Reservation Dogs,” the first ever Indigenous-led series to grace our screens. The show, centering the experiences of four Native teens in Muscogee Nation, is both sharp and illuminating, full of the authenticity that only an all-Indigenous cast and writers room can bring. Our essay, featuring photos by Jonathan Blaustein and words by Indigenous writer Chyana Marie Sage, reveals tender, behind-the-scenes moments and draws on exclusive interviews from two of the leading actors, Devery Jacobs and D’Pharoah Woon-A-Tai. Remember their names; they’re well on their way to becoming huge stars. Much of the journalism regarding what it means to be Indigenous today is all too reductive, relying on tropes or tragedy. Sage, who is writing a memoir about growing up Cree in Canada, calls the show a win for everyone in the diaspora. “Speaking with Devery and D’Pharoah, and listening to their perspectives and stories — we had so many similarities,” she tells me. “There are so many common threads among us Indigenous people, no matter what nation we are from. We just understand each other’s struggles, joys, and the passion for representation.” And that’s the whole point of Voices as a unique online space: Here, we as people of color and queer people can feel seen , rather than gazed upon. It’s your favorite group chat brought to life, with people you trust engaging in discussions that matter to you right now. On Indigenous Voices, you’ll hear from Native organizers, artists, chefs, actors and researchers of all ages and gender expressions. In the stories that we’ll publish in the coming weeks and beyond, we’ll lean into what the future holds in these communities, and look at the evolving concept of sovereignty through the eyes of young activists. To stay updated, check out our Indigenous Voices home and follow us on Instagram and Twitter . Above all, the stories you’ll find in Indigenous Voices upend the concept of assimilation. This rich culture is an absolute flex, and we’ll remind you of that every single day. As Sage aptly put it to me: “Amidst all the adversity that has been stacked against us, we are still here, and we are vibrant and thriving.” FX is the launch sponsor of Indigenous Voices.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer When they lived in Utah, Sean Snyder and Adrian Matthias Stevens often ran into each other at pow wows. For both Snyder and Stevens, these events served as spaces to share the dance and songs of their culture, while also competing with other tribes. But above all, the gatherings were a means for building community. After a few casual yet pleasant run-ins, Snyder and Stevens, who both identify as Two-Spirit, began dating. Ten years later, they’re still dancing at pow wows all over the country — but now, as a same-sex couple. Long-lasting, healthy queer love is something I’ve always loved to witness, but it feels particularly special when there’s a connective thread in the relationship, rooted in an identity at odds with so much of the world. Two-Spiritness , for those unfamiliar, is not quite gayness or transness as we would define it in binary terms. Instead, it’s an identity that actively embraces the duality of femininity and masculinity within a single person. It’s an identity that can, and should, teach all of us about how expansive queerness can be. Snyder , who is Navajo and Ute, is a beadwork artist who was born in Iowa and grew up in several states, including Alaska and Arizona. Stevens , who is Northern Ute and Apache, was born and raised in Utah, where his fondest memories were of celebrating the Bear Dance, a 10-day springtime festival of feasting. Although both Snyder and Stevens were intimately connected to their Native heritage growing up, it wasn’t until later in life that they learned the term “Two-Spirit.” Still, they both describe intuitive reactions to their Two-Spirit identities from their families, even if they weren’t verbally articulated. For example, Stevens’ parents allowed him to take part in activities that were traditionally reserved for women in ceremonies, such as carrying water, which was their way of acknowledging that they understood something about Stevens that he might not have fully understood about himself yet. To him, this is evidence of the link between queerness and the universe. “Two-Spirit is not physical. It’s spiritual, being able to embody both masculine and feminine energy within you,” he says. “I’ve been able to move through both masculine and feminine spaces with a natural fluidity.” When I spoke to Snyder and Stephens, they had recently returned from Los Angeles Pride. I went to LA Pride this year, too, and noticed a lot of hypermasculine energy in the form of shirtless men at an outdoor Mariah Carey concert. I asked them how they navigated what can seem like rigid notions of gayness in places like West Hollywood — where clubs lure in patrons with flyers of cis men flaunting rock-hard abs — while holding an identity as nuanced as Two-Spirit. Showing up to those spaces in full regalia from their culture is a big part of the battle itself. Visibility is key here; dressing to reflect their authentic selves is a reminder that there are other ways of existing. Often, they tell me, just attending an event as visibly Indigenous is enough to spark interest and conversations about their identity. Another, more fundamental part of being in gay spaces as Native American people is simply to remind others that tribal communities are still here, thriving — and they have something to teach everyone. In a world where a Western way of expressing queerness has triumphed on our TV screens and in media, it’s important to be reminded that there are alternatives. We don’t all have to have the same coming-out stories and identify with labels like “gay” or “lesbian” — there are limitless possibilities out there for how we navigate our queerness. But Snyder’s and Stevens’ mission exists outside of gayborhoods, too. Not all Indigenous communities embrace people who are Two-Spirit, and many are not immune to the queerphobia that exists everywhere else in the country. Snyder tells me that one of his dreams is to help create a pan-tribal sense of Two-Spirit identity, so that more Native American people who identify with the label can come together and shape its future. When you’re in LA or New York, it’s easy to feel like you’re at the center of the queer world. In reality, the axis of that center shifts depending on what your values are. For Snyder and Stevens, I get the sense that that queer center lies not in gay clubs, bars and parades, but at pow wows and within each other. When they are dancing in sync it’s hard not to see them as two spirits that, once they connect to centuries-old ancestral beats, become one.

    "article_content": "Last year, I was invited to speak on a Métis panel at COP15 in Montreal about my community’s historical and persisting connection to the land. Throughout the conference, the voices that carried the most power were all Indigenous, which makes sense considering how much of the world’s biodiversity in forests, grasslands, deserts and marine environments is protected by Indigenous people — even though we make up less than 5% of the world population. I am a writer by craft, but my identity as an advocate for the health of the land runs strong in my blood. The connection between Indigenous peoples and the land we come from can never be severed because we believe that when the land is healthy, we are healthy. In many of my conversations with Indigenous land activists at the conference, we spoke of the difficulties that emerge when the descendants of white settler colonialists engage with our Indigenous-informed work. Even when we’re working toward similar goals, the perspectives we approach them from are worlds apart. At this event, I met Danielle Rey Frank , a member of the Hoopa Tribe and president of the Hoopa Valley High School Water Protectors Club. “One of the biggest challenges I face when working with primarily white conservation groups is having to be so informative about absolutely everything I do,” she told me. While communication and education were necessary, she described having to expend a lot of emotional labor teaching these groups about her Indigenous-based science practices and sacred bonds with the land. This resonated with me. As the only Indigenous person to ever participate in my graduate program’s creative nonfiction program, I was expected to provide extensive cultural context and explicit details of sacred ceremonies to my white counterparts. And while I want non-Indigenous people to gain knowledge and understanding and to ultimately become advocates, this took a mental toll on me. I wanted to be as accurate as possible while leaving room for the nuance of our tribal identities. Alleviating that emotional burden feels like an important step while collaborating to attain our collective 2030 climate change goals. And it’ll require a solid partnership between Indigenous land stewards and non-Native conservation groups, especially amidst the challenges. One blueprint for that partnership is currently coming to fruition. Jennifer Whitener Ulrich is a descendant of the Squaxin Island Tribe and COO of The Whitener Group, a consulting group dedicated to the advancement and sustainability of tribes. Along with Brie Fraley , an enrolled citizen of the Tolowa Dee-ni’ Nation and The Nature Conservancy’s director of North America Indigenous Landscapes and Communities , she helped produce Indian Country 101 , a training program that provides cultural context and guidance for non-Indigenous conservationists. Fraley toes the line between two worlds as a member of both of her Indigenous tribe protecting the land and the corporate, white-led conservation group. “There’s a call for action in Land Back, and I like to tell my colleagues that this is something Indian Country has given us to respond to,” said Fraley, who began using the term “Land Forward.” “Moving forward, how can we be in right relations with our Indigenous partners? How can we listen to their voices?” she asked. “How can we support their self-determination goals in their ancestral territories? The enabling conditions to make that happen is to build a competency capacity and that’s what Indian Country 101 does.” Indian Country 101 is narrated through an Indigenous perspective. While tribes have provided training to conservation groups before, this is the first training tool of its kind in terms of depth and accessibility, with the onus not placed on individual tribal members. The interactive, video and cue card modules are narrated by Ulrich with compassion, humor and just a touch of snark. For Indigenous communities, humor has always been a mode of healing and protection. Her style of communication is key. Ulrich has been working with various tribes, tribal-owned businesses and tribal nonprofits for years and has witnessed the complications when there’s a lack of understanding by white-led conservationists about the history of Indigenous peoples and how tribal governments operate. In its most transparent sentiment, the training program’s stated objective is to “ help you offend Native people 50% less and engage with Tribes 25% more effectively.” Tribal members who were not involved in creating the training recognize it as a positive thing overall, but it’s also important to note that nations are not homogenous. Frank, amidst her enthusiasm, noted there are a million ways things could go wrong. “Tribal Nations are not a monolith; we are unique individual nations with different traditions and values,” she said. “I think in order for anything of this nature to be effective, tribal governments and tribal people have to be leading it,” Frank added. The Whitener Group shared Frank’s perspective; it’s important to its leaders that the curriculum came solely from Indigenous perspectives and voices, which is why it dismissed research The Nature Conservancy did for the curriculum prior to the collaboration. While Indian Country 101 focuses on tribes specific to the Washington region, Fraley is already working to create specific training for Oregon tribes and she hopes to expand across the nation. These resources, which could take on many forms with the right support, could lessen so much of the emotional burden for all tribal nations. Outside of combatting cultural erasure, an educational touchstone could protect nations and people from having to rehash each belief, protocol and procedure of tribal governance that have protected these lands for time immemorial. And that protection might begin to address the trauma that’s come with America’s long history of theft.

    "article_content": "Florida’s restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors and adults are unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. The decision overturns the law banning gender-affirming care for minors, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy, that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed last year. It also relieves transgender adults of the requirement that patients see a physician in person for any transition-related care, a rule that was particularly burdensome given that most people received care from nurse practitioners and use telehealth appointments. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle in Tallahassee sided with the 11 plaintiffs, including four transgender adults and seven parents of transgender children. “The State of Florida can regulate as needed but cannot flatly deny transgender individuals safe and effective medical treatment ― treatment with medications routinely provided to others with the state’s full approval so long as the purpose is not to support the patient’s transgender identity,” Hinkle wrote. The 105-page order in Doe v. Lapado is the first time a federal court has weighed in on the constitutionality of restrictions on gender-affirming care for adults. Last year a federal judge struck down Arkansas’ ban for minors as unconstitutional. “Gender identity is real. Those whose gender identity does not match their natal sex often suffer gender dysphoria,” wrote Hinkle, a 72-year-old who was nominated by Democratic President Bill Clinton. “Florida has adopted a statute and rules that ban gender-affirming care for minors even when medically appropriate. The ban is unconstitutional.” The plaintiffs’ challenge, however, did not include the state’s restrictions on gender-affirming surgery, and the state still prohibits those procedures for minors and has some restrictions for adults. In the order, Hinkle criticized DeSantis and some state legislators who “plainly acted from old-fashioned discriminatory animus” and described the “frenzied rhetoric” of legislators who mischaracterized the kinds of care that transgender people seek as “castration” and “mutilation.” Hinkle quoted an unnamed state House member who ranted about the dangers of gender-affirming care and falsely described it as doctors “taking little children and they put them to sleep on a gurney. They cut off their breasts. They sever their genitalia. They throw them in the trash.” Hinkle blasted the state legislators and wrote that this statement is “probably about as far removed from reality as any statement by any legislator ever.” He instead cited the nearly two dozen American medical associations that support gender-affirming care for minors and adults and wrote that “not a single reputable medical association has taken a contrary position.” “Transgender opponents are of course free to hold their beliefs. But they are not free to discriminate against transgender individuals just for being transgender,” Hinkle wrote in the ruling. “In time, discrimination against transgender individuals will diminish, just as racism and misogyny have diminished. To paraphrase a civil-rights advocate from an earlier time, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” DeSantis signed the ban after the state medical boards ― filled with DeSantis’ political appointees ― first passed its own rules to ban that care in late 2022. Florida became the first state in the nation to pass such a ban. The Sunshine State passed six anti-LGBTQ bills in 2022 that included a ban on drag performances and a ban on transgender people using bathrooms in schools and government buildings. Under DeSantis’ helm, Florida enacted a slate of anti-LGBTQ bills amid a record-breaking two years of such legislation in states across the country. Last June, Hinkle issued a preliminary injunction against the state’s ban for minors, applying only to the three plaintiffs. In the order, he warned that the minors would “suffer irreparable harm” if they were not allowed to access treatment. That same month, he also struck down Florida’s prohibition on Medicaid coverage for treatments for gender dysphoria. Hinkle has generally ruled in favor of LGBTQ+ rights. In 2014, he ruled that Florida’s 2008 amendment barring same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. But in the decade after same-sex marriage became federally protected, the right wing has pivoted to attacking transgender people and particularly the rights of transgender minors. To date, more than 20 states, all of which have Republican-controlled legislatures, have passed bans and restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors, forcing families to make difficult decisions about how to best care for their child. And the courts have thus far issued mixed rulings . The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, allowed Alabama’s ban to go into effect, and the 6th Circuit, based in Ohio, ruled that Tennessee and Kentucky could enact their bans as well. But other appeals courts have blocked bans on transgender athletes joining teams that correspond with their gender, and the 11th Circuit sided with a Florida drag brunch spot, Hamburger Mary’s , to stop the state’s drag ban from taking place. In November, LGBTQ+ advocates asked the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in on Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care. The Supreme Court intervened in an Idaho ruling in April, focusing on how the state could enforce its ban on gender-affirming care and for whom. But neither the Supreme Court nor any U.S. Court of Appeals has yet to weigh in specifically on the constitutionality of restrictions for transition care, Hinkle wrote. Tuesday’s decision in Florida returns decisions about transgender medical care to the patients and their families, Simone Chriss, an attorney for the plaintiffs in the case and the director of the transgender rights initiative at Southern Legal Counsel, told The Tampa Bay Times . The ruling “restores some balance in terms of respect and dignity and decency in a state that has never been more in need of those things right now,” Chriss said.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost For decades, pregnant people have been arrested, charged with various crimes and jailed for their pregnancy outcomes. A 27-year-old white woman from Tennessee attempted suicide while pregnant in 1986. She survived, but the fetus was stillborn. She was arrested, charged with criminal abortion and held on a $5,000 bond. She pleaded not guilty for reasons of insanity. In 1999, Regina McKnight, a 22-year-old Black woman from South Carolina, gave birth to a five-pound stillborn baby. McKnight was drug tested after the birth and arrested in the hospital for “homicide by child abuse” because she tested positive for cocaine. Although it was not conclusive that the cause of the stillbirth was due to her drug use, McKnight was sentenced to 20 years in prison after the jury deliberated for only 15 minutes. Gabriela Flores, a 22-year-old woman from Mexico, managed her own abortion using pills in 2004 in South Carolina because she couldn’t afford a fourth child or the $700 in-clinic abortion on the $1.50 an hour she earned picking lettuce. Her neighbor found out about her abortion and called the cops, who initially wanted to charge Flores with homicide and seek the death penalty. Flores eventually pleaded guilty to an illegal abortion and spent a total of seven months in jail. These are just a few of the stories included in Grace E. Howard’s new book, “ The Pregnancy Police: Conceiving Crime, Arresting Personhood ,” in which she analyzes 1,116 pregnancy-related arrests that happened between 1973 and 2022 in Tennessee, South Carolina and Alabama. Although the cases vary from self-managed abortion to substance use and miscarriage, each person was arrested for crimes against their own pregnancy. “The criminal prosecution of pregnant people for crimes against the fertilized eggs, embryos, and fetuses they carry relies on a legal understanding that pregnant people occupy a different, lower space in the United States’ system of law,” Howard, who uses she/they pronouns, writes in her book. Howard, an associate professor of justice studies at San Jose State University, traces pregnancy-related prosecutions throughout history, specifically highlighting the intersections between drug use, race and class. “We’ve been taking rights away from folks because of their pregnancies, but we haven’t been naming it,” they told HuffPost. “What I try to do in the book is to trace out the places where pregnancy has been considered an exception to the norms.” HuffPost spoke with Howard by phone about pregnancy criminalization throughout history, and how the threat is likely to increase in a post-Roe world. Who are the “pregnancy police” included in your book title? They don’t exist as an actual department or agency. I hope they never will. Right now, the pregnancy police are made up of people in a bunch of different networks and agencies. I would argue that the pregnancy police even exist in our own minds. Sometimes we police one another, just as friends or family or random people who decide to weigh in. But the pregnancy police are mainly health care providers: 75% of these cases go to law enforcement because health care providers make a report. They’re also social workers, child protective service agents, law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, and sometimes it’s our neighbors telling on us, sometimes it’s our boyfriend telling on us. It really could be almost anyone. To me, that speaks to just how pervasive it is to socially police the behaviors of folks who are pregnant. Strangers who come up and say, “That’s decaf, isn’t it?” when you’re drinking a coffee. Or people who put their hand on your belly without asking first. Society feels a sense of ownership and entitlement over pregnant bodies. We’ve been seeing more and more right-wing rhetoric around fetal personhood — defining a fertilized egg, embryo or fetus as a person. Some states have written personhood into abortion bans post-Dobbs, while others are threatening fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization because of fetal personhood ideology. How does fetal personhood play into pregnancy criminalization? Currently, fetal personhood seems to be the primary motivating factor or at least the justification for criminalizing pregnancy. This idea that we need to protect these unborn children from their mothers who don’t love them, who won’t take care of them, who won’t do right by them — fetal personhood is a big part of that. Now that Roe v. Wade is gone and there is no federal protection that maintains a pregnant person’s rights before viability [around 24 weeks of pregnancy], it’s so much easier to put fetal personhood in the law when you don’t have to worry about viability being the determining factor. You looked at 1,116 arrests of pregnant people for crimes against embryos and fetuses in South Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee between 1973 and 2022. Are there any stories that really stick with you to this day? There’s the Marshae Jones case, where she was shot in the abdomen when she was pregnant. Marshae was going to be charged with manslaughter but the shooter wasn’t. National outrage eventually killed that case. But I am haunted by that case. I can’t help but think about what the precedent they were trying to set in that case could mean for victims of intimate partner violence. “This idea that we need to protect these unborn children from their mothers who don't love them, who won't take care of them, who won't do right by them — fetal personhood is a big part of that.” Abusers use pregnancy to control you, keep you in a relationship. They use children to create a legal bond, even after the relationship ends. So the idea that your abuser can beat you up and you get in trouble for it because you didn’t protect your pregnancy, and now you have even fewer options, because you’re charged with a crime? Terrifying. A large part of your book focuses on the criminalization of pregnant people for drug use during their pregnancies. Yes, most of the cases in my book do involve drugs. I know this will be hard for some people, the idea of a pregnant person using drugs. We’ve also been taught some very misleading, if not completely false things, about what certain substances will do to a pregnancy . But I feel compelled to carve out the distinction I’m making: I’m not saying that pregnant women have special rights to do drugs. I’m saying that people who aren’t pregnant don’t get charged with crimes for testing positive for drugs and pregnant people do – and that is a distinction. If we’re arresting you for possession or sales or manufacturing, that’s something we do all the time. We’re not charging pregnant people with those things, or at least not those things exclusively. We’re charging them with things like child abuse, homicide, delivery of drugs to a minor, in some cases manslaughter. Many of these are felonies. There are people spending decades in prison because of these kinds of cases. Can you talk to me about how substance use has been weaponized against pregnant people? We’ve been weird about substances for a long time. That’s something I learned while reading the history and literature for this book. Our concerns about substances are almost always tied to other, broader social concerns. It’s never just: This is bad for you. It’s almost always: This is bad for you because these people are the ones doing it. A wing of the prohibition of alcohol movement was doing it because slaves had been emancipated and people believed they were going to get drunk and rape white women. That has been true in our modern drug crisis as well. A lot of people are familiar with how the war on drugs and the focus on crack, in particular, was a big part of mass incarceration in the United States. A story that has been less explored — though there are wonderful feminist academics who have looked at it — is how much of the crack panic was about pregnant people and babies. It really was understood as these uncaring women who are irresponsible and selfish are birthing hordes of monsters that are going to ruin the United States. The way they described it with crack was that these children would be inherently violent, they wouldn’t be able to hold down a job, they’d be antisocial. It was interesting to read about the link between pregnancy criminalization and, as you wrote, the three “periods of radicalized drug panic”: South Carolina’s crack cocaine crisis, Alabama’s methamphetamine crisis and Tennessee’s opioid crisis. Right. After the crack crisis, it happened all over again in Alabama. During that time, they were really focused on meth. It was understood, at least in the Southeast, as a poor white trash drug. So, instead of poor Black inner-city people, now it’s poor white people in trailers. These babies were also described as they’re going to grow up and be psychotic and violent and cost a lot of money. And we [society] are going to have to pay for it because these selfish women won’t just love their babies enough to stop doing drugs. Then we see it repeated again in Tennessee with opioids. The way that we’ve talked about opioids has been somewhat different from the way we’ve talked about other modern drug crises. Part of that is because so many of the people that are addicted to opioids are folks who got injured on the job and now they’re hooked to these pills that they initially got through a medical prescription. So we have sympathy because they’re white and employed and it started as a medical thing instead of a fun or social thing. That, somehow, makes it better or more moral. Unfortunately, that understanding has not included pregnant folks. The talk about folks who are pregnant and use opioids is generally just as punitive, and the policy responses have been really punitive, too. It being considered a white working-class or middle-class drug hasn’t been enough to insulate the pregnant folks who are using it, too. You include a great quote from professor and author Michele Goodwin — whose work you note has been instructive to your book — about how “the criminalization of poor, pregnant women of color was perceived as a race issue — something too remote for feminist discourse and activism.” I love that Michele Goodwin quote. I’ve been thinking about it since the recent IVF case out of Alabama. There was so much national and international outrage — rightful outrage — that embryos are defined as extra-uterine children. “There are 38 states that have laws in their criminal codes that define either fertilized eggs, embryos or fetuses as crime victims, potentially.” That was an outrageous moment, and we should be angry. And also, most of those people have no idea that fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses have been considered legal children in Alabama since 2013, really. Then there’s the question of: Why don’t they know that? Why didn’t they care then? Where was the outrage then? To me, I can’t help but think it’s because of who can access IVF versus who is mostly getting arrested and put in jail. There’s not a lot of overlap there. Maybe if we [had] cared a little more then, we wouldn’t be where we are now. How did decades of ignoring pregnancy criminalization impact today’s landscape, now that we’re in a post-Roe world? There are 38 states that have laws in their criminal codes that define either fertilized eggs, embryos or fetuses as crime victims, potentially. It varies by state, but that’s a lot of states. Most of these bills were, typically, created in response to a really awful murder case of a pregnant person. These laws almost never get into the meat of it, which is that people’s intimate partners are the ones who are doing the harm to them, and maybe we need to approach it from that aspect. But these are all white women who are victims, who are murdered or lose their pregnancies because they are attacked, and they want some kind of legal recognition of the pregnancy loss so the person who hurt them gets heightened charges. So, 38 states have those laws, and in cases where we’ve had arrests in those states — which is all before Roe v. Wade was overturned — those arrests always happen after we recognize the fetus as a crime victim. Here’s how it goes: We established the fetus as a crime victim because a white, respectable woman got attacked. Then a non-respectable woman does something bad and we use that protective law to punish that bad woman. It is so easy for a state court to turn the fetus as a crime victim of third-party harm into a fetus that is now a victim of an abortion provider or the person who is gestating it. States are exploring this right now. Clarence Thomas pointed this out at the oral arguments for Dobbs. He didn’t name the case, but he referenced it. He asked, hey, if we’re allowed to punish women for using drugs during their pregnancy based on the idea that a fetus is a person, how in the hell is it legal for people to intentionally terminate their pregnancies? And you know what? Fair. If we’re being consistent, that doesn’t make sense. For me, we should either say it out loud, that pregnant people aren’t going to have rights — and that’s how we’re doing it — or we need to make sure pregnant folks have rights. So, do you think we’re on a path where more people will be criminalized for their pregnancy outcomes? I think so, for a few reasons. Yes, more states are exploring criminalization now. Most recently, Texas Republicans said they’re possibly going to pursue the death penalty for people who get abortions. We’re also seeing people taking greater legal risks to access abortion care. Because of the legal changes that have happened in states with abortion access, in particular, people are being put into positions where they are taking legal risks that they might not have had to before. You might have been able to go and get your first-trimester abortion in North Carolina, but now you have to order pills through the mail and hope you don’t get in trouble later. That is very scary to me. This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. Need help? In the U.S., call 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) for the National Domestic Violence Hotline .

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer When Emel, 34, consumed cannabis for the first time, it wasn’t at a house party with a cloud of smoke drifting up and onward, or any other clichéd scene that programs like D.A.R.E. used to warn her about — nor was it this great act of rebellion or dissent by an angsty American teen. It was 2009, and Emel, who omitted her last name to avoid drug-use stigma at her job, was at a backyard barbecue hosted by a college friend’s family, whose Mexican heritage meant that their East Los Angeles home swelled with mariachi music and the chatter of aunties and uncles. The homemade brownies were perched alongside the rest of the food on the table, she recalls, readily available for the adults. Emel felt safe enough at the party to know that she’d be taken care of in case something happened — so she tried some. “The thing I remember most is how peppery the brownie tasted,” she says. “It took an hour for the high to really hit. It was really subtle. It wasn’t scary or anything like that — it was really pleasant. It was in that moment that I was, like, ‘Oh, this isn’t that bad.’” But it wasn’t just the taste of the brownie that had surprised her. “Nothing else happened. The earth didn’t open up and swallow me in hell because I had an edible.” Emel grew up in Pakistan, then immigrated with her family to Los Angeles in 2003 when she was 15. Her traditional parents’ moral compass included reductive binaries that made ethics almost too simple: Don’t smoke, don’t drink and don’t dress provocatively. To do any of these things would make you “bad.” “I don’t think I’m a bad person — I think I’m a really good person,” she says. “But that battle will always be in the back of my mind because that’s how stigma boils it down.” Many cultures condemn cannabis, but there’s something uniquely bitter about the battle that’s been waged against the substance by the South Asian community. As misguided as this is, many (especially older) members cling to their “model minority” status, and consuming weed is, well, not model minority behavior. This judgment of cannabis use manifests in harmful rhetoric that’s internalized by people like Emel who consume with caution and intention. It’s not uncommon for brown people to hide their cannabis usage from the watchful and discerning eye of the cultural community they live in, which sometimes views users of the plant as “lazy stoners,” even though the myth has been thoroughly debunked . Yet it was always “log kya kahenge” — “what will people think” in Hindi — a catchphrase that our parents have thought out loud when we veered away from what they deem the safest and most honorable behavior. “I think South Asians are one of the most community-based groups, which is a positive thing,” says Nidhi Lucky Handa, founder of the California-based cannabis company Leune . “But the exact opposite is true as well. The community is very concerned with what people think.” A child of immigrant parents from India, Handa grew up in the suburbs of Boston. Though her parents were open to having conversations about traditionally taboo topics, like cannabis, Handa couldn’t say the same about her larger, conservative brown community. “When there was a function or birthday party, I was very aware that, even amongst my Indian peers, I would never talk about cannabis. It was an assumption that, at best, they might also smoke weed, but then it would get back to their parents and then put me in some sort of category of being a bad influence.” Handa founded Leune in California — more than 3,000 miles away from this community in Boston — with the kind of IDGAF attitude that would make her younger self proud. The stigma she grew up with lurked in the background at times; she acknowledges that the physical distance served as armor against the whispers of the community she had grown up in. Away from home, she was able to focus on navigating the industry’s complex supply chains and ebb-and-flowing legalization. Not to mention, as a BIWOC founder in the industry, she had to face the additional laborious hurdle of having to dismantle its predominantly male and white landscape. Though it’s easy for South Asians to deem the plant and its users as “bad influences,” the community’s stigma around the plant feels inherently contradictory. For one, it’s the South Asian cultures’ reverence for Earth and its natural elements that have led some brown people to see cannabis not as an offender but rather as another terrestrial inhabitant. “The way that my parents were, they were very interested in preventative medicine, homeopathy, ayurveda. So, from where I was sitting, cannabis was a plant first,” Handa says. Pari Patel, a 25-year-old who’s studying medical cannabis science and cultivating her own homegrown cannabis farm, agrees. “Having a green thumb is in my blood. I grew up with the farms in India owned by generations of farmers,” the New Yorker says. “I’m a Patel, after all, so that’s our known trait back in the motherland.” Patel’s exposure to cannabis, however, wasn’t born solely out of curiosity. “I actually learned about [cannabis] in religious school, in a story about how the lordship used ‘bhang,’” she says, referring to the low-potent paste made from the leaves of the cannabis plant that dates to as early as 1,000 BCE. On Hindu religious holidays that celebrate Lord Shiva, like the spring festival Holi, bhang is traditionally used in food and drink: cold and milky “thandai,” thick and creamy “lassi” and ghee-ful sweets, among other sugary and savory concoctions. Cannabis has also been recognized in both ayurvedic and Unani systems of ancient medicine as a treatment for endemic diseases like malaria, among other ailments. “The Atharva Veda” — one of four sacred pieces of Indian literature — calls bhang (which English translations posit as hemp) one of the five “kingdoms” of plants that “free us from distress,” and varying legends across India tell tales of Lord Shiva’s consumption of bhang (this is why it’s present at religious festivals that honor him). It’s this very mythological and religious significance that has allowed bhang to escape India’s otherwise strict cannabis criminalization . If cannabis has been interwoven in the fabric of South Asian existence, where exactly did the stigma around it come from? In the U.S. and many other Western nations, the answer may not be so elusive: politics. “It’s a much more linear thing to understand in the U.S. This is a plant that has been used as a weapon, to fuel the industrial complex and to further structural racism,” Handa says. “This country is founded on this great ability to bring people together over their mutual hate for immigrant groups.” In fact, Indian immigrants — along with Mexican immigrants and Black people — were in the crossfire of an ensuing century-long political smear campaign against cannabis beginning in the early 1900s. California’s cannabis prohibition in 1913 was accompanied by public health official Henry J. Finger’s contempt of the “Hindoos” — who were in reality predominantly Punjabi Sikh people — “a very undesirable lot” for “initiating our whites into this habit.” The “war on drugs,” which labeled cannabis as a “gateway drug,” coincided with the influx of South Asian immigration following the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. In 1985, the Reagan administration successfully pressured the Rajiv Gandhi-led India, a nation looking to strengthen its relations with the U.S. and tap into American technology , to outlaw cannabis vis-a-vis the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, codifying cannabis hostility into law on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Despite all this context about how weed stigma persists for South Asian Americans, some have a hard time acknowledging that very stigma could be, at least partially, a part of their assimilation process. Within our diaspora, there’s a tendency to accept ideologies, no matter how stigmatized, as impenetrable truths when they’re coming from authority figures within political, legal and social structures. For first- and second-generation brown people in the diaspora, adjusting to certain so-called truths was a matter of survival. Cannabis was a symbol of calamity, especially as South Asians massively immigrated against the backdrop of the war on drugs; witnessed the resulting mass, disproportionate incarceration of Black people; and navigated a post-9/11 world that already stigmatized brown people. Being “good” and keeping our heads down were perceived to be the safest options. Emel, who was raised in a Pakistani Muslim family, agrees. “It never made sense to me that a man could marry outside his religion in Islam but a woman can’t ,” she says. “There are certain ideas and structures that are ingrained within us, and we accept them without question.” Increasingly, however, brown people are challenging these predisposed, unjust structures. Patel says that, though her family disapproves of her using cannabis, she’s no longer willing to hide her cannabis use on social media and in real life. “A lot of people who have judged me have now come around and are users themselves.” Handa has noted a welcome shift in her community’s attitudes since launching Leune. “It was a ‘don’t talk about what she’s doing’ thing for a while,” she says. “Now I’ll get a random call, text or email asking, ‘Are you raising money? Can I invest?’” Challenging stigmas also manifests in education. It’s important to note that cannabis can be addictive, especially for those who start as teens. But it’s crucial to recognize that cannabis can be a source of both physical and mental healing when used with informed guidance and intention. Emel, Handa and Patel all credit weed for helping them through anxiety and other mental health struggles — a benefit that’s beginning to be backed by research . And, despite being demonized as an gateway drug, cannabis has actually shown potential as an exit drug in preventing opioid , tobacco and alcohol misuse. Medical marijuana has also been used to alleviate chronic pain and seizures in children . Feelings around the plant are contradictory and complicated, and breaking down these barriers can be taxing. But for many South Asians, it’s worth the struggle. “At the end of the day, [cannabis] is something that helps me be a better and healthier version of myself,” Emel says. “That is more valuable to me than preventing myself from doing something that’s ‘unsavory’ and suffering from it — preventing myself from being the whole person I can be.”"

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer The debut of “Velma” late last week — a reboot posited to be the adult, modern reinvention of TV classic “Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?” — came with an impressive achievement: It was the most-watched premiere of an animated series on HBO Max. Previews built hype for months leading up to it, boasting a diverse Mystery Inc. crew accompanied by an equally diverse and star-studded cast of voices: a South Asian protagonist Velma (Mindy Kaling), an East Asian Daphne (Constance Wu), a Black Norville, aka Shaggy, (Sam Richardson), with Shay Mitchell, Jane Lynch, Wanda Skyes and others voicing minor characters. The icing on top was the hint of an unfolding queer love between our two frenemies, Velma and Daphne. So, w hat’s not to love? Brown viewers, including myself, have some notes. We arrived to the series, executive-produced by Kaling, only to experience some unsavory South Asian tropes that simply don’t reflect the nuance of our ethnic identities. It’s a track we’re far too familiar with, having experienced it across “ The Mindy Project,” “Never Have I Ever ” and “ The Sex Lives of College Girls” : disparaging comments about body hair and being unattractive, relegation to being a loner and misfit, and thirsty quips over an aggressively mediocre white man. Don’t get me wrong; the series’ white male showrunner, Charlie Grandy, is also entirely accountable for these depictions. Yet the show falls back on what critics call Kaling’s familiar pattern of self-insertion, which centers whiteness as a source of validation and displaces brownness across now four different, highly publicized series. In Kaling’s three other shows, whiteness emerged as an aspiration in the romantic relationships of characters Mindy Lahiri (“The Mindy Project”), Devi Vishwakumar (“Never Have I Ever”) and Bela Malhotra (“ The Sex Lives of College Girls”) . And it’s not sitting right with us anymore. We’ve evolved past the era of using our culture as a gag line or a reason for self-deprecation. While promoting “Velma,” Kaling raised our hopes when she acknowledged the significance of reimagining the protagonist as a brown girl. “The essence of Velma is not necessarily tied to her whiteness,” she said last fall. “And I identify so much as her character, and I think so many people do, so it’s like, yeah, let’s make her Indian in this series.” Kaling’s right, in a superficial sense. In the series, Velma isn’t technically tied to whiteness — she probably ticks off “Asian,” then “South Asian” on her fictional standardized tests. But in Velma’s neon-soaked animated world, being brown has two connotations — being a punchline at worst (the second scene in the first episode is a rapid sequence commenting on Velma’s weight, “handsome face,” and “hairy gorilla arms”) or being ignored at best. The gray area that Velma occupies represents a divide: Is Kaling doing the work of the bullies by putting down her own brown protagonist? Or is she, as a brown person, perfectly justified in making these jokes? Velma’s character (who, to be clear, is written by a group of people and not just Kaling), is reminiscent of the world roughly a decade ago. It was a time when audiences were still laughing at Apu Nahasapeemapetilon on “The Simpsons” and comedian Russell Peters (who conveniently voices Velma’s father, Aman), who used trite stereotypes about Indians in his stand-up. “ The Mindy Project” debuted in 2012 employing the very tropes we see in “ Velma ,” ones that would only somehow reincarnate in each subsequent show by its titular creator ( less so in “ Never Have I Ever,” but exaggerated in ” The Sex Lives of College Girls” ). Of course, it’s not easy to create a singular character who represents all South Asian Americans, since our experiences can’t be homogenized. And the show does have some great nuances — particularly in making Velma queer , something that past depictions of her character have assiduously avoided. I argue, though, that we’ve evolved past that era of using our culture as a gag line or a reason for self-deprecation. And so, when I saw the first two episodes of “Velma,” I immediately went to social media to see if it was sitting wrong with anyone else. And, based on the deluge of disappointed tweets, I wasn’t alone. Here are a few that resonated the most: I’m happy Mindy Kaling’s style of writing brown girls that hate themselves wasn’t around when I was younger & only became a thing when I was at the age where I loved my heritage and skin color. I can’t imagine being young & already self conscious and then seeing that portrayal. It’s wild to me that #Velma was the thing that sparked all the Mindy Kaling criticism. Mindy always thrived for white validation in her work. She wrote this scene. A young Indian girl eagerly rejects her culture bc she thinks having a white boyfriend is better & more appealing. pic.twitter.com/O5utwqQePl mindy kaling needs to stop portraying indian girls as losers. i’m personally extremely cool and sick of it #Velma So, Velma is a brown girl in this show, and Fred is a racist, rude douchebag?! In addition, she’s CRUSHING on him at the same time acknowledging that he’s rude. This is terrible!! pic.twitter.com/3Fb9R5KPVD Velma is unfortunately just the latest in a series of brown girl characters written by Mindy Kaling that represent brown girls by stripping them of their brownness (as well as their moral compass sometimes 😬) https://t.co/dIlQzOgLq9 Actually I’ve been seeing a lot of Velma discourse on my feed and wanted to share my quick two cents: Can we please get some positive Brown Girl rep for once?? Why does every brown girl have to be written to be self-hating and insufferable??

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer In recent years, many members of the Korean entertainment industry have been more vocal about mental illness — especially after the deaths of several rising stars, including actor Yoo Joo-eun in 2022 and actor/singer Kim Jong-hyun in 2017. The community’s most recent loss is Moon Bin, a 25-year-old K-pop star and member of the boy group Astro, whose manager reportedly found him dead of suspected suicide last week. Suicide in the K-pop community has received more attention in recent years. While nobody can pinpoint the exact reason these losses have compounded, there’s no question that the pressure these celebrities experience from a young age — including the burden of exporting Korean culture to the rest of the world — is a major contributing factor . On top of that, the industry pushes artists to be highly “likable” and have a variety of talents and skills , treating them more like products than real people. Still, I can’t help but feel that this isn’t just a K-pop trauma. It’s a cultural one, too. In South Korea, suicide is a leading cause of death for young people, Time magazine reports . And the country ranks high in suicide rates globally. As someone who is part of the Asian diaspora, events like this hit close to home because they’re part of a larger and unacknowledged crisis that exists in our communities. As children, many of us are taught that our achievements and service to others are more important than our well-being and that being depressed just means you’re not trying hard enough to get better. For these artists, I can only speculate about the connection between depression and their apparent suicides. We may never actually know what led to their deaths — nor do we have the right to pry — but the conversations they have sparked are enough for us to take action. I t feels evident enough that when we, as people of Asian descent, refuse to talk about mental health issues, those problems don’t go away. We’re just forced to confront them alone. Combined with other stressors many Asian Americans face outside of the home, like the perpetual foreigner stereotype , it’s not hard to see why some of us feel the need to hide depression and anxiety. In the U.S., the mental health crisis among AAPI individuals is on the rise. In fact, nearly 15% of Asian Americans 18 or older reported having a mental illness in a 2018 survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Also, Asian American college students are believed to have higher rates of suicidal ideations than their white counterparts, according to a study cited by the American Psychological Association. The pressure to excel at an unrealistic level is not just present in entertainment but in many other areas of our lives. Even after high-profile deaths like Moon Bin’s, we continue to dance around this issue. This might feel harsh, but it’s time for more of us to take responsibility for the mental health crisis in our own communities. Whether it’s working to the point of exhaustion or studying to get into good universities at the expense of our own wellness, we need to evaluate what “success” means to us. Mental illness is an issue that Asian and Asian diaspora communities can no longer afford to ignore.

    "article_content": "On a recent date with a non-Asian man, I mentioned that I wanted to read more about Asian women’s struggles, especially in America. He scratched his head and wondered out loud, “Asian women’s struggles?” To him, Asian women did not struggle. Data shows that we are favored by men on dating apps, and stereotypes suggest that we are “smart” enough to get ahead in the world, “docile” and “submissive,” and “small,” “cute” and non-threatening. How could we struggle, right? My date did express sympathy for Asian women who are harassed and assaulted on the streets, as well as sadness about the recent deaths of Michelle Go and Christina Yuna Lee in New York. But he didn’t appear to grasp the oppression and erasure that Asian women experience regularly, outside of physical violence. Much of the anti-Asian sentiment that we can’t see serves as a seed for physical violence. But even when it doesn’t, it hurts and it holds us back. Therein lies the problem with #StopAsianHate. It has a limited definition of what racism toward us looks and feels like on a daily basis. Many acts of hatred toward Asian women are rooted in Asian misogyny, which is often disguised as a popular and accepted narrative about “loving” or preferring Asian women. Without looking at how Asian women in America have been regarded throughout time, we can’t really understand (and destroy) the current ecosystem of Asian hate. While it sounds counterintuitive, receiving love as an Asian woman can involve the residue of a specific type of xenophobia. Some white women, for instance, fought to keep Asian women in America when it was popular to exclude them . But their intentions weren’t exactly noble: Without Asian women’s domestic service, their homes would have been a mess , and, well, they would have had to mop their own floors. Some of these white women claimed that they loved Asian women. But their “advocacy” reflected a stereotype that harms us to this day, instilling the idea that we are no more than service workers, a labor force both disposable and cheap . And despite Andrew Yang’s jokes about Asians being good at math (which implies that we’re predominantly highly employable, white-collar workers), in 2020, Asian Americans made up the highest share of long-term unemployed workers in America. It’s a warped, transactional and dehumanizing 'love' of Asian women that leaves us vulnerable as our community remains divided and as people deny, overlook, forget and erase our journey. Wanting and appreciating us as submissive assistants isn’t real love. Recognizing only parts of us without seeing us as whole humans deserving of equal rights isn’t love. Real love, to my ancestors, would have looked like a collective fight for their rights to citizenship and social and financial equity, not just for their ability to serve white households. It’s time for us to recognize that unchecked mentality that still exists today. People may want to date us — because they fetishize us as exotic, hypersexual , and excited to submit to a male partner. But we are rarely voted for and are unlikely to lead entire organizations at which white people work. In dating and at work, there’s a palpable difference between being desired and being valued. Many Asian women have experienced the former quite intensely. Very few have experienced the latter. Asian women have yet to be seen for the totality of our humanity, supported in our ambitions and lifted from our assigned place as secondary so we can lead the masses. It’s no accident that feminist activists of the Asian diaspora such as Grace Lee Boggs , Patsy Mink , Mabel Lee and Evelyn Yoshimaru are not household names. We deserve to strongly influence the public discourse and make decisions that impact millions. Relegating us to the back is a form of violence, and in order to actively stop Asian hate, we have to unearth every form of it and address it head-on. Truly loving Asian women also means letting go of the model minority myth . We are not and shouldn’t be expected to be people of silent resilience whose suffering is effectively erased to attack another minority group. White supremacy, if you haven’t noticed, “loves” Asian people. A U.S. News and World Report published in 1966 read, “At a time when it is being proposed that hundreds of billions be spent to uplift Negroes and other minorities, the nation’s 300,000 Chinese-Americans are moving ahead on their own—with no help from anyone else.” White supremacist propaganda like this perpetuates systemic oppression of other minority groups, all while denying the struggles of the Asian people. Deeming us a model minority is an implicit recruitment of Asian people into a group that oppresses without removing our own minority status in any other real ways. The uptick in assaults on Asian American women has awakened the country in some ways — but we’re only beginning to surface other types of violence we experience on a day-to-day basis. It is frustratingly challenging to convince people that the Atlanta shooting was racially motivated when it’s obvious that the victims were seen as disposable. It is equally frustrating to always remind people to ask themselves “why her?” whenever an Asian woman such as Michelle Go or Christina Yuna Lee is harassed, attacked, stalked and murdered. It’s a warped, transactional and dehumanizing “love” of Asian women that leaves us vulnerable as our community remains divided and as people deny, overlook, forget and erase our journey. For those who want to be a better advocate from within the community or outside of it, examine how you may be participating in systemic oppression. A step toward progress might come from determining whether your love serves us or just holds us back.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer The first time I saw a sexy Asian man on TV, he was doing kung fu. In my world, he was the only mainstream famous Asian man, a belief reaffirmed by strangers who would call me by his name: “Hey, Jackie Chan!” Before I could comprehend the prejudice behind those words, I was proud to be compared to someone so iconic. Growing up, I began to see other Asian men on TV, but they were decidedly less sexy. I grew up on Ken Jeong’s characters in “Community” and “The Hangover.” Although hilarious, his Asian maleness always felt like part of the joke. Hollywood has a long and ugly history of portraying Asian men from all corners of the diaspora as weak, undesirable, nerdy and asexual tropes that are perpetuated everywhere, from dating apps to porn sites . While the 2010s gave us “Crazy Rich Asians,” the rise of K-Pop and “Shang-Chi,” it still felt like Asian men in movies and TV existed in sexual extremes. They were either fetishized — declared sexual demigods like Henry Golding and Simu Liu — or deemed sexually irrelevant. The full spectrum of humanity simply did not exist for Asian American men. Then came Season 2 of “The White Lotus,” which was the first time I saw an Asian male on screen that was equal parts captivating and sexually complex. A month after the latest season wrapped up, I couldn’t figure out why I couldn’t stop thinking about Ethan Spiller’s character and why he resonated so much. And then it hit me. Finally, here was an Asian male character that was sexually nuanced. Despite being on vacation in picturesque Italy, for much of the season, Ethan, played by Will Sharpe, seems uninterested in having sex with his frustrated wife, Harper, played by Aubrey Plaza. At one point, Harper finds Ethan mid-jerk off and tries desperately to create the circumstances for him to have sex with her, to no avail. Whatever your opinion of Ethan, to see an Asian man pursued, to be simultaneously horny but not horny enough to have sex with his wife, was new. And sure, the outline of the giant dick we saw might have been a prosthetic , but it got its point across that Asian men get to have complex desires of their own instead of just being a prop for other characters. Ethan is a departure from traditional Asian male representation on TV, and it’s worthy of examination since it clues us into why mainstream depictions of Asian men are so off in the first place. There’s one obvious problem with an entire demographic being deemed undesirable by the Western media, asserts Karen Wu, an associate professor of psychology at California State University, Los Angeles. This can make it challenging for Asian American men to find romantic partners. And that not only sucks, but it can also create inferiority complexes. An OKCupid survey from 2014, a few years before Asians became more prominent in Hollywood, found that Asian men are the group most likely to be rejected on dating apps. Although there’s more visibility for Asian American men than ever before, many continue to run into issues that stem, at least in part, from stereotypes perpetuated in popular culture. Wu tells me that this type of rejection leads to harmful behaviors like working out obsessively, fixating on finding white partners, or (in extreme cases) becoming incels . And so, this message that there are very few sexy Asian men, with the rest being labeled undesirable, is damaging on several levels. However, Wu tells me that Asian men can become aware of this pervasive negative representation and work together with their community to demand better. “Asian men and women are often pitted against each other, and Asian women are sometimes blamed for Asian men not being deemed desirable,” Wu says. However, she urges all genders within the community to recognize the source of the issues and actively work to dismantle them. While Ethan is beautifully complex, there are whiffs of the same old Hollywood BS. The actor who plays him, Will Sharpe, is biracial and half-white Asians have often been deemed a more palatable and less risky form of on-screen Asian male representation. On top of that, Ethan’s character is, in some ways vouching for the approval of his best friend, a white man. Some could argue that he is still portrayed as sexless because, for most of the series, he doesn’t have sex with his wife and doesn’t seem interested in the sex workers his friend hires. But the significant departure from any other Asian male representation is that he does have the opportunity for sex — he just doesn’t exercise it. So the ball, for once, is in an Asian man’s court. Ultimately, the allure of Ethan’s character lies in the fact that he seems unconcerned with proving his desirability, and everyone around him seems to agree that he’s worthy of being pursued. The last time I saw an equally complex male Asian character was Glenn Rhee, played by Steven Yeun, from “The Walking Dead.” But that’s it. And in contrast to Glenn, Ethan seems more concerned with navigating the uncomfortable dynamics between himself and his best friend, Cameron, than keeping a partner. As a result, Ethan is given a chance to be a mediocre straight man who can’t satisfy his wife and (possibly) cheats. Wu and I agreed that he’s not the shiniest example of an Asian American man. Still, maybe that’s precisely what we need right now — to see one who gets to be mediocre, or perhaps more accurately, to exist on a spectrum of human complexity that includes desirable and undesirable. In Hollywood, white men have always gotten to be morally complex and still be main characters — we should all be allowed the same privilege. Maybe that mediocrity will finally give our Asian male characters (and real Asian men) permission to own our nuanced existences.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer When 27-year-old Hetal Vasavada was faced with a rice challenge on “MasterChef” S eason 6 , she knew exactly what to do. “Everyone’s panicking, like, ‘I don’t know what to make.’ But all I could think about was khichdi,” she says with a laugh. Vasavada intimately knows the power of good khichdi . When she was a child, her grandmother would feed her heaping spoonfuls of the South Asian staple made from rice and lentils — with “a crap-ton of ghee,” of course. She and her family also attended khichdi parties, where other families proudly shared batches of their generational recipes with one another. And despite going through a period where she simply had enough of the hearty comfort food, she found herself seeking it out again when she left home for college, and throughout the years after. It ultimately became a career-defining tool for her, emerging as one of the best dishes in that round of ” MasterChef .” Of course, the show’s pantry was not the haven of Indian spices found at her parents’. So Vasavada made do with what she had: green lentils instead of mung beans and roasted almonds instead of cashews to top the dish. “I mean, that is the essence of khichdi — it’s whatever you have on hand.” The dish impressed judges Gordon Ramsay, Graham Elliot and Christina Tosi, but everyone else seemed to be rather agitated. “I got shitted on by both sides: by Indians, for not making everything ‘authentic’ ... I mean, I was just working with my constraints,” she says, of the comments she received online. “Then Americans were like, ‘You can’t be MasterChef because all you do is cook Indian food.’” Vasadava has written a bestselling cookbook and her food blog @milkandcardamom , an amalgam of unique Indian fusion recipes, has a huge and dedicated following. But her experience is far too familiar to many among the diaspora, who often get told they’re neither American nor South Asian enough. I can relate. As a child of Indian immigrants who delicately balanced assimilation with cultural preservation, I struggled with my Hindi. I understood it perfectly, but my American-accented and broken “Hinglish” responses inspired sympathy chuckles from more fluent speakers. I could dance, but not with the same instinct and flair as Madhuri Dixit, Aishwarya Rai or my friends who were born with The Gift. South Asian friends in high school and college took me to garbas , dressed up with me for Diwali parties, and threw colored powder at me during Holi — but I couldn’t ignore the uneasiness that begged the question, are you Indian enough to be here? In my early 20s, I’ve been reflecting on that question more. And, like so many other quandaries, it led me to TikTok and Instagram. I stumbled upon FoodTok and Foodstagram, which sit at the most delicious corner of the internet. The short videos of South Asian fusion recipes—chutney grilled cheeses, masala burgers, butter chicken wings, and so much more—inspired stomach rumbles. But they also evoked a sense of nostalgia for my own mother’s Indian fusion cooking: veggie quesadillas spiced with garam masala, paneer coated in Indonesian sambal oelek chili paste and soy sauce, and paninis stuffed with aloo masala (savory, spiced potatoes) and cheese. For many who grew up in the South Asian diaspora, desi-fied food made up an entire culinary subculture. It was a fragrant, garlicky and ginger-y, melting pot of cultures served up at the dinner table. And from that movement, South Asian American, South Asian Canadian, and any other concatenation have actually become identities on their own, rather than haphazard products of the two cultures they represent. Palak Patel is the foodie behind @thechutneylife , a blog she describes as a visual love letter to her identity. Her mother, who’s from the Indian state of Gujarat, cooked fusion food from whatever was in the pantry to satiate her kid’s cravings for “American” food, which often turned into a grand, muti-ethnic culinary affair. “My mom would make eggplant parm, for example, and there’d be mustard seeds, or cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella,” she tells me. Patel fell in love with the blends of flavors as an adult—especially the savory, mouth-watering union of Indian and Mexican food. “I’d want to make my mom’s enchiladas, and I never got her recipe, but I knew they had some sort of Indian touches in it. I’d Google ‘Indian-style enchiladas,’ and I’d find absolutely nothing,” she says. It was this void that led Patel to create The Chutney Life—that, and the need to convert her mother’s ambiguous pinches of this , and her handfuls of that to finite ounces and cups. “Her kitchen didn’t have measuring cups, so I’d take all of mine, then have her put the spices on a plate, to literally scoop it back up and measure it.” Though the process wasn’t easy, Patel’s tedious documentation of her mother’s recipes came to codify her cultural identity. For that, the food that defined her childhood, and by extension the subculture of brownness it represents, is permanently etched onto the fabric of the internet. TikToker Shihan Chowdhury, who immigrated from Bangladesh to Maryland when he was five, also thrived at the intersection of South Asian and American food culture. “My dad would buy those plain cheese frozen pizzas, and he’d put desi toppings on it: literally masala chicken or caramelized onions,” he recounts. “Then, when it came out of the oven, he’d sprinkle green chili peppers over it.” Those little green chili peppers were found in nearly every dish Chowdhury ate growing up—so his TikTok handle, @chilipeppercooks , is an ode to the small-but-mighty flavor bomb we all know well. Today, they’re featured in many of his desi-esque recipes, like masala potato chips , cheesy beef samosas , and tandoori chicken melts . But, what is authenticity really? Being transparent about how our upbringing shaped the way we eat, speak and live feels about as authentic as you can get. Chowdhury grew up watching his mother and grandmother cook to provide both sustenance and affection. But it was when he watched Chef’s Table on Netflix, an Emmy-nominated show that marries chefs’ culinary innovation with their personal stories, that his perception of cooking fundamentally changed. “It was then that I realized, it’s not about making really good food and eating it. It’s an art form,” he says. And this art isn’t an imitation of life; instead, it’s instead a reflection of how we live it—in a beautiful (and sometimes cacophonous) harmonizing of two cultures. “Having a western upbringing, we already grew up eating so many different types of food,” Chaheti Bansal, the creator behind @rootedinspice , tells me. “We’re able to go to an Asian or Hispanic grocery store and get ingredients. The accessibility we have is unlike any other generation before us.” And while it’s all pretty revolutionary, haters never fail to do what they do best. For Vasavada, Bansal, and most creators, some of the comments on their videos shun their culinary choices and attack them for being inauthentic. But, what is authenticity really? Being transparent about how our upbringing shaped the way we eat, speak and live feels about as authentic as you can get. “First of all, Asian cuisine is so regional and diverse. Just because my mom makes, let’s say, dal in a way that’s authentic to our family, your family might make dal in a completely different way — and that’s authentic to you,” Bansal says. Bansal’s mother is from Jaipur, which has an arid culture leading to lentils and legumes dominating diets, while her father comes from Kolkata, home to India’s oldest port and where fish is a staple. But it was her mother’s experimentation in the kitchen, blending these regional flavors, that made Indian food Bansal’s favorite cuisine growing up. What emerged for her was a distinct micro-cuisine, if you could call it that — one that’s unique and authentic to her family. For TikToker Bilal Bhatti of @goldengully , the evolution of a recipe is both crucial and inevitable. “It’s hard to say whether my current recipes are 100% ‘authentic,’” he notes. “Maybe my great-grandmother swapped an ingredient in a recipe given to her grandmother, but then my great-great-great-great grandmother might say, ‘Nah, this ain’t authentic.’” Bhatti describes a kind of oral tradition that celebrates each generation bringing something new to the table — and emphasizes the act of passing down recipes rather than the final product. The latter is something he does through his TikTok series “Mama.” In it, his mother, who immigrated from Pakistan to Canada, walks us through making regional dishes like pakora curry , paya , and a fried fish dish popular in Karachi, where she’s from. For those in the diaspora watching, these clips take us home: the sizzle of white onion in hot oil, the gentle crunch of cilantro being chopped, and the soft-spoken instructions in Urdu, her native tongue. Though dishes may look different between families and generations, our generation is still able to wield the same spirit as our food-loving ancestors. “Growing up, anytime something good happened, you’d see my mom making seero in the morning,” Vasavada reminisces. “There’s that love of wanting to celebrate accomplishments, then sharing it with others.” For her and her peers, each bite is a vignette of the food, kitchens and people who raised them. To share our food with others is to share a piece of ourselves. This art isn’t an imitation of life; instead, it’s a reflection of how we live it — in a beautiful (and sometimes cacophonous) harmonizing of two cultures. If food is a love language, these creators have helped me speak it into existence as I explore my brownness with new confidence. These days, I find myself asking my mother to save some garam masala for me when she makes it in batches; planning trips to South Asian grocery stores in New York City’s Murray Hill neighborhood; blending herbs and spices together to remake my mother’s green chutney recipe, passed down from her own mother; and proudly sending pictures of my concoctions on my family WhatsApp. The positive reinforcement from my aunties and uncles in the U.S. and abroad just hits differently. The South Asian diaspora isn’t a monolith, and neither is the food we create. For that, I have embraced the -esque, the -ish, the ambiguity, the gray space its aromas fill. Cooking this food — a peculiar yet nostalgic amalgam of spices, ingredients and memories — is like peering into a mirror. Looking back at me is a blend of two cultures, neither totally Indian nor American. But it’s 100% authentic.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Matt Bomer may be one of Hollywood’s most sought-after film and television actors these days, but he says he lost out on a major role early in his career after being outed as gay. Appearing on The Hollywood Reporter’s “Awards Chatter” podcast Monday, Bomer recalled auditioning decades ago for the titular role in “ Superman: Flyby ,” a planned film written by J.J. Abrams and set to be directed by Brett Ratner. “It looked like I was the director’s choice for the role,” he said, noting that the project was linked to a three-picture deal he’d recently signed with Warner Bros. “It never came to light.” When Bomer was asked if his sexuality had been a factor in losing the part, he said, “Yeah, that’s my understanding.” He continued: “That was a time in the industry when something like that could still really be weaponized against you. How, and why, and who [was involved], I don’t know. But yeah, that’s my understanding.” Though “Superman: Flyby” never materialized, the project underwent significant retooling and eventually became 2006’s “ Superman Returns ,” directed by Bryan Singer and featuring Brandon Routh as the Man of Steel. Fortunately, Bomer said, he ended up receiving an early script for USA Network’s “White Collar” — which gave him his breakout role — shortly after the “Superman: Flyby” debacle. The actor, who is married to film and TV publicist Simon Halls , came out publicly in 2012 while accepting an award for his HIV/AIDS advocacy work. “I’d really especially like to thank my beautiful family: Simon, Kit, Walker, Henry,” he said at the time, referring to Halls and the couple’s three sons. “Thank you for teaching me what unconditional love is. You will always be my proudest accomplishment.” Since then, Bomer has gone on to portray gay characters in films like “ The Normal Heart ” and “The Boys in the Band.” Last year, he starred opposite Jonathan Bailey in the queer-themed romantic drama “ Fellow Travelers ,” and is widely considered an Emmy Awards front-runner for his performance. It’s long been rumored that Bomer’s hopes of playing Superman were dashed because of his sexuality, though the actor’s “Awards Chatter” interview appears to be the first time he’s addressed the speculation. In 2012, E! News reported that Ratner’s departure had led to “Superman: Flyby” getting scrapped, not Bomer’s sexuality. “Brett knew Matt was gay. They’re good friends,” a source told the outlet. “Matt not being Superman had nothing to do with his sexuality. It was because the director changed.” Listen to Bomer discuss “Superman: Flyby” beginning around the 19:19 mark below: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointees on Wednesday gave final approval to an agreement that buries the hatchet between Disney and the governing district for Walt Disney World, which the Florida governor took over after the company two years ago publicly opposed a state law critics dubbed “Don’t Say Gay.” The five DeSantis-appointed board members to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District unanimously voted to approve a 15-year development deal in which the district committed to making infrastructure improvements in exchange for Disney investing up to $17 billion into Disney World over the next two decades. The agreement followed a detente in March in which both sides agreed to stop litigating each other in state court and work towards negotiating a new development agreement and a new comprehensive plan no later than next year. The district provides municipal services such as firefighting, planning and mosquito control, among other things, and was controlled by Disney supporters before the takeover by the DeSantis appointees. District board member Brian Aungst said at Wednesday night’s board meeting that the agreement provides a lasting and stable framework for Disney and the board to work together. “This is the day we all have been looking forward to,” Aungst said. “I was always extremely optimistic and knew we would get here because it was the right outcome.” Under the deal, Disney will be required to donate up to 100 acres (40 hectares) of Disney World’s 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) for the construction of infrastructure projects controlled by the district. The company also will need to award at least half of its construction projects to companies based in Florida and spend at least $10 million on affordable housing for central Florida. Disney would then be approved to build a fifth major theme park at Disney World and two more minor parks, such as water parks, if it desired. The company could raise the number of hotel rooms on its property from almost 40,000 rooms to more than 53,000 rooms and increase the amount of retail and restaurant space by more than 20%. Disney will retain control of building heights due to its need to maintain an immersive environment. Leaders of Orlando’s tourism industry praised the agreement, telling the district’s board members that it will bring boundless jobs, tourists and attention to central Florida. “It very clearly demonstrates to the world that the district and Disney are eager to resume working together for the great state of Florida,” said Robert Earl, founder and CEO of Planet Hollywood International, Inc. Still up in the air was an appeal of a federal lawsuit Disney had filed against DeSantis and his appointees. After the settlement was reached in March, Disney asked the appellate court to put that case on hold while the development agreement was negotiated. The company has until next week to file a brief with the court if it wants to move ahead with the case. Disney didn’t respond to an email Wednesday afternoon seeking comment on how the company planned to proceed. The DeSantis appointees to the district had planned to hold a closed-door discussion about the lawsuit after their board meeting Wednesday but cancelled that meeting. Matthew Oberly, a spokesperson for the district, said Wednesday night that the district didn’t have any comment on the future of the federal litigation. The March settlement ended almost two years of litigation sparked by DeSantis’ takeover of the district following the company’s opposition to the 2022 law that bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law was championed by the Republican governor, who used Disney as a punching bag in speeches during his run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination until he suspended his campaign earlier this year. As punishment for Disney’s opposition to the controversial law, DeSantis took over the governing district through legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors. Disney sued DeSantis and his appointees, claiming the company’s free speech rights were violated for speaking out against the legislation. A federal judge dismissed that lawsuit in January, but Disney appealed. Before control of the district changed hands early last year, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with the company shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees claimed the “eleventh-hour deals” neutered their powers , and the district sued the company in state court in Orlando to have the contracts voided. Disney filed counterclaims that included asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable. Those state court lawsuits were dismissed as part of the March settlement.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer Growing up Dominican meant growing up with an endless family; I grew up enveloped in love; a tía for every dish, a tío for every problem, a cousin for every adventure. We had the biggest parties, tables lined to capacity with aluminum trays of the greatest sazón ever, speakers blasting Los Hermanos Rosario , Wilfredo Vargas or Milly Quezad a until the wee-est of hours. I grew up so Dominican that when I first arrived in New York at age 4, I insisted on wearing shorts in November because I didn’t understand the cold. I still do not understand the cold. Growing up Dominican wasn’t all glorious; our culture uses respect, obedience and acquiescence almost interchangeably. The word “no” feels like an insult, and politeness is mandatory. I was taught to value and prioritize family, by any means necessary, even if it meant I was neglecting myself. I was also raised to understand womanhood and motherhood as an immense responsibility, one I had to approach cautiously and execute perfectly. There’s not a lot of room for autonomy in obedience; there’s also not a lot of foundation for building self-confidence when children are discouraged from expressing themselves or when their opinions and ideas are minimized. I loved my family gatherings, but the “ esto no es para muchachos ” (“this isn’t for kids”) whenever I walked into a room full of adults conditioned me into shyness and silence. Growing up Dominican meant that sometimes our parenting style bordered on authoritarian. I was raised to be obedient and, in some cases, acquiescent. For the sake of context, a 2010 study placed the Latinx parent’s version of respect into a framework, and it was my childhood on paper. “Obey parents no matter what, never express disagreement with adults, stay quiet when reprimanded, accept parental authority without questioning it, offer to help elders, defer to adult wishes, avoid a rude tone of voice, never talk back.” These were just some of the behavioral expectations of respect indicated by a group of Latinx mothers. My Dominican parents, aunts and uncles meant well. But they forgot to teach me when it was OK to talk. They forgot to teach us when it became appropriate to start participating in conversations, to formulate our own opinions, or, at the very least, when it was all right to question. “I was taught that saying 'no' to an adult was disrespectful, and disrespectful is the last thing I wanted to be. So, I never said no, even if I didn’t want the food, even if I was uncomfortable, even if I was unhappy.” I internalized inadequacy as a child, never knowing if I was thinking, saying or doing the right thing, not really confident enough to speak up, unsure about my capacity to make decisions or have opinions and without the slightest clue how to set a boundary. Fast-forward a couple of decades and some intense unlearning and reparenting, I was sitting in my office conducting my last family session of the day as a therapist, in front of a mom who looked like mine who told me her daughter was depressed. She almost cried as she looked at her daughter and said to me, “She has low self-esteem! She doesn’t think she’s pretty.” She almost had me, until I looked at the 11-year-old across from me, staring at her feet, shaking her head with a smirk on her face. “Do you think you’re ugly?” “No, I don’t,” she giggled as she looked up. The almost-crying mom almost yelled this time. “Just this morning, I did her hair, it took me such a long time to pick it up and she took it down a few minutes later.” At this point, the giggling 11-year-old started to laugh. I sighed, “Do you like your hair picked up?” “Not really, it looks much prettier down.” I closed my book and crossed my legs, and at that point, the almost-crying mom likely realized that she was staring at the 30-year-old version of her little girl. “Your daughter doesn’t have depression; she has a preference.” I sat in my office for another 30 minutes after the end of that session, more aware than ever of the little human growing inside me who was, at this point, just a little bigger than a peach. I saw the biggest role of my life unfold before me. How do I raise this little girl? What do I want her to learn? What do I want her to see? Will I really care so much about her hair? Will I forget to listen? Will I forget to ask? Will I remember that she deserves a say even at 11, even at 5, maybe even at 2? I called upon my own childhood; do I raise her how I was raised? Our culture has certain expectations of little girls because it is very invested in the women we grow up to be — wives, mothers and homemakers — more often than not giving these roles so much importance that any deviation is considered a failure. My aunts and mother wore their exhaustion like a badge of honor, withering themselves and busying themselves while inherently neglecting themselves. Today, I sit across from so many women, and I’ve asked them in my best therapist voice, “So why do your needs come second?” Sometimes they pause, sometimes they smile, and other times they frown at the first time someone has actually asked them why they aren’t putting themselves first. When they look like me, I suspect the answer, because a culture that teaches us “ Calladita te vez mas bonita” (“You look prettier quiet”) is quite problematic. In telling us that the quieter we are, the prettier we are, we’re conditioned to silence and taught that what we have to say isn’t really that important, and therefore we come second to others. I was taught that saying “ no ” to an adult was disrespectful, and disrespectful is the last thing I wanted to be. So, I never said no, even if I didn’t want the food, even if I was uncomfortable, even if I was unhappy. Besides, “ Calladita te vez mas bonita.” It was people-pleasing but dressed up as respect; I was encouraged not to make people uncomfortable, even if I was unhappy. I’ve decided to gift my daughter the word “ no” and allow her to make her own decisions and set her own boundaries. I honor my daughter’s “ no, ” and because at 2 years old her “no” is respected, that will become her baseline; respect her no, hear her voice. “My daughter will know that she has a right to boundaries without guilt and that her extended family will understand.” At any given gathering, I hold my child as the t ías and the tíos attempt to greet my quarantine baby with their usual request for our bendición that’s sealed with the Dominican cheek kiss. My little human then shakes her head or verbalizes her “no” as she squeezes me a little tighter. I squeeze my daughter back and reiterate “ dijo que no” (“she said no”) as I shrug. “Maybe she’ll warm up later.” In doing so, I’m reinforcing my place as my daughter’s firmest ally. The tíos and tías might think I’m enabling my little girl, and technically, I am. Enabling her to be assertive. I decided to set some boundaries and pass them down, boundaries about space, opinions, involvement and presence. Our Dominican families love so hard that their response to everything is to be immediately present and involved, which is amazing, except for when they forget to ask if it’s welcome. My daughter will know that she has a right to boundaries without guilt and that her extended family will understand. See, we love our big familias, but she’s going to learn to honor herself first and most. I had to teach myself how to be OK with disappointing people, which is challenging if you’ve been taught to defer to adult wishes for most of your life. My daughter will grow up knowing that she comes first, and that we’re so hardwired to love that her family will love her no matter what boundaries she sets, like they had to do with me. The beauty of our extra-large family is that they remain ever-present, even when you’re changing the script a little bit. They adapt and love us anyway. I’m refraining from passing down the idea that marriage, childbearing and exhaustion are a part of womanhood. I watched my mother and my tías wear all the hats and do all the things. Our mujeres are the heart, the head, the backbone and the feet of every family. They took on housework and child-rearing, and then came to America to work outside the home as well. Our mujeres are tired, and they’re not resting, because nobody has told them that they need it, they deserve it, or that they’re worthy of it, and when we do, they don’t believe us. My daughter will witness my self-preservation. She will learn that she deserves rest, that takeout is OK, and so is sending out laundry, and that there’s no prize for wearing ourselves thin. As for now, my 2-year-old is assertive and autonomous. She says her yeses and says her noes, she picks her shoes and picks her toys, and gets asked what she wants when it isn’t clear. Sometimes she has tantrums, and I remember how much of me is in her, and I take my deep breaths and wait. I was raised so Dominican-respectful that I had to build my own confidence from scratch. Our generation of Latinx parents know what it takes to empower our children, so we encourage autonomy and self-expression. Since we now know better, we do better, and we raise our little humans to feel comfortable and confident with their choices, to be curious and to feel secure in whatever space they choose to occupy.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost It’s no secret that there is a stigma in the mental health field, no matter the demographic. People are afraid to go to therapy because of how it may look to other people (for the record, it looks healthy). And w hile this spans across cultures, when it comes to the Hispanic community, “there is a negative perception about mental health care in general,” said Dr. Ruby Castilla-Puentes , the president of the American Society of Hispanic Psychiatry. Because of this, “there are misunderstandings about mental health.” This can make it hard for people in the Latine community to realize they need help, talk to loved ones about mental health and ultimately seek treatment. But, there are many experts who focus on creating safe spaces where people can explore their identity, their emotions, their problems and more. Here, experts share how to find a therapist who focuses on Latine mental health. “Hispanic folks are looking for mental health providers that are culturally competent,” Castilla-Puentes said, adding that this can mean a therapist who speaks Spanish or someone with a deep knowledge of Hispanic-Latino culture. Castilla-Puentes noted that miscommunication, either because of language barriers or cultural misunderstandings, causes many people in the Latine community to feel misunderstood by people in the mental health field. This can cause a “lack of confidence in the ability to receive the service that they need,” she added. That being said, Brandie Carlos, the founder of Therapy for Latinx , noted that as a community, there is a large spectrum of cultures and beliefs. “We’re not a monolith,” she said. So, what’s right for one person may not be right for another. “What is most important is to get clear on what is important to you when you’re looking for a therapist,” she noted. Make a list of the things you want your therapist to understand about you, your family or your culture, or make a list of the languages you want them to speak. Carlos noted that some people don’t want to go through the trouble of translating certain phrases from Spanish to English in therapy, while other people purely want someone who will speak English. It’s a totally personal preference. Additionally, you should decide what goals you want to achieve in therapy and what subject areas you want to focus on. From there, ask questions when you meet with therapists to see if they are a fit for you. “[Finding a therapist] is a lot like dating,” Carlos said. And like dating, it’s perfectly OK to go on a few introductory therapy meetings before finding a therapist you click with. There is nothing wrong with looking around for a therapist, and all mental health professionals have come to expect this — not everyone can be a match for every patient. Because of the stigma associated with mental health, it can be hard to admit that you need support. This is challenging across many cultures, but can have particular difficulties in the Latine community where people are afraid of being labeled as “loco,” according to Castilla-Puentes. Additionally, she noted that research has shown many people in the community don’t recognize the symptoms of anxiety or depression. Instead, “ they believe that depression is not a disease, it’s a part of life they need to pass through without any treatment.” If you feel unmotivated, sad or tired , or notice that you no longer enjoy the things you used to enjoy, it may be worth finding a mental health provider to talk to. Also, if you’re going through a hard time — like dealing with the loss of a loved one or going through a breakup — it could be helpful to address any mental health concerns head-on by starting therapy. If you’re feeling off, know you don’t have to go through a hard time without any support. Depression is not something you need to “get through” on your own. The American healthcare field can be a challenge for people who are undocumented, who often worry about being detained or separated from their families. This also rings true in the mental health field, Carlos noted. She added that it’s not unheard of for these individuals or their loved ones to avoid care because of these fears. Fears like “what could happen if the mental health provider reports an incident to the police?” come front of mind. In this case, it’s best to use word-of-mouth to find who in your area provides safe mental health care. You can talk to friends, family members or people who are undocumented, or have loved ones who are undocumented. Beyond word-of-mouth, the Latinx Therapists Action Network is also a good resource for mental health care for the migrant community, Carlos said. Additionally, ask how your therapist handles emergency situations, she said. Find out if they call the police when someone is having suicidal ideation or if they’ll call friends and family first. Also, find out if they are under any requirements to report those who are undocumented to government agencies. You can turn to specific websites and databases to help you understand your mental health and find a mental health provider who provides culturally competent care. Castilla-Puentes noted that the American Psychiatric Association recently launched a Spanish language section of its website , and the American Society of Hispanic Psychiatry has a listing of providers broken up by state . Carlos added that Therapy for Latinx , Latinx Therapy and Inclusive Therapists are all good ways to find therapists who focus on Latine mental health, too. She also pointed to Open Path Collective as another good resource that is particularly valuable because it provides affordable mental health services to people. Even if you are not a Spanish speaker or don’t want to speak Spanish in your therapy appointments, Carlos recommended that you use the language filter on online databases to find someone who speaks Spanish (just make sure they also speak English if you are not fluent in the language). This way, “you might find someone who shares the same culture even if you don’t speak Spanish,” she said.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer The most interesting thing about Wednesday Addams as we know her now is that she’s a powerful psychic whose best friend is a disembodied hand. Addams also happens to be Latina — but that’s not supposed to be the point. The recent record-shattering success of the Netflix series “Wednesday” feels like a new type of win for Latinx representation at a time when the word “representation” is often a stand-in for tokenism. It’s evidence that we can have diversity without being reminded of that diversity at every waking moment, and for once it feels like a TV show gets it . For example, Wednesday Addams, played by Jenna Ortega (who is of Mexican and Puerto Rican heritage), doesn’t have to highlight her Latinidad in order to be comfortable with that part of her identity. We get passing references to her heritage — from the way she dances to nods at Dia de los Muertos — but it doesn’t feel performative. She doesn’t have to lean into the “spicy Latina” stereotype or adopt a fake accent in order for us to understand her as a Latinx character. In fact, her authentic portrayal of Latinidad is one of the things that Ortega expresses when she talks about what she loved so much about her role as Wednesday Addams. “I feel like a lot of [the Latinx representation is Hollywood] is very calculated diversity, in terms of they hire people to check off a box,” she said in a recent interview . “I do hope to see a world where we start to see Latinos being cast as everyone and not just a side character where their heritage is their entire personality.” Ortega’s sentiment about Latinx characters basing their entire personality on their cultural heritage definitely resonates. While Latinx representation is broadening, shows that brand themselves as “Latinx shows” tend to overplay their character’s culture to the point where it starts to feel inauthentic. I remember thinking this about the Netflix show “On My Block,” in which the characters seemed to remind each other that they were Latino way too often. It felt contrived. While it was nice to see so many Latinos on screen, it felt like the Latino expression was for the others — not us. Personally, I can understand the impulse to play up our culture; it’s something I arguably do in my writing, too. To an extent, it comes from a fear of not being perceived as “Latino enough” because there’s a certain way that our culture tells us what Latinx people are supposed to look like and how we’re supposed to act. When we’re “the only ones” in certain spaces, there’s also a pressure to try to display all aspects of our culture. Maybe it’s the reason that producers, even from our own communities, exaggerate the stereotypically Hispanic traits of their characters — otherwise, how are we going to know that they are really Latinx? The beauty of “Wednesday” is that it doesn’t seem to concern itself with making the main character Latina enough. She simply is . And that’s more than enough proof that we are not a monolith. Still, Wednesday’s Latinidad is an essential part of the story. In fact, I’d argue that Addams would not be the hero she becomes if it weren’t for her cultural heritage. That’s because Wednesday is doubly an outsider: one, for having psychic powers, and two, for being Latina. Her status as a cultural “other” makes her more sensitive to the struggles and motives of others, expertly illustrated in a scene where she calls out the town’s Pilgrim-themed amusement park for glorifying colonialism. But even beyond that, the entire series revolves around the historical tensions between Evermore Academy, a so-called school for outcasts, and the people of the nearby town of Jericho. It’s not hard to see how this tension resembles the real political climate between certain Americans and their misguided fear of those who are different. This is what makes “Wednesday” a fundamentally Latinx story, too. Through Netflix’s Wednesday Addams, we finally got a main character whose Latinidad informs their world view but doesn’t define it. In the series, Latinidad expands her vision of the world and the possibilities of what she’s able to do, instead of limiting who she can become. It makes me excited for what the future of Latinx representation holds.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Latinx representation in Hollywood’s most popular movies comes nowhere close to reflecting either the U.S. population or that of Los Angeles, where many of these movies and the decisions behind them get made, according to a new study. The University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative finds that in the rare instances when Latinx characters do appear on screen, the films in question perpetuate unrealistic and often harmful tropes, often by depicting Latinx people as criminals, low-level workers and “the other,” or they disproportionately focus on immigration stories. According to the study, which uses the U.S. census category of Hispanic/Latino, nearly 20% of the U.S. population, 39% of California’s population and 49% of Los Angeles’ population identifies as Hispanic/Latino. Yet only 3.5% of the top 100 grossing films at the U.S. box office from 2007 to 2019 featured Hispanic/Latino leads or co-leads. Across the 1,300 movies in the study, which included over 50,000 speaking characters, only 5% of all speaking characters were Hispanic/Latino. That percentage has never gone higher than 7.2% in 2017 and was as low as 2.8% in 2009. “This relegates Hispanic/Latino actors to sidekick, friend, or even villain roles. Moreover, it fails to reflect the multitude of stories about Hispanic/Latinos that exist to be told,” the researchers wrote, warning of “an epidemic of invisibility.” Released Wednesday to coincide with the start of Latinx Heritage Month, which runs from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, the group’s new report marks the second time the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative has specifically studied the lack of Latinx representation in major movies. (In addition to the broader census category of “Hispanic/Latino,” the study also uses “Latinx” to more closely examine representation for “U.S.-born Latinos who are not of Spanish descent.”) For years, the low numbers have been especially egregious because of how fast these communities across the country have grown and how they make up a significant portion of box office revenue. Year after year, studies and data have shown that representation is not only a moral imperative but an economic necessity for Hollywood . The Annenberg team partnered with two production companies focused on telling stories from underrepresented communities: Wise Entertainment and actor Eva Longoria’s UnbelieEVAble Entertainment. The research identified a link between Latinx representation in front of and behind the camera. From 2017 to 2019, nearly half of the top-grossing movies with Hispanic/Latino directors “had one or more Hispanic/Latino actors in a top-billed role, compared to 26.5% of films by non-Hispanic/Latino directors.” But Hispanic/Latino directors rarely get to direct major movies, as the study shows. Across the 13 years of movies included in the study, only 4.2% of the directors were Hispanic/Latino, and the researchers documented “no change over time.” Among the 1,447 directors who directed the films in the study, just three were Hispanic women or Latinas. Only 3.3% of the casting directors behind the movies in the study were Hispanic/Latino, as were just 3% of the producers. Over the study’s 13-year period, only two Latinx actors — Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez — starred or co-starred in more than one top-grossing movie. Even as recently as 2019, only 28 of the top 100 highest-grossing films featured a Hispanic/Latino actor getting top billing, and in 82% of them, they were the only Hispanic/Latino actor to do so. Just one movie had a whopping five top-billed Hispanic/Latino actors: 2019’s “Dora and the Lost City of Gold.” The study aimed to not only measure when Latinx characters appear on screen, but how they are depicted. Many recent films continue to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and do not portray Latinx characters as their full selves. For example, Latinx characters are often shown in isolation — interacting with no other Latinx characters — and references to their cultural identities are often erased or minimized. The researchers also examined problems like the ways stories featuring Latinx characters are disproportionately likely to be about immigrant experiences. Also, Latinx characters are often placed in low-level occupations. For example, for the 56 Hispanic/Latino characters whose films identified their occupation, almost half — 47.3% — “were shown in a job that did not require a specialized education (e.g., salesperson, factory worker, line cook, street vendor).” Insidious tropes about Latinx people continue to permeate Hollywood movies. Nearly 40% of top-billed Hispanic/Latino characters were criminals. More than 37% of all Hispanic/Latino characters spoke no English, and 30.5% spoke English with an accent. There was also a substantial portion of characters “shown as angry or temperamental” and female characters who were sexualized. As is often the case, the study found that intersectional representation is even more lacking. Across all 1,300 movies, only six featured Afro-Latinx actors as leads or co-leads — including three of them in 2019, the most recent year included in the study. (The researchers did not include the movies of 2020 because the pandemic upended theatrical releases and made it more difficult to consistently measure yearly progress.) In 2019, 59 out of the 100 top-grossing movies had zero Hispanic women or Latinas, 95 had zero Hispanic/Latino disabled characters and 98 had zero LGBTQ Hispanic/Latino characters. The study did not delve into the prevalence of white or white-adjacent Latinx people in representations of Latinx people on screen. The researchers’ recommendations include more intentional hiring, casting and building sustainable paths for career advancement for Latinx artists in Hollywood, which many people in the industry have said is the bare minimum that Hollywood executives and leaders need to be doing. The study also puts some of the onus on people and institutions beyond the gates of Hollywood studios and companies. For instance, film festivals should make more specific efforts to feature the work of Latinx filmmakers, and philanthropists should fund initiatives that support Latinx filmmakers. At the government level, states and municipalities that provide tax incentives to encourage more filming in their jurisdictions could also include specific incentives for productions that meet benchmarks for representation. In addition, legislators should provide more robust funding for arts education to support the next generation of Latinx filmmakers. Read the full study here .

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer A month before Selena Quintanilla was murdered, she entered the Houston Astrodome for her first and final televised concert on a horse-drawn carriage. Dressed in a sparkly purple jumpsuit, she waved at the crowd, smiling, as a piano riffed the first few notes of “I Will Survive.” Selena stepped onto the stage ceremoniously and began one of the most momentous concerts in Tejano history, belting out a medley of songs by Gloria Gaynor, Donna Summer and other disco legends. Performing hits by American artists was Selena’s way of telling the world she wouldn’t be put in a box. Sure, she could fuck up a Tejano song better than anyone (it was, in the end, the genre she was confined to), but she was also doubling down on her blended identity in a country that struggled to understand how one person could be equal parts Latina and American. In anticipation for the posthumous album her estate is set to release on Aug. 26, it seems appropriate to reexamine Selena’s curious popularity among Gen Z. We’re of a generation that was never alive when Selena was, but have nonetheless made her ubiquitous on platforms such as TikTok — from a Selena impersonator walking through the suburbs to a post of a little girl dressed in a purple jumpsuit , viciously pummeling a piñata in the likeness of Yolanda Saldívar, the person who killed Selena. Twenty-seven years after her death, what’s our unmitigated reverence of Selena really about? During my TikTok investigation, I met Nessa Diosdado, a 25-year-old who grew up in rural East Texas and runs a popular page where she teaches young people about Mexican-American music. Nessa told me that growing up in a predominantly white town, she hated being Mexican and when she was young. Her only real role model was Selena. Her mom, who was a diehard fan of Tejano music and had actually attended a Selena in concert, would blast her music every weekend while she cleaned the house. Nessa also remembered watching the biopic and hearing the actor who played Abraham, Selena’s father, complain that their family was too Mexican for the Americans, but also too American for the Mexicans. “It’s been engraved in our heads, for those of us who have watched it,” she said. That sentiment — of being left out by all sides, of being simultaneously neither and both — is the key to Selena’s allure for many young people today, including myself. The latest U.S. census found that the Latino population grew by at least 23% in the past decade, which means there are more and more people like Nessa who navigate a Hispanic identity that is neither fully American nor rooted in a Latin American country. So much of the labor of being a hyphenated American lies in the struggle of proving that we belong equally to both ends of that hyphen. Then, there’s the existential fear of being excluded by both. Selena seemed to navigate this identity maze seamlessly; when the news anchor Cristina Saralegui corrected her for fumbling a Spanish word and teased her for her “Tex-Mex accent,” Selena took the comment in stride. “You understood me, didn’t you?” she asked Saralegui, laughing. “[Selena] made something so derided into something charming, even endearing,” said Mexican-American journalist Maria Garcia in an episode of her podcast, ” Anything for Selena .” That moment is emblematic of how secure the singer seemed to be in her identity and how unwilling she was to be ridiculed for it. Going to school in suburban Texas, I disavowed my first name, Jesús, and begged my parents in hushed whispers not to speak in Spanish whenever they picked me up from Elementary School. For one, I look pretty Asian and people would ask me why I spoke Spanish when I didn’t “look” Latino. Second, this was the George W. Bush era, and I would hear news anchors and classmates talk about people “like us” infiltrating the southern border. Things have changed drastically with the mainstream success of reggaeton and an internet culture that actually celebrates Latinidad (this TikTok sound is emblematic of this shift). But this is where things get complicated: Although I am ecstatic for the visibility of artists like Bad Bunny, few people would ever question whether he’s Latino enough. He’s not really concerned with proving to Americans that he is American, either. He seems perfectly comfortable in his identity — which is so powerful and very needed — but he’s also someone who was born and raised in Puerto Rico and is firmly rooted in his Puerto Ricanness. His particular identity still leaves out some of us who walk through the world with an angst of feeling like others aren’t letting us fully claim our Latinidad. Then, there’s artists like Rosalía, who claim Latinidad while also benefiting from their own whiteness. Rosalía is from Barcelona, but her latest album was heavily influenced by reggaeton, dembow and bachata. Although I’m a fan of her music, there’s a sense that she’s telling stories that are not entirely hers to tell. Despite the visibility of Latin artists, we still don’t have a Selena right now — and we desperately need one. Her authentic embodiment of Hispanic-American angst and joy continues to reverberate. And the internet is just as obsessed with Selena’s death as they are with her life. When she was killed, Selena was in the midst of finishing her debut English language album, which was expected to cross her over as a mainstream American artist. “I can only imagine how much more she would have contributed to music if she would have still been alive today,” Diosado said. That’s when I realized that at least a part of our fixation with Selena comes from the anger of growing up in a world without her and the Hispanic-American movement that was beginning to form around her. That rage is evident in much of the way Gen Z talks about Selena’s legacy today. Jordan Harb, a teacher in Washington, D.C. told me that one of his fifth grade students recently told the class that once Saldívar “gets out of prison, [she’s] gonna send her a dry ass Popeye’s biscuit so she can choke.” TikToker Princess Young made a viral video expressing a similar sentiment, where she’s standing in front of a green-screen prison dancing to “Como La Flor” with the caption “Waiting on Yolanda to get out on parole March 2025.” Young, who is 25, said that she was obsessed with the 1997 biopic. “For her to display a sense of pride made me feel so seen as a Black child,” she said. Selena’s untimely death spilled into other marginalized communities, who understand the depth of American prejudice and the obstacles Selena had to overcome. Unlike other artists, Selena wasn’t just making music for other Mexican Americans — she was reaching out to anyone who didn’t feel fully rooted in their world. There’s a real sense that an inclusive Hispanic-American identity died along with Selena, or that maybe we’d be further along as a community if she were still here. But focusing on her death and lamenting what she wasn’t able to do also feels unfair to her legacy. Selena laid the groundwork by showing us that there can be so much joy and authenticity in not belonging. “I don’t feel pressure because I’m not trying to portray something that I’m not,” she once famously said.

    "article_content": "Contributor My story isn’t new, but I didn’t come across another one like it until I saw something on public-access TV about teenage survivors of childhood sexual abuse, or CSA. The group was entirely Latino, like me. I was 13 years old, and I’d never related harder to anything in my life, especially when one of the guys on the show talked about being abused by a woman when he was just a kid. That was the moment I made the connection that I, too, was a victim of CSA — and just one example that demonstrates how sharing abuse narratives can help victims make sense of their experiences. That instant was a salient one. It was painful, but it marked the beginning of my journey toward truth and healing. It’s one of the reasons why I chose to help others by talking about what happened to me. I had, and still have, so many questions — for my parents, for other Latinos and survivors, and for fellow psychotherapists and other experts. And so, I set out to understand the experiences and unique issues that male Latino victims of CSA face and to understand why their abusers are so often protected. “I feel like it’s our nature as Mexicans to wonder what people might think,” says a resident of Los Fresnos, Texas, who asked not to be identified by name for this piece. Many of the people I spoke to, especially men, requested an alias or anonymity. Within the Latino community, the topic of child sexual abuse is shrouded in silence and secrecy. “Until now, this topic had never even existed in my mind,” says Miguel Gonzalez, a fellow Latino who agreed to discuss this topic using an alias. “Our culture wears its sexuality very plainly but is also repressed.” Repression emerged as a theme early in my conversations with fellow Latinos. “Repression can lead to divorce of the self,” says Misty Solt, a professor of counseling at Southern Methodist University. Her words reminded me of how I became disconnected from my emotional experiences as a boy. The roots of my repression stem from others’ lack of acknowledgement and invalidation of my feelings. My tears were consistently minimized, if not outrightly ignored. I was emotionally deserted, and I followed suit by abandoning myself. This happens to boys a lot, and I couldn’t help but wonder how anybody can heal when this is their experience. “In these cases, it can be really hard to anchor into those experiences, [but] your body will tell you what you need to remember and when,” she added. Solt is referring to the idea that a lack of memories can create challenges to processing and coping with trauma. But memories aren’t the only clues that trauma has taken place, because our bodies can indicate that something horrible has occurred. Some common physical manifestations of trauma can be hyperarousal around triggers, and a plethora of physical ailments like headaches, chronic pain, tense muscles and more. Masculine pride, or what’s known as machismo in my culture, goes hand in hand with repression. Strength, in particular, is probably the most highly regarded virtue a man can possess. And not just physically, but emotionally as well. In Latino culture, emotional strength is perceived as an almost total lack of emotional vulnerability. There’s an expectation that men should refrain from expressing emotions like fear and sadness. In this context, repression and strength are almost indistinguishable from each other. “When I speak to Latino men, they talk about their experience of being abused in an almost joking way, or with an attitude like, ‘It is what it is,’” explained Ana Lopez Wagner, an advocate on the subject of child sexual abuse. “There’s a minimization of what happened. They’re detached from the pain of what’s transpired.” Wagner has observed the consequences of minimization in her conversations with victims of CSA. “Dismissing a child who discloses abuse is minimization, and is a way of enabling and perpetuating abuse,” Wagner said. “In some cases, it can be a passive way of giving permission to an abuser.” Her account aligned with my own experience, because I was dismissed when I told my parents about the abuse. Their silence and subsequent stonewalling deprived me of the emotional support I needed to heal. I had to talk about it, and put things under a microscope to figure out my story. Getting there meant getting in touch with my anger. “[Anger] is not only common, but necessary in order to erect boundaries,” said Marlena del Hierro, a Mexican American trauma therapist. “It helps dispel the shame, and is a much healthier place to be. I think it’s a sign of healing for someone who’s been through this kind of trauma.” Like other victims, I also self-blamed. But talking about the abuse in therapy, and with trusted friends, helped me release shame. I started to understand — not just intellectually, but on an emotional level — that this wasn’t my fault. Shame is an overarching theme of latinidad, or Latin identity, and multiple factors can contribute to it. “Loyalty, sometimes blind loyalty, to family, is very common,” says Holly Lockett, a psychotherapist and trauma specialist in the Dallas area. Disclosure and betrayal are often viewed as one and the same when the abuser is a family member. Within the family system, the shamed — or the abuser — sometimes get comfort and protection from the accuser, or the one to bring shame. The religiosity that’s so common in Latino culture also plays a significant role in the experience of shame. In particular, the pervasiveness of Catholicism implies that there’s only one right way to live virtuously. Rigid expectations create opportunities for failure, especially in the moral sense. “It’s common for Latinos to try to find answers through religion or prayer, but often that’s not enough, and sometimes a client has to work through religious trauma before working on the abuse,” Lockett said. This kind of trauma can take various forms — like sexual abuse from a priest or the loss of a church community — and often increases shame. Reducing that shame is critical for the purpose of breaking the cycle of abuse, in the intergenerational sense, because shame keeps victims from taking a closer look. “If you do a generational trauma timeline, you can go back to the beginning,” Lockett said. “When you’re able to find out what your ancestors had to go through, you start to understand what gets programmed into our DNA.” Generational trauma is a term that’s slowly made its way into social consciousness, and it also refers to the ways that trauma may be stored in our genes. “Some babies are born traumatized because of their genes,” Lockett said. The shared family experience — especially when others in that environment also experienced abuse — can create more vulnerabilities. Nearly 78% of Latino youth have experienced adverse child experiences, including poverty, neglect, abuse or household dysfunction, according to the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. The research also found that Latino youth are more likely than any other group to have these types of experiences. When it comes to CSA in Latinos, the data is inconsistent. There is little consensus in the literature about whether estimates of its prevalence in nonwhite groups are too low or too high, and by how much, according to the Joshua Center on Child Sexual Abuse Prevention at the University of Washington. Methodological differences across studies partly account for these inconsistencies. For example, some studies differed in their definition of sexual abuse, some relied too heavily on self-reporting, and others had sample sizes that were simply too small. These findings make sense to Lockett, who also identified poverty and immigration as common themes in her work with Latinos. “If you’re born poor or an immigrant, you’re more likely to be exposed to trauma,” Lockett explained. This is something that’s echoed in immigration narratives. The first generation to arrive in the U.S. is especially likely to experience poverty and all the vulnerabilities that accompany it. As risk factors came clearly into view, I began digging further into why abusers in Latino communities are often protected. “Adults tend to protect adults before believing children, usually because they don’t want to break up the family,” Wagner said. “It’s an important institution in Latino culture, and people don’t want to break something that works for them, regardless of how it is.” Lockett shares this view. “[Clients] will often say things like, ‘I can’t do that to my uncle, grandpa or whoever,’” she said. Loyalty to family is a common thread among Latinos that creates barriers to speaking up and being supported. So how can Latinos break the cycle of intergenerational abuse? Sharing narratives is one important way. “To me, storytelling is about taking off the bandage and just having that wound open to let it heal,” Wagner said. “I learned that I had to be more vulnerable for the people who needed to hear me say this, because I look like you, and you can relate to me.” I talked to Melinda Sanchez, an old friend of mine from the Rio Grande Valley, who was the only Latino person I spoke with who grew up having these kinds of conversations. “My family talked about consent and sexual abuse, but that’s because my mother was abused, as were her brothers, back in Mexico when they were kids,” she said. In Sanchez’s case, an understanding of what could go wrong was a source of protection for her growing up. “I knew that if anything ever happened, I’d have the support of the grown-ups in my life,” she said. But she acknowledged that this was atypical for people living along the U.S.-Mexico border, which is where we both were raised. She believes that education about sexual abuse, consent and interpersonal boundaries can go a long way in keeping people safe from abuse. “I didn’t know what boundaries were [growing up],” del Hierro said. “Twelve steps and my counseling [graduate] program helped me learn boundaries.” Her words resonated with me because I didn’t have a clear understanding of what boundaries were until adulthood, either. Examining my early experiences, and getting angry, played a crucial role in asserting these kinds of barriers. In my case, anger pushed me to ask questions. And in the face of stonewalling, it’s what made me threaten to sue my parents if they wouldn’t tell me my abuser’s last name (and it worked). Like many Latinos, my parents chose to protect my abuser despite warning signs that things weren’t right. But eventually, I realized that more than anything, they chose to protect themselves from shame. So how should you respond if someone you care about tells you that they’ve been sexually abused? Lockett has some ideas. “If you love someone, keep your mouth shut and hold space. … All you can do is love them, protect them, and be there.” Need help?

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Despite the Supreme Court unanimously rejecting an attack on abortion pills this week, pro-choice advocates are cautioning against calling the decision a win — and for good reason. The ruling rejected the anti-abortion plaintiffs on standing, not on the merits of the case, which simply maintains the status quo of abortion access in the U.S. The decision does not offer additional protections to mifepristone, the abortion drug at the center of the case, and the door is wide open for continued attacks. There are a few ways Donald Trump could circumvent the courts and Congress to ban mifepristone across the country if he wins the presidency in November. Trump’s anti-abortion allies have outlined the presumptive GOP presidential nominee’s second-term agenda in Project 2025 , a wish list of extreme policy proposals that would reshape the federal government. There are at least three ways Trump can use executive action to ban abortion nationwide, including in states where abortion care is currently protected. “He has a literal blueprint to expand the chaos and cruelty he’s already created nationwide, even in states where abortion is currently legal,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the Biden-Harris campaign manager, told reporters in a call on Thursday. “Trump's second-term agenda threatens women in all 50 states.” “ Donald Trump ’s anti-reproductive freedom agenda is not just a threat to red states,” she continued. “Trump’s second-term agenda threatens women in all 50 states, and it’s extremely dangerous for women’s health care and our families.” As president, Trump could replace the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and direct them to revoke the agency’s approval of mifepristone. Mifepristone is prescribed as part of a two-drug regimen alongside misoprostol for abortion and miscarriage care — which together are used in more than 60% of abortions in the U.S. The drug was approved by the FDA in 2000 and has since been used safely and effectively by nearly 6 million Americans, according to the agency. Trump’s ability to appoint a new FDA commissioner would take mifepristone out of circulation, effectively implementing an abortion ban in both red and blue states. Recalling mifepristone would have devastating effects on abortion care in the U.S., as well as care for other medical conditions that are treated with mifepristone, like Cushing syndrome and hyperglycemia. The other proposal outlined in Project 2025 includes enforcing the Comstock Act , a 150-year-old law that criminalizes sending “obscene” materials in the mail, including anything “intended for producing abortion.” Around 20 states enacted abortion bans after the Supreme Court repealed Roe v. Wade in 2022 – forcing some pregnant people to travel out of state to get care, or else continue with an unwanted or unsafe pregnancy. But abortion rates have generally stayed the same in large part because people can still access abortion pills by mail. The Comstock Act would prohibit sending pills by mail to any state in the country, creating a backdoor abortion ban overnight. The Comstock Act is a dangerous weapon for anti-abortion groups, and they know it. Jonathan Mitchell, an attorney representing Trump in his own case before the Supreme Court, has said that Republicans don’t need a nationwide abortion ban because the Comstock Act exists. “We don’t need a federal ban when we have Comstock on the books,” Mitchell told The New York Times in February. Mitchell is also the architect of the Texas abortion bounty hunter law, which banned abortion in the state over a year before Roe v. Wade was repealed. He added about Trump: “I hope he doesn’t know about the existence of Comstock, because I just don’t want him to shoot off his mouth. I think the pro-life groups should keep their mouths shut as much as possible until the election.” Awareness of the Comstock Act is alarmingly low: Two in three Americans do not know about the Comstock Act and its implications, according to recent polling from Navigator Research and Global Strategy Group. Seven in 10 Americans opposed the enforcement of the law after learning about it. “The way that these anti-abortion extremists want to misuse the Comstock Act is entirely wrong from a legal perspective,” Julia Kaye, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project, told reporters during a Thursday press call. “They are defying the consensus of the federal appellate court, the U.S. Postal Service, Congress and the Department of Justice.” The third way Trump could ban abortion nationwide comes back to this week’s Supreme Court case. There will likely be continued litigation because the case was not dismissed but remanded back to Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk’s courtroom. Kacsmaryk is the far-right Trump appointee, well-known for his anti-abortion views , who ruled last year that the FDA unlawfully approved mifepristone in 2000. After the Supreme Court took the case, Kacsmaryk allowed attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to be added as plaintiffs. Those officials have suggested they will continue litigating the case — either by continuing in Kacsmaryk’s Amarillo courtroom or by filing copycat lawsuits in other federal district courts. The lawsuit that was in front of the Supreme Court should not be allowed to continue in Amarillo based on legal precedent, Kaye said. But if it does move forward in Amarillo or through copycat suits, a Trump Justice Department could stop defending the FDA and its evidence-based mifepristone regulations. Mitchell, the attorney betting on enforcing the Comstock Act, is reportedly on Trump’s short list for attorney general. “The bottom line is that these attacks on medication abortion and on all abortion nationwide are absolutely going to continue despite the relief of today’s decision,” Kaye said.

    "article_content": "Lynn Conway, a pioneer in the design of microchips that are at the heart of consumer electronics who overcame discrimination as a transgender person, has died at age 86. Her June 9 death was announced by the University of Michigan, where Conway was on the engineering faculty until she retired in 1998. “She overcame so much, but she didn’t spend her life being angry about the past,” said Valeria Bertacco, computer science professor and U-M vice provost. “She was always focused on the next innovation.” Conway is credited with developing a simpler method for designing microchips in the 1970s, along with Carver Mead of the California Institute of Technology, the university said. “Chips used to be designed by drawing them with paper and pencil like an architect’s blueprints in the pre-digital era,” Bertacco said. “Conway’s work developed algorithms that enabled our field to use software to arrange millions, and later billions, of transistors on a chip.” Conway joined IBM in 1964 after graduating with two degrees from Columbia University. But IBM fired her after she disclosed in 1968 that she was undergoing a gender transition. The company apologized in 2020 — more than 50 years later — and awarded her a lifetime achievement award for her work. An employee who is transgender had brought Conway’s story to the attention of executives. “We deeply regret what you went through, and I know I speak for all of us,” said Diane Gherson, who was senior vice president of human resources, according to a transcript. Dario Gill, director of research, told Conway: “Quite simply: You have helped define the modern computing industry.” Conway told The New York Times that the turnabout was unexpected and “stunning.” IBM recognized her death Friday. “Lynn Conway broke down barriers for the trans community and pushed the limits of technology through revolutionary work that is still impacting our lives to this day,” said Nickle LaMoreaux, IBM’s chief human resources officer. In a 2014 video posted on YouTube , Conway reflected on her transition, saying “there was hardly any knowledge in our society even about the existence of transgender identities” in the 1960s. “I think a lot of that’s really hit now because those parents who have transgender children are discovering ... if they let the person blossom into who they need to be they often see just remarkable flourishing,” Conway said. The native of Mount Vernon, New York, had five U.S. patents. Conway’s career included work at Xerox, the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, part of the U.S. Defense Department. She also had honorary degrees from many universities, including Princeton University. ___ AP reporter Matt O’Brien in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this story. ___ Follow Ed White at https://twitter.com/edwritez By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Contributing writer Ever since it became evident that the right to a safe abortion was going to get the boot, experts have been speculating that marriage equality could be next. Despite the reality that many queers reject the idea of marriage altogether, the fact that our right to marry is even up for debate proves that queer people are still not deemed equal citizens. No matter how many commercials you put us in, queer people still face the daily risk of hate-based violence , abuse, addiction and suicide. All of these harsh realities made this past June, aka corporate rainbow-washing season, feel like an exhausting performance of mass cognitive dissonance . For many of us, participating in Pride™ now requires a type of queer double consciousness . What used to be a celebration of and for queer communities now includes a deeply performative element that uses us as a viable market demographic in a capitalistic culture that is — seemingly — never actually going to see us as valid members. I’m so tired of prancing in parades to win acceptance into cis-het society that I skipped it this year. I refuse to masquerade in respectability drag to be a more palatable mascot. My identity is not brandable content . Pride hasn’t always been this way. It was different when the summer glitter parades really were just for queer people, but now they’re for everyone. And while that sounds nice in theory, “allied” sponsors have begun to take up so much space in our parades that it doesn’t feel like there’s enough room for the complexity of our experience anymore. It’s not too late to take back our stolen celebration. But if we want what is rightfully ours, we must tap into our rage . A few years ago, Them Magazine dubbed July “ Queer Wrath Month .” It finally seems like it’s catching on . Maybe it’s finally sunk in that we can take nothing for granted in this post-Roe hellscape and we might want to start fighting for our rights before they begin to dissipate. We can’t glitter-gloss over the fact of our threatened existence and we can’t sashay our way out of prison. Not only do we as queer people need to enthusiastically embrace our rage in this post-Roe moment, we need everyone who reaps the rewards of our long struggle for liberation to get pissed and fight with us. You don’t have to work very hard to find the queer battles already being fought with force — you just have to look past the mainstream headlines. In May, as normies obsessively planned their Pride itineraries, queer activists in Louisiana were locking their bodies in solidarity to protest the state’s vote to ban trans women and girls from playing on female school sports teams. Protesters from The Real Name Campaign — a New Orleans-based grassroots group that fights for trans people in Louisiana — occupied the state Capitol until they were forcibly removed by security guards. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, thousands of queer people (and real allies) opted out of Pride parades and organized abortion rights protests instead. And some Pride parades in major cities such as New York and Chicago turned into equal parts gay parade and abortion rights protest . Not only is the coexistence of joy and rage the real spirit of what Pride means, it’s also a reminder that we don’t have to choose between recognizing what we have and demanding what we need. Small groups of focused gays are already leading the fight against our government’s tepid response to the emerging monkeypox crisis. To be clear, monkeypox is not a “ gay disease ” — nor does such a thing exist — but queer people are being disproportionately impacted by the virus. Alice B. Toklas LGBTQ Democratic Club, the oldest queer democratic society in the U.S., recently took action at the Department of Health and Human Services headquarters in San Francisco to demand a more robust response to monkeypox . The truth is that we have a lot to be angry about right now, and rage has been proven to shift tides. Queer and trans people know that any threat to the bodily autonomy of any human is a threat to us all, and we know what kind of tragedy awaits when a virus that could infect anyone gets dubbed a “gay disease.” We also know how to channel our outrage into action. Right now, it may seem like unicorns dominate queer culture, but that’s just what looks good on TV. Queer people are not just gorgeous mythical creatures, we are also rebellious and dangerous when oppressed. Right now, queer activists are organizing to fight against oppressions new and old, and we are unwilling to smile gayly in the face of oppression. To be clear, I am not gay as in happy. I am queer as in fuck the police . Look, I know that some people are turned off by the energy of rage. We’ve been told our whole lives that anger is bad and should stay under wraps. But the fundamentally binary logic underlying the notion that a natural human emotion is bad and should be repressed is the same logic that undergirds systemic oppression . Rage is not the opposite of love. In fact, my outrage in this post-Roe moment is 100% fueled by love. I love women and I love trans people and I love queers, and that love is not just hearts and flowers. It’s also fierce and not to be trifled with . Our queer rage could be not just a weapon in the fight for liberation , but also an antidote to the apathy so many of us have been hypnotized into by the (failed) promises of acceptance and equality. No matter what the white cis heteropatriarchy tells you about anger being a toxic emotion, it’s all just sedative blather. Queer history is mired in resistance and yet our rage has never destroyed us. Instead, our collective anger when channeled , has always given us the energy we need to come together and protect our lives and our liberation. If we stay grounded in love and rise up in rage, we can render our wrath into something that is both a weapon and a salve. We all know the first Pride was a riot , but the second was both a protest and a celebration . We can have acceptance and liberation. But only if we are willing to fight for it. In the earlier days of the queer liberation movement, we had to force ourselves into the spotlight. First we had to fight for basic human rights and then we had to fight for the world to like us. Well, now everybody’s gay , but the fight isn’t over. The price we paid for assimilation into respectable society can’t be our souls. No shade to Lizzo (like never ever) but if you’re not angry as hell right now, you’re not gay and you’re not an ally. You’re just a mid in glitter.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer Every autumn, the male satin bowerbird forages both the forests and suburbs of Australia in search of the color blue — berries, discarded bottle caps, plastic straws — and arranges his finds around a pile of sticks. When a female visits him, the male hops around her flamboyantly in a mating ritual, screeching and showing off his kaleidoscopic hues. This is just one of the species that Pattie Gonia, a drag queen who first became famous for hiking up the Rocky Mountains in 6-inch heels, brings up when I ask her what nature and drag queens have in common. “Just look at all of the gay birds that are always popping off with song and dance performances,” she tells me. “Queerness shows up everywhere in every single kingdom on planet Earth.” When I think of what an environmentalist looks like, someone like Pattie Gonia — with her full face of makeup, teased wig and declarations of queerness — doesn’t register. Environmentalists are supposed to look like Greta Thunberg and their work is supposed to resemble raising their voice at powerful white men until they care about vanishing ice caps. But Pattie Gonia frolics in fields in elaborate dresses made of camping tents while educating her followers about the nuances and importance of recycling . Her brand of environmentalism, which is mostly devoid of evangelizing, is clearly resonating. She has more than 609,000 followers across Instagram and TikTok and recently had the opportunity to partner with The North Face in a multi-city Summer of Pride event series that included taking queer people on hikes in an effort to connect the community to nature. Even the most open-minded person might ask, how does a drag queen, a person typically endemic to big coastal cities, find themself in the mountains of Colorado? Like many queer origin stories, Pattie’s began with a moment of defiance. In a previous life, she walked the Earth full time as Wyn Wiley, a photographer from Nebraska. Four years ago, Wiley attended a photography conference and was invited to a party that encouraged attendees to dress however they liked; they decided to attend as Ginger Snap, a redheaded drag queen with black platform heels. The photos from that party made it back to Wiley’s hometown, and in the weeks that followed, friends silently walked out of their life during what they describe as a “very sad time.” Wiley decided to combine the freedom they found in the outdoors with a newfound sense of rebellion and took the shoes they’d worn as Ginger Snap to the Colorado mountains as a final “fuck you” to everyone and everything that had hurt her. They posted it on social media and woke up to several million views and hundreds of messages from gay people saying it was the first time they had seen anyone so visibly queer out in nature. “I never thought the intersection of queerness and the outdoors would be possible,” they tell me. And so Pattie Gonia was born. Midway through our conversation, I realized that I am Pattie Gonia’s target audience: a gay person whose idea of nature is the grassy median that separates two sides of a highway. I moved to New York as soon as I turned 18 because the city represented safety while the countryside and suburbs I grew up in harbored the possibility of homophobia at every turn. As a visibly queer person, nature didn’t represent serenity; it was an unwelcoming place where I had to hide who I was. Pattie encouraged me to challenge deeply rooted ideas of where gay people are “supposed” to exist. “What I find often is that people go to cities to find that queer community, but it’s often limited to bars, drug culture, alcohol; and people are projecting their own trauma on each other and are often repeating harmful patterns,” she tells me. “Nature for our mental health is one of the most healing things that anyone can do.” Among other things, studies have shown that being in nature significantly reduces stress , improves overall mood and reduces the risk of developing depression . Pattie does acknowledge the reality that the outdoors is not always a safe place for queer or trans people. It’s the reason she never gets into drag when she is alone or why she goes with groups of other queer people to turn the trail into a big, gay party. Still, “nine times out of 10,” she reassures me, people she runs into in nature respond to her presence with more joy and curiosity than hostility. But does her activism reflect an open-mindedness in the larger fight against climate change, or do people just gravitate to Pattie because a hiking drag queen feels like a novelty? Pattie genuinely thinks that the tide is changing in environmentalism and that marginalized communities, specifically people of color and queer people, are finally being listened to. She attributes organizations like Queer Nature as the reason she can do more intersectional work and tells me that straight and white environmentalists are realizing that in order to survive, the movement will have to be as diverse as nature itself: “In a meadow, having a lot of different species leads to its survival,” she says. I hope her vision for the future comes true. The inclusion of queer people in the climate movement seems like a big step forward, but hearing Pattie talk makes it seem like it’s the only logical step. She made me think about all the ways in which our existence is affirmed in the natural world. Besides the satin bowerbird, she pointed out a fish species that goes through several sex changes throughout its life and sea creatures that change their appearance to look like the opposite gender. “So many animals put on drag everyday,” she says. The more I think about it, the more profound that revelation becomes. It makes me confront all the erroneous ideas that have made me feel separate from nature: that people like us don’t exist there or that a quiet life in the woods is reserved for straight men who look like lumberjacks. When I let go of those ideas, the world suddenly feels bigger. Queerness is not a concept invented by liberals or a mode of existence confined by geography. According to Pattie Gonia, it is precisely what nature intends us to be.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer While we’ve made notable strides, it’s safe to say that 2023 is still a tricky time for queer people and their basic human right to exist , let alone thrive. And so, coping mechanisms are necessary, whether they be family support systems, talk therapy, or, well, weed. This recent small but enlightening study found that individuals who identify as bisexual used cannabis more frequently than their counterparts of other sexual orientations. The study, wittily titled “The Pot at the End of the Rainbow,” pulled survey data from 10 universities and analyzed responses from 4,700 college students aged 18-30. According to the report, coping was one of the leading motives for cannabis use among this group of participants. The data also reflected higher rates of anxiety, depression, cannabis use disorder, and risk of suicide within this demographic. Before we dive into the analysis, it’s important to note that all the data collected was self-reported by participants. Still, the report shed light on two important topics for young people right now. First, weed is not just a hobby for many people — it’s a way to self-soothe. Researchers were concerned, however, that their bisexual participants reported that they not only use flower and edibles, but also concentrates, which are more potent. Many health professionals would argue that high THC takes a coping mechanism from self-soothing to self-medicating. Secondly, the study highlights the unique mental health challenges faced by those who identify as bisexual. Bisexual individuals exist in a complicated space where they face stigma for being queer but also often feel left out of LGBTQ spaces and issues. This combined pressure and isolation results in higher adverse mental health outcomes. Biphobia is real, and so are the mental health conditions caused by internalizing stereotypes and identity invalidation from members of the straight and LGBTQ+ communities. And because there’s not nearly enough conversation about or support for those who don’t identify as squarely gay or straight, life can feel isolating and scary. Hopefully, this research ― which is about weed, but is actually about mental health ― could be the introduction to a deeper dive. On a lighter note, the data also found the second leading motive for cannabis use among those attracted to multiple genders to be much less depressing and more joyful. They refer to this as “enhancement.” “Enhancement is about expanding one’s awareness, being more open to experience and more creative, so perhaps it all comes back to openness,” said Carrie Cuttler, an assistant professor of psychology and senior author of the study. At the end of the day, if this study teaches us anything, it’s that we need to support each other, continue to fight for queer people’s rights, and destigmatize weed use so adults can indulge safely.

    "article_content": "Contributing writer I loved all the religions I knew about as a young child. From the sweet-faced Jesus my great-grandparents talked about to the stern big daddy God of my Pentecostal cousins to the muddy femme spell-craft of my Appalachian kin, it didn’t seem strange to believe in it all. Then life happened. I learned you had to pick a god or at least a side. But I couldn’t see myself on one spiritual path. All of them seemed to revere the binary. Some paths were more equal than others for women. Most seemed ruled by men, with no possibility of genderlessness or ambiguity in any religious space. As a female-assigned person who was dubious about gender from a young age, I knew that I did not belong. I am not the only queer person who has struggled to find their place in a spiritual community. Sadly, I consider myself lucky because I did not experience religious trauma or the long-term emotional damage caused by practices like exclusion , or conversion therapy. For me, not fitting into religion was disappointing but not dangerous. Unfortunately, that is not true for many queer people . While many people find comfort and community in religion, queer people often face rejection and denigration that take a major toll on our well-being. Recent research suggests that religious trauma increases the risk of abuse , mental illness and suicidality for queer people. But it is human to crave a spiritual home, and more and more queer people are forging new spiritual paths instead of waiting for the old dogs of religion to learn new tricks. What contemporary queer spiritual leaders are doing is revolutionary as they rehabilitate our relationship with old religious ideas and structures. “I left mainstream Christianity because as an Asian American, bisexual woman, I intimately know what it feels like to have my body scrutinized and vilified as a sin,” Tara Teng, a spiritual embodiment coach in Vancouver, Canada, tells me. Teng helps people heal from trauma using their bodies. But she was formerly a preacher in the evangelical Southern Baptist tradition, as was her father. Ultimately, she was called to a different path because the intersections of her identity were not accepted. “ There was an expectation to live up to my parents’ dreams for me, and being a bisexual Christian or ex-evangelical was not part of that,” Teng says. Now a leader in the Deconstructing Faith movement — a loosely organized group of spiritual orphans — she uses her work as an embodiment coach to help people reconnect to spirituality and their bodies after religious trauma. “When we know in our bodies that we, as queer people, are a unique embodiment of the Divine, then we can see how we have been lied to by institutions seeking to gatekeep access to God,” Teng says. “It does not have to be this way, and we can heal the trauma in our nervous systems that have been taught to believe such lies.” Our queer bodies are divine in and of themselves, says Teng, while also being a site of spiritual connection. We don’t need to be healed of our queerness, but we do need help recovering from religious teachings that tell us otherwise. Teng believes that a queer theology — ideas about God, religion and spirituality designed by and for queer people — can help us heal. “Healing comes when we welcome back the parts of ourselves that we severed due to trauma and anti-gay theology,” Teng says. “The key to my work is coming back into a relationship with our bodies. And for those who want to stay connected to their spirituality, recognizing that we, as queer people, are also made in the image of God.” She sees her beliefs not as contrary to the Christian faith but as reinterpretations of Scripture. “God is described in the Bible using gender-fluid imagery that includes both masculine and feminine energy — i.e., God as a father and as a mother — and God self-identifies in a nonbinary way by simply stating, ‘I am that I am’ in Exodus 3:14,” Teng says. “If we can embrace a God who transforms to become a human, then it really isn’t a far stretch to believe a person might transform their gender in the same way.” The idea of God as trans and/or nonbinary is validating for those who don’t believe humans can be boxed into genders. Teng’s queer, embodied theology has revolutionized her spiritual experience. Studying queer theology brought her to the realization that her queerness is good, holy and can be a reflection of a divine being beyond our limited imaginations. Now she aims to bring that revolutionary insight to others. She believes healing the physiological trauma from religious persecution can help us realize and feel divinity. In many religious traditions, queer bodies are policed and punished instead of celebrated and sanctified. In the mainstream religious imagination, we are simply cautionary tales. Some queer spiritual leaders believe that changing the narrative around queer spirituality is part of reconciling our religious experience. “A big part of my work right now is telling spiritual stories — my own and those in the community,” says Caitlin Breedlove, vice president of movement leadership at Auburn Seminary in Phoenix. Queer spirituality, Breedlove reminds us, is not new. “There are ancient ways of understanding spirituality and our spiritual connection that predate monotheism and contemporary white supremacy and capitalism.” Centering stories instead of antiquated patriarchal lore serves queer people. It engages spiritually minded queers in more expansive ideas rooted in the world and community. “Many are yearning to know more,” she says. Breedlove sees a change in spiritual spaces. She believes more is possible and necessary, as many traditional faith organizations are at least somewhat accepting of queerness. “I would love to see the boldest theologies right now.” A more radical queer spiritual future is what Breedlove is conceptualizing — one that requires our active participation. “We are still conforming our theology to outdated shapes, patterns and stories. We require the ancient, and we require the new in our theology.” Breedlove believes queer theology would come primarily from Indigenous wisdom, Black liberation teachings, communally queer understandings and spiritual knowledge that comes from the margins. Our queer spiritual work is also sociopolitical work. Queer spiritual spaces that center on ideas of inclusivity often end up evolving communities in unexpected ways. An online community space called enfleshed started to fill a need for queer Christians but has ended up serving people of many faiths and practices. “We began enfleshed solidly on the fringes of the Christian tradition but have evolved into some broader directions,” says Rev. M Jade Kaiser, director of enfleshed in Iowa. enfleshed is a collective space of creative spiritual resources designed to support people who want to practice a more liberating spirituality — individually and collectively, says Kaiser. They have no explicit dogma, Christian or otherwise. Instead, what you find at enfleshed is mostly ideas for practices intended to help move individuals creatively towards personal and collective liberation. I know that sounds a little woo, but their eponymous newsletter is full of essays and suggestions for practices that are thought-provoking and practical. I can feel those stories told by the many artists and thinkers, who comprise enfleshed, in the tender meat of my heart. As Breedlove mentioned, even hearing queer stories of spiritual practice and transformation feels revolutionary. Teng’s work, and the like, help me understand how my spiritual wounds have changed the way I move in my body and the world. It gives me hope for healing. Old-time religion gave us the soul-crushing misconception that queer people don’t deserve God. We’ve been mostly denied entry into many houses of worship, much less the pearly gates of heaven. But we are no longer accepting that rejection as evidence of our original sin. Instead, we are reconceptualizing religion and spirituality in pursuit of both personal liberation and healing the collective. Queer people aren’t coming for your old gods, we’re making God anew. I see a new trinity emerging in this queer spiritual revolution: body, story and collective. These are the places where we can find the inspiration to enliven our world, animate our bodies and speak a language suited to the soul. This is a trinity without hierarchy. Contemporary queer spiritual leaders know that we must address all three at once to help us move, not just away from the harms of the past but toward new visions of healing for our collective future.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer The Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 were fueled by images that reshaped how many of us think about representation. At first, these were images of injustice, then, in the months that followed, resistance. Those images paved the way for a visual culture that ushered in a new wave of photographers of color who, through their striking and emotionally complex work, redefined what it means not just to be seen but also felt. When HuffPost Voices — newly relaunched as a section focused on celebrating the identities we embody — conceptualized an IRL photography pop-up this fall, three photographers came to mind as featured artists: Justin Wee, Kamyiis Mclean and Myles Loftin. They’d not just found success through representing queer people and people of color, but also by reclaiming the stories that are told about their communities by outsiders. In a culture that tends to co-opt and exploit our experiences as queer people of color, seizing those narratives felt like the only logical place to begin redefining what it means to be us. Loftin’s career took off when he was a student at Parsons, where he worked on a photo project called “HOODED.” Its intent was to offer a counter-narrative to the widespread stereotypes about Black men in hoodies; namely, that a Black person wearing one is criminal by default. To turn that on its head, “HOODED” featured joyfully nuanced images of Black men in colorful hoodies, smiling, hugging each other and frolicking. Loftin has held on to the ethos that gave birth to “HOODED” throughout his flourishing career, which includes high-fashion print covers. The 24-year-old says that, although the project was criticized by some for the perceived feminization of the men in it, he believed that those people were just uncomfortable because they weren’t used to seeing Black men embracing the radical act of joy. It’s that discomfort that signals a touched nerve and, hopefully, a shifted belief system — one that realizes that Black men are not a monolith nor are they vehicles for outsiders’ ignorant stereotypes. One of Loftin’s recent and notable portrait series features members of the House of LaBeija, a ballroom house that has welcomed Loftin in as chosen family. Their expressions of transness and queerness, manifested through movement and clothes, have helped Loftin step into his own identity and sustainable peace. These portraits all challenging tenets about the ways in which queer and/or people of color should “behave.” Especially in today’s political climates, merely “seeing” a marginalized person is not enough because the ways in which we’ve been seen historically always come with a default set of baggage. Black men and other marginalized people are hypervisible ― disproportionately seen, actually. And often the attention tends to be ambivalent or even destructive. That’s something that Justin J. Wee, an Asian-Australian photographer, addresses in his work, too. When he’s not shooting, Wee does drag — and the two worlds overlap in harmonious, unexpected ways. He points to the ways in which both mediums allow him to see himself and others in ways that feel complicated, multilayered and ultimately freeing. “I love creating an environment where the people that I’m photographing can see a version of themselves that they don’t normally get to see,” Wee says. His drag challenges his relationship to himself in a way that his photography does for others. In one of the portraits displayed at the Voices event earlier this month, Wee is shirtless, his face halfway beat and aglow across a cosmetic mirror. The image is tender, carrying a weight familiar to any queer child of immigrants who understands that to reach a fuller version of oneself often means having to depart, in some way, from family. “As Asian folk, we’ve been indoctrinated in a very specific form of masculinity or culture or obligation to our families, and I really want to see myself in a way that I wasn’t allowed to as a kid,” Wee tells me. “I just want to reclaim that for myself.” Mclean is similarly on a photographic journey that involves both reclaiming his narrative and helping others craft and nurture their own. He was born and raised in Jamaica and moved to New York in 2016 to pursue his dreams of photographing queer people and fashion, two subjects that weren’t particularly favored back home. Mclean’s photographs, which have been featured in Vogue as well several other fashion outlets, are imbued with a quiet defiance that aims to empower Black and brown people. His images often include subjects adorned in garments and accessories that are meant to harness their inner majesty. In one portrait, a woman carries a basket of flowers in a desert while wearing a flowing black dress, embedding elements of glamour to a peacefully bucolic scene. The 25-year-old got his first big break during the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests, when he took a picture of a person holding a sign that said “Power to the People,” which went viral. “The pandemic brought everyone of color to the next level,” he says. “It opened their eyes, and they saw that it was a movement that’s supposed to be about our representation.” For Mclean, glamor and power go hand-in-hand since they both evoke a sense of agency, especially for Black subjects. Regardless of the assignment, owning your own story is paramount for him. The three photographers were already putting out meaningful work before the pandemic, but BLM as an evolving movement gave them a real chance to tell stories that might have been deemed too complicated just a few years earlier. Through their images, the photographers are still shaping the legacy of the movement, hopefully one that moves us all closer toward a world in which our identities are shaped by stories told through a love of the self rather than the uninformed gaze of others. Ultimately, true representation means allowing historically disrespected people to embody the full beauty and complexity of the human condition. This isn’t, Wee believes, just about being seen but about making us feel whole. “‘Being seen’ is such a buzzy thing to say, and I feel cynical about it now,” he says. “What’s important is to give people agency, to give people tools that allow them to self-actualize — and not just give them a moment.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer Not long after Jay Colindres began his career, he became one of the most well-known up-and-coming actors in Latin America. The problem was that people didn’t know he was acting. In 2015, he appeared on the mega-popular Spanish-language courtroom show “ Caso Cerrado” ― think a Hispanic Judge Judy ― in which Colindres played Esteban, a mean-spirited gay man who is involved in a love triangle. In one episode of “Caso Cerrado,” Esteban and his baby’s mother (don’t even ask ―just watch the episode) get into it and she throws water on his face, which prompts him to yell a phrase that became instantly memeable : “Estupida, mi pelo, idiota.” Most of us know that courtroom TV shows mix a little bit of truth with a lot of acting. Despite that, many who watched that episode of “ Caso Cerrado” believed that Esteban was a real person and desperately wanted to see more of him. “People wanted me to stick to that character,” he says. “But that wasn’t what I wanted — and I also didn’t know how to move on from that.” To set the record straight, Colindres uploaded a YouTube video titled “ The Truth Behind Caso Cerrado .” In it, he explained that he’s an actor, not the character Esteban from the show. He also stressed his versatility; he could transform into whichever character he was assigned, from a saintlike figure to a hardened hit man. Like so many queer people, Colindres is a master of transformation. Colindres has 7 million followers across platforms, but it’s most likely that you’ve seen him on TikTok, where his presence speaks to his genuine ability to reinvent himself. On the platform, he’s most often wearing a wig and rocking drag that looks thrifted. You might have seen one video in which he’s dressed in a shiny purple Selena-esque jumpsuit while someone chases him through the streets and asks, in full paparazzi mode, “Selena, Selena, is that you?” Colindres turns around and belts out “Como La Flor” while pouting and giving an awkward, self-assured nod. It’s not Selena Quintanilla, of course — it’s the Kirkland brand version of her. And I say that with all due respect. #duet with @jaycolindres In all their awkwardness and shyness, these new characters are much more authentic to Colindres than the loud and abrasive Esteban ever was. “It’s pretty much me,” he says. “I guess people connected with my brain.” Perhaps Colindres’ ability to shape-shift stems from the way he’s adapted to different environments. When he was 13 years old, he moved to Boston from Guatemala and lived in a neighborhood full of Latinos from different countries. Now, he lives between Boston and Antigua, Guatemala, where he says he feels safer and more himself than in America. Colindres carries his Latinidad and his queerness in a way that I always felt was impossible for myself. I envy that, in a way. He’s able to wear a dress and a wig and act flamboyantly and still somehow be loved by a comprehensive Latin American audience (he says his biggest fan base is in Brazil). I had to ask him if he faces hate for being visibly queer in the Latin community. From my own experience of growing up Latino and queer, “maricon,” or the f-word in Spanish, was casually thrown around all throughout my childhood. Once, I was caught wearing a dress by an uncle, which led to an appointment with the chancla. “I don’t know. I really don’t know,” Colindres says. “I think people connect with me because it’s humor and people like to laugh.” His answer makes me think despite the homophobia that permeates the culture, he doesn’t spend too much of his emotional energy dwelling on it. Similarly to how he felt after playing Esteban, Colindres senses another shift coming. He doesn’t just want to stay confined to his pink wig character on TikTok anymore. For the public, Colindres has always been in some form of drag. But he is finally dipping his toe into just being himself, and that includes expressions from across the gender spectrum. Colindres suspects that this shift might be challenging since some peoples’ reactions to his wigless TikToks have made him a little nervous. “I’ve read comments that are like, ‘If you’re not wearing a pink wig, next time you’re not gonna get a comment,’” he says. This is, sometimes, both the gift and burden of playing a beloved character. To me, Colindres the person is much more interesting than any character he could play, if only because he proves that being LGBTQ and Latine really sets you up to step into any role you choose. If there’s anything Colindres’ career so far has shown us, it’s that you don’t need to marry a trope just because it was a great fit for a season. Colindres will be whoever he wants to be, and he’ll do it authentically and unapologetically. He won’t stop transforming, and he definitely won’t abandon comedy. “In life, I’ve learned that as long as you laugh about everything, everything is going to be fine,” he says.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer On Saturday night, a gunman opened fire with a rifle at the only queer club in Colorado Springs, killing five people and injuring several others. By many accounts , Club Q was a special place where the LGBTQ community and their allies gathered to drink, dance and be with one another. People at the club, including army veteran Richard Fierro and a trans woman, acted quickly to subdue the gunman before he could get to the backyard, where dozens of the patrons had fled. If you’re a queer person, this shooting feels personal. At a moment in history when the GOP has portrayed drag queens as child groomers and trans people as predators , an attack of this magnitude felt inevitable. Perhaps, unless something drastic changes, that threat will remain. But I resist any urge to try to understand the intentions of violent people. I do, however, wish to tell the world about what happens in spaces that are made and frequented by queer people, especially if they’ve never been to one, so they’re not hearing it from those who have a stake in our destruction. I first experienced unconditional love in a poorly lit gay dive bar called the Boiler Room in Manhattan, where a jukebox played cheap remixes of Ariana Grande songs and a generous helping of Mariah. It was a bar I went to several times a week and where I found my first semblance of queer community: There was always a group of old queens who were a little too loud, friends who argued over a pool table, and a bartender who called me “sweetie.” In this space, people danced no matter what song was playing — even, once, to a song by Mozart. It was the first time that someone told me that I was part of some shared experience, this monumental thing called queerness. It was there that I confessed to a random group of older gay men, shaking from anxiety, that I was queer. They hugged me and said that I was loved. It was the first time that someone told me that I was part of some shared experience, this monumental thing called queerness. It was also the first time that I understood that being gay did not mean that I was alone in the world. Here, in this space, it meant quite the opposite. Because I was able to come into my identity in queer havens, I am alive today. Last year, I told my close friends that I wanted to throw a party where queer and trans people of color could feel truly free. Freedom, to me, is the privilege of forgetting, even if just for a few hours, the heaviness of our existence. That party eventually grew into Whorechata , which has grown into a community that is much larger than any one person. It’s a place that feels like the first real home to me and so many of the people I care about. It’s a place, I hope, that is filled with the possibility of unconditional love, especially for queer people for color. Club Q had a similar commitment to being a radically inclusive space — at least two of the shooting’s victims were trans. These types of businesses represent a new type of queer space, one that goes beyond the ones I grew up going to, which often centered gay men’s desire for sex. Perhaps it is this amended, porous queerness, infinite in its possibilities, that terrifies conservatives. We are no longer just looking for people to hook up with behind closed doors, but also daring to imagine lives where we are fully seen. We are not only forming new ways of being, but also finding new ways of setting ourselves free. Queer bars began because straight people didn’t want to look at us. Dan Savage, a journalist and activist, tweeted after the shooting that, “An attack like this says ‘not even here.’ Behind closed doors isn’t good enough for *them.* It’s not that they want us to exist out of sight. They don’t want us to exist at all.” The solution, he says, is to make ourselves visible everywhere, conjuring a Stonewall-era slogan: “Out of the bars and into the streets!” I came out to my parents after the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016 because I figured that if so much of the world was going to hate me, they would hate me regardless of whether I was closeted or not. It feels heavy to think that, six years later, this shooting will serve a similar function for other queer teens. I wish I could hold them and tell them to not be afraid, that if these people understood how beautiful it is to be queer, they would be giving us flowers instead of bullets. The Club Q shooting reminded me that Whorechata, which has taken up so much of my world, is ultimately a bubble — one that was created out of the collective conscience of a handful of queer and trans people who imagined something better. It also renewed my conviction that this bubble will keep expanding, because so many more people are realizing that to be queer is to be free. Maybe someday enough people will see the possibilities of queerness and that bubble will finally burst open, letting in all who wish to reimagine the ways in which we can be in community with each other. The gunman reignited a rage that has always lived inside of us, but he didn’t understand that it’s impossible to terrorize a population whose very existence is built on defiance. There’s a quote that encapsulates exactly what I feel at this moment: To be visibly queer is to choose our happiness over our safety. There are those who will continue to make us feel like our safety is in jeopardy. I imagine they must have never spent much time in a queer bar — I think that if they did, they would see us dancing with each other, singing until we’re purple and understand that through every storm, we have always chosen joy.

    "article_content": "Comedian I’ve been a fan of comedy for years. I grew up, like many of us did, listening to the greats (yes, listening, because my parents had albums). I also remember staying up late to catch HBO’s “Def Comedy Jam.” I can still hear the late, great Bernie Mac saying “I ain’t scared of you muthafuckers” in my head as I write this — a mantra I’d need later when I began to develop my own stage identity. “Def Comedy Jam” was raw, hilarious and probably the reason people are scared to sit up front at comedy shows today. So buckle up, because nothing was off-limits. A comic would hit with the jokes and roast the crowd, leaving everyone in tears. The roasting felt familiar because growing up, the dinner table was crowd work — my family had jokes for days and on any given evening, you might just end up being the butt of one. In the ’90s, shows such as “Def Comedy Jam” and BET’s “ComicView” were like boot camps for aspiring comedians. The race and gender representation piqued my curiosity, leading me to believe that I, too, could one day get up onstage and tell jokes. As a Black woman, watching comedians like Mo’Nique command the room before even touching the mic inspired me to examine what her magic was made of. When Whoopi Goldberg, Melanie Comarcho and Wanda Sykes shared their stories onstage and on screen, there was a distinct vulnerability that shone through. It made them mesmerizing and accessible all at once — and it gave me the confidence to eventually get out there and shoot my shot. Pursuing comedy was not easy, but the journey started early. I was a carefree child who lived off of candy, Nickelodeon and vibes. I was also the typical class clown and my grandfather, who was a pastor, played a pivotal role in shaping my comedy career. I remember pulling him aside one day before church services to tell him, “Hey, after you finish your sermon and saving folks, I got some things I want to share with the people.” He loved it, and gladly let me take the reins for a few precious minutes. Eight-year-old me was fearless. And so after my grandfather finished preaching (closing with the fifth benediction — iykyk), I would go up and say whatever was on my heart: either a funny story or a reiteration of something that stood out from my grandfather’s sermon. Thinking back, I’m like, how bold is that to go up after the headliner? It’s like grown-up me pulling up to Chris Rock before he went onstage at Madison Square Garden and being like, “Hey bruh, let me do a tight five after you’re done.” Adulthood swiftly robbed me of that gumption. Challenging life experiences overshadowed my playful audacity, and insecurities raged. I allowed my self-worth to be controlled by bad relationships with men, health struggles and good ol’ racism with a side of microaggressions. Being in the South, I would legit have bookers tell me that they “already have a Black comic on the show.” They would do this with other minorities too — like, “Hey, we got our one Asian or one gay person.” Meanwhile, the lineup would be all white men sprinkled with the bare minimum of tokens. Sometimes bookers would even ask how Black or “urban” my act was — as if my Black-ass experience had a volume knob I should be turning up and down. It bothered me that they didn’t understand diversity within diversity. My parents moved around a lot when I was younger until they settled on the ’burbs — which was a culture shock. It was so white, my first crush was named Brett. That was a lot to unpack. Still, I refused to downplay my authentic identity and experiences for any audience. There are layers to being a Black woman comedian. We have to work twice as hard for a laugh and bring it every single time, which only adds more stress. And god forbid a woman shows weakness, especially a Strong Black Woman; there is no room for mental breakdowns for us in this field. There are also the beauty standards. And the constant code-switching to fit into certain spaces. And this will come as a shock to absolutely no one, but the game is heavily run by dudes. Many of you are nodding along because this applies to your industry as well. But here’s the thing about being a comedian: No matter how bright that spotlight is, I sometimes feel overlooked or altogether invisible no matter how hard I bring it. To be a Black woman and spill your heart onstage so that others can find beauty and levity in your humanity is a unique kind of exhausting. When I started doing comedy, I never realized how much of my life and experiences I would expose onstage. In general, I’m pretty guarded — I need to trust someone before I get vulnerable with them. Hopping up onstage feeling butt naked emotionally, hoping that people not just like me but find me funny? It’s terrifying. But for me and so many other comedians, that type of transparency is incredibly freeing. Initially, my act was observational mixed with a few jokes about my family life. It took me a while to find my voice. But baaybee — when I found my stride, I started telling all my business without a second thought. OK, maybe not all my business, but sometimes I leave shows asking myself, “Harpo, who dis woman?” There is so much power in owning who you are unapologetically. Especially when the world is always doubting you. An added bonus is that sometimes a punchline, or just sharing your journey, will heal someone else. It’s healing for me to have those uncomfortable conversations onstage. I had to shed the self-consciousness I developed because a shitty, insecure ex made me painfully aware of all my physical flaws, just to boost his ego. And ironically, sharing my experiences about him and all the other bad dates I’ve had in New York has been both hilarious and therapeutic for me and some of y’all in the audience. I also joke onstage about my fibroids, a reproductive condition I was diagnosed with a few years ago (it truly is the sex education no one asked for). During the pandemic, I launched a show series called “Make Fibroids Funny Again.” For the record, there’s nothing funny about the pain associated with fibroids, but the interactions I’ve had with women who find humor in the struggle have confirmed my purpose. More on that on my podcast ― shameless plug ― “Copay with April Body,” dropping soon. Oh, and I’m on a mission to end racial disparities in America’s janky health care system. So taking it easy, I guess. Being radically open as a Black woman onstage is actually an act of resistance — and some people don’t want us to seize this type of freedom. Our courage to be vulnerable is truly a superpower. Hearing people laugh at some of my silliest ideas (or getting that church “hmmm” when a relatable subject hits) is my motivation to keep pushing. Moving into 2023, for me, means leaving the dusty dating pool on read and walking into a dark comedy club every weekend ready to talk about fibroids and any other part of my humanity.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer Now that all the coverage of the performances and style at this year’s Essence Fest has mellowed out, it’s time to talk about the elephant in the room: the concept that the festival facilitators have a “new audience” in mind. Namely, younger Black women . Earlier this summer, my friend Loren and I made a road trip to New Orleans to attend in person for the first time. It was an exhilarating experience. Ms. Lauryn Hill and Missy Elliott killed it on stage, there was decadent Creole and Jamaican food everywhere I turned, and vibes were immaculate. Although I’m only 24 years old, and therefore younger than the festival’s largest age demographic, Essence’s new leadership made it clear during panels and in advertising that they’re looking to expand their global audience through new branding as Essence Ventures over the next several years. The 2020 launch of Girls United, a section of the magazine for Gen Z readers, piqued my interest as Essence began exploring new ways to maintain its relevance in a hyper-digital world. The median age for readers of the print magazine is 47 , which is generally reflective of the age range of women who attend the festival. I knew that it’s a space dominated by an older demographic than myself, where squads of aunties enjoy concerts and a little carefree debauchery at after-parties on Bourbon Street, often with their sorors. On the first night of Essence Fest, young crowds were invited to Girls United’s first-ever festival “kickback” in a separate building of the convention center. The event promised to be an “auntie-free zone” with an abundance of Instagram-worthy photo-ops, live music from local artist 504 Icy Girl, and a casual appearance from Jabari Banks, who plays Will Smith on Peacock’s “ Bel-Air .” “The Kickback is new territory for Gen Z’ers to act up without the pressures of the aunties this year at Essence Fest,” Essence reporter Kenyatta Victoria wrote in the event’s description. What Victoria meant to convey, I believe, was that this event and this space were created for those looking to, perhaps, partake in behavior that is associated with Gen Z: a little more body liberation, for example. But yeah, the phrase “pressures of the aunties” is pretty loaded. Many older attendees of the festival were vocal about Essence catering to younger crowds with exclusive events and even having Megan Thee Stallion as a headliner. In a private Facebook group with more than 15,000 members, they voiced their opinions about feeling ostracized at a celebration that has historically centered their age demographic. The Facebook group proved a great resource for me, as veteran Essence Fest attendees gave tips on how to make the most of the experience and what to pack. But the conversations often took a turn during and after the celebrations, with disputes between older and younger attendees on matters such as Meg the Stallion bringing fans on stage for a “twerk-a-thon,” and some commenters accusing others of complaining about “everything” all festival long. And the debates about the GU kickback proved to be one of the hottest topics in the group. To play devil’s advocate here: Meg the Stallion is for everyone. And sometimes when we talk about “age,” we’re really talking about more of a mental space than a physical reality. But this tension raised an important question: Is an “auntie-free” zone — at certain events or social settings — ageist, or is it just plain necessary? The conversation has made its way to message boards and TikTok posts alike. “As an older woman [52], it felt disrespectful and off-putting as I have been to Essence since 1999 and have stayed out until the sun came up,” said a commenter who asked that her real name not be used, in reference to Essence calling the kickback an “auntie-free zone.” “It sounded like Essence didn’t want my money at that event. It’s hard to feel welcome at an event that says it’s not for you.” Janet Young, a 61-year-old member of the private Facebook group, commented: “I don’t get it! I understand that you have to keep up with the trends. I faithfully attended Essence Festival 12 straight times until this year. It seems like they’re trying to satisfy the wrong demographic.” Well, “the wrong demographic” is just as loaded a term. Not every artist has a multigenerational fan base, but the festival does. To me, the biggest signifier of good music is its ability to transcend time and entice a whole new generation. I’m a big fan of some newer artists, but my favorite singer of all time is Stevie Wonder. Rather than Essence catering to a certain age cohort with its lineup, I think its focus continues to be on getting headliners who resonate with a majority-Black crowd. From the festival’s facilitators, at least, there appeared be a strong desire to retain older attendees while garnering younger ones. At the GU kickback, I asked Essence Ventures CEO Caroline Wanga what she’s excited to see from the next generations when she thinks about the future of Essence. “We’ve now established that the Black woman is the CEO of home, culture and community, and I’m now ready to see them flex their power for good,” she told me. The “community” part of that is key — and a reason why we should all be partying together. Young Black women are undeniably powerful trendsetters , so it’s no wonder the Essence brand wants to expand its spaces to include this age group more. But older Black millennials and Gen Xers also want to continue to feel protected and seen by one of the few companies that’s centered them for decades. With the final print issues of Jet and Ebony magazines released in 2014 and 2019 respectively, and the sister magazines being sold by Johnson Publishing in 2016, Essence is one of the last remaining print publications and brands that focuses on Black culture, fashion and lifestyle exclusively. Look, brands and their events have to evolve in some ways, or else they become stale and stagnant. For example, Essence recently partnered with Afropunk, a music festival that God-is Rivera, Essence Ventures’ chief content officer, described to me as “alternative.” This collab indicates the future of Black music and culture consumption. It expresses what many younger fans believe ― that Black musical expression is vast and sometimes intersectional. Rivera, the brand’s first-ever CCO, told me that progression and inclusivity are at the forefront of her and Wanga’s goals. They are not simply focused on attracting younger crowds. Rivera wants to make Essence Ventures a brand that feels welcoming to anyone on the margins of society, including queer communities, people with disabilities and others with multiply marginalized identities. At the end of the day, I believe in the validity of spaces catered to certain demographics. If you’re a young person, you can choose to drop into an “auntie-free zone” or not. The reality is, “aunties” are a trope, not an age group. Many younger people perceive aunties to be judgmental, stuck in an old-school mentality about sexual expression, or simply closed-minded. I have been in multigenerational spaces filled with tense conversations about topics like how a young Black woman should “appropriately” show up in the corporate world. For these reasons and others, an auntie-free zone sometimes feels like a safer and more accepting place to explore nontraditional thinking. Yeah, those types of aunties exist. But then there are also aunties — Black women well past their 30s — who twerk like champions, are sexually liberated in every way and truly believe that gender is a spectrum. These women wear what they want, lift up other women of all ages and discard respectability politics. In the same way, Gen Z women are not a monolith. We can move between zones depending on how we feel that day. In past experiences of socializing with older Black women, I’ve had a great time bonding over music, relationships and everything else. So let’s let “auntie-free zones” exist for those who need them. As long as we’re all outside, with the option of being with each other, gathering at a festival that celebrates Black women feels like a win.

    "article_content": "Author and Activist In the world of senseless crimes, I never thought I’d see the day when someone would be murdered for dancing. But here we are, living in a world without O’Shae Sibley. As more details develop about how Sibley was killed and who his killer was , it becomes clear that Black, queer people are still enemy No. 1 even when we are minding our own business and simply existing in a bubble of joy and self-expression. We are the boys who played with dolls that were taken from us and replaced with trucks and tools to project masculinity. It didn’t work. Our innate beings fought against the notion that we needed to present a certain way to be worthy of love. As children, we chipped away at the internalized homophobia that forced us into shadows and closets and boxes. We now live in the light despite the world’s attempts to extinguish us. And we will stay in the light. We are the boys who wore our mothers’ heels until what was once seen as “cute” became a threat to the notion of how boys are supposed to act and be. But that desire to live vibrantly never left us. We have become the ultimate arbiters of fashion and style. We are the boys who spoke like lightning and rainbows, exchanging words of energy and freedom. Our language has been stolen, sold and commodified for commercial use while we are still vilified despite being the originators of it. It has never stopped us from continuing to live in our truth. “To be visibly queer is to choose your happiness over your safety,” author Da’Shaun Harrison has aptly noted in their work. We are the boys whose spirit and well-being have been dismissed. And yet we refuse to be defined by outdated societal norms that stubbornly persist. We are living our unapologetic truths despite the hatred and harm inflicted upon us. Our Black queer heroes were stolen from us , stories erased or never told, and yet we get to be the heroes to future generations of Black queer children. While I never met Sibley, our stories are intertwined. I wrote “ All Boys Aren’t Blue” for boys like him. My narrative is one about a Black family’s love, a queer child in a world full of oppression, danger and spaces that reject us at every turn. It was and is a love letter to Black folks in my life who loved, supported and protected my queerness, despite a society that finds you disposable. My story has affirmed people and changed minds. But it’s still not enough. Our visibility cannot save us. In many ways, it has only put an even larger target on our backs. But we can’t give up. James Baldwin told us that to be Black in America is to be living in a constant state of rage. To be Black and queer in America — well, that’s rage, fear and hypervigilance. Yet we continue to dance and use our joy as resistance in a space that continues to tell us that our lives mean nothing. We are on the front lines of Black liberation, constantly on a quest to free ourselves from the constructs of the white hetero patriarchy. As we as queer Black people collectively grieve, we must turn our grief into our power by persisting. We must continue to love on each other and love on ourselves. Moments of violence like these are meant to send us back into the silence and secrecy that our ancestors were confined to. But we have every right to be where we are. We are O’Shae Sibley and we will carry him with us, as we carry every spirit stolen from us. We are the Civil Rights Movement, the Stonewall Riot and every other emblem of unapologetic Blackness and queerness. We will continue to grieve. But we must also continue to dance in the light, and we’ll grow stronger together.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer Over time, I’ve learned that grief is the sequel to love. I was 12 years old the first time I held space for someone nearing the end of their life. It was my cousin Delancey, who was so close to his death, he could feel the earth beneath him crumbling, he told me as we sat at my grandmother’s house drinking coffee, laughing, and flipping the television channels back and forth between “In the Heat of the Night” and “The Young and The Restless.” Since then, I’ve served many others in their grief, clearing as much fear, negativity, and uncertainty as possible while bringing compassion, peace, and hope. So even though I’ve held the title “death doula” for six years, I’ve been doing the work in some capacity for nearly three decades. But, then, I was a cousin, a friend, and a nephew who seemed — to the dying — to care a little more than others. I don’t know if I truly cared more, but I recognized early that I had an intuitive and effective approach to death and grief. And I knew how much my presence in those spaces helped people process what was happening. My role changes slightly when it centers a member of my community because I believe that grieving is second nature for many of us. Black Americans have been managing loss since we arrived in this country, and each generation faces its version of racism that eventually becomes a trauma. And so when we lose someone, the emotions that arise are unique to our intergenerational trauma, passed down from our ancestors. For some Black Americans, grief is a constant. When we find ourselves grieving our loved ones, it brings to mind the brokenness of many systems, including a lack of resources in our communities, health disparities, housing inequality, and overall racial injustice, most of which often contribute to the loss. When we turn on the news, we see the kids who look like they could be ours, or mothers, fathers, and grandmothers who could have raised us and how they’re treated at the hands of law enforcement — or at the hands of a medical system that deems Black people less susceptible to pain or simply less valuable. Racism and discrimination play as much a role in our deaths as they do in our lives. And the ones who survive have to carry that knowledge with them. On a recent flight from South Africa to Morocco, I sat next to a man who asked what made Black grief so different from the grief he, a white man, will experience when a loved one dies. I told him Black grief is different because it tends to be more communal. It’s also altogether too frequent and, many times, too soon . And though grief is as natural as necessary, Black people are never given enough time to grieve one person or thing entirely before it’s time to grieve another. And in these spaces where I’m sitting with and comforting the dying and helping those left behind through their mourning, I know my purpose. I try to show up with gentleness, kindness, and empathy. I come to say the names of those who’ve died, share their stories, dance, listen to song lyrics, feed, invite them to beautiful places, and say, “I’m sitting outside if you need me. I’m not going anywhere.” This is where I begin the healing, serving as a bridge, doing everything in my power to get those who are dying or grieving a loss from where they’re at in the present moment to a space where they’re telling me where they want to be when our time together is over. I ask the people I’ve worked with their needs and wants. When faced with death, they tend to be honest with their replies, and in return, I let them know if and how their needs can be met. Some of my clients are referred to me by those I’ve worked with; they often come to me already knowing how I navigate grieving spaces. Others, who find me through my site or social media, come with welcomed and encouraged questions. Though already unique to each person, I tell them my services become tailored as we go, and I become an even more compassionate advocate for honoring their wishes. Because this is my professional career, compensation for my services is a sliding scale depending on the client’s needs but usually starts at $25 per hour. I don’t want money to be a debilitating stressor for the communities I work in when they should be focused on healing. As a Black death doula who comes from a long line of folks who’ve done this work without titles, I am here not only to introduce people to this healing practice that works toward easing the fears and uncertainties around death but also to fight for end-of-life care that is both tender and dignified. I also aim to normalize conversations around death in the Black community. Having challenging conversations on this topic with each other allows us to process complex emotions that some may have been actively avoiding their entire lives. Sharing our fears, concerns, and wishes regarding our deaths can help prepare others for what to expect when we are gone. Research has shown that talking and thinking about the inevitability of death can help us lead healthier lives. What’s strange about Black “dying” and “death” is the stark contrast between the two. For Black folks, death can be a celebration , a homegoing ceremony filled with joy at the end of a struggle. But Black dying is taboo, as is everything that leads to that final moment. We often shoo away children when they ask questions about what’ll happen when death arrives, we do little work to prepare ourselves and those we’ll leave behind. Instead, we stutter through conversations about death as if talking clearly about it will bring it sooner. And so, much of my work is educating individuals about wills, advanced directives, their rights as patients and the rights of the family assisting in providing care. Through it all, I often think of my grandmother Irene who did this work until she was the last of her friends to die, and my cousin Delancey who allowed 12-year-old me to sit with him in his last days. And I am grateful. Dying doesn’t have to be the thing we whisper about, but the thing we approach prepared. I will continue to show up in this work because many of these people I meet have pushed through overwhelming losses, mainly for self-preservation — and they are tired. I am there to honor them as survivors who’ve reached the end of their journeys, and I know I have the strength to fight for the good death they deserve, even if they can’t.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer Since its inception, TikTok has been home to non-Black creators copying and never crediting Black artists — specifically choreographers. This is problematic for many reasons, but most egregiously because Black creators have been known to get paid significantly less than their non-Black counterparts. One of the more recent viral trends includes a modern staple of young Black culture: majorette-style dancing. And while there have been murmurs of discontent about the dance style being co-opted as a Gen Z trend white female creators are carrying, Khalil Greene, also known as the Gen Z historian on TikTok, explained it most succinctly . In the well-circulated video, which has garnered over 65,000 views, he recently reminded TikTokers to stop appropriating the genius of Black creators and denounced the app for allowing Gen Zs to bite off and bury Black content. Did y’all know this? #hiddenhistory #majorettedance #herwaychallenge #nolovechallenge #culturalappropriation #blackhistorymonth #hbcu @amour.jordynn It should be noted that the original use of the term “majorette” referred to Dutch carnival dancers. But it became what we now know it to be when the style of baton work and accompanying dance came to the American South — particularly to Black institutions, Essence reports . In Greene’s post, he calls out white TikTokers for appropriating majorette choreography in the viral “Her Way” and “No Love” challenges. Non-Black TikTokers have posted and racked up millions of views with their renditions of this choreography, reportedly created by 19-year-old Jordyn Williams , with no references to where the moves come from and the history of the majorette dance style. In his analysis, Greene also points to another viral video from a K-Pop stan account that incorrectly revealed the “origins” of the viral choreography. He criticized the post for referring to the choreography as a “silly little TikTok dance” and inaccurately crediting a K-Pop group for creating it. Greene then gives credit to the actual creator, reportedly a majorette from Alabama, and then provides a brief but useful history of majorette culture. I refuse to believe that people — even those unfamiliar with Black American majorette culture — simply aren’t aware that Black people created this dance style, especially after Beyoncé’s critically acclaimed Netflix special “Homecoming” shined such a respectful light on the HBCU community, culture and dances. Modern majorette dance is a unique style derived from African, Jazz, Ballroom, and hip-hop techniques and is among the Blackest forms of dance expression. It’s a piece of culture that should be fiercely protected, mainly because performing as a majorette is a rite of passage. Not any’ ole body can do it. You need to know the history and then study and practice the moves before you can perform them, similar to choreography at ceremonies for African and indigenous tribes. But in the case of social media, these cultural rites often go out the window, and the meaning behind the viral dance seldom comes through, let alone the person or people behind it. With all the recent chatter about banning TikTok, I, for one, couldn’t care less if the app fell off the face of the planet. While I’m always here for freedom of expression and access to information, it’s taken erasure to new heights, and there doesn’t seem to be any antidote to that. So let’s start finally respecting the drip and giving our Black creators some credit.

    "article_content": "Rappers like Megan Thee Stallion, Trina and Lil Kim center and empower Black women in a world that mistakes us for side characters. By Taryn Finley Aug. 2, 2023 When I was 8 years old, I dreamt of growing up to become a rapper. The idea of getting out of my shy shell and popping the biggest shit I could imagine fueled me. I started my first rhyme book, a steno notepad, because it was the first blank notebook I found in my mom’s computer room. With a glitter gel pen, I decorated the inside with lyrics about the complexities of second grade, flexed my straight As, and told a few lies I viewed as future truths about all of the popularity and money I had — as a rapper does. Sometimes I’d put on mini performances for my friends and boys I liked at recess. It was a way of using my voice in a way I had usually been shy about. But most times, I kept the words in my rhyme book since it felt like a diary. \"Remy Ma redefined ‘Conceited’ from a character flaw to a self-esteem boost. When Trina said she was a ‘five-star bitch,’ it became an affirmation for the rest of us. Rap beef aside, when Nicki Minaj’s ‘Did It On Em’ or Cardi B’s ‘Bodak Yellow’ comes on, all anxiety goes out the window, and I start to wish a hater would.\" As a child with bad anxiety and people-pleasing tendencies, it was often difficult for me to tap into a sense of self-assuredness. That only worsened going into middle school, where bullying was more frequent, and the pressures to conform became more apparent. For me, the remedy to that was channeling the overconfidence and cockiness required of hip-hop — even to this day in battling imposters’ syndrome or overcoming heartbreak. Women in rap helped transform my attitude about what I was capable of and knocked down the mental barriers that came with obstacles I faced early on. When I heard a chorus introduce Eve as “that girl,” I, too, took on the “that girl” persona. Lil Kim declaring, “I’m rich, I’ma stay that bitch” on “Queen Bitch” made me feel like the little $22.37 in my piggy bank was long money. Remy Ma redefined “Conceited” from a character flaw to a self-esteem boost. When Trina said she was a “five-star bitch,” it became an affirmation for the rest of us. Rap beef aside, when Nicki Minaj’s “Did It On Em” or Cardi B ’s “Bodak Yellow” comes on, all anxiety goes out the window, and I start to wish a hater would. And when Megan Thee Stallion says she’s “running through yo n***a house like the Tomb Raider,” it’s a proclamation to take up space. Those may not be the literal translations of their lyrics, but music, like all art, is subjective. Hip-hop invites intrinsic confidence that takes over your movements and can sometimes feel like a spiritual practice. Singing Crime Mobb’s “Stilettos” or Latto’s “Put It On The Floor” in the car with your girls becomes the therapy you need after a long week of folks getting on your last nerve. Parental advisory labels be damned, every Black girl and woman should listen to female rappers talk their shit. OK, maybe the edited version for the kids, but hear me out. To be a cocky Black woman is the complete antithesis of what society demands from us. We’re expected to be overly nurturing, taking care of everyone else but ourselves and being fine with it. We’re told our beauty isn’t up to standard while our bodies and features are constantly fetishized and copied. Our voices are policed to the point of being shamed and shunned for having the audacity to speak. And we’re conditioned to see our roles as in service to men to the point that we’re pitted against each other. Parts of the genre don’t make it any better, as men have used rap to oversexualize and belittle Black women to this day. It took pioneering women like Queen Latifah asking, “Who you callin’ a bitch?” on “U.N.I.T.Y.” to challenge the background role men subjugated us to. Foxy Brown and Lil Kim helped reclaim sexual agency for women in rap while using wordplay and bravado better than the men. That legacy carries on through Cardi B and Meg’s “W.A.P.,” Lola Brooke’s “Don’t Play With It” and Sexxy Red’s “Pound Town.” To this day, however, behind every confident woman rapper is a gang of sorry men complaining about what women rap about. Lest we forget that not too long ago, white folks’ complaints about gangsta rap led to the FBI surveilling rappers along with various states and networks banning certain rappers and songs altogether. And with women’s bodies and rights under critical attack today, the freedom we have to use our voices for joy, change and inspiration is a tool for our safety and sanity. \"When I heard a chorus introduce Eve as 'that girl,' I, too, took on the 'that girl' persona. When Trina said she was a 'five-star bitch,' it became an affirmation for the rest of us.\" The voice that Black women rappers — conscious, ratchet and in between — give to us are radical affirmations of our worth and power. Without exaggeration, hip-hop saved my life, but women in hip-hop specifically helped me see me. They helped remind me of who I was and empowered me to act like it. That was true then, and it’s true now. Black women didn’t just start being cocky with hip-hop, but it has been reaffirming to see reminders for us to pop our shit. Especially within recent years as we see more and more women dominate and literally save rap. City Girls, GloRilla, TiaCorine, Doechii and Flo Milli are just a few examples. This wave of so many different types of women dominating the genre — and doing it with confidence on their own terms — is nothing short of a revolution. This story is part of a HuffPost series celebrating the 50th anniversary of hip-hop. See all of our coverage here ."

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer At this stage in our reckoning with America’s ongoing history of systemic racism, it comes as no shock that historically Black colleges and universities have been underfunded across the board. But recent letters sent by the Biden administration to governors across the South and Midwest detail this lack of support — and the data is cringe as hell. According to the letters from Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack, land-grant HBCUs in 16 states were shortchanged more than $13 billion over the last 30-plus years. These HBCUs include Alabama A&M University, North Carolina A&T State University, Virginia State University and Tennessee State University, among others. The letters address how much funding land-grant HBCUs in each of the states would have received in the last three decades if states’ funding per student matched the mandate of the Morrill Acts, a pair of late-1800s laws that established land-grant universities. Tennessee and North Carolina topped the list, with the gap in funding swelling to over $2 billion apiece. “This is a situation that clearly predates all of us,” reads one of the sentiments in all 16 letters. “However, it is a problem that we can work together to solve. In fact, it is our hope that we can collaborate to avoid burdensome and costly litigation that has occurred in several states.” The letters, recently made public by The Washington Post , analyze data from the National Center for Education Statistics to pinpoint how inequitable funding distribution is setting back progress at land-grant HBCUs compared to states’ other land-grant institutions. Cardona and Vilsack say these missing funds could have supported “infrastructure and student services and would have better positioned [HBCUs] to compete for research grants” against their better-resourced, predominantly white counterparts. Adding to the inequity, these letters come on the heels of the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down race-conscious college admissions, an action many of us know will have a dire impact on higher education . A little context on the Morrill Acts and how they led to land-grant HBCUs: as the National Archives explains, t he first Morrill Act went into effect in 1862, during the Civil War, granting 30,000 acres of stolen tribal land for every senator and representative in a given state to be allocated as “public lands.” States could sell a portion of this public land to fund the creation of a public post-secondary institution or use it to expand an existing one. These institutions were meant to prioritize education and research on agriculture, science, military science and engineering, and they received (and continue to receive) federal and state funding through additional measures. Because of Jim Crow and discriminatory enrollment practices, white men disproportionately benefited from this first wave of land-grant institutions. So, to counter this, a second Morrill Act was passed in 1890, as CNN explains . This act required states to prove that the existing enrollment practices at their land-grant institutions were not discriminatory or else to establish separate institutions specifically for Black people. States that didn’t adhere would have their land-grant funding withheld. The second Morrill Act was the foundation of 19 land-grant HBCUs, which did not receive support in the form of physical land but received financial funding instead, according to the National Archives. While the Biden administration’s letters make no mention of “systemic racism” or any such words, opting for lighter terms such as “unbalanced funding,” the message is clear. After considering the history of land-grant institutions and the gap in funding between predominantly white land-grant institutions and Black ones, it’s impossible to ignore a pattern of deliberate systemic racism at the center of all of this.

    "article_content": "Senior Front Page Editor, HuffPost A recently opened grocery store in Indiana wants to be more than just another place that sells fresh produce. It wants to give residents a place to gather — and provide formerly incarcerated people a second chance. Indy Fresh Market , which had its grand opening this month, will address food insecurity on the east side of Indianapolis, in an area that previously didn’t have a supermarket for miles. Founder and co-operator Marckus Williams described the area as a food desert where low-income residents struggle to access healthy produce. “For five or six miles, there was no place to get food anywhere around here unless it was the Family Dollar or gas stations,” Williams explains. The area was once home to Kroger, Walmart and Safeway, but they’ve all closed in the past several years. “It’s hard out here, and with nothing on the bus line, it’s pretty much impossible to have healthy options for the residents in the community,” he says. In creating Indy Fresh Market, it was important to Williams for the grocery store to be a second-chance employer — a business that actively hires people with criminal records. He knows how important those second chances are; he was once incarcerated himself . Indy Fresh Market “was a second chance for me,” Williams says. “For some people, this is their first job.” About 20 of Indy Fresh Market’s 41 workers are second-chance employees, he says. Working at the grocery store provides them with the opportunity to not only improve their own lives but also leave an impact on a community that desperately needs it. The full-service, 16,772-square-foot grocery store boasts a wide range of products from national brands to produce from local distributors, he says. According to a study from Indiana University’s Public Policy Institute, the grocery store will bring over $11 million to the community . And the community has embraced the grocery store, Williams says. “It’s a new staple in the area now,” he says. “You can run into people you haven’t seen in a while, make connections, reconnections, hugs, smiles all inside.” Williams operates the grocery store alongside co-operator Michael McFarland, another native of Indianapolis. The pair are entrepreneurs with experience in this arena, having previously owned a small convenience store together. The grocery store, which has been in development since 2021, was built by the medical device manufacturer Cook Medical, which built a manufacturing location nearby in partnership with Goodwill Commercial Services after realizing how dire the need for food access was in the neighborhood. With no specific expertise in food retail, Cook Medical worked with McFarland and Williams, who both went through a multiyear training program to prepare for running Indy Fresh Market. The long-term goal is for the duo to own 100% of the business and real estate through a rent-to-own model. The store was a true community effort, with organizations like IMPACT Central Indiana, United Northeast Community Development Corporation, and neighborhood and city leaders working together to bring Indy Fresh Market to life. The employees, many of them local, have access to Goodwill’s services , including housing support, legal aid, mental and physical health care, and soft skills training. For some employees, this is their first time seeing this sort of support. Cameron Barnett is one of those employees. Hired through the grocery store’s second-chance employee program, the Indianapolis native says working at Indy Fresh Market has been a blessing for him as a single father because finding employment has been difficult. Currently the manager of the grocery store’s meat department, Barnett is excited about the opportunity to grow with Indy Fresh Market. “It’s always possible to make a change,” says Barnett, who has been working at the grocery store for two months. “Just stay focused on doing what you need to do. God’s gonna put some people in places for you. And when you get that opportunity, take it and run with it.” Although Indy Fresh Market just opened, Williams already has his eye on expansion. He says he wants to open up grocery stores in nearby cities like Carmel and Greenwood. “We want to keep the Black community and other communities fed,” he says. “Coming to a neighborhood near you, that’s the goal.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost It’s well-established that spending too much time sitting (ahem, working at a desk) could have an impact on our bodies. Sitting all day can decrease muscle strength and is linked to bad health outcomes like heart disease . But is all sitting created equal? Some folks say sitting on the ground is actually good for your health, and should be done regularly ― a concept that almost seems too good to be true. Below, experts shared with HuffPost the pros and cons of sitting on the floor — and why no one posture is ideal. Most adults likely don’t often find themselves frequently sitting on the floor in the cross-legged position. But kids who regularly sit and play on the floor may be onto something. “I really think from a health benefits or a musculoskeletal condition standpoint, that [cross-legged sitting] posture really does help us with ... hip, low back and knee range of motion,” said Dr. Christopher Bise , an assistant professor in the department of physical therapy at the University of Pittsburgh. It also helps keep our lower body flexible, he said. Dr. Jennifer O’Connell , a physiatrist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, added that “one of the problems with sitting in a chair is that it’s a position where your hamstrings tend to be tight — sitting in a cross legged position may help that somewhat.” But if you aren’t able to get yourself down to the floor, you can still work on your mobility and flexibility. “Remember that these positions don’t necessarily have to be on the floor. You can, on a couch, get in to the cross-legged sitting position, or you can use different sitting positions on the couch that will also increase your range of motion, as well,” Bise explained. Maintaining your range of motion is important for many reasons — you’ll be better able to get around your house, do your errands, and play with children and grandchildren as your years increase. “But I think one of the things that happens when we get older is ... we become less flexible because we begin to slow down ― but we don’t have to be less flexible,” Bise said. “And when you think about the treatments you’re going to receive from a physical therapist ... one of the first things they’re going to do is assess both your joint mobility and your muscle flexibility for the muscles around your joints and see how they’re moving,” Bise continued. “And when we have bones and joints and muscles that are inflexible, that are stiffer, we’re not going to move as well or as efficiently as we could.” Going from sitting on the ground, to the chair, to walking and exercising is a great way to keep yourself mobile and flexible. Plus, the ability to actually get into and out of a seated-on-the-floor posture is also important, Bise said. Older adults are prone to falls, he said, but if they have the ability to rise and lower to and from the floor, they’ll be more able to prevent falls in the future or get themselves up if need be. Sitting on the ground engages your core muscles in a way that just doesn’t happen when you’re sitting on a chair, according to O’Connell. Without back support from a chair, your core muscles automatically turn on, she said. “And then just the mere act of getting up from that position is beneficial for your whole body. You’re exercising your hips, your knees, your entire lower chain and your core in order to get up,” O’Connell explained. You can try sitting on the ground for 30 minutes or so, but you should not plop down on the floor for the entire day. “There’s a reason that your Apple Watch reminds you every 60 minutes to get up and start moving again ... some of it is postural, some of it is just simple motion and getting calories going, but some of it is also changing postures as well,” Bise noted. O’Connell said that she routinely tells her patients who work desk jobs to get up and move around — whether that’s walking to get a glass of water or just moving around the house. “Before you know it, an hour to two hours have gone by, you didn’t get up and move. And although you didn’t really notice that because you were focused on tasks, your back did notice that,” O’Connell explained. “One reason where floor seating may be detrimental is if you have joint issues,” O’Connell said. “As a matter of reference, I have an issue where my hips don’t open up very well, so sitting in a traditional cross-legged position on the floor for me is very challenging.” Additionally, people recovering from certain surgeries or injuries may also have trouble sitting on the ground. “Just like with anything ... check with your doctor before you start any type of exercise regimen,” O’Connell said. “But you can consult with a physical therapist, and they can give you strategies for getting up and down off the floor.” While it’s good to put your body in different postures and positions, you shouldn’t do so if it’s not safe for you.

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost When it comes to anatomy ― specifically female anatomy ― perhaps no part of the body has confused the internet quite so much as the belly pooch. Any time someone posts about the fat women tend to carry around their midsection ― and a strange number of people do post about it ― others are quick to chime in that “it’s not fat, it’s the uterus.” Take, for instance, earlier this year, when a man posted a few photos of the pooch on random women and said, “On behalf of all men, we hate this.” The post blew up, and the man was rightly ridiculed for his dumb blanket statement. Plenty of men love the pooch and went to bat for it: ”[We] never authorized this clown to speak on our behalf,” one guy replied. Women reacted, too: “On behalf of women, we don’t give a damn.” But as usual when these things get posted, many people weighed in to let the man know he was ill-informed: “That’s literally our uterus. Learn human anatomy,” one woman said. The “stomach fat is literally the womb [or uterus]” is a persistent, popular claim: In 2020, health influencer and dietitian Colleen Christensen posted an image on her No Food Rules Instagram account reassuring her followers “that [the] bump at the bottom of your stomach is your uterus.” Christensen shared how frustrated she was that she couldn’t get a flat stomach until a friend put her at ease by explaining that “that bump is organs.” As Christensen soon learned from her comment section, that’s not really the case: Internal organs do take up space in your body, but the uterus ― a thick-walled, hollow organ where the fetus develops during pregnancy ― is located in the female pelvis between the bladder and rectum, not in the stomach. (To Christensen’s credit, she later updated her post with more information for her followers.) Dr. Lisa Erlanger, a clinical professor of family medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine, broke it down further for us in an email interview: “The bony part contains the uterus and ovaries,” she said. “The hips are wider and tilted differently for women, which naturally gives a different look, but the uterus typically isn’t in what we consider the stomach.” There are also a lot of other body structures in that region that we need, said Dr. Stephanie Trentacoste McNally, the director of OB-GYN services at the Katz Institute for Women’s Health. “In that part of our anatomy, there are many layers, from skin to fascia ― which is the strong tissue that holds you together ― muscle, nerves, blood vessels, connective tissue, and fat,” she told HuffPost. But basically, your uterus isn’t contributing to a visible bulge unless you’re pregnant, postpartum or have a tumor. Uterine fibroids , for instance, can cause the uterus to enlarge, leading to a noticeable bulge. “The uterus is at least the size of a fist and can be larger with medical conditions like fibroids and endometriosis, and ovaries can have benign cysts that take up space,” Erlanger explained. That said, various stages of the menstrual cycle can affect digestion and fluid balance, and that can change the appearance of the body, especially the abdomen, according to Erlanger. If you’ve undergone surgery, the skin may heal in a way that creates a pooch, too, Trentacoste McNally said: For instance, about 30% of all babies in the U.S. are born via C-section and the scar from that procedure can pull skin and create a different shape abdominally. The rush to explain away belly fat ― “It’s not fat; it’s actually something useful!” ― speaks to how ill at ease we are with body fat in general. The fact is it’s totally normal for women to have more fatty tissue in the stomach region compared with men. “Under ovarian influence, the body does typically have a higher body fat percentage,” Erlanger said. “This is thought to serve the function of protecting reproduction.” “it’s just our uterus” so what if its not? y’all bending over backwards to explain away belly fat like it’s not that deep https://t.co/MJ5wXoSCIO In menopause, belly fat is thought to protect bones, mood, sexual function and even brain and heart health by continuing to make small amounts of estrogen, she explained. Regardless, though, there’s nothing wrong with belly fat just being belly fat. “People without uteruses have tummy pooches, too, and the back of my arm has fat, and there’s no uterus there,” Erlanger said. Weight fluctuations across our lifespans are very common, and in general it’s healthier to live in the body size and shape you have than to try to make it smaller or shaped differently, she added. Bottom line, according to our doctors? It’s not OK to have a pooch because there’s a uterus there. It’s simply OK to have a tummy pooch. “Having compassion for ourselves for having bodies and committing to caring for them as they are in ways that are responsive to our individual values, goals and circumstances is really part of the journey,” Erlanger said.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost No matter how many times you deal with anxiety or stress in your life, it can feel really hard to look forward to better, calmer moments. There isn’t just one way to cope with anxiety and stress. Instead there are a host of options for dealing with these emotions — from exercise to mindfulness to medication and more. That said, therapists told HuffPost there’s one activity you may not be doing when feeling stressed or anxious: considering your eye gaze. “When we are in an activated nervous system state, or in fight/flight, the eyes may protrude and be fixed on one spot ― also known as tunnel vision,” Justine Grosso , a somatic psychologist licensed in New York and North Carolina, told HuffPost via email. Just think about it: your eyes regularly narrow when you’re upset or you may find yourself squinting at the screen while prepping for a big meeting. “Visual stimuli [is] the information we process the most quickly ... when we’re experiencing the world, our eyes are our most dominant sense,” said Danica Harris , a somatic therapist and coach based in Texas. “So, if there’s been trauma or stress, the eyes become very fixed and narrow in focus, because essentially, what’s happening is ... you start looking at the environment in a way of like, where’s the next stressor?” It’s easy to see how unknowingly being prepped for the next stressor would cause both physical and mental discomfort. Experts say there is one thing you can do to combat this on-the-defensive eye positioning. Here’s what it is: The eyes can naturally carry a lot of pressure, said Harris, especially for someone who’s experienced stress or trauma. What’s more, as part of our fight or flight survival, our attention naturally goes to things we perceive as threats, Grosso noted. To combat this instinct, you need to give your eyes permission to relax when you’re in safe environments. You can do this by softening your gaze, which is when you let your eyes exist in the eye socket without pressure, Harris explained. “And what that might look like is tuning out all visual stimuli, or it might look like gently gazing around your environment,” Harris said. You can do this by cupping your hands over your eyes to block out all of the visual stimuli around you, she noted. “You could do that for 30 seconds, you could do that for a minute,” Harris said. She often recommends her clients do this every hour. “And normally what people will report after they do that is that they have less tension in their forehead .. when we have less tension in our forehead, we’re likely to have less tension in our jaw, when we have less tension in our jaw, we’re likely to have less tension in our neck.” You can also soften your gaze by looking around your environment, whether you’re in your home or out in nature, Harris noted. When softly looking around your environment, your eye gaze becomes more fluid as opposed to focused and narrowed on something specific, like a laptop screen or phone, she said. Harris recommends softly gazing into a field or forest, lake or ocean, or even throughout your home. “When our eye gaze is more fluid, what we’re likely to notice is that we’re not having as much tension in our body,” Harris said. You can also choose to look at things that feel good to look at, Grosso added. “ Exploratory orienting can help you shift from an activated state in the nervous system to a calmer state.” “When we think about the neurobiology of feeling safe, of self-regulation, of social engagement, we know that’s not just something that we can think out loud and say, ‘I am safe,’ or ‘I feel well,’ ... our body doesn’t necessarily always follow that statement,” said Meghan Watson , the founder and clinical director of Bloom Psychology & Wellness in Toronto. When trying to feel these thoughts you have, it can be helpful to use your physical senses, she said. “I use eye gaze a lot as a way to get people grounded into mindfulness,” said Watson. Visual cues are a core part of a common grounding exercise known as the 5-4-3-2-1 technique, added Watson. For this mindfulness practice, you name five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can touch, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste. “Really narrowing your focus to the body [and] starting with the eyes because visual stimuli is such a powerful, soothing component,” she said. The 5-4-3-2-1 technique is a way to get yourself back in the present moment and away from any negative emotions, Watson noted. You don’t have to have a set mindfulness practice to try out this eye-orienting technique, either. “You can use exploratory orienting anywhere, whether you’re alone or with others,” Grosso said. “You can practice orienting by taking the time to intentionally find things to look at that evoke a sense of joy, awe or warmth ... or by systematically looking to your right, left and behind you to really see that you are in a safe location and that there are no imminent threats.” Harris added that these practices can (and should) be done before you’re dealing with stress and anxiety, too. This way, you’ll be better prepared to deal with stress and anxiety when they inevitably show up. Self-care doesn’t have to wait for a bad situation. “We could begin a somatic practice today that actually helps us to feel a lot better in our bodies and really treat our bodies like our one true home,” Harris said.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost If you’ve ever heard (or said) statements like “Don’t get divorced, just stick out your marriage” or “Put other people’s needs before yours,” you’ve likely come face-to-face with societal expectations and beliefs. They exist to keep society in line, said Aparna Sagaram, a licensed marriage and family therapist and owner of Space to Reflect in Philadelphia. “I think it’s sort of a way to create that homogeny.” Though certain societal expectations are right for some people, they could not be more wrong for others — like if you’re in an unhappy marriage but refuse to get divorced. When you follow societal beliefs that aren’t right for you, they can actually get in the way of your contentment and put you in damaging situations. There are many societal beliefs that get in the way of your contentment, therapists say. Below are some common ones. Happiness is a common goal, albeit a nebulous one, for many people. But experts say happiness should not be the prize. “People are always trying to achieve happiness, and I don’t think it’s an attainable goal. The goal shouldn’t be happiness, because happiness is like every other emotion — you feel it, and then it goes away,” Sagaram said. You should aim to be content, calm or emotionally regulated “so that you can feel those moments of excitement and you can also feel those moments of frustration and anger without it throwing you into a spiral,” Sagaram added. Happiness as a goal is a belief that society puts on us and even tells us that certain things, whether a new relationship, kids or a high-paying job, will make us happy — but that doesn’t tend to be the case. This is known as the destination trap, Sagaram said. “Basically what it means is we fall into these ideas that once you hit a certain goal, if you get to the next thing, then you’ll be happy, but that goalpost keeps moving.” Then you’re in a never-ending cycle of happiness-chasing. Think about it: You think you’ll be happy once you make $100,000, but once you hit that salary, you probably just want to make more. Whether from religion or family pressure, it’s commonly thought that divorce is a “bad” thing. (For the record: It is not.) Though there are things in a marriage that can be improved and fixed — like having date nights more often or splitting cleaning responsibilities better — core values, core belief systems and someone’s core personality can’t be changed, said Natalie Moore , a licensed marriage and family therapist in California. If you’re with someone who has different beliefs regarding having kids or what a family structure should look like, you aren’t doing yourself any favors by sticking out the marriage. “Sometimes it’s for the best of both people to be honest about that ... and look at the relationship and say, ‘You know what? We gave it a good go, and it just isn’t working anymore,’” Moore said. For some people, divorce is legitimately safer than staying married. “And when abuse is present, it’s for the best for the safety of the person who’s being abused to leave the relationship,” Moore added. “So, as much as a society we might push the value of sticking out a marriage, there are situations in which, even with the best of intention, even with the best-laid plans, it’s not realistic for that couple to be able to stay married forever,” Moore said. For some people, family truly is everything, but for many others, family members have been hurtful or downright abusive. If you’re from a tight-knit family in which open communication is prioritized, along with trust and support, it may be easy to believe this, Moore said, “but if you’re from a family that has a lot of severe mental illness that’s untreated, or abuse or boundary crossing or betrayal, or a lot of unresolved grief and estrangements ... it’s hard to live out that belief of family is everything.” What’s more, for certain groups of people, just being their true selves results in estrangement from their families, such as for LGBTQIA+ folks. For many in the LGBTQIA+ community, chosen family are a much-needed support system if blood relations are no longer in the picture. So, being told “family is everything” would only be damaging, stressful and even shame-inducing. “And so it can be this huge betrayal of ‘Oh, I thought family was everything — I’m expected to conform to the family to make people comfortable, but then when I actually expressed my true self and who I am, well, suddenly family isn’t everything because now nobody’s talking to me, nobody’s coming to my wedding, nobody is supporting me in this life transition of being myself and being my true self,’” Moore said. The same goes for someone who is trying to establish boundaries with family for the first time but is dealing with pushback from loved ones, Moore said. “What happens when your family is toxic? What happens if your family doesn’t heal? What happens if your family operates out of trauma?” Hill asked. “Then ‘family over everything’ is the norm that you’ve adopted, but it’s not the healthiest,” explained LaWanda Hill , a psychologist in California. In this case, family with boundaries is more sustainable, or it may be a good idea to cut out certain family members altogether, Hill said. “So, this is a particularly damaging belief, especially for someone who identifies as a people-pleaser or perfectionist because they already feel a strong urge and need to prioritize other people over themselves,” Moore explained. This unfair societal belief reinforces self-sacrificing behavior to a level that can be detrimental to your mental health and overall functioning, she said. Think about it: If you’re lending money to a family member when you can’t afford it, you’re just denying your own necessities and peace of mind. “This is also one that tends to get romanticized a lot. As a society, we tend to see putting other people’s needs first as heroic, we tend to put it on a pedestal,” Moore said, “When someone puts another person’s needs above their own, they tend to get rewarded a lot for it, whether it’s verbal praise or other types of reinforcement, and that makes the behavior so much harder to change.” This is doubly hard for parents who sometimes do need to quash their own needs to care for their child (like sacrifice sleep in the newborn phase, for example). Though this is certainly necessary in some instances, it can’t constantly be the norm. “It’s that classic trope of ‘Put your oxygen mask on before you put the child’s mask on’ because if you try to fumble and put the child’s mask on, you’re trying to put your child first. But really you’re not because then if you pass out, you can’t help your kid, right?” Moore said. From a young age, we’re bombarded with the idea that we need to have kids, Hill said. “Kids play with dolls from the beginning of time, kids play house, those are their toys. So they’re being socialized so early on, they’re born into a family, and we have this capacity to reproduce, so it kind of becomes this thing that is expected for you to do.” Depending on your culture and upbringing, you then probably create an expectation around when you should start having kids, whether that’s by 25, 30, 35 or 40, she noted. “That pressure, if you’ve internalized those beliefs, that ‘I should be doing this by this age ... if not something’s wrong, I’m outside of the norm,’” Hill said. This can lead to shame, guilt and confusion, she said. And if you don’t want children, you may feel trapped by the societal expectation of having kids altogether. When you don’t feel like certain societal beliefs are meant for you, it can feel shameful, Hill said. But she stressed that many people feel the same way as you, but these just tend to be things that aren’t often talked about. You don’t need to go through life following belief systems that don’t make sense for you. It’s important to understand what beliefs you currently hold and which ones you actually want to hold, Moore added. To figure out your beliefs, Moore suggested that you think about the primary messages you received during childhood from parents or caretakers about what’s important in life. “And taking an honest inventory of which of these things do I actually agree with now as an adult looking back,” Moore said. From there, you can shift your belief systems to reflect how you feel today. Your beliefs also come from how you choose to live your life, Sagaram said. “If you take an inventory of your day-to-day and how you make decisions, how you interact with people ... what are the things that do bring you joy? What are the things that make you really angry?” Sagaram said. “If you start to analyze those parts of your life, it’ll start to shape your beliefs.” While you can subscribe to the societal beliefs that are right for you, you can also reject the ones that are wrong. “Just recognizing that you have the freedom to not subscribe to those things, and you may experience discomfort and backlash, and that’s OK,” Sagaram said. To cope with that pushback, Hill said, it’s important to seek out support from a therapist and/or a community of likeminded people. “You need to find your community of other people so you feel less isolated — and that can be a little bit of a journey because you’re trying to figure out ‘Who are my people who feel this way?’” Hill said. No matter what societal beliefs are right for you (including the ones above!), it’s paramount that you go through life making choices that fuel your spirit. “I think it’s just really important that if you’re in your 80s and you look back and you’re like, oh, I wish I did this, or I wish I didn’t do that ... you don’t want to be in a position where you’re regretting things because you thought that’s what you were supposed to do,” Sagaram said. “Because no one’s gonna give you a gold star for subscribing to societal beliefs.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Just like our bodies, our brains change as we age. The older we get, the harder we recall information, like the name of a restaurant we went to or where we put our keys. Or it may take longer to learn something new. But the good news is we actually have a lot of control in keeping our brains healthy and from aging prematurely — and it starts with daily habits. Most notably, the behaviors we avoid could have a positive impact on our cognition. We talked to experts about seemingly harmless habits we may be doing every day that could be aging our brains — and what we can do instead. Here are the mistakes to correct ASAP: From working remotely to having a new baby to retiring, there are a lot of situations life throws at us that can make it more challenging to get out and be social. “It’s so common in our culture to slowly lose our social network as we go through life,” said Dr. Zaldy Tan , the director of the Memory and Healthy Aging Program at Cedars-Sinai. “We need to have some kind of social network that we can turn to whenever we need it — or even if we don’t think we need it.” So, how does socialization impact the brain? “Every time we meet someone new … we make a new connection within our brain between brain cells,” Tan explained. Plus, a strong social network has been shown to improve mood, which is linked to our brain health. ( Depression is one of the risk factors for dementia.) While in-person interactions seem to be most beneficial for brain health, online socialization and virtual conversations can also help, said Dr. Glen Finney , a fellow of the American Academy of Neurology and director of the Memory and Cognition Program at Geisinger Health. “There are certain people who are literally physically isolated … or may not have friends and family in their local area, [and] their online community becomes their lifeline and can have some real benefit,” Finney said. You not only want to engage your brain by preserving the skills you already have, but you also want to get your brain outside of its comfort zone, Finney explained. “If you say, ‘I’m no longer a kid anymore. I’m not going to worry about learning anything’ … [That] actually can sabotage your brain health and lead to premature brain aging,” he said. Just like when we meet someone new, learning something new forms connections between our brain cells and helps to keep the brain youthful. “You should always be expanding your mental horizons,” he said. “If you’ve never taken a musical instrument, learn a musical instrument. If you’ve never read a foreign language, learn a foreign language.” Stress is a part of daily life, and our bodies can typically recover quickly from a specific stressful event or situation. The problem is when this stress becomes chronic — and we don’t address it. “We are really skilled at keeping the stress response on all day — at a moderate level that we might not even notice,” said Dr. Elissa Epel , a psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of “The Stress Prescription.” “Even when nothing stressful is happening, we may be carrying around unconscious stress.” She said it’s important to be aware of this stress and release it throughout the day, such as being mindful of our thoughts and slowing our breathing. Creating “short-term states of acute stress in our body” can actually help relieve stress, she added, such as using a sauna, taking a cold shower, or trying a high-intensity workout. This gives us more states of relaxation during the day and a better sleep quality at night. “When we are able to have deeper rest states, both during the day and while asleep, we give our neurons a chance to restore as well and slow brain aging,” she explained. “When we’re … busy with our professional and social lives, it’s a natural tendency to pick something that is quick [that] you can pop in the microwave or go to a drive-thru,” Tan said. “[But] in the long term, that may not really be the best for our brains.” Fast foods are often highly processed and full of saturated fats and added sugars. Studies have shown that a diet high in these types of foods over the years can lead to a higher risk of dementia. “We know that [these] may prematurely age the brain and can lead to health conditions that [are] very hard on brain health,” Finney said. (For example, studies suggest that uncontrolled diabetes can lead to brain shrinkage.) There’s nothing wrong with eating fast food or takeout every so often ― it’s delicious, can be the most affordable option and sometimes we simply need it. As much as you can, try to also focus on a diet high in Omega-3 fatty acids, such as green leafy vegetables, fish, olive oil and nuts. Omega 3s have been shown to increase memory, learning and blood flow in the brain. Even if you’re aiming to get the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep a night, if your sleep quality is poor, you’re likely to wake up feeling tired the next day. And both the quantity and quality of sleep are essential for brain health. “During sleep, the memories of the day are sorted out and placed in the right place for us to access in the future … [Also] beta-amyloid, the sticky protein that wreaks havoc on the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, is cleared during sleep,” Tan explained. “When sleep is too short or of poor quality … these processes are interrupted.” The next day, you may have a hard time concentrating or difficulty recalling information. But over the years, poor sleep can increase the risk for your brain aging prematurely and developing dementia. To improve the quality of sleep, Tan recommends setting a consistent bedtime, minimizing alcohol, reducing fluid intake before bed, avoiding sedatives and sleep medication, and limiting your bed for mostly sleeping (no scrolling or watching TV in bed). “Physical exercise, especially cardiovascular but also even muscle building exercises, are important for keeping the brain … youthful,” Finney said. “It actually can increase growth hormones in the brain, like nerve factors that promote brain health and wellness.” Beyond working out, Tan recommends making physical activity a part of your lifestyle. “Whether it be … gardening or … taking a hike, there are some things we could incorporate into our daily lives that in the long run are probably more sustainable and beneficial than spending an hour in the gym once a week.” When physical activity becomes a lifelong habit, there are multiple benefits, from decreasing stress and increasing blood flow to the brain. The worst thing we can do for our brains is to just give up as we age. “Don’t think everything just has to happen that way because you’re getting [older]. Take care of your brain, take care of your body,” Finney said. “And if you do that, you can successfully age and not have as many changes as you might think.” This post was previously published on an earlier date.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Our appendix, a thin tube positioned where our small intestine meets our large intestine, is a perplexing organ. In fact, many believe it to be rather useless , offering no real perks for our health. But when something goes wrong with your appendix, it can lead to appendicitis ― and the pain can be unbearable. Appendicitis is essentially when the appendix becomes blocked, swollen or infected. It commonly affects people between the ages of 10 and 30, with 8.6% of men and 6.7% of women being diagnosed in their lifetime. The good news is that, with “modern technology and healthcare, appendicitis is no longer a life-threatening illness,” said Dr. Kiran Turaga , a professor of surgery at Yale School of Medicine. However, about half of people with appendicitis don’t have the typical presentation of symptoms, which include specific pain, fever and vomiting. This is specifically seen among kids, pregnant women and elderly seniors. We spoke to physicians about what may emerge as sneaky signs of appendicitis and what to do if you need to seek help: Since the appendix is located in the lower right portion of your body, you may experience pain concentrated in that area. “The pain typically starts near the belly button and then moves to the lower right abdomen, becoming sharper and more severe over time,” said Dr. Kristy Ziontz , an emergency medicine physician at Hackensack Meridian Health Bayshore Medical Center. The pain may also feel like a period cramp or radiate toward the hip, Turaga said. According to Dr. Supriya Rao , a gastroenterologist and director of weight loss at Lowell General Hospital, patients experiencing appendicitis may experience constipation or diarrhea. These can be unexpected symptoms you’ll want to pay attention to, Rao said. It’s normal to feel like the pain isn’t going away. The bad news, however, is that pain can also extend toward the right side of the back, Rao said. This can mimic the discomfort that occurs with spine issues or other chronic back problems. Some people may even experience this pain in their hamstring or rectum. If you notice that you don’t have the same desire to eat as you used to, then chances are you’re experiencing a loss of appetite. This is often an early sign of appendicitis, according to Turaga. Another unexpected sign could be pain when moving around. “Pain from appendicitis will not go away on its own and usually gets worse with movement such as bending over, sneezing or coughing,” Rao said. “If you believe you may have appendicitis but are not sure, it is always helpful to run the symptoms by your primary care doctor or pediatrician,” Rao said. However, if you have high fevers and severe abdominal pain, you may want to visit the emergency room to see a specialist right away. C linicians will evaluate you by doing a history intake, a physical exam and ordering any bloodwork or imaging that may be needed, Ziontz explained. Appendicitis left untreated can cause perforation and sepsis, Turaga said, both of which can be serious. While treatment options vary, sometimes surgery may be needed, and if so, a referral to a surgeon will be made.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost Knee pain is unfortunately a common struggle as we age ― and while managing the pain may feel like an uphill battle, experts say there’s an exercise you can try to help your knee health. According to a recent study published in the Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise journal, bike riding is supremely good for knee health. The study was made up of 2,607 people with an average age of 64. Study participants self-reported their bicycling frequency throughout their lifetime. Researchers checked for knee osteoarthritis by taking x-rays of participants’ knees. People who rode a bike, whether outdoors or an indoor stationary bike, had fewer occurrences of frequent knee pain and were less likely to have knee osteoarthritis. “Osteoarthritis is a disease that affects different joints, in with the knee being the most common, and it also can affect your hips, your ankles, your hands,” said Daniel White , an associate professor in the department of physical therapy and the director of the Active Lab at the University of Delaware who was not affiliated with the study. “It involves degeneration of cartilage, but also of the bone, the joint itself ... an influx of fluid, and it’s a very common chronic condition in middle to older age adults,” White added. Signs of the condition include stiff knees, swollen knees and a cracking noise when you move the joint. “Bike riding ... it’s very low impact. The force that goes to your knee while you’re bike riding is a fraction of what happens when you walk or even run,” White explained. However, even though it’s low impact, “you still get the benefits of strengthening your muscles, having your cardiovascular system be taxed, as well as the other health benefits that come along with the exercise.” Low impact exercise puts less strain on your knee’s cartilage, added Dr. Michael Yang , a sports medicine physician at Jefferson Health in Philadelphia who was not affiliated with the study. “Cartilage is just like a cushion pad, like your shock absorber,” Yang explained. And as we get older, “it’s not just the arthritis, which is on the bone, it’s also the cartilage in between the bones that are getting a little bit worn down.” But there’s good news: If “you can do activities to strengthen the area, while you are also decreasing the impact ... on the cartilage, then you should have less symptomatic arthritis pain, and less development of arthritis,” Yang said. This is essentially what the study found. Bicycling helps to strengthen the musculature around the knee, which also improves your knee joint health as a whole, said Dr. Jessica Tomazic , a sports medicine doctor at the Cleveland Clinic who was not affiliated with the study. Cycling can be an expensive hobby, with bikes regularly costing upward of $1,000 and even $2,000. But you don’t need to splurge on a pricy bike to see knee health benefits, Yang stressed. You don’t need to be a serious biker who puts in tons of miles every day either. “It’s just as simple as getting on a stationary bike ― a lot of these things don’t require too much. If you have a bike in your garage, ride around the neighborhood first. If you have access to a gym, get on the stationary bike 15 to 20 minutes, two or three times a week,” Yang said. It’s important to note that bicycling isn’t the only exercise that can benefit folks with arthritis. According to White, this study underscored previous research that shows general physical activity and exercise are not only preventative in the development of knee osteoarthritis, but also can be an effective treatment for people with the condition or knee pain. “Even in this study, they talk about the fact that other activities — like swimming, running, strength training — help decrease what we call symptomatic arthritis ... you can have arthritis and you may not have as much pain from the arthritis with exercise,” Tomazic added. Many people who have arthritis are nervous about exacerbating their pain by exercising, which is a natural fear, White said. But that shouldn’t stop you from trying — and you can always talk to your doctor beforehand to get the right exercise regimen for you. Additionally, White said it’s normal for the knee to hurt after exercise, but it should go away quickly if you notice any pain at all. And, as mentioned above, exercising your knee will only help your ongoing pain as you move forward. “Finding something that helps you be active is the most important thing you can do,” White said. “So, for some, it’s biking, but then for others, it might be swimming and then for others it might be going for a walk.” As people age, physical activity is key to delaying the effects of aging on your muscles and joints, White added, “especially when you have a chronic disease, like knee arthritis or knee osteoarthritis.” If you want to start cycling outdoors, Tomazic stressed that it’s important to do so safely: Wear a helmet and other protective gear like kneepads and elbow pads, consider purchasing safety lights, stay in bike lanes and follow the rules of the road. “If you’re nervous about starting or not sure of what you know, seeking help from a physical therapist is a great way to go,” White said. Physical therapists can help you create a custom exercise plan to combat any knee pain and keep your knees as healthy as possible as you get older.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Your liver, which is the largest internal organ in your body, is responsible for a lot . It regulates blood clotting, removes toxins like alcohol from your bloodstream, helps in the production of bile and so much more. But your liver can get damaged and have reduced functioning due to illness or lifestyle habits. In fact, liver disease is fairly common, affecting 4.5 million adults in the United States . Liver disease is a very broad term that encompasses many different conditions that impair normal liver function, according to Dr. Douglas Weine , a gastroenterologist at Hackensack Meridian Health Center. Liver conditions include non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis or even cancer. Sometimes, these symptoms will happen immediately, but not always. “Signs and symptoms of liver disease do not typically present until there is significant liver damage,” said Dr. Bubu Banini , a hepatologist and assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine. So, how do you know when something is wrong with your liver? And how can you figure out what it is? We spoke to hepatologists about the five most common warning signs of liver disease and what to do if you spot these issues: “A subtle sign of liver disease is yellowing of the white of the eyes or skin, known as jaundice,” Banini said. This happens when there’s excess bilirubin, a pigment that is created during the natural breakdown of red blood cells in the body. Bilirubin is typically processed by the liver and removed from the body, but too much of it can cause jaundice and indicate liver issues. While high levels of bilirubin aren’t always a huge issue for adults, the underlying issue causing it can be, which is why it’s crucial to talk to your doctor if you notice any yellowing of the skin or eyes. Dark urine on its own typically doesn’t concern people. Usually, it’s an indicator that you need to drink some extra fluids. But it is also typical for people with liver conditions to excrete dark urine, Weine said. This is due to the buildup of bilirubin, which can turn urine into a dark orange, brown or amber color. If you’re drinking normally and still noticing issues with urine color, it could be a sign that something else is going on. We all forget things from time to time, but major changes to your mental state shouldn’t be ignored. They could be a sign of liver problems or a number of other underlying issues. If you experience confusion or other mind-altering issues, seek help right away. “A person who is otherwise healthy can develop acute liver failure that could manifest as changes in mental state or personality such as disorientation, confusion or sleepiness,” Banini said. You may not associate this issue with liver problems, but swelling in your legs and feet could potentially indicate something is wrong, Weine said. This is particularly true when you’re experiencing cirrhosis, which is the scarring of the liver. Cirrhosis slows blood flow through the liver and increases pressure in the vein that brings blood through the organ, according to the Mayo Clinic . The pressure in this vein, known as a portal vein, “can cause fluid to accumulate in the legs, called edema, and in the abdomen, called ascites,” the Mayo Clinic stated, noting that “edema and ascites also may happen if the liver can’t make enough of certain blood proteins, such as albumin.” People with liver damage may bruise or bleed easily when injured, Weine said. This happens because the liver produces proteins that the blood needs to clot, so when the liver is not functioning well, you are easily prone to bleeding. Liver issues aren’t something to dismiss. Heavy or moderate alcohol use, Type 2 diabetes, using shared needles, contact with toxins or a family history of liver disease are all risk factors for liver damage. If you believe you have any liver damage symptoms, it’s important to discuss this with your provider. Other symptoms include stool changes, exhaustion, appetite changes and more. Banini suggested seeking immediate medical attention if you experience severe jaundice, unexpected changes in mental state, the development of black or tarry stools, vomiting blood, progressive swelling of the abdomen, ankles and legs or difficulty breathing. If you visit an emergency room, you can be referred to a liver specialist for further evaluation.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost Between coughing, sneezing, watery eyes and a general blah feeling, allergies are an unwelcome and unfortunate side effect of the summer blooms around us. For some people, daily pills or nasal sprays help curtail symptoms, but for others, it can feel impossible to find a concoction that actually works. If you’re someone who feels like they’ve tried everything but still gets hit with pesky seasonal allergies throughout the year, here’s a suggestion: Experts say a nighttime shower can be the missing ingredient in an allergy treatment routine. “ It helps to wash all of the invisible pollen grains from your body so they can stop causing your allergic reactions,” Ian Budd, a pharmacist at the U.K.-based Chemist 4 U , told HuffPost via email. “ For allergy sufferers, going to sleep with the pollen that has coated the hair, skin and respiratory tract can mean longer exposure to what you are allergic to ― even when you’re no longer outdoors,” said Dr. Monica Kraft , an allergist and immunologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Showering can help remove the pollen and let [mucus] drain.” ( It’s well established that the hot steam from a shower can loosen up mucus.) What’s more, showering can keep your sheets clean by limiting the amount of pollen that you transfer to your bed. “But on top of that, it’s going to minimize a lot of your nighttime symptoms, too, because a lot of our patients complain of allergy symptoms throughout the night,” said Dr. Mas Takashima , the chair of the department of otolaryngology at Houston Methodist in Texas. That includes alleviating nighttime congestion, which otherwise prevents you from getting the sleep you need. Additionally, “you should consider washing your hair more regularly too. Pollen can cling to your hair quite easily, and as it is so close to your face, it’s only natural that pollen in your hair could contribute to your symptoms,” Budd explained. Washing your hair daily isn’t an option for everyone, though. If that’s you, Budd said you can wear a bonnet at night to keep the pollen in your hair away from your face and off of your pillow. On top of showering, “regularly cleaning your bedding ― especially down in the South, dust mites are very prevalent in moist, humid environments,” Takashima said. It’s also a good idea to have a HEPA filter in your bedroom to help reduce allergens in the air, he said. “I think we all tend to forget that we spend seven, eight hours in our bedrooms. And so if that’s the case, why not try to make that into an area where it’s where you’re prone to be less allergenic?” Takashima said. Even more, showering as soon as you get inside can help you feel better. According to Budd, “although showering before bed can help combat hay fever, showering as soon as you get home can prove even more effective. If your symptoms are particularly troublesome, we would recommend getting straight into the shower and changing your clothes as soon as you get indoors.” If you do this, not only will you be washing off the pollen, you’ll also be lessening the amount of pollen you bring into your home, he said. “If you feel like your allergy season is lasting longer than before, you are probably right,” Kraft said. “Weather changes, climate change and fewer deep frosts mean that plants are blooming and pollinating earlier in the spring and lasting longer into the summer and there are higher pollen counts during the peak season.” To help combat bad seasonal allergies, Kraft recommended that you start taking allergy medications as a preventative measure early in the season. So, if you normally have allergies starting in July, you should start taking your medication a few weeks before so the medication has time to build up in your system. Once you’re in your allergy season, nasal saline irrigations can also help you flush out allergens, Takashima said. “If you wear sunglasses , or if you wear a hat, it can decrease how much pollen gets into your hair and your eyes.” Additionally, keep in mind that peak pollen time is typically “in the early morning and late afternoon timeframes,” Takashima noted. This may mean staying inside during those times if you’re having a particularly bad allergy day. There are also many over-the-counter medications, nasal sprays and in-office allergy treatments available. Connect with a physician for the best road map for you. “Talking to your doctor about an allergy treatment plan can make the pollen seasons more tolerable,” Kraft said.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost You’re probably well aware of what should be done before physical intimacy ― from communication to setting the mood ― but you may be less certain about what should be done after sex. After all, there’s a wide variety of post-coital preferences: Some like to sleep it off, others like to cuddle quietly, some like to laugh or talk. However, you should also be making moves for your physical and mental health . By doing just few essential things right after you enjoy your partner, you can extend intimacy and promote optimum sexual well-being. Below are a few expert-backed activities you should consider right after every romp for your own health: What everyone hears about peeing after sex is true, said Sunny Rodgers , a clinical sexologist and sexual health educator. It’s a necessity. “This is the first step I always suggest for right after sex,” Rodgers explained. “This ‘clears the pipes’ and can help dispel any bacteria or toxins.” Afterward, Rodgers said you might want to briefly wash up, “using a clean washcloth, gentle unscented soap and warm water.” This essential hygiene step will do a lot to ensure comfort and help protect against infections, like painful UTIs, Rodgers said. An added PSA: Also remember to wash from front to back. Next, Rodgers suggested selecting breathable underwear from your drawer. “Cotton is the best for allowing genitals to breathe,” she explained. “Being a natural fiber, cotton is also hypoallergenic, highly absorbent, and won’t irritate your most sensitive regions ― which are prone to heightened sensitivity and moisture after sex.” There’s a reason pillow talk is so satisfying ― you’re primed for bonding. Each time you have have sex with a partner, “the love hormone,” scientifically known as oxytocin, is released. “This hormone creates a feeling of closeness,” said Chamin Ajjan, a New York City-based psychotherapist and sex therapist. “Talking with your partner after sex is a great way to connect and create even more intimacy. You can talk about your hopes, your dreams, what you would like to do with your partner or anything that is important to you.” Either grab bottle of water from the fridge and put it on your nightstand before you have sex, or make sure to hit the kitchen just after. “Drinking a minimum of eight ounces of water after sex play can help you hydrate and keep your energy levels up, since sexual stimulation can definitely deplete strength,” Rodgers said. “It can also help flush out bacteria from urinary tracts.” Sip up. It’s not unheard of to feel hungry after sex, because you burn calories and get your heart rate up. Grab a snack after, like chia seeds or green tea, Rodgers suggested. Or, you can try one of these post-burn foods . You can also consider cooking something simple-but-satisfying together, like an omelette, Ajjan said. It’s a great way to continue bonding and use more teamwork and communication. In order to get the most out of future sexual encounters, it’s important to verbalize what you liked with your partner. “Immediately after sex, oxytocin is still high,” said Karla Ivankovich , a couples therapist and clinical counselor at One Patient Global Health. “Share with one another what it is that you really enjoyed about your intimacy, physically or emotionally, is a great way to keep bonding.” Even if you didn’t reach orgasm, connecting on an emotional level and communicating with each other allows for “everyone’s needs to be met,” explained Ivankovich. Right after sex, you can also keep yourself in a playful mindset and connect with a bit of humor. “In the post coital state of euphoria, everything seems better anyway,” Ivankovich said. “Tell a corny joke, be silly, and extend the time in intimacy. That extra time is important; if one partner leaves too quickly, someone feels like their high just crashed to the bottoms.” Overall, try not to think of sex as a just one-act play. It should also revolve around relaxing together, prolonging intimacy and taking care of your health, too. This story was previously published on an earlier date.

    "article_content": "Staff Writer To get a taste of early morning life, I signed up for Sarah Downey ’s 7 a.m. Vinyasa flow class at Monarch Yoga in Philadelphia. As I left my house at sunrise — it only took three iPhone alarms and 32 ounces of iced coffee — it felt to me like the middle of the night, something I’d laugh about later when interviewing folks that wake up as early as 3 a.m. on a daily basis. Though Downey arrives at the studio just after dawn multiple times a week, she still identifies as an “aspirational morning person” and said it’s not always easy to jump out of bed ready to greet the day. “I’m not a natural morning person,” a seemingly well-rested Downey told me. “But I really like teaching the early morning yoga classes... I’ll already be up and I’m gonna be so productive. A lot of it is just motivation.” Downey, along with a majority of the other early birds I spoke to, described becoming a so-called “morning person” over time. They weren’t all biologically wired to wake up with the sun, nor did they shrug it off as something easy or enjoyable. It seems, however, that getting up at 5, 4 or even 3 a.m. is possible with the right routines and habits (and of course, a few helpful products). To pull back the black-out curtain on the inner workings of morning people, we asked 10 early birds about their a.m. hacks and the things that energize them for the day, even when the rest of the world is still snoozing.

    "article_content": "Senior Life Editor, HuffPost My secret weapon at work isn’t an organized inbox, a streamlined to-do list or a time-blocking method ― it’s a treadmill. Recently, I upgraded my work from home setup by purchasing a standing desk and a foldable walking pad that slides perfectly underneath my workspace. I was influenced by numerous TikTok videos and I’m so glad I gave into the allure. It was an investment , but one that has paid for itself in many ways. My energy and creativity have skyrocketed since using my treadmill while working. I find my mind is sharper when I try to focus on tasks, and the 3 p.m. slump is a little more easy to slog through. And, of course, I’m getting more steps ― a habit I lost when the pandemic hit. On a good day, I probably walk about 10 miles. On an average day, I do at least 4 or 5 miles. It’s not really a surprise I’m seeing these results: Research shows movement is beneficial to your mind and body. Walking just 21 minutes a day can cut your risk of heart disease, among other illnesses, including diabetes. It also reduces symptoms of depression (can confirm), boosts your immune system and promotes better sleep, according to the Mayo Clinic . Are there days I don’t feel like using the treadmill? Sure. I’m currently sitting with my feet propped on it as I write this story. There are also days when I walk and I still feel drained. That’s the nature of being a human who has a job and is just generally living in the world right now. But on balance, this new setup has made a world of difference for me. If you’re thinking about taking this step (yes, I did that on purpose) for yourself, below are a few treadmill options you may want to consider. They come either highly-recommended on TikTok ― where the treadmill desk skyrocketed to viral fame ― or by reviewers. There aren’t a lot of higher weight capacity options on the market yet, but here’s hoping we have more to add soon. If there’s one here for you, you won’t regret the purchase.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost Hearing cracking or popping from any part of your body is alarming, but many people report that their knees, in particular, make these sounds regularly. Think about it: Have you ever been in a low-squat position or sitting on the ground just to notice some cracking sounds erupt from your knees as you stand up? Turns out, this is a pretty common occurrence, especially as we get older. But is it just age that causes this, or is there something deeper brewing? At what point ― if any ― should you be concerned? We asked experts about knee cracking, and their insight was pretty surprising. Here’s what you should know: “Everyone’s knees crack and pop, and [this] can be normal and doesn’t mean that there’s anything wrong with the knee,” Daniel Wiznia , an orthopedic surgeon at Yale School of Medicine and co-director of the avascular necrosis program, told HuffPost. This is particularly true if you’re not struggling or in pain when it happens. “ Some painless popping that doesn’t affect motion or function is usually not considered serious,” Constance Chu , a professor of orthopedic surgery at Stanford University, told HuffPost via email. There are many potential reasons why your knee makes a cracking sound, both experts said. According to Wiznia, the main cause of this pain-free clicking is something called cavitation. “Cavitation is when you have two surfaces form a vacuum, and then they’re snapped apart,” he said. The sound is “produced as the two joint surfaces snap apart and the joint fluid forms almost like a little gas, and that makes the sound.” Another explanation could have to do with how your kneecap tracks. “The kneecap, as it tracks on the end of your thigh bone, can sometimes find a path where there’s a little ridge or bump within the cartilage within that path. That causes a little bit of a snap, and that’s normal. A lot of people will have that,” Wiznia said. Or you could be dealing with an issue called crepitus. “Crepitus occurs when the cartilage underneath the bone has been worn down and then you have two surfaces of bone grinding against each other,” Wiznia said, noting that you often see this in patients who have osteoarthritis. It can be loud and sometimes you can even feel it when you put your hands over your knee, he said. “That means that the patient has arthritis . Not all arthritis needs to be treated surgically, a lot of the time, arthritis is actually not painful,” Wiznia added. “If a crack and pop is painful, or if a crack and pop coincides with instability of the joint or if it coincides with the knee locking and getting stuck, then that’s definitely something that you would want to see a doctor about,” Wiznia said. There are a number of things that may cause knee pain or stiffness, including meniscus tears, cartilage damage, arthritis, thickened tissue from an injury and more, according to Chu. In more rare instances, the clicking could be avascular necrosis, Wiznia said. “This is where the blood supply to the bone gets injured, and when the bone isn’t receiving a blood supply, it unfortunately dies.” This can lead to a collapse of the joint, which leads to a clicking sound and knee pain, he noted. “If there is pain, swelling, an injury, something moving around inside the knee, or the knee gets stuck, the knee should be evaluated by a doctor as soon as possible,” Chu stressed. Your doctor can do a physical exam and potentially order X-rays to determine what’s going on with your knee and what kind of treatment is needed. “Most of the time, the cracking and popping creeps up on people as a part of aging ,” Chu said. While knee cracking is a common occurrence, Chu noted that it may mean your knee is not totally healthy or strong enough to maintain certain positions — but this can be improved. “Getting up from low positions puts more stress on the kneecap area, particularly if the person’s legs and body are not strong enough to maintain good body positions during the movement,” Chu said. “In this situation, knee health and function can be improved with learning how to properly strengthen the body and improve how the body moves, even if there is already some arthritis.” You can make an appointment with a physical therapist to learn how to build your strength, or you can choose to get a little more active. For example, a recent study found that both indoor and outdoor bicycling can prevent knee pain and lower instances of arthritis. Exercise in many forms can help folks manage arthritis pain. “Swimming, running, strength training help decrease what we call symptomatic arthritis . ... You can have arthritis and you may not have as much pain from the arthritis with exercise,” Jessica Tomazic , a sports medicine doctor at the Cleveland Clinic, previously told HuffPost . But, once again, pain-free knee cracking and popping is likely not serious — and exercise and strength-training is a good idea whether or not you deal with this phenomenon. “ Prioritizing knee health is important to maintaining mobility, which is critical to overall health and well-being,” Chu said.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost More than 55 million people across the globe have dementia , which describes a cluster of symptoms ― such as memory loss, overall cognitive impairment and psychological changes ― as well as specific conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, according to the World Health Organization. Cases continue to grow at alarming rates, with about 10 million people developing dementia each year . This underscores the importance of brain health, an umbrella term that emphasizes the wellness of all cognitive skills and abilities. Dr. Zaldy Tan, director of the Maxine & Bernard Platzer Lynn Family Memory & Healthy Aging Program at Cedars-Sinai, explained that “brain health is the state that allows a person to adequately perform important day-to-day functions such as purposeful movements, communication, thinking and learning.” “As a society, we should pay attention to brain health from the start of one’s life,” Dr. Dylan Wint, director of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health , told HuffPost, adding that brain health is impacted by “choices made over a lifetime.” It’s important to note that genetics, chronic illness and other individual risk factors can play a role in the development of dementia. However, physicians agree there are universal ways to dramatically boost your cognitive functioning. According to dementia experts, these are seven brain health rules to adopt that will keep your mind sharp as you age . Research has shown that regular physical activity is beneficial to one’s cognitive functioning , working to decrease stress, counteract the hormones that worsen anxiety and sharpen memory. As Tan further explained, “physical exercise is important to ensure healthy arteries and adequate blood flow to the brain, and also reduces the risk for falls which can lead to head trauma.” You don’t need to sign up for a 5K or hit the gym every day; it’s most important to prioritize consistency over intensity. “Find ways to build more movement into your day — walking, dancing, gardening. Whatever works for you,” said Heather M. Snyder , the Alzheimer’s Association’s vice president of medical and scientific relations. The brain may not be a muscle (it’s an organ), but a good rule of thumb is to treat it like one. Experts suggest strengthening the brain through developing new skills can promote neuroplasticity, which encourages the brain to adapt, change and grow over time . “You could try brain games, a new hobby, taking a class at a college or community center, or learning a new language or instrument,” Wint explained. “When determining whether an activity can have some cognitive benefit, what’s most important is that you are challenged and learning.” Aiming to get a good night’s rest ― around seven hours of uninterrupted, restorative sleep ― is essential to keeping cognitive functioning in tip-top shape. While snoozing, the brain is still at work flushing out toxins that are directly linked to a heightened risk of developing dementia , as well as general cognitive issues. Moreover, sleep plays an important role in memory consolidation , emotional processing and improving problem-solving abilities. “Do all you can to minimize disruptions,” Snyder said. “If you have any sleep-related problems, such as sleep apnea, talk to a health care provider.” Snoring, teeth grinding, excessive daytime sleepiness and frequently making bathroom trips at night are signs that may indicate you’re dealing with an underlying sleep disorder . Aside from getting adequate shut-eye, scheduling intentional downtime allows your mind the much-needed space to relax, recover and reset. “Just like our muscles and joints need to recover after a strenuous workout, our brains need a period of rest after a stressful and busy day of work or night of socialization,” said Tan, adding that intentional downtime may look like “taking short naps during the day or even just closing your eyes and meditating.” Not only is addressing potential sleep issues vital to boosting your brainpower, but tackling chronic stress is crucial to cognition. According to Tan, chronic stress can “ lead to higher blood pressure, which is detrimental to brain and heart health.” In fact, studies have revealed that high blood pressure (aka hypertension) leads to memory loss , a sharper decline in planning and organizational skills, and increased risk of having a stroke. Dietary modifications and prescribing blood pressure medications are two common ways that physicians treat hypertension. Another key brain health rule is to avoid social isolation. “As social beings, the human brain thrives on interacting with others. … When this does not happen, our memory and cognition can decline over time ,” Tan said. “It is important to keep engaged and connected with others.” This doesn’t mean you have to transform into a social butterfly if you’re an introvert, but rather find a meaningful social activity to you. Wint noted this can include spending time with loved ones, participating in sports or cultural activities, becoming involved in a spiritual community or volunteering for an organization. The physical health risks of smoking cigarettes are widely recognized, but the damage done to the mind can’t be overstated. There is strong evidence to suggest that smoking causes your brain to lose volume and age prematurely , directly increasing one’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or another dementia condition. Snyder explained that “quitting smoking can lower the risk of cognitive decline back to levels similar to those who have not smoked .” While quitting smoking is certainly ideal for those concerned about their cognitive well-being, it’s important to acknowledge that not everyone can or wants to entirely cut tobacco out of their lives. In this case, try practicing tobacco harm reduction such as choosing modern smokeless tobacco products or reducing overall intake. Similarly, alcohol is a known neurotoxin that causes both short- and long-term neurological damage, so aiming to reduce consumption is optimal for brain health. Though you can’t entirely control the way your brain ages, adopting simple rules such as these can add up in the long run. “ When should one start adopting these rules? The earlier the better, but it’s never too late to start,” Tan said.

    "article_content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The new agreement between Russia and North Korea reached by their leaders at a Pyongyang summit requires both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event of war, North Korean state media said Thursday. Both North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and Russia’s Vladimir Putin had described the deal reached Wednesday as a major upgrade of bilateral relations, covering security, trade, investment, cultural and humanitarian ties. Outside observers said it could mark the strongest connection between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Thursday reported the language of the comprehensive strategic partnership agreement. The agency said Article 4 of the agreement states that if one of the countries gets invaded and is pushed into a state of war, the other must deploy “all means at its disposal without delay” to provide “military and other assistance.” The summit between Kim and Putin came as the U.S. and its allies expressed growing concern over a possible arms arrangement in which Pyongyang provides Moscow with badly needed munitions for its war in Ukraine , in exchange for economic assistance and technology transfers that could enhance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear weapons and missile program. Following their summit, Kim said the two countries had a “fiery friendship,” and that the deal was their “strongest-ever treaty,” putting the relationship at the level of an alliance. He vowed full support for Russia’s war in Ukraine. Putin called it a “breakthrough document” reflecting shared desires to move relations to a higher level. North Korea and the former Soviet Union signed a treaty in 1961, which experts say necessitated Moscow’s military intervention if the North came under attack. The deal was discarded after the collapse of the USSR, replaced by one in 2000 that offered weaker security assurances. Following the Kim-Putin meeting, South Korean officials said they were still interpreting the results of the summit, including what Russia’s response might be if the North comes under attack, and whether the new deal promises a similar level of protection with the 1961 treaty. South Korean officials didn’t immediately comment on the North Korean report about the details of the deal as of Thursday morning. “As of now, there is nothing specific we can tell you,” Lee Kyung-ho, a spokesperson at Seoul’s Defense Ministry, said when asked during a briefing whether it assesses that Russia has committed to an automatic military invention on behalf of the North in war situations. The deal was made as Putin visited North Korea for the first time in 24 years, a visit that showcased their personal and geopolitical ties with Kim hugging Putin twice at the airport, their motorcade rolling past giant Russian flags and Putin portraits, and a welcoming ceremony at Pyongyang’s main square attended by what appeared to be tens of thousands of spectators. According to KCNA, the agreement also states that Pyongyang and Moscow must not enter into agreements with third parties if they infringe on the “core interests” of another and must not participate in actions that threaten those interests. KCNA said the agreements require the countries to take steps to prepare joint measures for the purpose of strengthening their defense capabilities to prevent war and protect regional and global peace and security. The agency didn’t specify what those steps are, or whether they would include combined military training and other cooperation. The agreement also calls for the countries to actively cooperate in efforts to establish a “just and multipolar new world order,” KCNA said, underscoring how the countries are aligning in face of their separate, escalating confrontations with the Untied States. Kim in recent months has made Russia his priority as he pushes a foreign policy aimed at expanding relations with countries confronting Washington, embracing the idea of a “new Cold War” and trying to display a united front in Putin’s broader conflicts with the West. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, with the pace of both Kim’s weapons tests and combined military exercises involving the U.S., South Korea and Japan intensifying in a tit-for-tat cycle. The Koreas also have engaged in Cold War-style psychological warfare that involved North Korea dropping tons of trash on the South with balloons, and the South broadcasting anti-North Korean propaganda with its loudspeakers.

    "article_content": "BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union countries on Friday formally approved the launch of accession negotiations with war-torn Ukraine and Moldova next week, another step in the two nations’ long journey to join the 27-nation bloc. Belgium, which currently holds the presidency of the European Union, said member states have agreed on a negotiating framework. “This opens the way for launching the negotiations on Tuesday 25 June in Luxembourg,” the Belgian presidency said. Talks will be launched with two intergovernmental conferences. Following a positive assessment from the EU’s executive branch, EU leaders had already agreed last year that accession negotiations should start with both countries. The process between the start of negotiations with Ukraine and its neighbor Moldova and their becoming members of the EU could take many years. To join the EU, candidate countries must go through a lengthy process to align their laws and standards with those of the bloc and show that their institutions and economies meet democratic norms. Ukraine is one of several countries that have long wanted to join the EU, seeing it as a path to wealth and stability. While the EU is not a military alliance like NATO, membership in the bloc is seen by some as a rampart against Russian influence. Ukraine officially applied for EU accession less than a week after Russia invaded it in February 2022. The opening of talks sends another strong signal of solidarity with Ukraine in addition to the huge financial support provided by the EU. Moldova has repeatedly accused Russia of conducting a “hybrid war” against the country, meddling in local elections and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail its path toward joining the EU. Russia has denied the accusations, but the Moldovan government is wary of Moscow’s intentions, particularly after Transnistrian authorities appealed to Moscow in February for “protection” due to what they said was increased pressure from the government.

    "article_content": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli forces shelled tent camps for displaced Palestinians outside Gaza’s southern city of Rafah on Friday, killing at least 25 people and wounding another 50, according to the territory’s health officials and emergency workers. This was the latest deadly attack in the Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands have fled fighting between Israel and Hamas . It comes less than a month after an Israeli bombing triggered a deadly fire that tore through a camp for displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza, drawing widespread international outrage — including from some of Israel’s closest allies — over the military’s expanding offensive into Rafah. Witnesses whose relatives died in one of the bombardments near a Red Cross field hospital north of Rafah told The Associated Press that Israeli forces fired a second volley that killed people who came out of their tents. The International Committee of the Red Cross said the hospital was flooded with casualties, including 22 dead and 45 wounded, and condemned the firing of “high-caliber projectiles” a few meters (yards) from the facility. Hundreds of people live in tents nearby, including many of the hospital staff, the ICRC said. According to Ahmed Radwan, a spokesperson for Civil Defense first responders in Rafah, witnesses told rescue workers about Friday’s shelling at two locations in a coastal area that has become filled with makeshift tents. The Health Ministry in Gaza reported the number of people killed and wounded in the attacks. The locations of the attacks provided by the Civil Defense and the Red Cross hospital appear to be just outside an Israeli-designated safe zone on the Mediterranean coast, known as Muwasi. The Israeli military said the episode was under review but that “there is no indication that a strike was carried out by the IDF” inside the safe zone, using an acronym for Israel’s armed forces. It did not offer details on the episode or say what the intended targets might have been. Israel has previously bombed locations in the vicinity of the “humanitarian zone” in Muwasi, a rural area with no water or sewage systems where displaced Palestinians have built tent camps in recent months. Israel says it is targeting Hamas fighters and infrastructure and that it tries to minimize civilian deaths. It blames the large number of civilian casualties on militants and says it’s because they operate among the population. With Israel’s war against Hamas now in its ninth month, international criticism is growing over the campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza , at a huge cost in civilian lives. The top United Nations court has concluded there is a “plausible risk of genocide” in Gaza — a charge Israel strongly denies . The attack near the Red Cross hospital began with a munition that only made a loud bang and bright flash, said Mona Ashour, who lost her husband after he went to investigate what was happening. “We were in our tent, and they hit with a ‘sound bomb’ near the Red Cross tents, and then my husband came out at the first sound,” Ashour said, holding back tears while clutching a young girl outside Nasser Hospital in nearby Khan Younis. “And then they hit with the second one, which was a little closer to the entrance of the Red Cross,” she said. Hasan al-Najjar said his sons were killed helping people who panicked after the first strike. ”My two sons went after they heard the women and children screaming,” he said at the hospital. “They went to save the women, and they struck with the second projectile, and my sons were martyred. They struck the place twice.” The hospital’s location is known to all parties in the conflict and marked with the Red Cross emblem, the ICRC noted on Friday. The 60-bed field hospital was opened in mid-May to provide emergency surgeries, obstetric, pediatric and outpatient care, according to a news release at the time, which shows white tents covering an area about the size of a soccer field. Israel is pushing ahead with its invasion of Rafah , where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from fighting elsewhere. Most have now fled the city, but the United Nations says no place in Gaza is safe and humanitarian conditions are dire as families shelter in tents and cramped apartments without adequate food, water, or medical supplies. Elsewhere, Civil Defense teams in the northern Gaza Strip recovered the bodies of five people who were killed in an airstrike that hit two apartments in Gaza City, and several others were wounded. An airstrike earlier Friday hit a municipal garage in the city and killed five people. Fadel Naeem, the orthopedic chief at al-Ahli hospital, said the bodies of 30 people were brought there Friday, calling it “a difficult and brutal day in Gaza City.” Meanwhile, the Israeli army said Friday that two soldiers were killed in combat in central Gaza. No information was given about the circumstances of the deaths of the two, both men in their 20s. Three other Israeli soldiers were severely injured, the army said. Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,400 people in Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Israel launched the war after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack , in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. ___ Associated Press writers Jack Jeffery in Ramallah, West Bank, and Drew Callister in New York contributed to this report.

    "article_content": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — At least 39 people were killed by Israeli strikes across northern Gaza on Saturday, as rescue workers scrambled to find survivors beneath the rubble, according to Palestinian and hospital officials. Fadel Naem, director of the al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, told The Associated Press that more than three dozen bodies arrived at the hospital. The Palestinian Civil Defense, an emergency group active in Gaza, said its emergency workers were digging for survivors at the site of a strike in the Shati refugee camp west of Gaza City and that it had pulled several dozen bodies from a building hit by an Israeli strike in an eastern neighborhood of Gaza City. Israel said Saturday that its fighter jets struck two Hamas military sites in the Gaza City area but did not elaborate further. The deaths come a day after at least 25 people were killed in strikes on tent camps and 50 wounded near the southern city of Rafah. Israel said Saturday that it was continuing to operate in central and southern Gaza and has pushed ahead with its invasion of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from fighting elsewhere. Most have now fled the city, but the United Nations says no place in Gaza is safe and humanitarian conditions are dire as families shelter in tents and cramped apartments without adequate food, water or medical supplies. A separate Israeli strike Saturday in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley killed a member of the military wing of al-Jamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, a Sunni Muslim faction closely allied with Hamas, according to the group. The member was the seventh killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon since the war began. The Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. when Hamas militants who stormed southern Israel killed about 1,200 people and took some 250 others hostage. Israel has responded by bombarding and invading the enclave, killing more than 37, 400 Palestinians there according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Also Saturday, Israel’s army said an Israeli man was fatally shot in the northern West Bank town of Qalqilya, where Israeli forces fatally shot two militants Friday, the latest flare of violence in the territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted. At least 549 Palestinians in the territory have been killed by Israeli fire since the war began, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which tracks the killings. Over the same period, Palestinians in the West Bank have killed at least nine Israelis, including five soldiers, according to U.N. data. Israeli nationals are prohibited from entering Qalqilya and other areas of the West Bank that fall under the under the control of the Palestinian Authority. In April, the death of a 14-year-old Israeli settler sparked a series of settler attacks on Palestinian towns in the territory. The army said a Palestinian was later arrested in connection with the killing. On Saturday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said a 12-year-old Palestinian boy died from his wounds after being shot by Israeli forces in Ramallah last week. Commenting on the shooting, the Israeli army said its forces raided al-Amari refugee camp near Ramallah to arrest a suspect Friday and then opened fire on a group of Palestinians who were pelting them with stones. Israel said Saturday that it was investigating a separate incident into conduct of its soldiers after a video surfaced online showing an injured Palestinian being transported on the hood of an Israeli armored car in the northern West Bank. The army said the man in the video was a wanted suspect and injured during an exchange of fire between Palestinian militants and Israeli forces near the city of Jenin. The man was being transported to a Red Crescent ambulance situated nearby, it said. The army said the conduct in the video didn’t “conform to the values” of the army. Anger across the country is growing at the government’s handling of the war in Gaza and the hostage crisis. On Saturday, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv calling for new elections and for the government to bring the hostages home. Among the families were the parents of Naama Levy, an Israeli soldier who marked her 20th birthday in captivity. ___ Jeffery reported from Ramallah and Associated Press writers Bassem Mroue in Beirut and Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Writer It’s common knowledge that cotton underwear is the best choice for the health of your nether regions. Many people, however, choose to ignore this advice for the sake of fashion and opt for knickers that are made out of lace or satin. Yet three countries, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, effectively banned lace panties starting back in 2014 . The bans aren’t about modesty or concerns about what people might be doing in the privacy of their bedrooms. Instead, these governments think that lace underwear without a cotton lining is unhygienic and poses a threat to one’s health. In the wake of these bans, protests broke out as women demanded the right to choose their underwear. To get to the bottom of whether lace panties are so bad for us, we consulted doctors who specialize in vaginal health. Cotton underwear is often the most comfortable option, but there are some health benefits to wearing it too, said Dr. Jennifer Angler , a urogynecologist and co-author of ” A Woman’s Guide to Her Pelvic Floor: What the F*@# Is Going On Down There? ” Cotton is considered the “gold standard” of panties when it comes to wicking away moisture and keeping the vaginal area clean and fresh, she said. “The reason so many doctors recommend cotton panties, or at least cotton crotches, is that cotton is a very gentle, absorbent and breathable material,” said Dr. Victoria Scott , a urogynecologist and one of Angler’s co-authors . Synthetic materials like spandex and nylon may trap moisture and heat. This creates “an ideal environment for bacteria and yeast to grow and cause infection,” Scott said. Moreover, because cotton is “a gentle fabric,” it is less likely to “cause vulvar irritation,” which is uncomfortable and can be painful, she added. People with certain health conditions should stick to wearing underwear with cotton crotches most of the time. “If you are prone to yeast infections, bacterial vaginosis, or urinary tract infections, panties with cotton crotches may decrease your risk of developing infections,” Scott said. Additionally, people who have vaginal dryness or vulvar irritation or pain may find that panties with cotton crotches help keep them more comfortable. Greves adds that those with diabetes or who are pregnant are at higher risk for developing yeast infections and should stick with cotton linings to stay healthy. Those who want the benefits of cotton but the look of lace should look for panties with cotton crotches or cotton inserts. “The crotch is the most important part of panties for vulvar and vaginal health,” Scott explained. Underwear with a cotton crotch “allow for lace, or any material, underwear to be worn but with the comfort of cotton right where it matters most,” Angler said. The biggest danger in wearing underwear without a cotton crotch is that moisture can build up, which allows yeast and bacteria to thrive, Scott explained. Overgrowth of yeast can cause uncomfortable yeast infections. When bacteria starts growing in the vaginal area, “it may lead to an imbalance of healthy bacteria in the vagina” and cause bacterial vaginosis (BV), said Dr. Erica Montes , an OB-GYN. BV causes discharge that “can appear thin or milky and possibly cause a fishy odor,” she explained. BV is not just unpleasant, but it may “ require antibiotics that are prescribed by your physician,” she said. Despite the risks, Scott says that wearing panties made out of other materials “is certainly not dangerous” for most people. Because “the balance of bacteria in the vagina is different for all women,” many can wear non-cotton underwear without any negative effects, Montes explained. Dr. Christenie Greves , an OB-GYN, emphasizes that lace undies have advantages for some. If you choose a high-quality pair, it “is soft, so it may feel good. ... Don’t toss out your lace panties if you happen to enjoy wearing them” and they aren’t causing any problems, Scott said. Montes encourages her patients to consider wearing the right type of underwear for the season and the occasion. Greves stresses that the phrase “everything in moderation” can also apply to lace underwear. All-lace panties may be fine in the cold of winter, but they can start to cause problems in the heat of summer when “sweating is more common,” Montes said. Greves explained that wearing lace undies on special occasions might be fine, but “during a regular day or when you are working out, you may not want to risk frustrating your lady parts.” Scott also recommends that people who are prone to infections or “vulvar or vaginal discomfort” wash their underwear with fragrance-free detergent and avoid fabric softeners. Fit is also important. Panties that are too tight “may increase risk of infection or irritation,” she said. Going commando at night is also helpful because it gives “your vulvar skin a break from coverage and reduces the risk of chronic irritation,” Scott explained. According to Scott, some people will continue to develop vaginal infections or vulvar irritation even after wearing panties that have cotton crotches and developing other healthy habits. For these folks, “it is worth trying panties that are made of 100% cotton,” she said. Greves says that the goal for most women “is not to think about their lady parts.” That means that “if a pair of beautiful lace panties” causes discomfort, pain, or an infection “then they may not be right for you,” she said. However, Greves encourages her patients to experiment and figure out what works for them.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost No matter what age you are, you deserve to look and feel your best. And if you’ve decided to let your hair go gray, you still have plenty of options that will help you look your absolute best at any age. “Going gray doesn’t mean giving up,” said Tim Foster , stylist and colorist at District on 50 th in Minneapolis. “I think it shows confidence.” Many stylists agree that gray can be the ultimate power color. Tom Smith , stylist and trend forecaster, said, “Going gray can be incredibly liberating. It has the power to look incredibly sleek, sharp and chic.” Tarryn Feldman said, “Embracing gray hair can be a beautiful and empowering experience.” Stylist Bradley Leake , owner of the Santa Monica salon Brdy Jay , commented, “A trend we love to see is embracing natural hair color. Gray is just that — it’s natural, and it’s beautiful, and I think gray is having its own moment right now.” But that doesn’t mean it that it doesn’t need good care. Below, experts reveal the ways to go gray gracefully. Yes, graying hair is a product of aging, but many people don’t realize what’s actually happening as the color of their youth is replaced by something different. “The biggest misconception about gray hair is that it is actually gray in color,” Smith said. “It’s actually the gradual halting of pigment production in the follicle of each hair, one strand at a time.” Smith suggested taking a closer look to understand what’s happening: “If you look closely at a head of gray hair, you’ll see it’s not just one color, but a mix of your original darker color and scattered colorless strands. That’s the reason some people’s gray hair looks more charcoal or slate-colored, while others’ looks creamier or more beige-toned.” He’s recorded a short video that explains the process in more detail. Marilisa Sears , artistic director at Mav Beauty, noted that more than just color is changing on a graying head. “The actual circumference of the hair can shrink, making hair thinner, including the cuticle,” she said. The sharpness in contrast depends on your original color, too, said stylist and Kerasilk ambassador Harry Josh . “Gray hair is more visible when you have darker hair color. For example, if you have dark brown hair and you’re still dying it, you’ll start to see gray within two to three weeks after coloring, because the color is so extreme compared to the starting point.” Just because you’re on the offramp of the Hair Dye Highway, you can still give your locks some well-deserved care at your favorite salon. For one thing, having the right cut matters more than ever after you go gray, many stylists said. “Having a foundation of a strong cut specifically designed for you does wonders for the overall look of gray hair,” said stylist Rod Anker . “There’s a misconception that gray hair requires no maintenance,” Feldman said. “In reality, gray hair can be coarser and drier than pigmented hair, so it requires more moisture and specific care.” “Quality hair care is crucial for gray hair,” Leake agreed. “If left to its own devices, gray hair can become extremely weak, often leading to that ‘wiry’ look. Simple treatments will make the biggest difference on the texture of your hair, which is just as important as the color, if not more so.” What are some treatments to consider? “A complete game-changer for gray hair is deep conditioning or repair treatments,” he said. And even if you’re happy avoiding covering dye, there are color options that really might help your look stand out — and give your locks some pampering, too. Stylist Mickey Bolek , owner of the Michael Anthony Salon in Washington, D.C., said, “Semi-permanent colors to enhance the gray can also increase shine and softness.” Bolek also mentioned a new perm technology that can help newly wiry hair. The Curl Cult perm “is not what you remember from the ’80s and ’90s,” he assured. “It’s 100% vegan and uses amino acids instead of harsh chemicals. It softens hair instead of snapping it off.” For daily care, it’s important to pay attention to the texture and condition of your graying hair. “Using a clarifying shampoo from time to time will minimize the level of impurities that more-porous gray hair will absorb, keeping it bright and shiny.” More than ever, moisture matters. “The goal is to get hair to the point where it is fully moisturized, since that will prevent breakage and add shine,” Sears said. “You want to ensure that your hair has enough moisture. Feldman said that drier and more brittle gray hair “makes deep conditioning treatments crucial.” She suggested intensive at-home moisturizing treatments to help restore hydration, improve texture and enhance hair’s overall health and appearance. How often? Josh said, “If your hair texture has changed, I recommend doing weekly intensive treatments like masks and leave-ins.” If you’re noticing that your hair has taken on a yellow overtone, Anker said that can be caused by the quality and type of water you’re using. “If this does happen, then adding a purple shampoo into your rotation may be a good idea,” he said. That purple shampoo is a perennial stylist favorite, and many mentioned it as a good option. Foster said: “ It will cut the yellow and make your hair silver and sparkly.” But beware of too much of this good purple thing, Smith warned. “J ust don’t overuse it, as it can cause your gray to become slightly or even fully lavender-colored.” If you’re looking for a bit of validation for your decision to go gray, you’ll find lots of it from stylists. Feldman noted that hair health is one key factor. “Going gray can be a healthier option for your hair, since you’re avoiding frequent dyeing with harsh chemicals, leading to stronger, healthier hair.” Need more reasons? Leake said, “Embracing your gray hair is a serious money-saving beauty hack, since you’ll be cutting down significantly on salon visits for dye maintenance.” He went on to say, “In essence, going gray is an opportunity to embrace your natural beauty and express yourself with authenticity. It’s a personal choice that can reflect confidence, maturity and self-acceptance. So if you’re considering letting your natural gray hair shine through, know that it can be a stylish and empowering decision.” “Gray hair doesn’t make you old,” Leake said. “But it does mean it’s time to invest in some quality hair care that will keep you feeling healthy, youthful, bouncy, and beautiful.” Here are some stylist recommendations: HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Do you start at your feet and move up? Give it all a quick spray and move on? If you’ve fallen into a routine of using sunscreen each day, you may be surprised to hear that there’s a preferred method for how it should be applied. Are you doing it the right way? Here’s what the experts say. Face-first is always the way to go, experts said. “I recommend starting at the face and then working your way down the body to your feet, so that you don’t wind up with bacteria from your body on your face,” said dermatologist Dr. Corey L. Hartman . Dermatologist Dr. Teresa Song agreed with this approach, and she explained why it’s a good idea. “Generally, skin care products used on the body are more occlusive, which means they can use heavy, greasy ingredients that create a physical barrier for the skin,” she said. “That heavier body skin care should be separated from products intended for face and neck, since they could potentially cause breakouts on the face.” “One way to apply your sunscreen is to focus on the cosmetic subunits of the face,” said dermatologist Dr. DiAnne Davis . “If you follow this method, the forehead gets one dot or glob of sunscreen. Each cheek gets another, then the chin area, around the mouth, the nose and finally around the eyes.” But that’s not the only method. “Alternatively, you could take a glob of product and spread it into both hands by rubbing them together, followed by one large application to the entire face with both hands,” Davis said. “We always recommend layering products from thinnest to thickest,” said dermatologist Dr. Claire Wolinsky . “If you’re using chemical sunscreen, it should be as close to the skin as possible and preferably the first product applied before moisturizer, then makeup. If you’re using a thin serum like a vitamin C, then the serum would be applied first. But if you’re using mineral sunscreen, that should be the last step so it’s closest to the sun.” Once the sunscreen goes on, give yourself some time before doing anything else, experts said. “ Let sunscreen sit on the skin for at least 10 minutes before applying makeup, just to make sure it fully absorbs,” Hartman said. The experts said that the biggest sunscreen mistake they see is people not applying enough. “You need a full ounce of sunscreen to cover your body, which equates to a shot glass or a golf ball-sized amount,” Hartman said. He noted that while sprays are very easy to use, they need some follow-up before they can provide protection. “Spray multiple passes across each body part, usually two to three times per arm and three to four times per leg,” Hartman said. “Hold the sunscreen nozzle about 3 to 4 inches from your skin. Stop in between sprays and rub the sunscreen into the skin entirely. If you skip this step, the spray will only protect where it hits the skin.” As you’re paying attention to application, make sure you’re getting even coverage — especially in spots you might otherwise miss. “Many people realize the importance of applying sunscreen to the face, but other areas like the ears, neck and back of the hands also receive a significant amount of UV radiation and are common sites for skin cancer,” said dermatologist and Mohs surgeon Dr. Carolyn Stull . “Applying sunscreen to these areas on a regular basis is important to reduce the risk of UV damage.” “I recommend a physical or mineral sunscreen that contains zinc oxide as the active ingredient,” said dermatologist Dr. Mojgan Hosseinipour . “Tinted sunscreens contain iron oxides that protect against blue light, infrared and visible light as well. Choose a sunscreen that has an SPF of 30 or higher, is water-resistant, and provides broad-spectrum coverage, which means it protects you from UVA and UVB rays [two types of ultraviolet light].” If you’re confused about how to read all of this on a label, Song put it this way: “‘SPF’ stands for ‘sun protection factor,’ and ‘PA’ stands for ‘protection of UVA rays.’ An SPF number of 30 and up is recommended, with a PA rating of 4-plus. If you’re wearing SPF 30, it blocks 97% of UVB, whereas SPF 50 blocks 98% of UVB rays. While SPF only measures for UVB protection, PA measures for UVA protection, and more pluses means higher protection.” Finally, SPF makeup doesn’t make the grade for medical aesthetician Victoria Waked . “Makeup with SPF is not enough coverage,” she said. “People often apply makeup sparingly, focusing on achieving a desired look rather than ensuring even and thorough sun protection. This can result in an insufficient amount of SPF being applied, leading to reduced effectiveness in shielding the skin from UV rays.” Now that you know which kind of sunscreen to buy and the best way to apply it, make sure you’ve got your timing right, too. First, you need to apply it before those harsh rays hit your delicate flesh. Here’s what Hosseinipour recommended: “Apply sunscreen 15 to 30 minutes before going outdoors. It takes approximately 15 minutes for your skin to absorb the sunscreen and protect you.” And keep reapplying it as long as you’re in the sun. “If you’re outside for longer than two hours, you need to reapply sunscreen,” Hartman said. “You should also reapply immediately after swimming or sweating. There are amazing products available that make reapplication easy, so find one that you like and stick with it.” Want to shop the best sunscreens around? Shop this selection of highly rated picks.

    "article_content": "Writer When it comes to body parts, there’s no shortage of products designed to keep the vaginal area feel fresh and clean. There are “feminine wipes” that claim to be more refreshing than toilet paper and skin care that costs more because it is packaged in feminine colors and has floral scents . But misunderstandings about feminine hygiene and how to best clean “down there” can be harmful and can lead to wasting money on unnecessary products. We asked health experts for the best way to keep vaginas and vulvas clean simply, without spending a fortune. There’s no need to routinely wash inside vaginas because they are “self-cleaning ovens,” according to Dr. Karyn Eilber , a urogynecologist and co-author of ” A Woman’s Guide to Her Pelvic Floor: What the F*@# Is Going On Down There? ” Lactobacilli , a type of natural bacteria that inhabits the vagina, produces lactic acid to keep the vaginal pH in the normal acidic range. This helps keep vaginas clean, explained Dr. Alyssa Dweck , a gynecologist and chief medical officer at Bonafide Health. Washing inside the vagina , which is also called douching, can disrupt the natural microbe and pH levels in the vagina, she said. Once this happens, it’s possible to become irritated or develop infections. That doesn’t mean people need to take special precautions to keep cleansing products away from their vaginas completely. If a little soap or body wash gets into the vagina while bathing, it may be uncomfortable, but it’s unlikely to be harmful, said Dr. Victoria Scott , a urogynecologist and one of Eilber’s co-authors . If someone does accidentally get a cleanser in the vagina, they should gently flush it out with water from the showerhead, said Dr. Christine Greves , an obstetrician-gynecologist. Even though the insides of vaginas shouldn’t be cleaned regularly, sometimes they need to be rinsed. “It can be helpful to get water inside of the vaginal canal a bit when showering to help clean out blood or discharge from a yeast infection,” said Dr. Jennifer Anger , a urogynecologist . Anger explained that one can perform a cleanout as needed “with a simple finger sweep while showering” by “placing a wet finger inside to scoop out any blood or discharge.” You should not use soap or cleansers when performing a cleanout. Unlike the inside of the vagina, the outside, called the vulva, is not self-cleaning. “When you don’t wash the vulva, it’s like not cleaning other areas with glands and hair, like your armpits,” Eilber said. She recommends washing the vulva whenever someone bathes. Dweck explained that, because yeast and bacteria tend to thrive in moist, dark environments like the vulva, poor vaginal hygiene can cause health issues. “Not washing can lead to unpleasant odors, yeast infections, other infections, irritation, inflammation, swelling, and even cysts on hair follicles,” said Dr. Cecilia Zhang , an obstetrician/gynecologist at Atlantic Health System in New Jersey. Because the vulva is delicate, Dweck emphasized that “vigorous scrubbing is not needed,” and may be harmful. She recommended cleansing the vulva with hands or a soft washcloth. Both methods are effective, and which one someone uses is solely a matter of personal preference. Greves recommended washing from front to back to prevent soap from getting into the urethra and to prevent contamination from the rectal area, which can cause urinary tract infections. After washing, Anger said that it’s important to use a towel to pat dry before putting on underwear to avoid excess moisture, which can lead to bacterial and yeast growth . She adds that sleeping without underwear is an ideal way to help keep the vagnial area dry throughout the night, which can help prevent irritation and infection. “Allowing your vaginal area to breathe is important,” Zhang said. According to Dweck, even with regular washing, vaginal scents are normal and may vary throughout someone’s cycle. However, some vaginal odors may indicate an infection. Unusual odors or “odor accompanied by unusual discharge, itching, irritation, bleeding, or pain is best evaluated by a health care provider,” she said. It’s not a great idea to reach for regular soap or body wash before cleaning down there. Some products contain ingredients that can disrupt the vulva’s microbiome, leading to infection and irritation, so it’s important to be thoughtful. For most people, a simple warm water rinse is sufficient, Zhang said. However, for those who prefer using more than just water to wash, many gentle cleansers are safe, Zhang said. Additionally, water alone may not get rid of smells caused by sweating, so those who sweat a lot may need to use a cleanser, Greves explained. When looking for a cleanser that is safe for vulvas, Scott recommended using “gentle, pH-balanced, fragrance-free, hypoallergenic and preservative-free” products. Specifically, she recommended avoiding products with parabens that can cause hormonal disruption. Scott also advised that one should avoid scented products, harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate, glycerin and glycol, antibacterial agents such as triclosan, petroleum-based ingredients and alcohol. “Not only can these substances be abrasive and cause irritation, dryness and pain of the vagina and vulva, but they can alter the pH balance, which may predispose you to developing infections,” she said. Even if a cleanser seems safe to use, if it causes any irritation, Dweck recommended rinsing the vulva with warm water and avoiding that product in the future. Greves emphasized that you don’t need cleansers or soaps that claim to be made just for the vaginal area. Those are likely to cost more without any additional benefit. When in doubt, Eilber said to keep things simple. “Less is more when it comes to the vagina. Treat your vulva like delicate skin,” she said.

    "article_content": "Wellness Reporter, HuffPost The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory this week warning people about counterfeit Botox , which has sickened 22 people in 11 states between November 2023 and March 2024. According to the CDC, “all symptomatic people were females aged 25 to 59 years. All reported receiving botulinum toxin [also known as Botox] injections by unlicensed or untrained individuals or in non-healthcare settings, including homes or spas.” The Botox that’s making people sick is counterfeit and was purchased from unlicensed sources, according to the Food and Drug Administration . People reported reactions such as vision problems, constipation, shortness of breath, dry mouth, trouble lifting their head and more. Some folks have even required hospitalization. “People basically exhibit symptoms of actually too much botox — botulism,” Dr. Jimmy C. Sung , a board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeon and founder of Tribeca Aesthetic in New York, told HuffPost. He added that the quality control checks that real Botox goes through is not happening for this counterfeit product. Experts stress that receiving Botox is a medical procedure and should be treated as such. The product is FDA-approved for the treatment of wrinkles, migraines, excessive sweating and more, Dr. Deeptej Singh , a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Sandia Dermatology in New Mexico, told HuffPost. It’s best known for the treatment of forehead wrinkles, crow’s feet and frown lines, which it relieves temporarily. “Readers should not be concerned about genuine Botox, because genuine Botox ... goes through several stages of quality assurance, and genuine Botox gives consistent, reliable, safe results,” Singh said. “People want Botox because it works, but people also need to understand that it is a medical procedure.” According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons , injections like Botox are the most popular minimally invasive treatment in the country. “Because it is so popular and so many people want it, there is this market for getting a ‘deal’ that turns out to not be a deal,” Singh explained. The illness that’s happening across the U.S. is due to this issue. Some providers may be enticed by cheaper products, which could end up being counterfeit ― and that can spark a host of health problems . “All drugs are relatively safe when it’s used appropriately,” Sung said. “That’s why not only the person should be licensed, they should be properly trained, because at the end of the day, this is a poison, it’s a toxin.” To be safe, get your Botox from a licensed medical professional at a doctor’s office. “People want Botox because it works, but people also need to understand that it is a medical procedure,” Singh said. You probably wouldn’t get any other medical procedure at home, right? If you want to protect yourself from counterfeit products, “the best thing to do is to go to a doctor’s office ... people who specialize in this, meaning the core providers, such as board-certified plastic surgeons, board-certified dermatologists,” Sung said. It’s one thing to buy a fake designer bag, said Sung, “but this is a drug, and is it really worth it? I think the marketplace has created a situation where there’s actually room for counterfeits.” Overall, you are more than likely safe from any bad reactions if you’re getting standard, real Botox. But if you notice symptoms like difficulty breathing, vision changes, drooping eyelids, fatigue or muscle weakness following your Botox injection, you should contact your doctor as soon as possible. These side effects can occur hours to weeks after injection, according to Medical News Today . “I can’t give you a 100% bulletproof formula on how to make sure that your Botox is real because you could go to even a licensed person who has purchased unlicensed product,” Singh said. “The best advice is to go to a reputable source, treat it like a medical procedure and avoid anyone who is coming to your home or doing it in a spa.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost We all know the telltale signs that your skin isn’t aging well — sun spots, deep wrinkles and dry skin are just three things to look out for. If you’re a smoker, you may notice deeper wrinkles and dry skin. If you’ve lacked sun protection over the years, you may experience hyperpigmentation. But what are the signs that your skin is on the right path? The aging process can look extremely different from person to person, and there can be certain noticeable signals that you’ve taken good care of your body throughout your life. Dermatologist Dr. Hadley King says that lifestyle factors such as your sleep schedule, exercise routine and stress will also contribute to how your skin ages. We spoke with two dermatologists to help us determine the five signs your skin is actually aging well. When it comes to your wound healing, how quickly you heal can easily show the health of your skin and how it is aging. If your skin heals from an open cut within a week or so, “This means your diet has enough protein to help with wound healing, [or that you have] a healthy immune system [or maybe] good genes,” dermatologist Dr. Lauren Moy explained. If you’re dealing with a more serious wound, it should heal within four to six weeks, per National Library of Medicine . So how do you know if your wound is healing well? If you’ve had a cut, your body goes into repair mode to restore its skin barrier, forming a scab. This protects your wound , allowing the skin underneath it to heal . You’ll know it’s healed when your skin is fading from a pink color to closer to your skin tone, and the wound will flatten out and soften. There are a handful of factors to consider when it comes to your skin healing from an injury, especially as you’re getting older. Two in particular are skin moisture and nutrition. Wound Care Inc. reports that moisture is extremely important for healing wounds. When skin is dry, it’s more at risk for skin lesions, infections and thickening — all of which will hinder the rate of wound healing. When your body isn’t fueled with nutrients for cell repair and growth, your wound will heal at a slower pace. Since your body uses protein to build and repair skin, a high-protein diet can help ensure your skin is healing well. This is something to keep in mind as you age, since your skin will take longer to heal . If your skin feels smooth the majority of the time, you can assume that your skin is aging well. This is most likely due to a lack of sun damage, as well as hydrated skin. You also probably have your skin care routine down to a T. When your skin looks and feels consistently well hydrated and not dry or itchy, this means you’re doing a good job at moisturizing well after showering or washing your face. Oftentimes, those who have dry skin and experience scaly patches lack hydration, which prevents skin from feeling smooth. When your skin isn’t hydrated, “natural hyaluronic acid, glycosaminoglycans, and other elements of the extracellular matrix can decrease with age, making the skin less hydrated and bouncy,” King explained. If your face is maintaining its facial volume or fat as you age, it’s a very good sign. King says that the factors that largely affect your facial volume are “sun exposure and other extrinsic aging factors, [which] can expedite the loss of healthy elastin fibers in our skin, increasing laxity and decreasing elasticity.” “The collagen scaffolding in our skin provides skin strength and structure,” King added. So, when your facial volume is in good shape, you can guarantee that your skin has healthy collagen and elasticity. These components contribute to skin looking youthful and aging slowly. Moy says that if you have minimal sun spots — those flat, light brown spots on your face — this means that throughout your life, your cumulative sun exposure has been minimal, and you’ve done a great job protecting your skin well. It’s commonly known that the sun is simply not good for your skin. “Daily sun-smart behavior is one of the most important things we can do to help our skin age well,” King explained. So, if you don’t use sun protection while outside, you are more at risk of seeing uneven skin tone and discoloration. “Much of the sun damage that accumulates in our skin is the result of daily incidental sun exposure,” she added. However, if your skin is even toned and there isn’t really any discoloration, this is a sign that your skin is aging in the ideal and healthy way. “Over time, chronic sun exposure can increase dark spots, redness and yellowish discoloration in the skin,” King said. Another culprit of discoloration is blue light from the screens of your phone, TV and other devices. “We’re spending a lot of time on our screens lately, and we’ve learned that blue light can not only affect our sleep and harm our eyes, it can also cause discoloration and aging of our skin,” King explained. You can take precautions by using special products that protect your skin from the effects of blue light and other environmental stressors (like these from Ilia and PCA Skin ). If you’ve abstained from smoking throughout your life, you’ve given your skin the opportunity to age properly and in a healthy way. “Smoking increases fine lines and wrinkles and leads to drier skin and many other complications deeper than the skin,” Moy explained. Smoking can also lead to long-term effects such as uneven skin pigmentation, loss of elasticity and deep facial wrinkles. Some short-term effects of smoking can include yellowing of the fingers and nails and teeth discoloration, which may also make you look older than you are. The American Osteopathic College of Dermatology says, “It is common for the skin of a 40-year-old heavy smoker to resemble that of a 70-year-old nonsmoker.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost These days, it would surprise no one to hear you’re slathering yourself with asparagus extract balm and snail snot serum before bed every night. But no matter how committed you are to the latest and greatest in beauty trends , sometimes the best routines take a cue from old-school tricks of yore. For example, if you ever wondered why your grandma’s hands always seemed so soft, it was probably from donning a pair of white cotton gloves every night — not because she needed to be ready for a 2 a.m. tea party, but because she wore fancy creams under the gloves, letting her skin absorb them completely. We spoke to dermatologists about how and why this routine works, and how to make it work in the 21st century. Your hands can take a beating from weather, regular washing and the frequent use of hand sanitizers. If you have a skin condition like eczema, psoriasis or allergic contact dermatitis, they can become especially dry. It turns out that your hands don’t have much to protect them, unlike other body parts. “The major contributing factor to the hands drying out so easily is the lack of sebaceous glands,” said Dr. Regine Mathieu , a dermatologist . “The sebaceous glands produce a substance called sebum, an oily substance that lubricates the skin and helps it to retain moisture.” “So, the palms of your hands are already susceptible to lack of lubrication,” Mathieu explained. “Once you add in different environmental factors that strip moisture from the skin, they’re even more susceptible [to] dryness.” The cotton glove method beloved by grannies is also one that dermatologists still recommend. “Treating the hands overnight is a great option, because it allows you to soften the skin when you’re not using your hands,” explained dermatologist Dr. Josh Zeichner . “It helps to maximize the effectiveness of moisturizers or emollients to deeply hydrate and repair the skin barrier,” said dermatologist Dr. Lauren Penzi . “Gloves help the emollient to stay on, and wearing them overnight helps to drive the moisturizer deeper into the skin.” “Wearing gloves overnight is one of the most effective ways to boost hydration and support the skin barrier,” said dermatologist Dr. Carolyn Stull . “This can be a helpful technique for those with skin conditions like eczema, as well as for people looking to boost skin hydration and softness.” And there’s a bonus: Your cuticles will love this, too. As dermatologist Dr. Brendan Camp pointed out, “you’ll also be keeping your cuticles moisturized, which prevents the formation of hangnails, which are really just bits of dried-out cuticles that peel back from the skin around your fingers.” There are two things you’ll absolutely need: gloves and a good moisturizer. First, let’s talk gloves. Plain white cotton ones, like these , are just fine. In fact, they may be better than their fancier counterparts. “There are many products on the market advertised as ‘moisturizing gloves,’” Mathieu noted. “I would caution patients to make sure that they’re reading labels for ingredients, to make sure there are no irritants in them.” “You don’t necessarily need special gloves, but it’s important to use cotton gloves that are comfortable to wear throughout the night,” said dermatologist Dr. Hope Mitchell . Whatever you use, don’t keep using the same pair over and over — they need an occasional run through the washer, please. “Dirty gloves could introduce bacteria and potentially lead to irritation or infection,” Mitchell said. Not digging the cotton vibe? “You can use a nitrile glove to provide even more occlusion, but a cotton glove is best for sensitive skin,” advised dermatologist Dr. Blair Murphy-Rose . If you (or your sheets) don’t appreciate occasional goop smears, you can always add a protective layer. “I generally recommend a non-latex glove on top of the cotton one, since the cotton often becomes saturated with the moisturizer and may become sticky,” Zeichner said. You’ll need to use a heavy moisturizer, experts agreed. “Opt for a thick, hydrating formula that contains ingredients known to moisturize and repair the skin barrier,” Mitchell said. Ingredients to look for include petrolatum, petroleum jelly, shea butter, glycerin, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. “Ultimately, choose a cream that suits your skin type and preferences,” she said. “I like Lanolips 101 ointment ,” Zeichner said. “It’s made of naturally derived lanolin, the same ingredient that makes sheeps’ wool waterproof.” Another favorite of many of the dermatologists we interviewed was Eucerin Advanced Repair Hand Cream . Other ointments recommended by the dermatologists include Vaseline Petroleum Jelly , Aquaphor Healing Ointment , Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream and CeraVe Therapeutic Hand Cream . Camp also mentioned Neutrogena Norwegian Hand Cream and Cutemol Moisturizing Cream . Mathieu is a fan of La Roche-Posay Triple Repair Moisturizing Cream . The application process is fairly straightforward, according to Camp. “Soak your hands in lukewarm water for two to three minutes, which saturates the top layer of skin with water,” he said. “Pat your hands dry and apply a thick moisturizing ointment.” “Then put on your gloves, which will improve the penetration of the moisturizer into your skin, keep the moisturizer in place longer, limit the loss of water from the skin, and prevent you from spreading the greasy moisturizer all over your sheets,” he said. As great as this method can be to improve the condition of your hands, there are some caveats to keep in mind. “Be sure to use products that are non-irritating and that you aren’t allergic to,” Murphy-Rose said. “It’s always wise to perform a spot test before using a product overnight under occlusion, which refers to the process of covering skin with things like tape, gloves or impermeable dressings.” “Don’t get cavalier and try this with a retinol or retinoid,” Camp said. “When applied under occlusion, retinols and retinoids can cause more side effects, like skin irritation, redness, peeling and stinging.” Zeichner advised: “For people with a history of skin allergies, I recommend sticking to fragrance-free moisturizers.” As always, your dermatologist knows best. If you have any underlying skin conditions, talk to them first. “If you’re experiencing chronic dry hands, especially if there’s cracking, it’s important to visit a dermatologist for the correct diagnosis,” Mathieu said.

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost Love it or hate it , it looks like shapewear is here to stay. Like the corsets of yore, today’s shapewear is meant to smooth out the body, giving the wearer a more lifted, cinched-in silhouette. Celebrities who’ve posted behind-the-scenes Spanx selfies include Katy Perry, Padma Lakshmi, Karlie Kloss and Chrissy Teigen. The compression and shapewear market size has grown substantially in the last few years. Some market experts predict it will grow from $4.8 billion in 2023 to $5.17 billion in 2024, at a compound annual growth rate of 7.8%. But not everyone’s a fan. “Spanx are a sausage casing that hides your fat in your spleen,” actor and comedian Nancy Lee joked in 2017. (To be fair, shapewear is considerably more comfortable these days.) For years, Spanx was the big name in the game, but Skims , launched by Kim Kardashian in 2019 and marketed as a “solution-oriented” sculpting shapewear, was valued at $4 billion in 2023 . Skims’ latest gamble? Shapewear for guys. (Understandable, given that men’s underwear is a $5.7 billion market , with sales up 2% over the past year, according to Circana consumer tracking data.) In October, the company launched Skims Mens, a lineup that includes briefs, undershirts, boxers and leggings. Prices range from $16 to $54, depending on the item, and the sizes are extensive and body inclusive. “Twenty percent of our traffic, and 10% of our customers, are already men,” Skims co-founder Jens Grede told GQ at the time. “That means we’ve had 50 million men coming to [the] site over the last few months.” “I think men are just as unhappy with their shapes as women are, so I’m not surprised that there is a demand for it among guys.” The company’s initial ad campaign for the line featured high-profile athletes ― soccer star Neymar Jr., the NFL’s Nick Bosa and NBA All-Star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander ― all tugging up their shirts to reveal their Skims. A later ad campaign , featuring megastar singer Usher, catered to girlfriends and wives buying Skims for the men in their lives. Though the ads made a big splash, shapewear for men is actually nothing new. Thirteen years ago, The New York Times’ style section declared that “Men’s ‘Shapewear’ Is a Retail Hit.” “We are selling them as quickly as Spanx can make them,” Nickelson Wooster, then the men’s fashion director at Neiman Marcus, told the Times. Back then, shapewear for men was mostly limited to compression tops or body-skimming shirts that made ample use of elastane, better known as Spandex. (There’s also long been gender-affirming shape and compression wear for trans men, like chest binders .) Today, brands like Under Armour, Leo by Leonisa and Fabletics offer a wide range of items meant to help men smooth out lumps and bumps: bodysuits, vests, padded tank tops and more. The offerings are growing, but the share of sales that men’s shapewear brings in is still comparatively meager, said Kayla Marci, a senior fashion and retail analyst at EDITED , a global retail analytics firm. “Key shapewear players continue to direct assortments towards women, with menswear accounting for only 5% and 10% of ranges at Skims and Leonisa, respectively,” she said. It’s going to be a hard sell to get most men to consider shapewear, said Jennifer Lund Mahoney, a Chicago-based men’s personal stylist and shopper. “I have been in the men’s apparel field for over 20 years and been a stylist for 11 years, and I have only encountered two men that actually had a men’s shapewear shirt,” she told HuffPost. “Neither of them liked it much or wore it regularly.” To counter any male buyer hesitance, Skims has leaned into promoting its men’s line as sporty “activewear,” Marci said: Wear it in the gym or when you want to smooth things out in that tux you’re wearing to your buddy’s wedding. Last year, Skims and the NBA agreed to a multiyear partnership that made Skims the “official underwear partner” of the NBA, the WNBA and USA Basketball. “That, along with the ad campaign featuring Neymar and other athletes, gives the brand a broader reach than traditional ‘shapewear,’” Marci said. Anecdotally, the strategy seems to be effective. On TikTok and YouTube, you’ll find videos of Gen Z-ers giving their impression of Skims , most of them talking about how they wear the products at the gym or while playing basketball. “The reason I got into it was because I saw that they partnered up with the NBA,” said Eugene Kim, who created a Skims try-on video on YouTube for his product review channel Supreme Value. “Then for some reason it sparked me to critically think about my underwear and I realized that I never cared to wear nice quality underwear, so I figured I would give it a try.” “Compression wear is more intimate than outerwear and I think men have been conditioned to not have these concerns about their bodies.” For Kim, it’s not about creating a compressed look ― it’s more about wanting to up his game when it comes to underwear and other basics like T-shirts, sweats and hoodies. “You obviously wear them a lot more, and I see the value in investing in them,” he told HuffPost. John Glaude , a fitness influencer, has used compression wear during his workouts for about 10 years, after he lost more than 150 pounds . “To be able to run and jump without the discomfort of my skin moving around has been a game changer,” he told HuffPost. “I just wear it in the gym, though. I keep it pretty tight, so it would be quite uncomfortable to wear all day.” Glaude wears a compression top and compression shorts or tights whenever he’s running or doing an intense HIIT workout . “I never had any apprehensions about wearing it because it just seemed like a good solution to a problem I had,” he said. Nick Steele, who runs the YouTube channel Fat Guy Reviews, thinks the demand for shapewear ― or at least curiosity about it ― is growing even outside of gym-goers, at least based on his comments and direct messages. “A lot of the comments I get are from guys wondering how it works: Will it help to compress some excess skin they have from rapid weight loss? Will it make them look thinner?” he told HuffPost. For many Americans, the pandemic led to a little extra weight gain ― the COVID 15 , as people jokingly called it ― which exacerbated many guys’ existing body image concerns. Though much of the research on body dissatisfaction focuses on women, some surveys estimate that around 28% of men aged 18 and over regularly struggle with their body image . For women, the ideal is thin or, more recently, “slim thick,” à la the Kardashians. For men, the ideal body tends to be muscular but lean or athletic . Compression wear helps them achieve that look. Steele said he’s had people thank him for demonstrating compression wear in his videos, since up to this point, there’s been very little talk about how shapewear looks on real men, or what your best bet is money-wise. “I think men are just as unhappy with their shapes as women are, so I’m not surprised that there is a demand for it among guys,” Steele said. “Hopefully the more high-profile ad campaigns will take away some of the embarrassment that some men feel about wearing shapewear ― I’m all for that.” Steele bought shapewear to do a review video; he’s not particularly passionate about it himself. He wears his for special occasions and, recently, to fit better into a slightly snug Jedi costume he’s worn for a Comic Con-type event. As for recommendations, he says he generally favors the shirts over the shorts, which tend to roll down when you sit, as any woman who’s worn Spanx will attest. “There is no hiding them after you get up and have to adjust them,” he said. “My fit advice would be to choose a size smaller than your normal shirt size. I’ve tested a few brands and that seems to be the main takeaway. If you always wear a XXL, get an XL compression shirt.” (Be careful with sizing, though: Too-snug shapewear can make it hard to breathe and can even lead to digestive problems like acid reflux.) Lee Massey has been wearing shapewear for about three years, generally when he exercises or if he has to fit into a tuxedo or a suit for formal events. He likes Skims best. Among his guy friends, he’s sensing more interest. “Compression wear is more intimate than outerwear and I think men have been conditioned to not have these concerns about their bodies,” Massey said. He thinks that’s slowly starting to change, though. “I think men are getting into shapewear because the negative connotation or stigma surrounding men entering ‘women’s’ spaces is diminishing greatly,” he said. “I don’t think it puts off losing weight. If anything, it helps me visualize aesthetic goals that I can obtain. I have no complaints.” Negative connotations still exist, though. In Reddit communities centered on men’s fashion and weight loss, the criticism men face when they ask for shape and compression wear recommendations isn’t usually gender-based. Rather, critics in the comments tend to look at shapewear as “a barrier” to losing weight. “If you don’t like the way your body looks, diet and work out,” one person said . “Seems no different than a wonder bra. It’s false advertising,” another wrote . “If you want to be in shape, you have to work it.” Massey and Steele take issue with that argument. They’re still working out ― they just sometimes wear compression wear. “I don’t think it puts off losing weight,” Massey said. “If anything, it helps me visualize aesthetic goals that I can obtain. I have no complaints.” Steele reads that kind of criticism all the time in his YouTube comment section. “People will say, if you just go to the gym or stop eating so much, then you wouldn’t need compression shirts,” he said. “But according to my other comments, that’s not why most guys wear them. It seems like most guys are wearing them to fit into their clothes a bit better, or for pain relief.” “With compression shirts or anything else, I always say that if you’re curious, then give it a shot,” he said.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost When I discovered a pink dress with a lace collar in my storage, I was elated. Upon learning I was having a second child, a girl, I was excited at the opportunity to see some clothes my eldest daughter grew out of too quickly. One particular piece was this Janie and Jack dress that shows off little tiny shoulders and Michelin Man baby biceps. My mom, the hoarder or genius that she is, saved a lot of my own baby clothes, which means my girls are walking around parks in vintage OshKosh B’gosh overalls. Opening bins of clothing I hadn’t seen in a few years was a sweet walk down memory lane. Now that my second daughter is here, it’s even sweeter to see her in clothes her big sister didn’t get dirty. But at times, I can’t help but feel a little bit guilty. Should she have her own sartorial identity outside of Old Navy onesies her sister wore from 2021? Every time she’s in a memorable outfit we say, “We remember when your big sister wore that!” as if she has any idea what it means. Should she have the same treatment as my first child, to be adorned in new clothes specifically picked out for her and her only. On the other hand, there’s a whole additional layer of guilt associated with buying new clothes. Buying an entirely new wardrobe for a tiny person who grows every month is financially and economically irresponsible. Fast fashion is creating waste at a catastrophic speed, “accelerating the pace of climate change” and “contributing to the rapid destruction of our planet,” according to Fast Company . So with the state of the world crumbling because of the accessibility to cheap, semi-low-quality pieces that can be purchased at a moment’s notice, recycling clothes has its own distinct advantage. We reached out to adults who were dressed in hand-me-downs, be it from their older siblings or other older people in their lives. Additionally, we reached out to two licensed psychologists who work closely with children and young adults to explore the potential effects on hand-me-downers. Hand-me-downs evoke a lot of memories for some. Lauren French, a school counselor in Southern California, said her hand-me-downs affected her childhood and her relationship with her sister. “My sister and I are six years apart, which is a lot when you’re young and receiving hand-me-downs. Most of the time, [I felt] annoyed and frustrated about the fact that I was inheriting hand-me-downs because 50% of my life I was called Emily (my sister’s name), 40% of my life I was ‘Emily’s sister,’ which only left with 10% of my life being referred to by my real name. So [my] feelings surrounding hand-me-downs were less so that I was inheriting used or old clothes, but more that I was not my own person.” As the younger sister, French thought maybe inheriting her sister’s clothes meant they could share more time together. “I thought the hand-me-downs would make my sister want to play with me more. Because we were far apart in age, she would never play with me, so if I wore her clothes I remember thinking she’d like my outfit and would then play with me.” And hand-me-downs don’t stop at clothes, French explained. “I also never got to pick out toys/gadgets like a bike or scooter because I would inherit those from her once she grew out of it.” But now, French is singing a different tune when it comes to previously loved pieces. “Now, I love a hand-me-down (as long as it’s in good condition). When [my sister] does a closet clean out, I am right there going through the piles. My mother-in-law and sister-in-law often do closet clean outs and they know to ask me first before donating anything.” Katie Wiggins is a recruiter in Tennessee who grew up with an older brother. “I had an older brother — but having an older sister just seemed so cool. Plus, if I knew it came from my childhood best friend Marea’s older sister Elena, it was pre-vetted and was inherently cool. I was instantly, immediately cooler. Lots of times their parents bought them new Abercrombie from the mall. And the hand-me-downs were often cooler brands and they were ‘pre-approved’ by cool aspirational older girls, so that meant I was cool to wear them and I was cool because they gave them to me.” When it came to inheriting from her brother, her feelings were a little different. “I was super embarrassed! Not that I wanted pink — but I had that feeling that ‘everyone knew’ that they were hand-me-downs.” But any trauma didn’t carry over into adulthood. For Wiggins, she ended up embracing thrifting early in life and developed an aversion to buying new clothes.“Especially now, as a society we’re more environmentally conscious and I feel more aware of the amount of waste that exists in fast fashion. Aside from underwear, some leggings, socks and bras — I get almost every single thing I own secondhand. It really helps that I can do this from the comfort and convenience of my phone, but I’m no stranger to Goodwill. I’ve even convinced my husband of the merits and glory of secondhand shopping.” Rachel McCarron is a therapist in Santa Monica, California, who specializes in working with children, adolescents and young women. “I’ve definitely had clients who have been the recipients of hand-me-downs, and in my experience I’ve never heard kids or their parents identify this as being an area of concern or a trigger for anxiety or shame,” she shared. McCarron suggests that thanks to the increase in popularity, hand-me-downs are now applauded in the realm of thrifting. “My sense is that this, in part, because the proliferation of thrifting and secondhand fashion over the past few years has diminished the social stigma surrounding ‘used clothes’ and hand-me-downs.” And thankfully, because of this, McCarron has seen less pressure on kids to have the latest and greatest, the shiny new toy or, in this case, clothes. Dr. Shira Schuster, a licensed psychologist of Williamsburg Therapy Group , said siblings may even feel closer to one another when sharing clothing. “It can make a younger sibling feel a connection to an older sibling through wearing something the older sibling once did.” And my worries about my youngest not having her own sense of self seems to be not an issue. Schuster said, “Some adults who wore hand-me-down clothing as children might place more emphasis on how they dress as a way to show their individuality or as a way to feel like they ‘finally’ get to wear what they want; many people who wore hand-me-down clothing growing up probably don’t give it much thought as they get older.” So, while I can’t directly ask my 14-month-old what trends she wants to wear, it seems I won’t traumatize her — for now.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Ask any dermatologist about their best advice for healthy, glowy skin , and most would probably answer the following: 1. Regularly wear an SPF 30+ sunscreen and 2. Stay hydrated . While drinking water might be a relatively easy goal for Stanley-toters who always ensure their H2O is close at hand, others may struggle on the hydration front. Maybe you have every intention of switching to water after this one last iced coffee, only to get your fifth or sixth coffee refill of the day (guilty!). Or, as much as you would love to get your recommended number of cups of H2O per day , you simply just can’t stand drinking water— even with every friend, co-worker and family member asking you, “How can you not like the taste of water? It doesn’t taste like anything!” But what does it mean for your skin if you aren’t drinking your water every day? Are there any alternatives to plain, boring water that can help you achieve your skin care goals? With practically every health care professional from every field stressing the importance of staying hydrated, it’s no surprise that drinking water is also critical for maintaining healthy skin. “ Our bodies, and all of the organs within them, require water as an essential nutrient,” said Dr. Angela Casey , an Ohio-based, board-certified dermatologist . “Ionic compounds and solutes dissolve in water, and this process allows for transportation of critical compounds to the cells and structures of the skin. ” While water’s role in aiding in the transportation of compounds aesthetically benefits your skin, it also plays a critical role in maintaining your skin’s overall health. “[When you are hydrated], the skin barrier function is optimized, protecting us from infections and damage from ultraviolet light and pollution,” said Dr. Brooke Jeffy , an Arizona-based board-certified dermatologist. However, when you don’t drink water, the consequences may be much more dire than slightly less-than-ideal-looking skin, particularly in the long term. “When we are dehydrated, our skin’s microbiome becomes imbalanced, and we set the stage for inflammation, injury and damage to our skin,” Casey said. “And the damage that occurs from chronic bad habits (i.e., never drinking water) can be a slow burn that shows up years later. ” So, how much water should you aim to drink for adequate hydration to ensure damage doesn’t sneak up on you years down the line? “A good general rule of thumb is to drink 0.5 [or more] ounces of water per pound [of body weight] per day,” Casey said. However, both Casey and Jeffy point out that the amount of water you need varies greatly on many factors, including how dry or humid your climate is, if higher activity levels make you sweat more, your weight, and any medications you may take. “A great way to be sure you are adequately hydrated is to watch urine color. You want it to be a very light yellow, close to clear,” Jeffy said. While the market offers a plethora of excellent hydrating skin care products , they cannot fully replace the benefits of hydration from water for those who rarely drink it. “ Moisturizing your skin may improve the appearance of the skin, but it can’t replace the functional benefits of adequate amounts of water in your skin cells and skin structures,” Casey explained. Jeffy further explained that blood flow to your cells is also reduced when you are dehydrated. When blood flow is reduced, so is your body’s ability to deliver vital nutrients to your skin’s cells. And unfortunately, for those who are hydrophobic, this is a function that even the most hydrating skin care products just can’t replicate. “ I’m a bit of a purist, so my opinion is that plain water is the gold standard,” Casey shared. “You don’t have to drink plain water, but you do need to make sure that you’re maintaining adequate hydration from other sources.” If plain water simply doesn’t do it for you, whether because of its taste or texture, your next best option for hydration may be to mix it up with a seltzer or an herbal tea. “Seltzers or sparkling waters are nearly equivalent to standard waters in terms of hydration properties,” Casey said. “Herbal teas and waters flavored with fruit placed in the water to render flavor are likewise nearly equivalent to standard water given that these beverages are composed primarily of water. ” Caffeinated beverages like coffee and tea are commonly thought to dehydrate the body due to caffeine’s diuretic effect. However, if you throw back coffee like Lorelai Gilmore, rejoice! Your caffeine addiction may actually bring you closer to your skin care goals than you think (so long as your caffeine addiction is within moderation). “ The diuretic effect of the caffeine in coffee and tea is unlikely to outweigh the hydration benefits of the water within these beverages,” Casey said. “ Caffeine is an antioxidant, so in small amounts, it can be very beneficial to the skin.” Although caffeine can benefit the skin, Casey cautions that caffeine affects individuals differently, so you should watch how caffeine affects you personally. Casey also recommends ingesting no more than 250mg of caffeine daily. But if you regularly take your coffee or tea with sugar, you may be moving further away from your skin care goals. “ The problem with sweetened coffee, tea, juices, sodas and sports drinks is that sugar does harm to our skin by damaging our collagen and elastin, leading to wrinkles and sagging,” Jeffy said. Casey also adds that sugar and other high-glycemic index foods have been linked to acne. “Likewise, inflammatory skin conditions such as rosacea, eczema and psoriasis can be exacerbated by excess sugar intake as might occur from ingestion of juices, sodas, sports drinks, etc,” Casey added. In an attempt to stay hydrated while also cutting down on sugar and calories found in juices and sodas, those in the “watertok” community on TikTok share their “water recipes” using artificially sweetened flavor packets. But if your main goal for staying hydrated is improving your skin, it’s best to avoid this trend. “ I personally steer clear of artificial sweeteners as there is evidence that these too can exacerbate inflammation within the skin, and worsen acne and rosacea,” Casey said. “These ingredients are also linked to insulin resistance, which contributes to poor functioning within the skin.” While having glowy, bouncy skin is a nice confidence boost, achieving your skin care goals shouldn’t be your only reason to stay hydrated ― especially as we move into the hotter months of summer. “Do not just stay hydrated for your skin, but for your entire body. If you are dehydrated, not only will your skin look deflated, dull and work poorly, but you are also putting stress on your heart and kidneys, and negatively affecting your entire body,” Jeffy said.

    "article_content": "On Assignment for HuffPost Every morning, my almost 5-year-old daughter stomps her feet while announcing, “Today, I’m wearing pink.” Despite my confusion about her propensity for the color given my own reluctance to ever wear pink (I’m more of a yellow kind of gal) and my annoyance at having to obey a semi-toddler’s demands while trying to get her to school on time, I must admit that I admire Giordana’s complete devotion to a specific look. Given her age and my motherly sense of overwhelmedness (basically, a perennial state of being), I, in fact, have not done much to foster her sense of fashion throughout her short life. I simply pick the clothes I buy for her and her siblings based on my own likes, price points, their needs and what I have come to notice looks most fitting on them. And yet, Giordana’s daily demands have me wondering: Should I be letting her choose which pants and shirts to purchase to begin with? Is it normal for her to have such strong preferences at the age of 4? Am I to explain to her that wearing the same exact thing every day is not socially acceptable, let alone possible given our current laundry schedule? It turns out that, according to experts, it’s never too early to start giving out proper style etiquette lessons to your offspring and it’s certainly always the right time to allow them to discover their own fashion-related dispositions. “Helping your child to find their own fashion style is a commitment that parents and caregivers have to intentionally make because it requires them to give up some of their control as their child develops their own sense of style,” said clinical child psychologist Tasha M. Brown . The idea is that the more leeway you give your kids to navigate the subject, the more secure they will be about their sense of self. “Let your child choose clothing while offering guidance and feedback,” said Caroline Fenkel , a licensed clinical social worker who has a focus on adolescent mental health care. “Ultimately, letting them express themselves through their fashion choices is essential, and can help build their confidence and sense of identity.” In a way, it’s not about whether I let Giordana pick her leggings but how I respond to her choice — a reaction that will have just as much bearing on her well-being as the fashion statement she opted for. Below, experts share a few tips that will help you navigate the whole process: from what style choices kids should be allowed to make on their own to your reactions to those preferences and more. The sooner you give your kids the liberty to make at least some decisions when it comes to getting dressed, the faster you can set up ground rules. “Give your young child the opportunity to make small choices about their clothing/accessories and how they want to wear their hair,” Brown advised. “As your child gets older, involve them in the decision-making about what types of clothing and accessories you purchase for them.” You may allow little ones to pick their shoes for the day, for example, specifically addressing their schedule as a way to limit their choices. On a school day, you may allow your child to wear whatever sneakers they choose, so long as they are sneakers, explaining that the day’s activities do affect what you wear: You can’t walk around the school in your dressy shoes if you have to attend gym class. Start using this logic early on, and be prepared for the rules to change over time. “With younger children, focus on simple explanations and encouragement,” Fenkel suggested. “As they grow older, involve them more in discussions about style and encourage critical thinking about their choices.” It’s important to note that, as kids grow, not only will they understand more complicated discussions regarding style and expression but their own sense of fashion will naturally shift. “Regardless of age, emphasize the importance of self-expression and individuality in fashion choices,” Fenkel said. “Help them understand that it’s OK to experiment and make mistakes.” According to experts, the key to a peaceful process (or a semblance of one) involves actually talking through the choices: not just what we’re getting dressed for in the morning but why certain looks might be more appropriate than others. If, as a caregiver, you’re willing to be open and honest in such discussions, the likelihood of your children responding in a similar way will be higher. Finding it hard to position yourself correctly? Consider some open-ended questions, Fenkel suggested, like “How do you feel in that outfit?” or “Have you considered trying this instead?” “Focus on how the clothes make them feel rather than how they make them look,” Fenkel said. Brown similarly talked about the process. “I encourage parents to praise their children’s efforts and decisions,” she noted. “For example, [try saying] ‘I love how you styled your outfit this morning’ or ‘You are doing such a great job getting dressed in the morning’ or ‘The way you choose to wear your hair this morning really shows off your personality.’” While you’re finding the right way to talk about fashion with your child, keep in mind there are some words to stay away from. “If you are committed to helping your child develop their own sense of style, it is important to avoid phrases that are really going to discourage your child from making decisions about how they present themselves,” Brown said. “Therefore, it is important for parents to be mindful of the language they use as they participate in the process of their child getting dressed.” Among the phrases to avoid, Brown mentions: “You have no sense of style,” “That doesn’t look good,” or “You don’t know what you’re doing.” Fenkel takes it a step further, warning caregivers about reinforcing stereotypes while approaching the topic. According to the expert, parents should stay away from phrases like “Boys don’t wear pink” or “Girls should wear dresses.” In short: Asking a child about their choices might work better than instantly commenting on them. Giordana and I have come to a mutual understanding of sorts: She (mostly) gets to pick what to wear each day based on a set of options that I lay out in the morning. That doesn’t always work. Some mornings, she’ll renounce all the outfits I picked, declaring the lot of them to be unsuitable. Other days, though, she’ll specifically ask me to offer her a range of possibilities. According to the experts, that’s a pretty standard routine and one that may benefit children in the long run. “When it comes to getting dressed daily, I very often encourage parents to present their child with two to three options of things that they can choose from,” Brown said. “When children are able to make a decision that is accepted by their caregivers, it helps them to develop a sense of pride in their decision-making skills and increases their self esteem. This can serve them well in various parts of their day, not just in their style development.” By limiting kids’ choices but still giving them the agency to make some sort of decision, caregivers will actually help little ones develop a stronger sense of self and, hopefully, style. “Offering a few options allows your child to make choices within a framework, fostering independence while still providing guidance,” Fenkel agreed. “If they prefer a different outfit after initially choosing one, allow them to switch without making a fuss. This shows that you respect their decisions and will enable them to explore their preferences.” The idea of freedom of choice through alternatives may even be applied before the process of getting dressed, said Fenkel. She suggested that visiting thrift stores together or looking through magazines and style videos might help a child understand more about how fashion choices are usually carried out — and may help you purchase clothing that you know your kids will actually wear.

    "article_content": "Writer Moms are chefs, coaches, chauffeurs, playmates, confidants, medics, monster-slayers and personal assistants — and because so much of this work is done on the feet, they must be protected at all costs. Dr. Kristy Golden , a mother of four and a podiatric surgeon at Kaiser Permanente in Largo, MD, knows how important it is to select the right footwear. She looks for factors like good arch support, a wide and deep toe box, and shoes that bend at the toes are important for comfort and foot health. Moreover, she hears from many moms who find that shoes that worked for them pre-pregnancy may not be practical or comfortable after having kids. “The hormone relaxin, which circulates during pregnancy, [loosens] the ligaments in the arches,” causing them to lower, Golden said. Many people also experience an increased shoe size during pregnancy because their feet may widen. “These changes related to pregnancy are often permanent,” and may require different types of shoes “to prevent pain and discomfort,” she explained. As a result, the first thing you may want to do after having kids is reassess your shoe size. When it comes to shoes to avoid, Golden said, “Moms should be cautious with shoes that lack structural support, such as ballet flats or very flat sandals” because “these types often offer minimal arch support, which is crucial for maintaining foot health.” Golden also said that “heels and wedges are generally not the best choice,” for active mothers due to “due to the increased risk of discomfort and instability.” But this doesn’t mean mom-shoes need to be frumpy. “Regardless of style, a shoe should provide a snug but comfortable fit, adequate arch support, and a sole with enough thickness and tread to prevent slipping,” Golden recommended. She added that “a heel height of approximately a half-inch to 1 inch” is a good idea, “as this slight elevation helps in distributing pressure evenly, which can alleviate stress on the Achilles tendon and the arch.” Golden recommends visiting The American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) website to find a list of footwear that has received the APMA Seal of Acceptance . We rounded up some tried-and-true shoes that work well for moms in all stages of motherhood, based on the guidance above.

Thanks to a variety of factors like aging, weight loss and sun damage, skin can adopt a similar texture, especially on areas like the neck. We corresponded with dermatologists who revealed that anyone wishing to regain a little more hydration, elasticity and smoothness in their neck skin can do so with products and ingredients that are widely available online. According to Dr. Navin Arora , a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Borealis Dermatology in New York, once you do find the right product cocktail for you and your skin, consistency is key. “Regular use of skin care products that target skin elasticity and hydration can not only minimize the appearance of existing crepey skin but also strengthen the skin barrier against environmental stressors,” he said.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. If you’ve ever dutifully shampooed your hair only to be met with greasy roots and flaky strands post-shower, you feel my pain. I hate the feeling of oily hair and itchy dandruff, so whenever shampoo day fails to actually clean my hair, I’m equal parts frustrated and uncomfortable. Recently, I found myself dealing with more scalp buildup and flakiness than normal and decided I needed to bring in extra reinforcement, so to speak. On the advice of the internet and TikTok, I decided to try out the viral Heeta shampoo scrubber and scalp massager , which reviewers describe as “ worth every penny and then some ” and “ a revelation .” With over 100,000 5-star ratings and an under-$10 price tag, I figured I had nothing to lose — and I doubted that many 5-star reviews could really be wrong. It did the trick. Its silicone bristles are gentle on the scalp — including particularly sensitive scalps, according to reviewers — while getting deep into hair’s roots to cleanse grease, buildup and flakes. I find that the scrubber is much better at cleaning my hair than when I just use my fingers to massage my shampoo in: Its flexible, evenly spaced bristles tackle dirt and dandruff the way only a specially designed tool can, plus I’m able to scrub for longer since my hands don’t get tired, leaving my roots extra (blissfully) clean. This is probably also thanks to the tool’s ergonomic design, which makes holding the scrubber actually comfortable. Experts also approve of the benefits of a scrubber like this one. Los Angeles-based trichologist Anna Asarte previously told HuffPost that a scalp massage can actually have an impact on your scalp’s health, helping “ stimulate blood flow and nourish the hair follicles” — and mentioned that a scalp brush with soft, rounded bristles like this one could do the trick. (Your fingertips can also suffice.) Best of all, this is a truly quick fix; the scrubber adds only about 10 seconds to my shower routine. This is especially great since I find that whenever I do skip this 10-second step, I’m more prone to flakiness and greasy buildup. It’s pretty easy to convince myself to stick to this step, since I gain no time — only oiliness and dandruff — by skipping it. I would also be remiss not to mention the sweet massage this scrubber provides. Its gentle silicone bristles massage hair’s roots the way you’ll only get at a salon . Reviewers love this feature, saying it’s soothing and feels amazing , plus helps relieve itchiness . I use mine on wet hair, but you can also use it on dry hair to help redistribute oils and soothe itchiness. It’s designed for all hair lengths and hair types, including thick and thin strands, long and short cuts and straight hair and curls. The scrubber comes in 23 colors, so you can pick the one that best fits your aesthetic and your bathroom. (I own the turquoise style .) Grab one from Amazon now , or check out what reviewers have to say: “ I thought this was just a scalp massager but it’s so much more!!! I use this when I shampoo and it allows you to get such a better, deeper clean for your hair!!! You know how after you go to the salon and your hair stays clean for so much longer?? Yeah this is a tool that will allow the same thing to happen as it acts like a stylist’s massaging fingers on your scalp/through your hair! My shampoos last days longer than without using this tool! Get it - you won’t regret it!!!” — Christy Garner “ I was skeptical about the need for this, but I’m in love! As a woman with long and thick hair, shampooing and conditioning is always such a chore. This brush provides a soothing scalp massage and helps eliminate tangles! Highly recommend to anyone looking to elevate their hair care game. ” — Amazon Customer “I recently stumbled upon the HEETA Hair Scalp Massager during my deep dive into Korean hair care routines, and it’s been a revelation. I can’t believe I went so long without one. Not only is it affordably priced, but the quality is also impressive. Using it to massage my scalp while washing my hair has turned into a part of my routine that I look forward to— it feels amazing. Despite having pretty small hands, I find it easy to use and hold onto , which was a concern of mine initially. For anyone on the fence about trying a scalp massager, I’d say go for it. This little tool has made a significant difference in how I care for my hair and scalp , making the whole process more enjoyable and effective. Definitely a purchase I don’t regret.” — Jae “ I purchased this unsure if I was going to like it. I imagined the rubber bristles to pull at my long hair but I was wrong! This is the most amazing product. It cleans my scalp so well and feels like a great head massage! It fits so comfortably in your hand as well. My husband is obsessed. I would even consider buying as a gift for others because of how great it is.” — Aubrie Buell “First time using this was amazing, I use it every wash now. Usually my hair would have residue or dandruff or even didn’t look of feel clean once my hair dried. My first use I can feel the difference. I always thought it was the shampoo and conditioner I was using but this brush proved me wrong. Buy it. You will not regret it” — E.G “ Everytime you brush with this hair scalp massager, your scalp will feel renewed. Use it in the shower to massage with shampoo on, use it daily if you have a dry scalp and itch- it will relieve the itch , and the styling is ike you just left the hair salon. I can’t say enough about this little scrubber ; it is better than any hair brush I ever had , good for both women and men. Treat yourself!” — Lydia F.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Lying on the beach or poolside striving to get a golden tan may be one of your favorite summer activities — even though you probably know getting too much sun is risky, especially if you don’t take the right precautions. While dermatologists urge caution about spending time in the sun, they recognize that people are still likely going to sunbathe. About two-thirds of Americans said they got a tan last year, and many incorrectly believe a base tan will prevent sunburns and that tanning is safe as long as you don’t burn, according to a new American Academy of Dermatology survey . “Regardless of past sunburns, the fact that ultraviolet light causes skin cancer, including melanoma, people are still going to sunbathe this summer,” said Dr. Hope Mitchell , an Ohio-based board-certified dermatologist. “It’s crucial to recognize these risks and others that are related to sunbathing.” Even short periods of sun exposure and minor sunburns can add up over time and damage your skin, she said. Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the U.S., dermatologist Dr. Elizabeth Hale , senior vice president of the Skin Cancer Foundation , told HuffPost. It can affect anyone of any skin tone, and it’s often diagnosed in later stages in people with darker skin, according to the American Academy of Dermatology . However, skin cancer is preventable, Hale said. “It’s easy to apply a sunscreen you like, stay in the shade as much as possible, and enjoy the summer with peace of mind.” As you plan your next beach trip, here’s what you should know about how bad sunbathing truly is and the best way to protect your skin as you spend time outdoors. Basking in the sun can stimulate the brain’s pleasure center and trigger the release of endorphins, also known as “feel-good hormones,” explained Dr.Carmen Castilla , a board-certified dermatologist at New York Dermatology Group. “People can actually become addicted to the sun.” But when your skin is exposed to the sun, it absorbs ultraviolet radiation, Mitchell said. This damages the DNA in your skin cells, which speeds up the aging process, leading to wrinkles and sun spots and increasing your risk for skin cancer. Melanin, a chemical that produces pigment in your skin, protects against UV damage, Castilla said. So when your skin tans in the sun, it’s actually a sign that the skin is trying to protect itself from further UV damage. “But it’s a flawed defense mechanism that ultimately puts your skin health at risk,” Mitchell said. “While a tan might give you a temporary glow, it’s not worth the long-term consequences.” UV radiation is a known carcinogen , and overexposure is what causes skin cancer, Hale said. “We know that getting five or more sunburns doubles your risk for melanoma,” a dangerous form of skin cancer, she added. Melanoma is considered more dangerous because it can easily spread to other organs if it’s not treated early. Castilla said there’s a misconception that because people with darker skin tones have higher amounts of melanin, they don’t develop skin cancer or get sunburned. “This is entirely not true,” she emphasized. Anyone, no matter their skin tone, is at risk for skin cancer or sunburns from sun exposure. There’s been lots of talk about vitamin D lately, as many Americans have a vitamin D deficiency, research shows. While sunlight is a natural source of vitamin D, dermatologists say spending time in the sun isn’t the most effective way to increase your intake of the vitamin. And you should never forgo sunscreen. Research shows that wearing sunscreen likely doesn’t interfere with the skin’s vitamin D production. Always approach sun exposure with skin cancer prevention in mind, Hale emphasized. The American Academy of Dermatology Association ( AAD ) doesn’t recommend relying on the sun or indoor tanning to get vitamin D. Instead, the organization suggests food sources , such as dairy and fish, or supplements to increase your intake. If a “sun-kissed glow” is your goal, Mitchell suggests a sunless tanning option, including spray tans and self-tanners. “These products provide a bronzed look without exposing your skin to harmful UV radiation,” she said. Self-tanning products with dihydroxyacetone (DHA) or erythrulose react with the top layer of skin to temporarily tan the skin, Castilla said. Some are labeled “gradual tan,” which means they contain lower concentrations of these substances and let you build color, she added. Look for products that “prioritize skin health, since moisturized, smooth skin will look the best,” Hale said. She suggests items containing natural oils and hyaluronic acid. Be sure to follow the directions on the product for the best results, Mitchell said. “When it comes to chilling by the pool or soaking up some extra sunshine outdoors, it’s all about balance and protection,” Mitchell said. That starts by wearing a generous amount of sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher, she said. Look for sunscreens that offer broad-spectrum protection, which means they guard against both UVA and UVB rays, Hale added. Don’t forget to smear sunscreen on the tops of your ears, back of your neck, bottoms of your feet, or any other area that’s exposed to the sun, Castilla said. “There’s nothing worse than walking on sunburned feet.” Reapply sunscreen at least every two hours or more frequently if you’re swimming, sweating or towel-drying your skin, Mitchell said. Along with sunscreen, take breaks in the shade and wear sun-protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses, Hale said. And drink plenty of water. “Lastly, give your skin some love by checking for any changes regularly,” Mitchell said. “Your skin is your body’s largest organ, so treating it with care and protection is paramount for overall health and well-being.” Want to protect yourself?

    "article_content": "Writer Teens and their parents will inevitably disagree about many things, from curfew to allowance. Another common point of conflict is clothing, especially when a teen’s aesthetic is more revealing than parents would like. Some parents would like their teens to dress more modestly. Others don’t mind bare skin but are concerned about their child’s well-being and how others might perceive them. “It’s still a sad reality that what people wear can bring bad attention,” said Rudy Hernandez , a mental health therapist at Kaiser Permanente in California. “As a parent, we have an instinct to protect them from reputational, verbal and possible emotional abuse” they may encounter if they wear barely there clothing, he explained. Although it may be difficult for parents to keep their thoughts about skimpy clothing to themselves, Hernandez advises parents “to try their best to not criticize or judge the teen for their clothing choices.” Instead, he recommended that parents have “a broader conversation about style and what they’re hoping to get across.” Asking questions in a nonjudgmental way can open up a dialogue. Parents can ask, “Why do you want to wear that?” or “What sort of statement are you hoping to send with your clothing?” and pay close attention to the answers, Hernandez advised. There may be many valid reasons teens want to wear skimpy clothing, explained Caroline Fenkel , a mental health expert and chief clinical officer at Charlie Health. “Clothing can be a form of self-expression for teens, allowing them to explore their identity and individuality,” she said. It can also give them a confidence boost if they “feel more confident and empowered when wearing clothing that they feel comfortable and attractive in,” she said. Additionally, certain clothing can lead to greater acceptance among peers. “Wearing clothing similar to that of peers can help teens feel like they belong and fit in with their social group,” Fenkel said. After listening to your teen’s reasons for wanting to dress the way they do, parents can lead into a discussion of the dangers of wearing revealing clothing. Many parents are concerned that “certain clothing may attract unwanted attention or harassment, potentially compromising the teen’s safety,” Fenkel explained, and that certain clothing may lead to conflicts with others in the teen’s life who don’t approve of their clothing choices. When parents let teens know that they are trying to protect them rather than control them, they may be more receptive to their parents’ message, Hernandez said. Parents should also be honest if they are not ready to see their children dress in such a grown-up manner, he said. “We live in a very difficult and frightening time. Gone are the days of just ‘stranger danger.’ Kids are being stalked online, tracked in person, and manipulated on a global level,” Hernandez said. While clothing isn’t solely responsible, it can play a role in attracting unwanted attention. “I always suggest providing actual proof that there are inappropriate people out there watching and videotaping such outfits and trying to post them online,” he said. This is important because “due to the adolescents’ development, they think it’s unlikely for bad things to happen to them,” explained Traci Williams , a child and family psychologist . Most teens experience a temporary stage of development called egocentrism, during which they “perceive themselves as invincible,” Williams said. According to Williams, this is “a normal part of adolescents’ cognitive development” that “results in teens inaccurately assessing possible risks.” Parents shouldn’t expect teens to see their point of view immediately. “Teens push boundaries and push dialogue and want to prove a point,” Hernandez said. Sharon Van Epps found this to be true when talking to her now-20-year-old daughter about revealing clothing when she was a teen. “She told me my reaction was ‘anti-feminist,’” Van Epps said. In response, Van Epps told her daughter that “we live in the unfair real world,” although she understood her daughter’s position. According to therapist Carl Nassar , teens may also value independence over common sense. “Teens want a growing level of independence from parents, so they will, in general, ask for control over almost everything in their lives, including clothing choices, even when it’s to their own detriment,” he said. No matter what parents might be thinking, “telling your child they look ‘horrible’ or ‘trampy’ will cause hurt feelings, pain and trauma, which may cause them to criticize their own body,” Hernandez said. Telling teens they are “bad” because of what they want to wear can hurt their self-esteem, he added. Additionally, parents should remain calm no matter how upset they feel about their teen’s choice of clothing. “ We can usually get our point across if we display love and concern without shaming or yelling,” Hernandez advised. Even if parents strongly oppose their teens’ clothing choices, Nassar advises against implementing an outright ban. “A hard ‘no’ often creates compliance at home and rebellion outside of the home,” he explained. To get around the rule, teens may sneak around and change into skimpy clothing once they are out of view. Instead, Nassar advises reaching a compromise. “ Examples of compromise might be the teen avoiding a specific sort of clothing that makes the parent most anxious” or limiting the number of days each week a teen wears revealing clothing, Nassar said. Hernandez also encourages parents to “discuss alternatives” with their teens such as wearing bike shorts under short skirts or a bandeau bra under a low-cut shirt. Van Epps decided to compromise with her daughter by focusing “on dressing appropriately for the occasion.” For example, she encouraged her daughter to dress more conservatively for family events and at school but was more lenient at home and on weekends. Clothing can give teens “the agency to share their body on their terms,” Williams said. Choosing what to wear is an important part of adolescent development and part of how “teens create their sense of identity,” she explained. However, “if the clothing puts the teen at risk of harassment or other dangers, parental intervention may be necessary,” Fenkel said. Ultimately, “parents are responsible for setting boundaries and guidelines, including rules about clothing choices,” she said. However, any rules around clothing “should be reasonable and explained to the teen,” she said. If parents allow their teens to wear revealing clothing, they should teach their children to “be vigilant” of their surroundings so they are aware if someone is watching or filming them, Hernandez suggested. Whether or not teens wear skimpy clothing, they will probably receive “unwanted attention” at some point, Williams said. “This can be a learning opportunity for teenagers, and parents can help facilitate by asking how they felt and creating solutions for handling similar future situations,” she said. Part of that discussion can be the role revealing clothing played in the incident. Even if parents are more permissive at home, school dress codes may dictate that kids cover up on school grounds. Jillian Amodio , a licensed social worker and mother to a teenage daughter, buys her daughter crop tops with the understanding that she won’t wear them to school because they would violate her school’s dress code. She follows through with consequences for noncompliance. “I’ll be the first to admit that I’m not a fan of dress codes. But I am a fan of respect. And we don’t always have to agree with the rules of an establishment but we can still respect their existence,” Amodio said. When Amodio’s daughter got in trouble for wearing crop tops to school in violation of both the school’s rules and her mother’s, Amodio confiscated the shirts for two weeks. She then gave her daughter the “opportunity to prove that she can handle making her own clothing choices responsibly.” Amodio explained that she ultimately returned the shirts to her daughter because “the clothing is not the problem, the choices are.” Parents need to accept that having children means not agreeing with all of their decisions. “Ultimately, your teen will make decisions that you may not be aware of” or agree with, Williams said. “Having to relinquish some of your control can be a difficult part of parenting,” she added.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost We’ve all purchased something impulsively online. The decision was likely triggered by a message telling you the item was the last one in stock, or because a retailer offered free shipping if you added one more thing to your order. It’s common for online retailers to use these kinds of tactics to encourage you to buy in the moment and spend more, with the goal of increasing revenue, explained Lennart Baardman , assistant professor of technology and operations at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. “Generally, that comes from increasing demand.” One way retailers increase demand is by appealing to shoppers’ emotions. This includes using discounts or low-stock alerts to create a sense of urgency or fear of missing out (FOMO) that encourages you to react quickly and purchase, said Gary Reichmuth , associate professor of instruction in executive education at the University of Texas at Dallas’ Naveen Jindal School of Management. “It’s the value perception — if they feel that there’s just a few left, there’s that exclusivity that they’re getting something special,” he told HuffPost. “If there’s a run on products, then there’s social proof, a belief that if other people are buying it, it must be good.” If you tend to buy things you don’t want or need or overspend, here’s what you should know about the strategies retailers use to encourage impulsivity, why the tactics work, and how to avoid falling into the trap. An analysis of 200 online retailers by researchers at the University of Michigan School of Information found that they used an average of 19 features to encourage impulse buying. (Large retailers, like Target.com and Amazon .com, included more than 30.) These features included discounts, low-stock messages, countdown clocks and more. Here’s a look at some of the most common tactics online retailers use to encourage you to buy. More than 80% of consumers say they’re more likely to purchase something when they have a coupon or discount, according to a 2022 survey by Wildfire Systems. Offering a percentage off a purchase or free shipping for spending over a certain amount can help retailers sell more items quickly, Baardman explained. While these offers can be costly for retailers, the companies still usually come out ahead if people are buying many more of the discounted items. “It counteracts that loss in revenue from the discount itself,” he said. Brands also often offer discounts in exchange for you signing up for email or text alerts or a loyalty program. This enables companies to collect data about your preferences and shopping habits so they can offer product recommendations and personalized offers, explained John Talbott , director of the Center for Education and Research in Retail at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business. Low-stock messages create a sense of urgency, Reichmuth said. “Retailers are trying to make you make a quick decision, not comparison shop.” Baardman said this strategy often works well for airlines and hotels, when consumers are told there’s one ticket or room left at that rate. It speeds up the decision-making process. For products, he said, consumers might not feel as much urgency, as they could check other websites or wait in case the retailer restocks. Whether an item truly is the last one in stock is difficult to say, but Baardman said most reputable retailers are likely being truthful. Giving consumers the opportunity to upgrade an airline seat or buy a premium product for a small percentage more, which is known as upselling, is another way retailers drive sales, Reichmuth said. Other strategies include cross-selling (where they offer a related product at a discounted rate, such as a camera bag if you buy a camera) and bundling, where a discount is offered if you buy multiple related items, he added. “The whole intent is to get you to spend more to increase your average order value,” Reichmuth said. These approaches also help retailers move large volumes of products quickly and increase consumer demand, Baardman added. This might be necessary if they have too much stock and need to reduce inventory costs. Many consumers browse e-commerce sites and add products to their shopping carts, but don’t complete their purchases. Online shopping cart abandonment rates average about 70% , according to the Baymard Institute. To get shoppers to return and check out, many retailers send cart-reminder messages via email or text message. This strategy has been shown to increase sales . “Customers get reminded that they were shopping with you,” Baardman said. It instills a sense of urgency and scarcity and makes shoppers feel valued. “Shopping is a complex activity and the decision-making process by consumers is not straightforward and linear,” Talbott said. “Many factors play into a decision to purchase or not.” Often, emotions drive shopping decisions, especially impulse purchases, research shows. Discounts, cart reminders, and other strategies tap into consumers’ FOMO, scarcity mindsets, feelings of accessing something exclusive, and social proof (the idea of wanting something because others have it), Reichmuth said. “All these psychological aspects make people more likely to buy,” he said. The sentiments may also cause someone to “short circuit any comparison shopping or evaluation” that would help avoid impulse buying. Each time a customer engages with one of these tactics, it’s also a chance for retailers to collect more data about them, which they can use to further encourage shoppers to buy, Baardman added. “It allows them to understand their price sensitivities, what types of products customers should be recommended, and how they can personalize the promotions to this customer so that maybe if they give them a 10% discount on this specific product, then they might buy it,” Baardman explained. But, encouraging impulse buys can sometimes backfire for retailers, such as by increasing return rates, Talbott said. There’s also the environmental impact of shipping and processing returns. It’s easy to get caught up in FOMO, buy too many things, and spend too much. If you want to avoid it, first recognize that retailers are using strategies designed to get you to buy impulsively, Reichmuth said. “They are not trying to rip us off, necessarily,” Baardman said. “They’re just trying to get us to buy more to make more money.” Then, experts suggest these tips for avoiding the traps: It may be easier said than done, but Baardman said, “If you’re going to buy something, think about, ‘Do I actually want this item or do I need this item?’” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

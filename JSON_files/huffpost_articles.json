In a wide-ranging interview with Variety , Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams say they’ve missed out on profits from the original movie, which raked in a reported $248 million at the box office worldwide. Given the film’s then-unique faux documentary conceit, none of the three actors were able to benefit from its unexpected success, and are now seeking residuals and “meaningful consultation” on future projects that use their names and likenesses. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “I’m very grateful for what I have now and how fucking hard I fought to get it. But it still impacts me,” Williams told the publication. “Giant corporations don’t care that this happens to young artists. It’s bullshit. And that’s got to change somehow. Hopefully, we will help somebody to see: Don’t do what we did.” Added Leonard: “I don’t need Lionsgate to like me. I don’t care that they know that I think their behavior has been reprehensible. I don’t want my daughter to ever feel like anything is more valuable than her self-worth.” The trio’s remarks come just months after Lionsgate honored the 25th anniversary of “The Blair Witch Project” by announcing plans for a big-screen revival. The new film will be produced by Jason Blum, whose work includes the “Paranormal Activity” and “Halloween” franchises, and is intended to “reintroduce this horror classic for a new generation,” according to Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chair Adam Fogelson. Written and directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez, the original “Blair Witch Project” follows three student filmmakers (played by Donahue, Leonard and Williams) who hike into Maryland’s Black Hills with the aim of making a documentary about a local myth known as the “Blair witch.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); From left: \"Blair Witch Project\" actors Joshua Leonard, Heather Donahue and Michael C. Williams in 1999. Ron Galella, Ltd. via Getty Images The group goes missing without a trace, though their abandoned film equipment is discovered a year later. The big-screen film was supposed to be a compilation of that “found footage.” When Artisan Entertainment ― now a subsidiary of Lionsgate ― picked up “The Blair Witch Project” for distribution, Donahue, Leonard and Williams were barred from attending its Cannes Film Festival premiere or participating in interviews in order to maintain the illusion of the movie being a true story. None of the actors had union representation when “The Blair Witch Project” was released. Although the movie was a critical and commercial hit, they said many casting directors assumed they’d just played themselves, given that their real names were used for their on-screen characters. In her chat with Variety, Donahue says she had an epiphany when “The Blair Witch Project” passed the $100 million mark at the box office, and she and her co-stars were sent a fruit basket. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “That was when it became clear that, wow, we were not going to get anything,” she recalled. “We were being cut out of something that we were intimately involved with creating.” In 2000, Donahue, Leonard and Williams collectively sued Artisan as a sequel, “ Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 ,” was being rolled out. About four years later, they were able to reach a settlement for about $300,000 that would be paid to each of them over several years. As part of the settlement, however, Artisan “can’t use our names and images to make money for themselves anymore,” Leonard told Variety. But, Donahue added: “They keep doing it anyway.” In response to the actors’ claims, the directors and producers of “The Blair Witch Project” issued a joint statement to Variety saying they were “hopeful Heather, Joshua and Mike find a satisfying conclusion to their conversations with Lionsgate.” “For us, this anniversary provides an exciting opportunity to celebrate the movie and its legacy with fans,” the statement continued.

Rita reached the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) summit at 7:49 a.m., according to Khim Lal Gautam, a government official at the base camp. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); His first ascent of this year’s climbing season was on May 12 guiding foreign clients. “He is in good health and happy to have achieved this record,” said Mingma Sherpa of the expedition Seven Summits Treks, which organized the expedition. They were able to briefly speak to him while he was on the summit and was in good health condition, Mingma said. Rita was still descending to the lower camps on the mountain, and Mingma confirmed Rita would not be climbing again this season and likely would travel home in the next few days. He also climbed Mount Everest twice last year , setting the record for most climbs of the world’s highest mountain on the first and extending it less than a week later. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); His closest competitor for the most climbs of Mount Everest is fellow Sherpa guide Pasang Dawa, who has 27 successful ascents of the mountain. Rita first climbed Everest in 1994 and has been making the trip nearly every year since. He is one of many Sherpa guides whose expertise and skills are vital to the safety and success each year of foreign climbers who seek to stand on top of the mountain. His father was among the first Sherpa guides. In addition to his Everest climbs, Kami Rita has scaled several other peaks that are among the world’s highest, including K2, Cho Oyu, Manaslu and Lhotse. Officials said more than 450 climbers have already scaled Mount Everest from the Nepali side of the peak in the south this climbing season, which ends in a few days. Most climbing of Everest and nearby Himalayan peaks is done in April and May when weather conditions are most favorable. Nepalese authorities issued hundreds of climbing permits to foreign climbers this season, and at least as many local Sherpa guides were accompanying them.

The official Xinhua news agency reported 70-year-old Wang Jian reached the summit Tuesday, becoming the oldest Chinese person to do so. Everest was first climbed in 1953 by New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepali Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.

The phenomenon, dubbed “shrinkflation,” is gaining more notice even as conventional inflation has come down appreciably from the heights seen in 2022 and 2023. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) has a bill aimed at fighting shrinkflation , and President Joe Biden released a Super Bowl YouTube ad calling on companies to “put a stop to this.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Groundwork Collaborative, a group of left-leaning economists, issued a study Wednesday finding that shrinkflation played a substantial role in inflation between the years 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic began, and 2023, after most businesses had returned to normal. “While shrinkflation is not new, it is arguably the most deceptive pricing practice companies use and has come under renewed scrutiny as Americans face grocery prices 25% higher than prior to the pandemic,” Lindsay Owens, executive director for Groundwork and the author of the study, wrote. “We find that as much as 10% of inflation in key product categories can be attributed to shrinkflation.” Owens cited tracking by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 10% figure. The BLS checks the prices on thousands of items each month to compile its Consumer Price Index, the most widely known measure of the pace of price increases, or inflation. While most of the CPI simply consists of tracking price movements for specific items, the bureau also tracks when companies change their formulations or packaging, to ensure it does not miss the inflation that occurs when a company, for example, charges the same price for six-pack of soda but reduces the size of each can by half an ounce. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Citing BLS data, the Groundwork study said that household paper products, a category that would include toilet paper and paper towels, had 10.3% of its nearly 35% price increase between 2019 and 2023 come from shrinkflation. Another category, snacks, saw 9.8% of its inflation over that period attributable to shrinkflation. The report noted other categories where shrinkflation contributed significantly to overall inflation: household cleaning products (7.3% due to shrinkflation), coffee (7.2%) and candy and chewing gum (7%). The report also included examples of companies using shrinkflation and related strategies to boost corporate bottom lines. In one instance, the CEO of a major toilet paper maker was reported to have said on a quarterly financial reporting call that consumers were unlikely to change their buying habits even if they realized they were paying more for less. “If the price goes up on bath tissue, generally doesn’t mean you’re going to use the bathroom less, right? And so, I think we do operate in essential categories that have less elasticity,” the CEO said, according to the report.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer Back in 2014, I stood proudly on the New York Stock Exchange podium with my Care.com colleagues, making history as the seventh female founder to take her company public. It was a high point in my career after years of perseverance. B eing a woman of color, an immigrant, and eventually a female founder primarily focused on serving women, I faced expectations and stereotypes at every turn. Here are three key pieces of advice that I learned along the way. Letting go of expectations can unleash your strongest, most authentic self. We encounter our first gender-based stereotypes early in our lives. Growing up in the Philippines in the ’70s and ’80s, I often fell short of the expectation that girls should be passive, pleasing and perfect. (I call these the three P’s that plague me and so many Asian women into adulthood.) Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); My parents also had plans for me and my five siblings: Each of us had a designated profession. Imagine my parents’ surprise when I got pregnant in 1991 after my sophomore year at Mount Holyoke — a major detour on the road to becoming the lawyer they wanted. But even though I seemed to have a knack for flouting expectations, I still cared deeply about what others thought of me. I became determined to succeed even as I juggled my new role as a young wife and mother and completed not only my BA but also my JD/MBA. As I began my career, I often lied by omission about my family in job interviews so no one could question my dedication. I couldn’t hide the fact that I was a woman of color, but I could hide the fact that I was a mom. I didn’t want to be underestimated and dismissed. I was determined to look and act the part of a young, hungry go-getter whose only focus was to win. Soon, I realized that what I felt were my vulnerabilities were actually my superpowers. I used my intuition and experiences as a woman and mother to create Care.com. When I got to where I needed to be, I prioritized creating a work environment where no one felt the need to lie by omission about their families as I had done, a place where everyone could bring their whole self to work. Cultivating empathy toward others will foster more joy in your interactions and create powerful connections. By the early 2000s, I was a young VP on the management team at UPromise—a consumer rewards program that helped families save for college. Ryan, my first child, was now a teenager. This was a rocky time in my life. I built up very high expectations for everyone — my team at work and my family at home. At times, I treated them similarly to how my parents treated me. And when they didn’t meet those expectations, I struggled. I had given Ryan little choice in his designated hobbies. He’s Asian, so of course he had to play a stringed instrument, and because he’s Filipino, he had to play basketball. He hated me for being such a tiger mom. And I wasn’t faring much better with my team at work. I had gotten through my graduate degrees at Harvard with determination and frequent all-nighters, and I expected my colleagues to demonstrate the same tenacity. When they fell short, I reacted impatiently and without empathy. I thought that’s what respected leaders did. One day, after losing it in a meeting where I discovered my team had missed a deadline, a few colleagues sat me down and told me something that has become a mantra I repeat to this day: Be intense with outcomes, but be chill with people. And I followed through (adjusting my parenting style for my second son, Adam, after the lessons of raising Ryan). It was at this point in my life that I realized that the quality of my relationships is more important than how others see me. I realized that everyone around me has value beyond my expectations of them. My husband, my kids, my team, everyone is the sum of their individual experiences and interests and strengths. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); I had been so worried about achieving what was expected of me that I was turning around and putting unrealistic expectations on others. I had been so worried about being underestimated that I was underestimating those around me. I had been dragging everyone into playing the game with me, but at what cost? Later, as I was assembling an amazing team to help me build Care.com, I tried to remember the lessons I learned at my previous role. Though there were challenges along the way, we built an incredible culture where teams enjoyed working together as we focused on helping millions of people. Own your struggles and flaws. They could spark your next big idea. While I was working at UPromise, my father had a heart attack, collapsing as he was holding baby Adam. Now I was not only juggling work and family but was also sandwiched between caring for young children and an aging parent. Compartmentalizing my role as an executive from my role as a mother and caregiver became impossible. This is what inspired the idea for Care.com, which would go on to become the world’s largest online marketplace for caregivers. But I was still concerned about what others would think of me if I started a business that appeared to only focus on serving women and moms. In the male-dominated world of tech startups, what could be less sexy than caregiving? Would I be taken seriously? Would I get a fair valuation for myself or my company? Ultimately, I wanted to build a product that people needed — something that would address a real pain point for myself and so many others. I wanted to help families, to put my identity as a woman and mom and caregiver on display for all, and ignore the expectations of the tech world. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); And so, we helped millions of families around the world find caregivers and helped millions of caregivers find jobs. I became an advocate for caregiving as an economic imperative that enables female entrepreneurship. It was not easy. I was doubly underestimated. Male investors often lack proximity to the problems women face and don’t fully appreciate the economic value of female-focused businesses. But again, I tried to worry less about how others valued me and more about how I valued others. I channeled my energy and experience into both pursuing a mission I loved and building a company on my own terms with compassion and empathy. At the party after I rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, Ryan, who was by this time 21 years old, surprised me with a toast where he said that I had been a great mom. In front of our bankers, accountants and colleagues, I shed tears of pride, unafraid to show my vulnerability. I’m so proud of what we achieved at Care.com, but there’s still unfinished business: to advance female founders, to solve the cognitive load crisis for families and to take advantage of recent advances in AI. And so I’m at it again with another venture: Ohai.ai , an AI assistant for “chief household officers.” I’m still trying to focus on how I see others and let go of how others see me. I’m still trying to be a good manager and leader. I’m still trying to help families around the world — but this time with the gift of hindsight. I’m following my heart, putting my full self and all my vulnerabilities out there. And now, playing the game to win looks totally different.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost T＆I studio via Getty Images We asked registered dietitians — here’s what they had to say about okra water’s wellness and skin benefits. The wellness world has always been rife with questionable-sounding trends, and the rise of TikTok has only added fuel to the fire. The latest wellness trend everyone’s talking about on the social media platform is okra water, which promises smoother and clearer skin , a more efficient digestive system , better lubrication , a more balanced vaginal pH, and the ability to nourish the body with vitamins and minerals that it can be difficult to get enough of. But how legit is okra water, anyway? Does this slimy liquid really have health benefits, or is it just the latest “here today, gone tomorrow” wellness trend? We asked registered dietitians — here’s what they had to say. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); What is okra water? First, what is okra water, and how do you make it? “Okra water is water you drink after soaking okra for 24 hours,” explained Amy Goldsmith , a registered dietitian at Kindred Nutrition. “To make okra water, you cut five to six pieces of okra into smaller pieces and add them to an airtight container, like a Mason jar, with 16 ounces of water.” After letting it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours, you can strain it and drink it. Advertisement Sophie Lauver , a registered dietitian at Aeroflow Diabetes, added that while Goldsmith’s recipe is a great blueprint, okra water is very new, and there’s not necessarily an “official” recipe. “The goal is for it to take on a thicker, gel-like texture due to okra’s mucilage,” she said. The (potential) benefits of okra water. Like most trendy wellness waters, proponents of okra water claim it can do everything from balancing vaginal pH to curing acne. It’s hard for registered dietitians to say what the exact benefits of okra water are because it hasn’t been around long, but Lauver said the only evidence we really have about okra water’s benefits has to do with the health benefits of okra as a vegetable. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “We do know that okra is a very nutritious vegetable and is rich in soluble fiber, which can help improve blood glucose and reduce cholesterol,” Lauer said. “Its insoluble fiber helps keep things moving through our digestive tracts, reducing the risk of colon cancer, constipation and other gastrointestinal problems.” Lauver added that some studies have shown that the consumption of okra or okra capsules can improve blood sugar control and that it’s a superfood when it comes to the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants namely, vitamin K, C, magnesium, calcium and B vitamins. “There’s also substantial evidence to show adequate hydration and a high intake of fiber-rich vegetables reduces the risk for chronic disease, so consuming more vegetables is only beneficial for overall health,” Lauver said. With that in mind, Goldsmith pointed out that it’s unlikely you’re getting many of the benefits of okra from okra water since you’re not actually ingesting the vegetable. “A lot of the nutrient properties reside in the skin and cells of the vegetable,” she explained. “However, since you are drinking the water it does have a positive effect on your daily hydration goals.” As for the claim that okra water can balance vaginal pH and make you more lubricated down there, Goldsmith and Lauver don’t see a lot of evidence to support that. Are there any risks to drinking okra water? While okra water is unlikely to have tons of health benefits, it probably won’t hurt you either — unless you’re allergic to okra, that is. And if you’re using it as a type of “cleanse,” that can cause problems as well. “It’s important to note that this drink provides very few calories,” Goldsmith said. “If you’re drinking okra water as a meal replacement or in an attempt to reduce calories you will put yourself at risk of not getting enough fuel in a day, which will negatively affect your mood, cognition, focus, sleep and more.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Another risk, according to Lauver, can come from adding sweeteners to your okra water in an effort to make it more palatable. “The added sugars and calories could have an unintended effect, especially with implications for weight management and glucose control,” she said. “And as with any dietary changes, contact your doctor and a registered dietitian to see whether this choice is right for you.” If you’re thinking about adding okra water to your regimen, both Lauver and Goldsmith will be the first to tell you that in general, it’s probably a safe choice. But if you expect it to transform your life and health, you’re probably better off holding out until more research emerges before spending hours chopping, soaking and straining okra. In the meantime, go ahead and roast it or throw it into a stir fry —you’ll probably end up reaping more health benefits that way. Related Health TikTok Nutrition Is Orange Juice 'Bad' For You Or Not?

The “Underworld” star is warning her social media followers about a catfish pretending to be her in order to scam people out of money. Beckinsale, who shared screenshots from multiple fans who say their parents were targeted, addressed the issue Tuesday. “Hey so this is such a shitty horrible thing to do and it’s not the first time an elderly man has been scammed out of actually a lot of money ― hundreds of thousands of dollars,” she captioned her Instagram post . “Whoever is doing this is disgusting and evil.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); The “Serendipity” actor emphasized that “any message pretending to [be] me is a scammer and I will never be dming anyone asking for money.” The FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center recently confirmed that elder fraud complaints increased by 14% last year, and noted that “scams targeting individuals aged 60 or older caused over $3.4 billion in losses” in 2023 alone — with the average victim losing $33,915. Beckinsale shared a glimpse of just how manipulative these scammers are. One of the messages she shared on Instagram came from a concerned daughter who said her “elderly dad is being scammed out of lots of money” and “does not believe” he’s a victim. The other message went as far as mentioning Beckinsale’s daughter, Lily Mo Sheen . In 2021, actor Kate Beckinsale heard from catfish victims who visited her home uninvited. Lionel Hahn via Getty Images Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “He is convinced that Kate proposed to him via text... and that she and Lily are coming out soon to pay him a visit,” another Instagram user said of their father. “The news article about the catfished stalkers that forced Kate to move homes didn’t help.” Beckinsale was indeed forced to move after several catfish victims who thought she had invited them harassed her at home over the course of several weeks in 2021. The actor reportedly later explained that the deceived harassers thought they “were in some sort of relationship” with her. “My boyfriend at the time and I were completely freaked out, the catfished guys were humiliated and some of them arrested, the scammers weren’t caught and I ended up ultimately having to move house,” she wrote on Instagram in 2023, per The Independent . “So long story short,” she concluded, “if you think I’m messaging you, it’s not me.” Related fraud Scams kate beckinsale elderly scams catfishing Ariana Grande Reveals TMI Answer She Gave To Fan's Question About Dream Dinner Date Justin Timberlake Arrested For Driving While Intoxicated In The Hamptons Howie Mandel Shows Photo Of Wife's Battered Face After Fall In Vegas Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up Entertainment Don't miss a beat.

The documents, from 2017 to 2020, reveal yet another instance of the Border Patrol’s use of a slang term that officials in Washington have condemned but have struggled to stamp out. This is the second disclosure that Border Patrol personnel used the word in internal communications since HuffPost first requested a global search of its use among Border Patrol agents four years ago. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); The origin of the term is uncertain, but most insiders believe it comes from the sound made by bashing an arrested migrant’s head with a government-issued flashlight. Some of the records reference that origin story, with one agent writing: “ah, savor the sound.” A U.S. Border Patrol agent watches on Jan. 7 as migrants prepare to board a bus after crossing the border at Eagle Pass, Texas. Documents obtained by HuffPost reveal that Border Patrol agents who used a slur for migrants also at times gloated about migrants’ misfortunes or hinted at beating them. Agents also joked about killing migrant children in their custody. John Moore/Getty Images Use of the term remained surprisingly common among both rank-and-file agents and those in leadership positions, the records show. Many agents appeared to use the term as a synonym for unauthorized migrants, with little apparent derogatory intent. “Make sure to change the country of citizenship to match your tonk, (i.e. Honduras) ...” one agent wrote in a May 21, 2019, email explaining a new data collection tool. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); But the slur often appeared alongside expressions of raw contempt for the people whom Border Patrol officers police, which disproportionately included Central Americans attempting to gain entry to the United States on humanitarian grounds. Many agents wrote the term in all caps to highlight it. Several described COVID-19 as “Tonk flu,” with one agent telling a colleague, “Hope you’re wearing a mask, don’t let those dirty TONKS get you sick.” Border Patrol agents who used the slur at times gloated about migrants’ misfortunes or made references to beating them. In one instance, agents joked about killing migrant children in their custody. The El Paso Sector watch commander forwarded a request on March 4, 2019, for donations of clothing and toys for unauthorized migrant children and families traveling together. An unidentified official in the email chain noted that some agents “have performed some of these kind gestures” in the past. “I donated a car seat that expired shortly thereafter in the hopes that it would alleviate our processing number by exactly one,” one Border Patrol agent responded. “That count?” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “We’ll leave that one out, along with the Rice Krispy Treats that [redacted] brought in one day that may have been laced with cyanide,” another agent wrote. “You call it cyanide, he calls it tonk seasoning ...” an agent responded. “The use of any derogatory language toward or in reference to others is unacceptable and will not be tolerated,” a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson wrote to HuffPost in an email. “CBP takes all allegations of misconduct seriously, whether it occurs on or off duty. All known allegations of misconduct are immediately referred to CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility, and employees must fully cooperate with any criminal or administrative investigations that may result. CBP leadership takes these allegations seriously and will determine on a case-by-case basis the appropriate actions to address the misconduct.” One agent shared a story in an email about Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arresting an unauthorized migrant in front of his daughter. The subject line on the email was “I can read these all day, they make me happy.” “Adios Tonk,” the recipient responded. “I donated a car seat that expired shortly thereafter in the hopes that it would alleviate our processing number by exactly one. That count?” - U.S. Border Patrol agent responding to call for donations of clothes and toys for migrant families Some agents described themselves as “tonk smasher” or “tonk stomper.” One agent goaded a colleague to go “smash some tonks.” When an agent complained that there were “tonks everywhere” and that officers were getting rocks thrown at them almost daily, another wrote: “Ugh, would rather crack skulls down south than be there bro.” One aging agent lamented that his “tonk arresting days might be over,” forcing him into “some office puke job.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Several agents appeared to reject U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s condemnation of the slur as a sign of political correctness, with many of their comments striking a right-wing political tone. In one email chain, an agent mocked another for using the word “migrants.” “Now you’re leaning left and sounding like a snowflake,” the agent wrote. “Do you know how hard it is for me not to drop ‘F’ bombs and say tonk??” the other agent responded. “I know... embrace your disability, let those F-bombs drop with wanton disregard for the innocent ears you will forever rape with your vitriolic symphony of pooty laced verbiage,” the original agent responded. In another exchange, an agent shared a story from the right-wing news website The Blaze describing how a New York City housing discrimination policy could lead to fines of $250,000 for calling people “illegal immigrants.” “I wonder what ‘Tonk’ would have cost someone,” an agent responded. Few outside the U.S. Border Patrol were familiar with the slur “tonk” until former President Donald Trump took office. His controversial first pick to head U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Thomas Homan, got his start in the Border Patrol and used the slur in Washington. Democratic senators weighing his confirmation sharply condemned Homan’s use of the term after HuffPost first disclosed it in a 2018 profile . Homan resigned two months later and never appeared for a confirmation hearing. The prosecution of Border Patrol Agent Matthew Bowen for striking a Guatemalan migrant with a government truck also cast a spotlight on the term. Bowen referred to unauthorized migrants as “tonks,” “Guats” and “disgusting subhuman shit unworthy of being kindling for a fire” in text messages that appeared in court filings. (Bowen ultimately pleaded guilty in August 2019 to a single misdemeanor civil rights violation and avoided trial.) Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Despite publicly discouraging use of the slur, the emails indicate that in some areas, leadership remained aware of its widespread use and only reluctantly tried to tamp it down after the news media brought greater attention to it. “As per upper management, we have been told to remove all coins that have the word ‘TONK’ on it,” one agent wrote in an email sent Aug. 7, 2019, describing plans for a luncheon and Christmas party. “They have expressed that with all of the recent media attention our agency has been undergoing, the last thing they want is for someone to get in trouble.” One official showed contrition for his past use of the term. In June 2020, as protests over the police murder of a Black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis spread across the country, an assistant chief of the Border Patrol in Washington, D.C., emailed a colleague looking for a “sanity check” on notes he had prepared to raise concerns about racism in law enforcement. The assistant chief planned to ask whether then-Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott would be willing to say “Black lives matter” without adding “All lives matter” or “Blue lives matter.” “Racism is not just a police problem, but we as law enforcement have power and authority,” the assistant chief planned to say. “And that means we have a duty to call it out and not just say something but do something.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); He also planned to ask whether his colleagues had seen the comments made on “that dishonorable Border Patrol Facebook Page.” “I did, but I didn’t say anything,” the assistant chief wrote in the email to his colleague. “Some time ago, I recall hearing agents say Tonk in Headquarters,” the notes say. “Again, I didn’t say anything. And I remember saying it as a younger agent. Shame on me.” Related Immigration Border Patrol Freedom of Information Act Republicans Are Blatantly Lying About A Biden Program That Is Actually Working Uncovered Emails Show Widespread Use Of Racial Slur By Government Agency Biden Goes On Offense On His Weakest Issue: Illegal Border Crossings Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up Politics HuffPost's top politics stories, straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Faith Omole as Bisma, Sarah Kameela Impey as Saira, Juliette Motamed as Ayesha, Anjana Vasan as Amina, singing covers of Britney Spears songs in a scene from \"We Are Lady Parts.\" Saima Khalid/Peacock/NBC International/C4 Growing up, “We Are Lady Parts” creator Nida Manzoor would have jam sessions with her sister, Sanya, and brother, Shez. “One of us would come into the other one’s bedroom and be like, ‘Oh, I’ve got this idea for a song.’ And Sanya, my sister, would start harmonizing, and my brother would start playing the guitar,” Manzoor told me in a recent interview. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); As adults, they still work the same way, as collaborators on the music for “We Are Lady Parts.” Now in its second season on Peacock , the bold and buoyant comedy series follows the members of Lady Parts, a punk band composed entirely of Muslim women: Amina (Anjana Vasan), Saira (Sarah Kameela Impey), Ayesha (Juliette Motamed) and Bisma (Faith Omole), as well as their manager, Momtaz (Lucie Shorthouse). Naturally, the band’s music plays a central role in the show, and, thanks to Manzoor and her siblings, Lady Parts’ songs are extremely rad. (Shez, a composer, also scored Manzoor’s 2023 film, “Polite Society.” ) In composing the songs together, it was a return to the “organic” way they would write music during childhood, as Manzoor explained. “We had a week in a studio here in Bristol, where I live, and my siblings came and stayed over.” Manzoor would come in with a song title or style in mind. “And then, we would just brainstorm ideas, lyric ideas, and then my brother would pick up the guitar, and then we would just start jamming and singing, and then we’d start writing. We’d write a song every day and then sort of move on. And we didn’t overthink it as well. We weren’t like, ‘This has gotta outdo Season 1.’ We just followed the vibe, and we were like, ‘This is cool. All right. That’s a song.’ There was not a lot of pressure on it. I think it was just ’cause it felt like we were just kids in our bedroom again. It felt very free and relaxed.” \"We Are Lady Parts\" creator Nida Manzoor said she and her siblings would \"just brainstorm\" songs, like they did as kids. Rhiannon Adam for HuffPost Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Despite the siblings’ low-pressure approach, the songs — like much of the season as a whole — do feel bigger and bolder than in the first season, something the show’s cast encountered when learning them before filming. “All the actors said that these songs this season are so much harder than [the songs in] Season 1. They’re way more intricate harmonies, way harder to play,” Manzoor said. “So the actors were really freaking out, but my brother really coached them through all that.” In addition to the original songs performed by the band, the show’s new season features several showstopping covers, including Bisma’s powerful rendition of Nina Simone’s “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood” in Episode 4. It’s one of several great needle drops this season that were natural song choices to Manzoor, who drew a lot from the songs that have inspired her work and served as a soundtrack while she was writing the show. “That Nina Simone song has always been in my sort of Lady Parts playlist since before I even wrote the pilot,” Manzoor said. “‘Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood,’ it just really resonated with me as someone trying to express a certain aspect of identity whilst not always pleasing everyone. And I’ve never heard a song that speaks to that.” Faith Omole as Bisma in Season 2 of \"We Are Lady Parts.\" Saima Khalid/Peacock/NBC International/C4 Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “When I’m writing, I’m just open to songs that enter my orbit in a way, which sounds very woo-woo and annoying,” she added. “But with that song, I was with my producer, and we were at a festival, at Glastonbury Music Festival, ’cause ‘Polite [Society]’ was screened there, so we got free tickets. So we were watching Cat Stevens, [aka] Yusuf Islam. Watching Yusuf Islam, I’m like, ‘I need a Yusuf Islam song in my show,’ ’cause all his songs are so beautiful. I was sobbing, ’cause these are songs that I grew up with. And then he did the Nina Simone cover, which had always been in the back of my mind, and I just turned to John, my producer. I’m like, ‘Bisma should sing this, right?’ And he’s, like, ‘Yeah.’ It kind of came out of that, although it had been in my subconscious.” On a very different tonal note from Nina Simone, Hoobastank’s “The Reason” punctuates a lot of the romantic arc between Amina and will-they-won’t-they love interest Ahsan (Zaqi Ismail). Ahsan includes the song on a mixtape for her. During a rom-com moment at the end of the season, Amina performs the song outside his window, “Say Anything”-style. Manzoor credits her sister, Sanya, with the song choice. When she suggested it, Manzoor immediately thought it was “so good and ridiculous and cringe and cheesy and perfect,” she said. Anjana Vasan as Amina, singing Hoobastank's \"The Reason,\" in the Season 2 finale of \"We Are Lady Parts.\" Saima Khalid/Peacock/NBC International/C4 Another fun cover moment happens in the season’s third episode, when the members of Lady Parts, clad in matching dark suits, perform a medley of Britney Spears songs for a gig at a wedding. “I think I’d always wanted to do a Britney cover for Lady Parts for some reason — like, why not? Britney’s amazing,” Manzoor said. “And I just wanted to see them all looking amazing in suits and playing Britney — just the contradiction of that was really exciting to me.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); According to Manzoor, the music from Season 2 will be released on a soundtrack album — including a special version on vinyl. Aside from the show’s original songs and covers, Manzoor said she is especially happy to “get to feature some artists that I was listening to as I was writing the show,” particularly undersung Muslim artists. “In Episode 6, Saira discovers all these different artists, and those were all musicians I was actually really listening to as I was writing the show,” she said. “So we have Elaha Soroor, who is an Afghani musician who had to flee Afghanistan because of the Taliban. And we have Rasha Nahas, who is incredible. All these musicians were people I was listening to and enjoying as I was writing. So then getting to showcase them because they’re not super mainstream was really fun as well, as well as doing all the fun covers.” “We Are Lady Parts” is now streaming on Peacock.

    "article_content": "Shopping Writer for HuffPost Amazon The Matein laptop backpack even has a built-in USB port for charging your devices on the go. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. This unassuming backpack may not look like much, but it’s adored among reviewers on Amazon for a few reasons including its near endless organizational compartments, thoughtful features and affordable price — a number that’s even more impressive now that it’s currently on sale for 55% off . Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); $17.79 at Amazon (regularly $39.96) Ideal for just about anything from travel to work , this 15.6-inch backpack has a designated padded interior sleeve for laptops (sized 13 to 15 inches) as well as two cavernous main compartments and two additional smaller compartments. There’s even a built-in USB charging port and a secret anti-theft pocket at the back of the bag for things like passports, wallets and cell phones. And if you’re toting this with you to the airport, there’s a luggage strap that runs along the padded backside of the pack so it can easily slide over the handle of your suitcase. It does come in two sizes and several colors, though only the smaller gray version is discounted at the moment. Keep reading to see how pleased others are with this hidden-gem-of-a-bag or snag one for yourself at this truly impressive price while you still can. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Promising Amazon reviews: “Several pockets and compartments to store items, and well cushioned backpack. I love the quality as well, very well padded and easy to organize. I especially like amount of smaller to medium pockets on the front for my phone, and larger one for other necessities. The interior is amazingly spacious, I’m able to fit my laptop, iPad, binder, and 5 subject notebooks along with a large water bottle. I’m so pleased with this purchase, I purchased the 15.5 and have all this space, so I’m sure the larger one could fit even more items. The charging extension is a bonus, I haven’t used it yet, but love having the option with its own pocket to insert a battery pack. Very happy with this purchase.” — Amazon customer “This is a fantastic backpack! I bought it to replace an Ogio I had for around 6 years, so I was nervous about this one at first. But I have to say, I think I like this one more than my old one. I love all the nice organizational pockets this has, and there’s even a slot in the laptop compartment that fits my charger and brick! I have an Alienware m17, and it fits perfectly in the padded laptop pocket. The backpack is made of what feels like a very durable canvas like material. The zippers are smooth, which is good and bad, especially on the laptop part, which could flop open if you’re not careful. The straps are comfy and the bonus “secret” pocket on the bottom of the bag is a nice bonus. In fact, there’s a few hidden pockets on this thing! This backpack would be fantastic for traveling, especially since it has loops you can put luggage locks on. I use it as an everyday bag for work, and it certainly serves me well. I highly recommend this backpack!” — Sophie “I purchased this to use in place of my laptop bag and purse for use on a flight across the US. It was the best decision I made! It was great to consolidate those items and had a place for everything I needed. Was not heavy and was very east to carry and navigate across the airports. I have decided to use it on a daily basis going back and forth to and from work! I would highly highly recommend this backpack. Side note: I chose the gray color so that it would not show dirt as I knew I would have to set it on the floor while traveling. It that is not a concern there are lots of beautiful colors to choose from!” — Tamera $17.79 at Amazon (regularly $39.96) Related shopping Amazon travel sales backpacks Laptop Backpacks From Target That Don't Look Too Technical Reviewers Say These Are The Best Backpacks For Commuting 12 Waterproof Laptop Bags For When You Commute In The Rain Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up An essential daily guide to achieving the good life Subscribe to our lifestyle email.

Two hours later, the singer surprised fans with the revelation that “TTPD” is actually a double album, and dropped 15 additional songs, for a total of 122 minutes of new music. With 31 brand new tracks, fans have plenty of lyrics — about relationship trauma, mental health and other themes that fit into the album’s “tortured” theme — to dissect. But while many of the songs also sound melancholy, Swift sneaks some of her saddest sentiments into the upbeat electro-pop bop “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart”: Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); I’m so depressed I act like it’s my birthday every day / I’m so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like a plague / I cry a lot, but I am so productive; it’s an art / You know you’re good when you even can do it with a broken heart. They said, ‘Babe you gotta fake it til you make it,’ and I did / Lights, camera, bitch, smile, even when you want to die / He said he’d love me all his life, but that life was too short / Breaking down, I hit the floor / All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ‘MORE!’ The singer seems to describe performing on her record-breaking “Eras” tour ― which is all but confirmed by the concert footage that accompanies the track on Spotify ― and recalls glittering on the stage and hitting her marks while feeling miserable in her personal life. (Swift and her longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn ended their six-year relationship around the start of the tour.) Advertisement As my colleague Jillian Capewell wrote in her “TTPD” review , “She manically pep-talks herself through the devastation of heartbreak ... assuring herself she’s a ‘real tough kid’ who can ‘handle her shit,’ but hinting at a harder fallout from her breakup with Alwyn that she didn’t let the public see.” Swift concludes the song, practically laughing, ”’Cause I’m miserable, and nobody even knows!” before sighing and declaring, “Try and come for my job.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Although most of us don’t know what it’s like to spend night after night performing for football stadium-sized crowds while grieving the end of a long-term relationship, many people can relate to the notion of throwing yourself into your work as you go through a difficult breakup. “For better or worse, distraction is one of the most tried and true coping strategies people turn to when dealing with difficult and overwhelming things,” Brit Barkholtz , a Minnesota-based clinical therapist, told HuffPost. “Productive distractions like throwing yourself into work or other projects can be particularly compelling to us because unlike a more passive distraction ― like maybe watching TV or reading a book ― productive distractions provide some tangible ‘output’ that can give you a sense of control and agency and competency, which can feel like a much-needed balm.” Just as Swift boasts about how “good” she is at doing her job amid severe emotional turmoil, anyone can derive a sense of satisfaction from accomplishing something at work, especially in times when they feel like they’re failing in other areas of their lives. “You might feel better about yourself getting things done, and feel like it helps your self-esteem in some capacity,” said Jessi Gold, an associate professor of psychiatry and the chief wellness officer at the University of Tennessee System. “So many of us base our identity on our work and our relationships, so having one going OK can sometimes help balance our feelings of loss and confusion about the other.” Neilson Barnard via Getty Images Taylor Swift attends the 66th GRAMMY Awards on February 4, 2024 in Los Angeles. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); It’s understandable, then — but is it healthy? Trying to stay productive “can give your mind a needed break from the painful things you’re dealing with, and on a practical level it gets stuff done,” Barkholtz said. “Maybe you make some extra headway at work or complete some projects at home you’ve been meaning to get around to. It feels good to get stuff done!” And Swift’s job already requires her to process her emotions. Writing lyrics can be “really close to journaling, which is helpful for processing,” Gold said. “[Swift] has said her lyrics can mean different things at different points, and I think just like music can be comforting for us to hear, it is comforting for her to write and perform.” She pointed to the artist’s 2020 albums, “Folklore” and “Evermore,” which she wrote and recorded amid the challenges and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Her productivity skyrockets over the times when it seems harder for others to get things done, emotionally, so clearly it helps her in some way,” Gold said. Swift also thrives on getting positive responses and support from fans at her live concerts. Gold noted that Lady Gaga’s song “Applause,” which features the chorus “I live for the applause,” plays out in every stadium before the singer takes the stage at her “Eras” shows. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “So we know she not only loves her fans, but it helps her to be with them, loved by them and around them,” she said. “That can also help when she might feel less loved in her personal life, or even in her own head towards herself, which can both happen as a result of feelings around a break up. It is a bit of, ‘It is OK that he doesn’t love me, look at how many people do.’” But although there is no right or wrong way to grieve and cope with heartbreak, there are some potential downsides to diving so fully into your job during a breakup. “Throwing yourself into work during times like this can put you at risk of burnout,” Barkholtz warned. “If you’re trying to do too much and [run] more on adrenaline and emotion than actual energy, it’s not going to be sustainable. You’re already using a great deal of your mental and emotional capacity just existing through this hard time, so adding a lot of extra work ― particularly high-intensity work that requires a high level of mental or physical energy and focus ― can deplete even your deepest reserves and leave you exhausted.” Working too much is certainly healthier than more obvious self-harm, but that doesn’t mean this tactic can’t become problematic in excess. Emotionally, there’s also a fine line between using work as a little bit of a distraction and full-on avoidance. “If you are working, and busy, you don’t have time to sit and feel,” Gold noted. “Sometimes we do this unconsciously, like we have no idea that we even are working more, but sometimes we are choosing to be busy because it feels better than not being busy. Still, you do want to make sure you are not doing it for too long with no awareness that is what you are doing,” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); You can’t work your way out of having to acknowledge and accept you breakup and difficult emotions, however. Repressing those feelings will only intensify them. “You will need to feel eventually, and pushing it down and pushing it down will likely only make it pop right up with more force, like a beach ball in water,” Gold said. Gold also urged people going through a personal challenge to be kind to themselves, rather than compound the negative feelings by judging the way they cope. “Thoughts like ‘I am handling this badly’ or ‘coping wrong’ make it worse,” she said. “I think it is important to do what works and is helpful to you, and for many of us we do need to work through it and don’t have an option not to.” Easing up on your job if you’re going through a rough time isn’t a privilege everyone has. So even if you have no choice but to focus on work, try to make space in your life for self-care and reflection as well. “It’s important to also have places and people in your life where you don’t have to appear fine or be productive,” Barkholtz said. “Try to make sure to not cut yourself off from supportive people you can be genuine and honest with or from hobbies or practices that bring you joy and keep you centered.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); She hopes the song “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” makes others who must work through heartbreak feel less alone as they struggle to get from one day to the next and even do it with a smile. ″[I] want Taylor and everyone else to know: It’s OK to just be messy, it’s OK to not be ‘tough’ or ‘resilient,’” Barkholtz said. “You are not weak or any lesser on the days that the pain keeps you in bed all day than you are on the days you play a sold-out show with a broken heart.” She believes the song contains a second message ― one that is more implicit but offers an always-relevant reminder to everyone. “There is often so much more than meets the eye,” Barkholtz noted. “Many people have experienced or are currently going through things you have no idea about.” Related Mental Health Taylor Swift This New Taylor Swift Song Has A Crucial Message About Mental Health 8 Tips For Working Through A Hard, Sad Breakup A New Taylor Swift Song Is Resonating With Those Who've Had Miscarriages Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up An essential daily guide to achieving the good life Subscribe to our lifestyle email.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Morsa Images via Getty Images Using iPhones can be an unavoidable part of our workdays. Here's how to make them work for you, instead of the other way around. If you’re an iPhone user, you know that they can be both a necessary tool for our jobs and also the very tool that keeps us from getting any work done. There are features that can help you get the most out of using an iPhone, so you remain focused. Productivity experts and professionals told HuffPost about their favorite hacks and features to help them stay on task. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Try for yourself: 1. Turn on Do Not Disturb. Anna Dearmon Kornick, a time management coach, said that turning on the iPhone’s Do Not Disturb feature is her go-to when she wants to avoid being distracted by notifications. “I love it because when I set my iPhone to Do Not Disturb, it extends to my laptop notifications, too,” she said. What makes it different from Airplane Mode ― which disables your phone’s ability to connect to cellular or Wi-Fi networks ― is that you can still allow certain notifications to come through, she said. Advertisement “I’ve noticed that a lot of productivity experts recommend putting your phone in Airplane Mode while you work, putting your phone in another room, or locking it in a drawer,” she said. “As a mom to two little girls in daycare, Airplane Mode or going completely off the grid is not an option for me, because I need to be available in case of an emergency. Within the Do Not Disturb settings, you can allow notifications from certain people within your contacts or specific apps, so the girls’ daycare is able to reach me even while I’m in Do Not Disturb mode.” To turn on Do Not Disturb: 1. Go to Settings, select Focus. 2. Tap Do Not Disturb. From there, you can choose to allow notifications from selected people or apps. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); 2. Use the extra fields in Contacts to put in helpful reminders about the people you meet. If you tend to forget details about the people you meet and network with, try typing in those details alongside their contact info. “You may automatically save phone numbers and email addresses in your Contacts app, but take things a step further and utilize more information fields in Contacts,” said productivity consultant and time management coach Rashelle Isip. “You can add in helpful information for contacts like birthdays, anniversaries, important dates, family members, and work contacts,” she said. “You can create custom labels, add pronunciation fields, and take notes. You add in information once, and it’s there for easy reference in future.” To add more details in Contacts: 1. Select your phone icon, go to Contacts and select a person’s contact entry. 2. From there, select Edit. You can fill in fields like birthday, URL and email, and you can write notes in the select field. 3. Use the Notes app to scan documents. “If you have to send in a lot of signed/filled out documents like camp registration or school permission forms, and these organizations don’t generally use electronic signatures, then the Notes function on an iPhone can save a ton of time,” said Laura Vanderkam, author of “Tranquility by Tuesday: 9 Ways to Calm the Chaos and Make Time for What Matters.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “It creates a PDF from your scan and you can then email it straight to whoever is asking for it,” she said. “Other than that, I think the best productivity app is staying off your phone as much as possible.” To scan documents from your phone: 1. Open Notes and select a note or create a new one. 2. Tap the camera icon inside Notes and place your document in the camera’s view to scan. 3. Your document will automatically scan if it’s in Auto Mode, but you may need to manually capture a scan by tapping the Shutter button . 4. Set up Reminders. Harleny Vasquez, a New Jersey-based career coach for social workers, said she uses the built-in Reminders app on iOS devices. “In taking the time to create and set up reminders, it can give you the peace of mind in ensuring important tasks, meetings and deadlines are not missed or overlooked,” she said. “These types of reminders can also help you stay organized and focused, including allowing you to set the foundation to take necessary breaks and prevent burnout.“ To set up Reminders: 1. Go to the Reminders app and tap New Reminder. 2. Use the Title and Notes fields to type out what you want to remember. 3. Tap the Date and Time button to set due dates for your reminder. Tap the Photos button if you want to attach a photo with your reminder. 4. If Location Services is turned on, you can also receive location-based reminders and choose whether you want to be notified when arriving or leaving a perimeter area. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 5. Use Focus mode. “To protect my energy and time, I use the Focus mode, which allows me to mute notifications and minimize distractions,” Vasquez said. To turn on Focus: 1. Go to Settings and select Focus. 2. Select a Focus option, such as Personal, Sleep or Work. From there, you can customize how you want to allow or silence notifications from certain people and apps during set hours. 6. Set app limits. If you find yourself automatically scrolling social media or checking emails when you should be working, try setting app limits, productivity consultant Samphy Y recommends. “I’ve found that endless email and social media scrolling tricks my brain into feeling busy and satisfied, when I’m really just procrastinating,” he said. “Restricting app access flips that switch and forces me to sit with boredom and discomfort. That’s when the real work happens.” For example, Y said that he restricts his access to email to only a few hours. “I get more done in those two hours of email than I would in an unlimited email day,” he said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); To set app limits: 1. Go to Settings, select Screen Time and select Add Limit. 2. From there, you can set daily time limits for app categories like “social” or specific websites. 7. Turn off the Raise to Wake feature Have you ever noticed how the iPhone’s lock screen automatically turns on when you pick up your device? That’s known as the Raise to Wake feature . Y, the productivity consultant, said that turning off the Raise to Wake feature has helped him reduce distractions, because it makes it a little harder to get sucked into automatically using his phone. To turn off Raise to Wake: 1. Go to Settings, then select Display & Brightness. 2. Tap Raise to Wake to turn the setting off or on. This story was previously published at an earlier date.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Illustration: Benjamin Currie/HuffPost; Photo: Getty In a volatile job market, \"bridge jobs\" are common. See how you can get the most out of them. Despite the popular idea of job ladders, a career journey is not typically a straightforward path onward and upward. At some point, there are likely to be detours when you lose a job unexpectedly or need to take time off to take care of yourself or a family member . That’s when you might take what is known as a “bridge job.“ Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Career coach Jasmine Escalera defined a bridge job as one you take “to stay in the career game, even though that step isn’t your end goal, in an effort to acquire certain skill sets or experiences that will get you closer to that end goal.” In other words, they are the jobs you take when you need to shelter in place amid a tough job market and/or when you are burned out and need time to decompress. I’ve certainly had one, and you might, too. Advertisement For me, my bridge job was a two-year stint writing blog posts for a job board site after a layoff. It boosted my confidence, gave me free time to write fiction on the side and taught me that I do enjoy staying up to date on management trends, something that I do to this day. For Escalera, one of her bridge jobs was being an Uber Eats driver while she worked on building her coaching business. “I credit that as being one of the most influential points of my life. Because there I really had the space and time to think about what kind of business I actually want to grow,” Escalera said.

Due to mass layoffs and a flooded job market, Escalera said she’s seeing more people take a bridge job right now. “I think people are much more open to taking contract positions, freelance positions, things that are truly going to help them stay in the market and maybe potentially try some new things out,” she said. Why you should be proud of your bridge job Despite how common they are, there can still be a lot of stigma attached to taking bridge jobs. “People often feel ashamed of taking a bridge job because it feels like taking a step backward from their career goals, they worry about the optics of a bridge job on a resume or they fear difficulty reentering their desired career path later on,” said marketing manager Hanna Goefft , who shares tips on how to get hired on TikTok . “We’re often socialized to believe that a ‘successful’ career means advancing in a traditional, linear trajectory.“ However, bridge jobs can be a strategic next move if you put their benefits into perspective. “If the best option for you is to take a role that allows you to pay your bills and take care of yourself, that is absolutely the right decision to make,” Goefft said. Escalera said the shame of bridge jobs is tied to “this old-school mindset and mentality of, ‘We have to be on a path.’” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); But careers are a long and winding road. A bridge job can be the refreshing reset your career needs when you feel stuck. “If you’re not on the right path, don’t feel fulfilled, don’t feel happy, don’t feel growth ... then you should have the opportunity to experience bridge jobs and use that as a very strategic way for you to create experiences to determine what you want to do next,” Escalera said. Signs of a good bridge job It can be overwhelming to wonder where you will be in five years and how you will get there. That’s why it can be more useful to break up your long-term goal into manageable, shorter goals. Ask yourself: What’s my next right move? A bridge job may be the right answer. Thinking of pivoting to an entirely new career? Get a bridge job that will expand your network in your desired field. “Bridge jobs are really great for transitioners because they give you the opportunity to dip your toe in and see what’s working,” Escalera said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Even if it is a job that is entirely outside of your desired industry, it can still be a useful bridge job if it will help you gain a new skill for your resume. Goefft used her own trajectory as an example. “I started my career by accepting a job offer in accounting while my subconscious was telling me I wanted a more creative career in marketing,” she said. “At the time, I felt the same concerns: fear that the role would pigeonhole me into an industry that I didn’t care about, and fear that I’d struggle to get interviews with that role on my resume. But over time, I’ve been able to recognize the invaluable skills I learned in accounting that I never would have gotten exposure to in marketing.” Maybe the bridge job is simply a chance to take a breather and have a lighter workload while your current career is not your top priority. That’s OK, too. For Jannese Torres , host of the personal finance podcast Yo Quiero Dinero , a bridge job is “any job that pays you probably less than what you’re used to earning.” Ideally, “It should also not contribute to your stress, it shouldn’t be a job that adds more to your plate in a negative way. It should be something that helps you manage that transition period,” she added. For entrepreneurs, the bridge job can be a great way for you to grow your business without feeling pressured to make it your full-time gig right away. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “If you’re in a situation where your business might be bringing in maybe 50% of what you need to live on, that bridge job can help you make up the other income that you need in order to meet your expenses, but also not be the thing that sucks up so much time away from your business,” Torres said. You do not have to mention every bridge job you have done on a resume, but don’t be ashamed of your diverse skill set. Sometimes, it can be the very experience that will help you stand out from other candidates. Escalera gave the example of mentioning what you learned as a barista in a job interview unrelated to that field. If you can frame how the barista job taught you project management and customer service capabilities that no one else has and how you’re going to use those to solve problems at the organization, then, “Boom, you’ve got the job,” she said. So, see your bridge jobs as something to be proud of. They show you are still learning and pushing yourself forward, despite all the many bumps and potholes that you’re likely to hit on the road of life.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Maddie Abuyuan / HuffPost The FTC just enacted a nationwide ban on new noncompete agreements. See how that would affect you. When you get a new job, you might be one of the 30 million Americans who also signed a noncompete agreement. A noncompete agreement stops you from going to work for a competitor or from starting up a competing business of your own, typically within a geographic zone and a set period of time after you leave a job. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); You may not realize the consequences of what you signed until you try to leave for a new job. In January 2023, the Federal Trade Commission proposed a comprehensive noncompete ban and opened their proposal to public comment. Thousands of responses poured in from professionals who shared stories of how these noncompetes forced them to stay in jobs with toxic working conditions, to uproot their families, and to stop serving their patients and clients. As one Appalachia-based physician put it in their comment: “Providers with aggressive noncompetes must abandon the community that they serve if they chose to leave their employer. Healthcare providers feel trapped.” Advertisement From doctors and janitors to sandwich makers and yoga instructors , noncompetes have become one of the main tools employers across industries can use to control what kind of job an employee can take next. They are not usually negotiable if you’re a new hire who wants to keep your job. Or as one car power-washer explained in their public FTC comment: “My boss said that if I didn’t sign before the end of the week, not to come in the next week ... I’d like to start my own business but I would have to find another job and wait five years.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); The FTC estimates that one in five Americans are under these restrictive employment agreements right now. But no more, according to the FTC. On Tuesday, the federal agency set a historic precedent and banned noncompete agreements nationwide in a 3-2 vote, saying that they are an “ unfair method of competition ” and therefore in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC cited research about how noncompetes suppress wages, and estimated that its noncompete ban would raise workers’ wages between $400 billion and $488 billion over the next decade. “It’s clear the freedom to leave your job and take another job is fundamental to a free and fair economy,” said FTC commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter in her Tuesday presentation on the rule. Whom would this noncompete ban effect? “The final rule bans new noncompetes with all workers, including senior executives after the effective date,” according to the FTC’s fact sheet on its rule. In other words, there is no salary threshold and independent contractors are covered by this ban, too. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); However, if you’re a nonprofit employee, you would not be covered by this rule, because the FTC only covers the private sector, said Daryl Leon , a New York-based noncompete, trade secret and employment law litigator at BakerHostetler. There is also an exception for noncompetes that are made when a business is sold. And what if you already have a noncompete? Under the rule, existing noncompetes are also no longer enforceable after it goes into effect and your employer must give you “clear and conspicuous” notice of this fact, according to the FTC. In its final ruling, the agency outlined a scenario where a former employer would individually text, email, or mail a notice to past workers about their rights with language like: “A new rule enforced by the Federal Trade Commission makes it unlawful for us to enforce a noncompete clause.” However, existing noncompetes remain in effect for senior executives because the FTC said this group is less likely to be exploited by them. The FTC defined a senior executive as someone who makes more than $151,164 annually and is in a “policy-making position.” When would this ban go into effect? In the final ruling, the FTC said the ban would be effective starting 120 days after the rule gets published in the federal register. In other words, by mid-August under the best of circumstances. But the FTC rule is also likely to face significant legal challenges from firms and trade groups seeking an immediate stay of the ban’s implementation. Leon said that more than likely a nationwide injunction will be issued by a district court, and then that would go through the appellate courts, and potentially all the way up to the Supreme Court. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “There is very little chance, it seems, that this rule in its current form will ever go into effect without the Supreme Court blessing,” Leon said. Businesses typically say that they need noncompetes to protect trade secrets and customer relationships, as well as their investments in worker training. In its public comment to the FTC against the ban, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest business lobby, said noncompetes were needed to reduce “free-riding,” and that nondisclosure agreements and trade secret suits were not enough protection for “vital procompetitive business and individual interests.” The Chamber of Commerce said Tuesday that the rule “sets a dangerous precedent for government micromanagement of business” and that it plans to sue the FTC over the rule. What can employers and employees expect going forward? Even without noncompete bans, employers still have other tactics to stop you from quitting, according to Reid Skibell , a New York-based civil litigator at Glenn Agre Bergman & Fuentes who counsels professionals on breaches of noncompetes. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); If noncompetes become unavailable, Skibell said he expects more “golden handcuffs” tactics to be more widely used on senior employees. He cited the common practice of employers delaying bonuses until the first quarter of the following year to deter employees from leaving, and loans that are only forgiven over a certain time that an employee remains employed. Skibell said he also expected major employers to rely more on confidentiality restrictions and nonsolicitation bans to retain lower-level employees. And if you want a glimpse of the future, look at California, a state that has already banned noncompetes, said Orly Lobel , the director of the Center for Employment and Labor Policy at University of San Diego. In California, banning noncompetes helped to bring entrepreneurship and venture capital investment to the region, she said. That’s because the power dynamic between a boss and employee shifts when noncompetes are no longer on the table. Employers “learn to use carrots rather than sticks to secure retention,” Lobel said, citing incentives such as stock options and greater company innovation to get employees to stay in California. Without noncompetes, employees have more leverage to leave toxic jobs, too. Take it from a bartender, whose story was highlighted in the FTC final rule. This bartender said they were being sexually harassed at their old bar, so they took a job at a competing bar with better wages and conditions, even though it violated their two-year noncompete agreement. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “I took the new job, thinking our legal system wouldn’t allow a massive company with over 20 locations to sue a young entry-level worker with no degree. In December 2021, I was sued for $30,000,” the bartender wrote . Fighting a noncompete in courts can result in costly litigation fees, said Basel Musharbash , a Texas-based antitrust lawyer who has defended employees against noncompetes. He said that the less wealthy and less expert that an employee is, the more likely it becomes that they cannot defend themselves against the enforcement of a noncompete. “We currently have a system that lets employers basically write noncompetes, regardless of whether they’re legal or not, and then just intimidate and bully employees into submission to their terms. And that ends with this rule,” Musharbash said. He noted that the FTC rule will hopefully deter lawyers from adding noncompetes into new employment contracts. And in the meantime, employees can use the FTC rule against noncompetes to negotiate their way out of one. Until it goes into effect, Leon said that the FTC’s rule does not change workers’ conditions right now legally, but it could still be a way for employees to advocate on their own behalf. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “When they are leaving employment or thinking of leaving employment, it’s ... more ammunition that they have available to them to try and say, ‘If I have a noncompete, employer, you should waive it, or you should not enforce it against me,’” he said.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Sony Pictures/Alamy The movie is surreal, but the pressure to figure yourself out by 30 is all too real. When you turn the big “3-0,” you are going to hear many unsolicited messages about what you should have accomplished by now. Whether or not you ask for it, you’ll hear advice and admonishment from friends, families and pop culture about what this next decade should look like. And if you were a young millennial in the early 2000s, you likely got one of these messages of what a thirtysomething could and should be from the popular film “13 Going on 30.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); In the 2004 romantic comedy, 13-year-old Jenna Rink (Christa B. Allen) makes a desperate wish to jump past the humiliation of puberty and be “30 and flirty and thriving,” which has now become the movie’s most famous line. Jenna gets what she asked for, although nothing turns out quite like she expected. Jenna wakes up and suddenly she is 30, as portrayed by Jennifer Garner. This older Jenna has all the status markers of thirtysomething success that young Jenna wanted. She lives in a luxury apartment filled with designer shoes and clothes, she has a “big-time magazine” job, is on a first-name basis with Madonna and has a buff boyfriend who’s a professional hockey player. Advertisement But she also happens to be a “pretentious, conniving snake,” as one disgruntled colleague puts it. She is passing off a secretary’s idea as her own after firing her. She ignores professional boundaries and is having an affair with her co-worker’s husband in her office. Jenna’s ambition has made her well-known in her industry but a stranger to those her knew her growing up. As Jenna learns in the movie, you can be 30 and still be a hot mess. Her journey in the film is learning that the success you might end up treasuring the most is something that will not show up on a résumé. (In Jenna’s case, it’s regaining the relationship with her childhood best friend, Matty, as portrayed by Mark Ruffalo.) Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Although the movie is now 20 years old, “13 Going on 30” depicted a very real pressure to understand yourself by a certain date that is still relevant. Jenna strongly believes her teen angst will end when she turns 30 because society is telling her that’s when she should be “thriving.” And that’s a common belief young people still hold, said Kayleen Schaefer, a journalist and the author of “ But You’re Still So Young: How Thirtysomethings Are Redefining Adulthood .” “I absolutely had the misconception, as Jenna does in the movie, that you hit your 30s and everything is figured out,” Schaefer said. “And your life is settled, and the hard stuff is over. And that is a lie.” In this way, the milestone of 30 still carries a heavy weight, especially if you are dissatisfied about what you have yet to do with your life. “There is this idea of taking your 20s to find yourself. But ... I think when you hit 30, you kind of are like, ‘Oh, OK, this is the decade where it gets serious and where I need to figure out my adulthood,’” Schaefer said. “But the thing is, adulthood doesn’t look the same for anybody.” Why there are still pressures to reach milestones by 30 For Schaefer’s book research, she found that 1950s sociologists had a checklist for what adulthood should entail: finish school, leave home, make your own money, marry and become a parent. Back then, you needed all five markers of success to be a real adult. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); And even though what’s on that cookie-cutter checklist has undoubtedly changed, many young people still have one. “I certainly had that belief that when I was in my 30s, I would just check all these things off, and I was really rocked when it didn’t work out like that because you actually have to go after these things,” Schaefer said about the checklist. “We have a lot of agency, which is amazing, but it’s also really hard.” In this way, it’s interesting how “13 Going on 30” depicted Jenna being unmarried, child-free and career-driven ― and a professional success as a result. Schaefer said it’s an example of how the 2004 film shows a shifting on-screen idea of what society expects from people in their 30s. So, yes, this can be a decade of transformation. But ultimately it helps to put your life in perspective. Each of us has our own path but no roadmap to consult. Schaefer gave the example of starting a new career in your 30s or making the decision to not have children as milestones you can give yourself. “Some people are in early stages of their careers. Some people are in late stages of their career, some people have two kids, some people are still deciding if they want to have kids or not,” she said. “Life isn’t just a straight line anymore.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “I absolutely had the misconception, as Jenna does in the movie, that you hit your 30s and everything is figured out.” - Kayleen Schaefer, author of “But You’re Still So Young” Take what happens to Jenna. Once she realizes all the people “older Jenna” has betrayed, she returns to her parents’ home in need of comfort. The background music swells. Billy Joel croons “You’re so ambitious for a juvenile / But then if you’re so smart tell me / Why are you still so afraid?” Jenna is at her lowest, loneliest point. She climbs into her mom’s bed and apologizes for not visiting at Christmas. Her mom gives Jenna the pep talk she needs to keep going, and Jenna returns to New York City to make amends. Jenna discovers that these relationships ― not her résumé ― are what she values. Nurturing and investing in these acquaintances and friendships can actually end up creating the most meaningful memories of all. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Indeed, the big lesson of “13 Going on 30” is that those personal connections can be what saves you from going down a lonelier, harder path. That can look like befriending your young neighbor who lives down the hall and learning her name. Or it can involve thanking your secretary and promoting her ideas. Or sometimes it’s simply sharing red Razzles with your old friend. “We need to remember what used to be good. If we don’t, we won’t recognize it even if it hits us between the eyes,” Jenna declares to her magazine colleagues as she pitches a redesign, to applause. They are taking her more seriously as someone to respect and admire, and so is Jenna. Ultimately, turning 30 has as much power as you give it. This decade will likely take you on a journey you did not intend to make, and that uncertainty can fill you with anxiety or excitement. It just depends on what you wish, as Jenna would tell you.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Amanda Lucier for HuffPost Donna Kopman, a 57-year-old job seeker, is pictured at her home in Lake Oswego, Oregon. She has been looking for a job since being laid off in December. Since she got laid off from her job in December, Donna Kopman, 57, has sent out over 300 job applications. From Sunday through Tuesday, the Lake Oswego, Oregon, resident spends eight hours a day at her computer applying for jobs. The rest of the week, she focuses on researching jobs she will submit applications for the following week. So far, she has gotten only one job interview with a recruiter. “It’s really frustrating,” Kopman said. “I’m not trying to shoot for the moon at this point in my career. I just would like gainful employment until I retire.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Before her layoff, Kopman was a sales operation manager at software company Milestone Systems. She had two decades of sales experience and made $110,000 at her last job. Now she is applying for jobs that earn $60,000 and has broadened her search to include administrative or contract work, in order to get affordable health insurance. Kopman said she regularly experiences highs and lows with her job search. First, she will get excited by a job and spend hours crafting a personalized application based on how the role aligns with her direct experience. Then, she will have those hopes dashed by an automated rejection 24 hours later. Advertisement “It’s like, did anybody even look at my résumé?” she said. That’s when Kopman questions: “Well, is it ageism?” Amanda Lucier for HuffPost Over 50 and hearing nothing back? Unfortunately, this is a common experience. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Kopman is right to be concerned. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act protects U.S. workers who are 40 and older from being discriminated against on the basis of age, but the odds are stacked against older job seekers. If you’re over 50, you are more likely to lose ― or be pushed out of ― your job. Once this happens, it takes much longer for older job seekers than their younger counterparts to land a job again, let alone a job that pays them what they are used to earning. In fact, half of people in their 50s are laid off at least once and only 1 in 10 of these workers will ever again earn as much as they did before this setback, according to a 2018 data analysis by ProPublica and the Urban Institute of the Health and Retirement Study. One major reason it’s so hard to get rehired? Because of machines that rank an older job seeker’s job application. When older workers apply for a job, they often get rejected by automatic tracking systems that can sort out their résumé based on dates used and skills that they do not list, said Carl Van Horn, a public policy professor and director of the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. He gave the example of digital skills not being listed, even though they can be easily taught. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Employers “make this assumption and say, ‘Well, they probably don’t know how to do X, Y, and Z.’ Now, of course, on the other side, what we know is that [those] people have been successful in the labor market for a long time. They’re probably good workers,” he said. “But it flies against some people’s attitude about older people and what they can and can’t do.” And as more employers adopt generative artificial intelligence into their workflow, Van Horn said he expects older job seekers to face potentially more rejections. The lengths job seekers over 50 go through when applying The common advice you’ll get as an older job seeker? Hide any suggestion of your mature age. That’s because hiring managers can make instant judgments based on what you share. In one experimental study , economist Joanna Lahey sent out 8,000 fake résumés of candidates to hiring managers and tracked what they looked at with an eye-scanning lab. Hiring managers’ eyes were pausing at years of employment history and the year candidates got their education, and ultimately spent more time scanning the résumés of younger candidates. Kopman said she no longer bothers applying to jobs that ask for a graduation date in their online applications. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Nina, a 55-year-old Allentown, Pennsylvania-based job seeker, said she keeps her 1987 college graduation date off her résumé and, when possible, she avoids including the years she worked at past jobs. Nina, who asked to be identified by her first name since she is currently employed, said she also purposefully colors her hair for interviews. “I want to go gray so bad, but like our society, they just write you off as invisible anyway, so I’m still coloring my hair,” she said. On top of these appearance biases, some employers still hold ageist beliefs that older employees are “too stuck” in their ways and that they will not adapt to new business needs, Nina said. To fight against the assumption that older workers are unfamiliar with technology, Nina posts her LinkedIn and Instagram information on her résumé to show she is up to date on social media. The financial stress of job-hunting over age 50 Kopman is aware of how her long-term unemployment is eating into her savings. She has not taken a break since her layoff. Her unemployment insurance will expire in November. She is currently paying $900 a month to retain her health insurance from her past job through COBRA. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “I’d love to take advantage of this opportunity of not working to enjoy myself and do things. But you can’t psychologically allow yourself to do that, because you have no idea what your next real paycheck is going to be,” she said. To stay positive, Kopman said she takes walks. Amanda Lucier for HuffPost Career experts said emailing your job application is not as helpful as networking when you are an older job seeker. People keep working and looking for work into their 50s through their 80s both because they want to and because they have to, for their budgets. If you were born between 1943 and 1954 in America, you will not get full retirement benefits until you turn 66. And many older workers do not have enough saved up to retire comfortably. About 43% of people between 55 and 64 do not even have a retirement savings account, according to a 2022 survey of consumer finances from the Federal Reserve. Washington, D.C.-based Elizabeth White, who is now 70, is the author of “ 55, Underemployed, and Faking Normal: Your Guide to a Better Life ,” which is based on her experiences looking for work. After losing consulting jobs amid the 2008 Great Recession, White said she faced challenges with re-entering the job market, despite her advanced degrees and accomplished employment history. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); To make ends meet, she got a roommate and started taking a Greyhound bus at times for job interviews in New York, among other cost-cutting measures. “It was humbling to have the kind of background that I have and to have this whole thing [happen]. I felt like I had stepped on a banana peel,” she said. And she’s not alone with experiencing financial insecurity as an older adult. White said a lot of older workers will eventually give up searching for the types of jobs they once had and start looking for what she calls “a casserole of work.” “So they might [get] a little bit of Social Security, they might rent out a room in their place on Airbnb ... that older guy you see at Trader Joe’s bagging groceries is probably not there because he wants to be,” she said, as an example of what this series of money-making opportunities might entail. So if you’re an older job seeker, it helps to “get off your throne” and be open to changes and pivots, White said: “Sometimes you have to ... go back a couple of steps before you can go forward.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Support groups and networking can offer a much-needed confidence boost Mark Gyurina , chief program officer for job training nonprofit Operation ABLE, said a common challenge people in their 50s and 60s face is the reality of being single or widowed and needing to get back to work to support themselves. Darla Jelley is a 57-year-old single mom of a 17-year-old teenager who lives in Boston. Now that her daughter is almost an adult, Jelley wants to re-enter the workforce full time after taking part-time jobs doing eldercare. In April, she graduated from Operation ABLE’s 12-week job training program for older job seekers who meet federal low-income guidelines and are interested in working for medical offices. Jelley said the program taught her computer skills like how to craft a résumé and how to use Excel and PowerPoint. But more important than teaching her how to save files, the program boosted her confidence, Jelley said. Before the program, Jelley didn’t have much contact with the outside world except for her home-care clients. “I didn’t think I had anything to offer,” Jelley said about her skills. Studying to become a nurse has always been Jelley’s dream that she has not been able to afford doing. But through Operation ABLE, she has a few interviews lined up to be a hospital front office coordinator and a pharmacy technician that have tuition reimbursement programs. Recruiters came to her classes, which gave participants “a foot in the door for interviews,” Jelley said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Jelley said she once used to view her goal of becoming a nurse at 61 as “crazy.” But after her job training, “I don’t consider that at all. Like, I would do it in a heartbeat,” Jelley said. “People over 50 are not ready to be put out to pasture.” - Donna Kopman Even talking with fellow older job seekers can be a much-needed balm. When Greg Bailey lost his job at 56 in 2020, he joined an online job search support program called Who Ya Know four months into his search. He said ageism was one of the most common shared issues people talked about. “That was a huge lifesaver for me, because it does get very painful, it gets very lonely, especially when you’re not interacting with other people,” Bailey said. “The things that I was feeling, they were feeling too.” Bailey has since found a new sales job. Research finds that once you have been out of work for more than six months , it gets significantly harder at any age to find a job, but particularly for older job seekers. That’s why it’s critical for older job candidates to network to get past long-term unemployment biases on top of ageism. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Emailing résumés is not going to get you employed, you really have to be out there in the community,” Gyurina advised older job seekers. He said older job candidates should network extensively through internships, volunteering and part-time work to avoid résumé gaps and build references, and that they should take advantage of help that family or neighbors offer. Amanda Lucier for HuffPost Older job seekers like Kopman said they have experiences they can share with people new to the workforce. You never know who might lead you to your next job opportunity, so make time to invest in your relationships. “I often find that people in their 30s and 40s are much more knowledgeable about where the jobs are, who are the rising stars, where’s the money, where are the opportunities,” White said. “I’m applying for something now that I would not have heard of, but somebody told me about it.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); White gave a past career success as an example. She said she got into an entrepreneurial incubator, because someone in their 40s who was already in the incubator and had worked with her years ago, told her, “Oh, this would be a good opportunity for you.” If you’re not finding success with getting a regular 9-to-5 job, it might be time to forge your own path. White, who is now the founder of NUUage Coliving , which seeks shared affordable housing solutions for older adults, also pointed to entrepreneurship as a growing alternative path older job seekers can take. She cited 2019 research from the job nonprofit Kauffman Foundation, which found that more than 25% of new entrepreneurs were ages 55-64 ― a number up from about 15% in 1996. What older workers want others to know about job-hunting Ultimately, older employees are an asset to any company. Research backs up that older workers are less likely to quit and are more likely to have higher performance ratings than younger colleagues. And at their best, multigenerational teams can share their unique knowledge, networks and experiences for better ideas. But more hiring managers need to believe in this, too. Until then, don’t count out people just because of their age, older job seekers implore. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “At this stage of the game, I have no kids at home,” Nina said. “I don’t have to be home at 5. I can stay late, I can come in on the weekends, I’m not running out to drive anybody anywhere. To me, it seems like a no-brainer, like, ‘Give me this job.’” Nina said losing out to job candidates who are 20 years younger than her can make her feel self-doubt, but ultimately, “It’s your age, and ... it’s their loss.“ Nina is currently the oldest person at her video production job, and when she started, she believed she got “OK grandma” vibes from certain younger colleagues who avoided interacting with her. But the teammates who did take the time to know her now “lean on me for everything.” “You’ve got to be a trailblazer at a certain point,” Nina said. So don’t be ashamed of highlighting the skills and experiences your long career has given you. In the eyes of the right employer, it’s what will make you stand out. In his job interviews, Bailey highlighted the fact that “I don’t have to learn those things; I already know them.“ Or as Kopman puts it: “People over 50 are not ready to be put out to pasture. We have so much experience and personal learnings to be shared with colleagues who are new to the workforce.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Related jobs job search older women older workers 2 Common Work Questions That Are Secretly Ageism In Disguise Data Reveals An Infuriating Reason Women Over 40 Are Held Back At Work 9 Questions Job Candidates Should Never, Ever Be Asked In Interviews Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up An essential daily guide to achieving the good life Subscribe to our lifestyle email.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Illustration:Jianan Liu/HuffPost;Photo:Getty Images Middle managers have a tough, thankless job — but they are necessary for any organization. When you’re a middle manager, the pressure comes from all sides. You’re going to be held accountable for carrying out executives’ marching orders, but unlike senior leaders, you’re the one who has to directly sell leadership’s vision to your team. “Middle managers often have limited authority, yet they are held accountable for achieving results,” said Jenny Fernandez , an executive and leadership consultant. “This creates a feeling of being trapped between conflicting demands.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); In toxic situations, middle managers become the buffer between bad management and frustrated, anxious employees. “They are tasked with managing up and are responsible for delivering business goals that may be unrealistic due to external factors” like economic downturns and intense competition, as well as internal challenges like hiring freezes, budget cuts or reorganizations, Fernandez said. Advertisement Autumn Maison said that she experienced these types of demands firsthand as a middle manager at a major tech company. Maison recalled that during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, she felt a pressure to make sure her direct reports were productive at a difficult time, while also managing up the expectations from leadership. “I was getting increasingly frustrated, because it felt like every step that I was taking in every single decision I was making was the wrong one,” she said. “It was always this endless sort of building of frustration and angst, because it felt like I was just constantly letting people down.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Eventually, Maison hit her limit and said she became completely exhausted. She took six weeks of medical leave from work for her anxiety. “The tension I had been holding on to and all the adrenaline that had been keeping me through that period, it all hit at one time,” she recalled. “I was so depleted from that period.” Research has shown that middle managers are the type of employees most at risk of experiencing job burnout . Gallup survey results from 2021 found that managers were more likely to report higher levels of burnout and stress compared with direct reports. Why This Happens And What It Looks Like Psychologist and executive coach Lauren Appio said that middle manager burnout can show up as irritability, restlessness, a preoccupation with work, feelings of failure or ineffectiveness, difficulties with focus and concentration, or increased substance misuse. “They may find themselves with a fancier title and bigger scope of responsibilities, but without the resources or influence to do their job well,” Appio said about why middle managers have such a tough role. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Jocelyn Lai , the global head of talent acquisition at Duolingo, identifies as a middle manager. According to Lai, what can make middle management taxing is how you become the “secret-keeper” for your team. “That burden is on me, all the positives and all the negatives,” she said. “I have to figure out, what do I share and what do I not share with upper management?” As a middle manager, you have to balance the needs of your team with what upper management wants, and this can be challenging. In fact, an increasing number of younger middle managers say that these duties are too much to handle. Approximately 71% of middle managers say they “sometimes” or “always” feel overwhelmed, stressed or burned out at work ― and that number spiked to 75% for millennial and other middle managers under 35, according to a 2023 survey by productivity software company Capterra with responses from more than 300 middle managers in Australia, Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. According to Maison, something that can exacerbate burnout is how many middle managers are part of the “sandwich” generation ― a term used to describe the financial and emotional challenges of supporting both aging parents and young children. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Just as they are coming into more responsibilities at work, they may also be experiencing increasing or changing responsibilities outside of work, like parenting or caring for aging family members,” Appio said. “It’s a lot of pressure all around.” At the time of her middle manager burnout, Maison was taking care of her hospitalized father and two children, who needed her to show up and be present for them on top of dealing with her work demands. She described that time period as a “sandwich squeeze” from both her job and her personal life. “It felt like I was just constantly letting people down.” - Autumn Maison, a former middle manager at a major tech company Another thing that can be emotionally tough for middle managers is how teams expect more from them nowadays. As employees, we need them to help manage our careers, but more of us also want them to know what we are feeling and thinking ― and we want to know what they feel and think, too. “Modern middle managers face new challenges in managing diverse teams,” Fernandez said. “With four to five generations now in the workforce, conflicts and disagreements arise due to differing expectations, values and work styles.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Lai said that with younger, Generation Z colleagues who want more vulnerability, she will share glimpses of her personal life, but she’s learned that she does not have to “open the whole window.” Lai lays out explicit boundaries around what she does on the weekend, with language like “I really value my privacy in life, but I appreciate you asking.” She noted, “That boundary, I think just showing them what it is, is an act of vulnerability.” And when it comes to interpreting leadership’s decisions, Lai said it helps to be upfront that you are not an expert on everything. Lai said that she’s learned to be transparent with her team about when she does not agree with upper management’s decisions. Saying “here’s what I think,” “here’s what we’re doing as a company,” or “I don’t know why we’re doing it this way, but I’m going to find out the answer for you” is how she’ll frame the discussion, Lai added. “What I’ve learned is, if I say [that] I don’t agree with a certain aspect of it but I’m still committing to standing behind the company, it actually strengthens the message,” Lai said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Tips For Preventing Burnout As a middle manager, your well-being should be a top priority. “I have to first take care of myself to be then able to work through it with everyone else,” Lai said. She added that it helps to talk with other middle managers within your company who might have the “missing puzzle piece that [you’ve] been trying to figure out.” To prevent burnout, it also helps to understand the extent and limits of your power as a middle manager, Appio said. “You can be influential, but you cannot actually control other people’s behavior — your team members’ or your leaders’,” she said. “Therapy and coaching can be helpful with recognizing and tolerating this.” In some cases, it can help to ask executives to meet with your team and explain their decisions, said organizational psychologist Laura Gallaher of the consulting business Gallaher Edge . That way, “you can all work to get on the same page, and you have less weight on your shoulders to play the ‘middle person,’” she said. “This is especially useful for very critical changes, or changes that create a sense of loss for your teams.” And make sure to use the support that your company offers. Maison said she had a supportive workplace that allowed her to have the time off that she needed. She advised middle managers to take advantage of company-sponsored mental health benefits or ones that you’re entitled to in your state. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Also, it helps to know that middle management is not for everyone. Quitting is a perfectly fine option, too. Maison, now a New York City-based tech consultant, said that during her disability leave, she realized that her situation was untenable and resigned. “The environment that I was in was causing the anxiety, and going back into that environment would have led me to the exact same place of burnout,” she said. Maison said that her middle management burnout completely recalibrated her expectations for what she wanted from her life and career. She said she is now much more fulfilled as an individual contributor, because this role allows for more flexibility in her schedule and ownership over her time. “I thought that as a very driven person, that the path for me was very linear and that path was an upward line. But it doesn’t look like that to me anymore,” she said. “It looks like, ‘How does work fit into my life?’ not just, ‘How does my life revolve around work?’” People in other positions should be conscious of middle managers’ well-being, too. Although it can sometimes be a thankless job, middle managers are still necessary for any company. They deserve a shoutout for their hard work. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); A little gratitude and grace can count for a lot. Lai said that she still remembers a direct report who actively thanked her. That’s because middle managers’ jobs are both tough and rewarding under the best of circumstances. The “most effective middle managers are the systems thinkers,” Lai said. “They’re the ones who understand how this impacts five people over here, or how one person’s unhappiness could trickle into other things.” Lai said that most leaders in senior roles care about people, but middle managers are the ones who express that care and make people feel cared for. This involves “checking in with someone and having a conversation, [asking] them how their day is going. And that goes a long way,” Lai said. “I truly believe that that actually then makes the work more motivating. ... It helps team morale.” Related Work Business Management burnout Is Getting 'Layered' At Work A Demotion?

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life ciricvelibor via Getty Images Can being too nice at work be the reason you're not advancing? That's according to one recent TikTok. Are you a “pleasure to work with”? That could be why you’re not getting ahead at work ― even if you’re good at your job ― according to one viral TikTok. In the video , a TikToker named Jacqueline claims that people who are “a pleasure to work with” will “never get promoted” because executives “will never allow an employee who is both good at doing the work and good at keeping a smile on their face while doing the work move up the ladder, because they know they can keep serving you shit on a platter, and you’ll eat it with a smile.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); @jacquelameo but if I take a week off everything falls apart? it ain’t adding up ♬ original sound - jacqueline Her theory about the “curse” of being too pleasant has sparked a nerve. The video has been viewed more than 8 million times. But is it backed up by research? Are agreeable people more likely to be exploited and fall behind at work? It depends, experts say. Advertisement Why nice, competent people do, sometimes, finish last at work. In response to the TikTok, commenters to her video said that what Jacqueline was describing actually has a name: “ performance punishment .” Similar to a “ quiet promotion ,” it’s where you get more work dumped on you for being a high-achiever, but you do not get the rewards of a raise or a promotion. In this case, hardworking agreeable colleagues take on work that consistently goes above and beyond their job title. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Cynthia Pong, founder of Embrace Change , a career coaching and training firm, said a performance punishment mindset in organizations “does exist and can even run rampant.” “There absolutely is a perverse incentive there for leaders who would prefer that person to stay in the role where the high achiever is extremely competent, reliable and pleasant,” she said, noting that it can be due to the manager worrying if the workload is going to be done or done “with a smile” if other people do it instead. Lois P. Frankel, executive coach and author of “ Nice Girls Don’t Get the Corner Office: Unconscious Mistakes Women Make That Sabotage Their Careers ,” said there is a “kernel of truth” to the TikToker’s theory because being nice is “simply not sufficient for upward mobility. “Being nice and good at your job are ... just table stakes. You’ll most likely get to stay in the game, but you won’t win it,” Frankel said. She noted that it’s often women who face a social stereotype to be “nice,” which can backfire in the office: “You can’t be the nice little girl you were taught to be in childhood and expect to achieve your adult goals.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); In this way, if your niceness is making you too agreeable to what other co-workers demand, it’s a problem. Signs you are a pushover and how to break out of the cycle. There’s a key tipping point when your agreeable nature is leading you to become a pushover at work. Pong said if the following is true, you might be one: Your needs always come last. You avoid conflict at all costs. You feel resentful about your workload. The gulf between what you say and how you really feel inside is significant, or widening. Even the thought of saying ‘no’ to a request at work gives you anxiety. One way to break out of the pushover cycle is to set boundaries that will help you prioritize your own career needs. “Before you say ‘yes’ to tasks, events, and even conversations at work, pause and take a few minutes to reply,” advised career strategist Ana Goehner said. “If the task will not help you become more visible, learn new skills, challenge you, or add to your career, then politely say no.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); But once you turn down a request, you need to show your value in other ways. “Look for opportunities to not simply do your job but add value by questioning less effective ways of doing things, and proposing new ways that would save or make your company money,” Frankel advised. “Now you’re not just nice, you’re also strategic.” Frankel said to actively volunteer for high-profile assignments, even if these bigger bets could fail: “You’re either going to be seen as a hero if you succeed, or brave if things don’t quite turn out the way you hoped.” Pong said it also helps to get the help of a public-facing sponsor who can back you up and help you get promoted if you’re meeting resistance. Keep in mind that jerks don’t necessarily get ahead at work, either. If you are too agreeable, you may become the pushover your colleagues exploit to further their own careers. But simply bulldozing your way up the ranks with your unpleasant, brash demeanor is not a good career strategy, either. In his 2020 study , Cameron Anderson, a professor of organizational behavior at the Haas School of Business at University of California, Berkeley, measured college and graduate students’ selfish, combative, manipulative personalities prior to getting jobs, and then assessed the power and rank they held at work 14 years later. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Anderson found that disagreeableness did not give people a leg up at their jobs, even in more cutthroat environments. “Disagreeable people are no more ― or less ― likely to gain power because they engage in two kinds of behaviors that have offsetting effects,” Anderson told HuffPost. “On the one hand, they are intimidating to others. This would have helped them gain power, except that their behavior also repels others. Their colleagues and coworkers maintain a distance from them, which isolates them and reduces their power.” In this way, the TikToker’s argument that “people who are a pleasure to work with will never get promoted” is “just flat wrong,” Anderson said, because it is “irrelevant to getting ahead. Other traits matter far more.” The personality trait you actually need to get promoted. Anderson said there is actually one personality trait that will determine how far ahead you get at work, and it’s not dependent on how pleasant you are to work with. He said assertiveness is the key personality trait associated with gaining power. He defines it as “being self-assured, confident and forceful.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “It doesn’t mean being aggressive or bullying, but instead means believing in your abilities and ideas and pushing for yourself,” he explained. “If you are assertive, you are more likely to gain power, regardless of whether you are agreeable or disagreeable.” So don’t count yourself out if you have a reputation for being nice. It is still possible to be collegial and powerful. Anderson gave the example of imagining a leader you admire. Often it might be “someone who cares about their people, treats their people with respect, but who is also a strong leader and is willing to make difficult decisions and to fight for their people,” he said. In other words, pleasant people can be effective leaders when they are able to demonstrate both pleasantness ― or respect and concern for their people ― and assertiveness, or being willing to fight for them. It’s a good lesson for those who worry they are too nice to climb the ranks ― plenty of nice people outlast and outwit the jerks, but those leaders have the assertiveness to back up their pleasant charm. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Many workplaces often mistake pleasant and quiet people for weak and powerless [people],” Goehner said. But in fact, “most people value and remember leaders who were nice to them, including those who have shown humility, vulnerability and support. It’s all about what type of leader you want to be and what people say about you when you are not in the room.” Related TikTok Work promotion You May Get A 'Quiet Promotion' And Not Realize Until It's Too Late 5 Signs You're Being Undervalued At Work, And What To Do About It Can You Work For An Unethical Boss Without Becoming Unethical?

Check out some promising reviews from Amazon buyers: “After going through 3 sets of $200 Apple AirPods Pro’s in the last year, the speakers always blew out, I wanted to try something different, I had beats back in high school and they were the best quality headphones I had, so I figured I’d see what their Apple equivalent had to offer, and I’m beyond impressed. For HALF the price, you get a more comfortable and lighter earbud that you can barely tell is in your ear, and doesn’t hurt sitting in my ears after an hour like the AirPods, but most importantly, the sound quality is 10x better, a lot clearer with more bass, as well as they higher output of volume. These are as loud as AirPods at 3/4 volume when AirPods are at full volume. They also have the same tapping features as the AirPods for song skipping, pausing, and calls so it’s not like having to relearn a different style from before. I will never waste the money on AirPods again.” — Juliana Straessley “This earbuds are so incredible. I love the pink color. They are comfortable to wear once you figure out how to properly place them in your ear. They pair quickly on your device and I have used them on Android and Windows PC as well. The battery life is amazing, which was the biggest thing I was looking for when deciding which earbuds to buy. They also charge super quick and I love the little case. And the sound quality is very good. I am not an expert on audio but for a casual person that loves to listen to music, watch movies and play videogames this work great . So happy with my purchase!” — Gabriela Fernandez “I am personally super pleased with these headphones...The entire time I’m working out though, my headphones have no issue staying in my ear, the sound quality is amazing, and they have an excellent noise cancellation. Every once in a while you have to adjust them and push them more in your ear if the noise cancellation isn’t perfect, but thats every ear bud, if you don’t want to deal with that then get yourself a set of over the ear headphones. I think this purchase was one hundred percent worth the price! I got them almost a month ago, only charging them a few minutes here and there and they still haven’t been on low battery mode. I was using skullcandy ANC earbuds and honestly they just kept breaking on me, 30/40$ adds up if you have to keep buying a new pair every six months. I would rather pay a hundred bucks at this point for a pair of headphones that work than to not be inconvenienced at the gym with not being able to workout because my headphones broke, and keep buying a new pair of headphones which in the end, end up more costly than this pair anyways.” — Tabby $79.95 at Amazon (originally $149.99) $79.99 at Target (originally $149.99) Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Related shopping sales headphones earbuds AirTags Are Secretly Back Down To Their Black Friday Price – But We Don’t Know For How Long 22 Foolproof Gifts For Anyone Who’s Impossible To Please The Magical $20 Nail Concealer That Helped Me Slash My Mani-Pedi Budget This article was paid for by and created by HuffPost’s Branded Creative Team.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Oscar Wong via Getty Images High-functioning anxiety often doesn't look like a serious mental health issue, but it certainly can affect your daily life. High-functioning anxiety can go unnoticed. It’s a term that is often used to describe a person who struggles with symptoms of anxiety such as racing thoughts, body tension or frequent worrying ― however, this person can mask or hide these symptoms and appear “fine” on the outside. “It’s not a diagnosis, but rather someone who has anxiety but still goes about their day-to-day lives managing it,” said licensed clinical psychologist Scott Lyons . “They are typically someone who is successful and performs well but internally or at home experience this anxiety, rather than showing it in a work or public setting.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Someone may experience anxiety at work for a lot of different reasons: deadlines, toxic work relationships, job security concerns and so much more. “People with high-functioning anxiety often are successful at work but will mask this anxiety to others,” Lyons explained. “It also is a sign of compound stress, like there’s too many things to focus on, and there’s not enough resources or control of the future.” On the outside, someone with high-functioning anxiety may appear to have it all together and yet their internal world and even their mental health is suffering. They are constantly in the mode of “something bad will happen if I do not get this done,” which can be pretty difficult to handle day in and day out. Advertisement Not sure if you actually show signs of high-functioning anxiety at work? We spoke with psychology and mental health experts to lay out six work habits that are secretly high-functioning anxiety: 1. Being a perfectionist and having to be the best at everything. “Perfectionism is a huge sign of high-functioning anxiety as you work to be the best at everything, which is an impossible task,” explained Erin L. Moran, a licensed mental health counselor in Jacksonville, Florida. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); A perfectionist “often places a lot of shame and blame on yourself or others any time something is perceived as less than perfect,” she added. The thought of your boss or co-worker being upset or disappointed in you, despite there being zero specific evidence that they actually are, may occur in your strides to be perfect. While you’re doing well with your tasks at work, if your personal relationships with those in your office are seemingly not up to the standards of those with high-functioning anxiety, you may begin assuming the feelings and intentions of others and personalizing them. “Someone with high-functioning anxiety may be a perfectionist with their work or conversations as they are anxious of how it will be perceived by others,” Lyons said. 2. Having difficulty focusing on tasks due to stress and worry. Getting distracted and not being able to focus on your tasks at work are two very common occurrences for those who have high-functioning anxiety. Often, those who experience issues with concentration and focus will implement their own coping mechanisms to be able to work efficiently. For example, some people may wear headphones at work. “A person with high-functioning anxiety may wear headphones because this helps them feel less distracted and more in control of the information they receive,” Lyons said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The stress, worry and anxiety is to blame for the lack of focus at work and “will eventually lead you to have more difficulty staying present on your tasks,” Moran said. “When a person becomes overworked, over-stressed and places high pressure on themselves, there is an increased likelihood of their brain dropping some things due to the emotional energy drain attached to anxiety.” 3. Seeking reassurance and validation from others. Reassurance and validation are two very important things for those with high-functioning anxiety in the workplace because it will dictate how they perform, their thoughts, and emotions every time they come to work. “At work, people with high-functioning anxiety will often seek reassurance on their work or projects from others to ease their anxiety,” Lyons said. Seeking validation often reflects a fear response. “Validation is super important and helpful, but when you need your boss or co-worker to frequently provide this feedback without the ability to gauge your own success, this can create a sense of not being good enough when the likely reality is that other people are busy in their own work and will forget to praise or acknowledge you, which is not a reflection of doing anything wrong,” Moran explains. Reassurance may also come in the form of interacting regularly with certain co-workers only. “They find people safe and more reassuring than others and, outside of those select individuals, they may not socialize at all,” said Michele Leno , a psychologist and founder of DML Psychological Services in Michigan. “They may even shun others’ attempts to get to know them.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 4. Overreacting to the slightest change in routine. A routine is predictable and not anxiety-inducing. However, when there is a slight change, it can really stir up the entire day for someone with high-functioning anxiety. “The person with high-functioning anxiety may view change as total injustice and spend days talking about it, as they can’t afford any disturbance to their routine,” Leno said. 5. Comparing yourself to your co-workers. Along with perfectionism and seeking validation, comparison is common in those with high-functioning anxiety. “The root of this is insecurity attached to anxiety,” Moran said. “This is often associated with a fear of rejection, a desire to be seen as worthy, and overall pressure associated with attempting to be seen as good enough and not wanting to experience any negative feedback from others.” 6. Keeping yourself super-busy throughout the workday. In efforts to feel worthy at work, it’s not uncommon for someone who has high-functioning anxiety to keep themselves extremely busy. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “This might include volunteering for extra projects, despite these additional projects creating additional stress and strain and not having the time to fully focus on them,” Moran said. “This often creates burnout due to the constant pressure and lack of balance in workload.” Because of the overwhelming need to stay busy, these people will often arrive early to work and stay late in hopes to get ahead of any possible issues or changes. They’ll also rarely say “no” to things. “ Often people with high-functioning anxiety tend to be people-pleasers and will be hesitant to say no when they’re asked to do something,” Lyons explained.

What To Do If You Have High-Functioning Anxiety If these signs resonate with your work life, there are steps you can take to help you feel more at ease, mentally and physically, at work: Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Deep-Breathing Exercises Deep breathing is something that can help anxiety in the moment. Our bodies naturally respond to taking deep breaths and will calm down when the parasympathetic nervous system is activated, per the Cleveland Clinic . Consider Counseling And Therapy Speaking to someone else about what you’re struggling with at work may help you immensely with your high-functioning anxiety. Not only will it help you talk about the things that cause you anxiety, it can help you learn to effectively manage your symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is one option that helps people learn to reframe their thoughts about life and transform those behaviors that feed your anxiety. This could help you manage your thoughts, find solutions that work for you, and navigate your way through anxious moments.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Moor Studio via Getty Images This clichéd job advice remains popular but can ring especially hollow after layoffs. “Make yourself indispensable.” Work long enough, and at some point, you’ll hear this pithy advice from well-meaning colleagues about how you can advance your career. It remains a top-searched topic on TikTok and a piece of so-called wisdom that executives will share in interviews. Former CEO of PepsiCo Indra Nooyi, for example, said in a 2019 interview that it’s a mantra that helped her succeed at getting PepsiCo to accommodate her parenting needs. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “If you establish a niche for yourself, and make yourself indispensable based on competence, what can they do without you?” Nooyi said at the 2019 Women in the World Summit. In the interview, Nooyi said it was her indispensability that OK’d the corporate decision for her children to hang out with her in her office after 5 p.m. The underlying message is that if you work hard and make your skillset unique, the company will reward your efforts, encourage your development and meet your needs. Advertisement Maybe it’s comforting to hear this because it gives you a sense of empowerment and control over your career. And if you’re a senior leader like Nooyi, maybe this advice works. But there are glaring problems with this supposed wisdom. For one, the idea that you should make yourself indispensable rings especially hollow after mass layoffs of talented individuals that feel completely arbitrary. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “I think that this advice makes us feel like we have some control over what companies decide to do when we absolutely do not [have control] if a company decides to eliminate a product or shut down a division or scale down a department,” said career and leadership coach Phoebe Gavin . “They’re just going to do that.“ Similar to the advice that you should not job-hop too soon after taking a new job, career coach Jasmine Escalera said the “make yourself indispensable” advice feeds “this concept that corporate America is the one in charge. And so I think ‘making yourself indispensable’ is just another way of saying, ‘You’re supposed to focus on their wants and needs, not your own.’” This mentality can also trap you in roles you don’t want or force you to stretch yourself thin. For Escalera, internalizing the “indispensable” advice at a job meant she believed that “they make the decisions, and you have to adapt to that.” Eventually after five years, this belief led to her burnout . “I was always focused on what the company wanted, and trying to make myself indispensable. And inevitably, what I started to realize was that what I was trying to do, and what I was trying to work within really wasn’t even what I wanted to do with my career,” she recalled. Her wake-up call was “going through a divorce and realizing that committing to my job so intensely was one of the factors that led to that,” Escalera said. “It was really burnout. Like, I felt like I was burning myself out for a company that wasn’t paying me what I deserved.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “‘Making yourself indispensable’ is just another way of saying, ‘You’re supposed to focus on their wants and needs, not your own.’” - Career coach Jasmine Escalera Executive coach and career strategist Susan Peppercorn said “make yourself indispensable” is advice she’s heard all the time throughout her career, but being irreplaceable to a team can trap you into roles you’ve outgrown. She gave the example of a career coaching job she had for laid-off professionals. After 13 years in that role, Peppercorn asked her employer if she could transition to a leadership role with workshop facilitation. “I was very successful in that role. But I was getting tired of doing it. I was getting bored. And so I wanted to do something else. And the response I got when I asked to do something else was ... ‘No, we want you to keep doing what you’ve been doing,’” Peppercorn said. “The reality was, I had made myself indispensable.” It’s a hard lesson that just because you deserve to be rewarded and promoted, doesn’t mean that it’ll happen. Peppercorn said as a result, she quit that job. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Tom Werner via Getty Images There’s a better way to layoff-proof your career than internalizing \"make yourself indispensable.\" Alternative Career Advice To Follow Instead This doesn’t mean, however, you just throw your hands up and believe that you have zero agency over your career. “Make yourself indispensable to your employer” without any caveats is bad advice, but being seen as reliable and a hard worker are good qualities to have on a team. Peppercorn said making yourself indispensable is not bad advice if you have a clear expectation of what it means and if the colleague who believes in it has the power to advance your career into roles you want. “Are you learning new skills? Is that a pathway to a promotion? You need to know that,” she said. But don’t assume that making your boss’ life easier will automatically help your career, though. Escalera said being a solution-finder to your boss’ problems can help you advance, but before you start agreeing to their requests, you should take a step back and ask yourself, “Am I even doing the work that matches what I want to do?” And then you can use that answer to find the right environments, companies and jobs that actually connect to your personal mission. There’s a better way to layoff-proof your career than this approach, too. Gavin said she thinks everyone receives this advice, “but folks from ... historically marginalized backgrounds are more likely to deeply internalize it, and also have it sort of turned into self-blame versus motivation.“ Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); You cannot guarantee you’ll avoid being laid off, but you can prepare yourself for that scenario. Gavin said that instead of internalizing the message of becoming indispensable, professionals can focus on building their layoff resiliency. According to Gavin, there are three pillars on how to do that: 1. Build a financial cushion that allows you to say no. “If you have money in the bank, then it’s easier to say no to demands and requests from employers that you aren’t interested in,” Gavin said. “It’s easier for you to step away from a role that’s not working for you.“ Actress Lucy Liu dubs this power move as investing in “‘fuck you’ money.” In a 2013 interview with “DP/30: The Oral History Of Hollywood,” Liu recalled picking up catering jobs in her 20s and working a lot to be able to say “no” to jobs that did not serve her. “If you have it, and something’s not working out, and they say you have to take this job otherwise you’re fired, you can be like, ‘Fuck you,’” Liu said. 2. Research what skills make you marketable in your industry. Gavin said it helps to make your skill set “really strong and up to date” to the needs of your industry. You can do this at your current job by taking on projects or initiatives that allow you to develop skills that you can demonstrate to a future employer, she said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 3. Invest in your professional network. “Humans are social creatures, we tend to share information and give the benefit of the doubt to folks that we know, and we tend not to do that with folks that we don’t know,” Gavin said. “And so if you have great skills, but you don’t have a great network, it is still going to be much more challenging for you to step into another role.“ Once you break away from the mindset of serving your boss and your company’s bottom-line, you start to be in service of yourself. Under capitalism, you cannot be indispensable to an employer, but you can make commitments to yourself that last you past any one job. This story was previously published on an earlier date.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Tim Robberts via Getty Images Therapists say there's one common belief about happiness that's actually preventing us from experiencing it more often. According to the 2024 World Happiness Survey , the United States is no longer one of the 20 happiest countries. It’s pretty glum news, but not necessarily surprising. While some of our stressors and sources of grief are out of our control, or might constitute a “ permacrisis ,” there’s also a common misunderstanding about happiness that’s plaguing us. This belief often stands in the way of us truly experiencing regular, daily joy. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); The misunderstanding in question: that happiness is an end goal, or something we can’t have right now. In reality, we can cultivate happiness every day and before our goals are met. So why do we think otherwise? Why do we see happiness as an end goal? Here are a few reasons, according to therapists. The ‘American dream’ ideology. This viewpoint is partially rooted in cultural and societal norms, according to Hayli Evans , a therapist who specializes in trauma. In the U.S., many of us see productivity and hard work as top-tier. It leads us to constantly chase after the elusive “American Dream” ― the idea that if we’re productive all the time, we’ll be successful, happy and financially stable. “People are taught that work and play are to be kept separate, and often, we do not prioritize rest at all,” Evans said. “We commonly ‘live for the weekend,’ perpetuating the idea that happiness is something to be chased, or something reserved for later.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Thanks to this mindset (and thanks to capitalism), there’s always something we feel we should “fix” before we’re “allowed” to be happy, whether it’s our bodies, our relationship status or our job titles. Then, when we get to that point, we may confront the arrival fallacy , the illusion that meeting a goal brings lasting happiness. Or we might discover that the happiness doesn’t last. “Our society has turned [achieving happiness and reaching your full potential] into a way to measure success,” said Aurisha Smolarski , a Los Angeles-based therapist, certified co-parenting coach and author of “Cooperative Co-Parenting for Secure Kids: The Attachment Theory Guide to Raising Kids in Two Homes.” “Thus, you might feel happy for a moment when you achieve one success, but then you immediately jump to the next goal. And whatever happiness you found evaporates.” The ‘happily ever after’ ending. Further, we’ve grown up hearing that “happily ever afters” only come at the end of a story. “Hollywood has sold us an idea of ‘happily ever after,’ from fairy tales to rom-coms,” said Jenny Maenpaa , a licensed psychotherapist, author and founder of the Forward in Heels coaching practice. “We have grown up with the idea that happiness is a destination that we reach and then we hang on to for dear life.” It’s easier and more comfortable. Envisioning true happiness as something that’s coming ― rather than something already at our fingertips ― gives us hope. It gets us through less-than-ideal times. Basically, it’s self-protective. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “In many ways, it’s easier to live in the future, because if you’re not happy in the present moment, then all you need to do is think about how your life will be better when you lose weight, make more money, have a partner, own a home, etc.,” said Tess Brigham , a licensed therapist, certified coach and author of “True You: A Step-by-Step Guide to Conquering Your Quarter-Life Crisis.” Constant encouragement to set yourself up for success... ...which means you can’t take time for pleasure now. “We’re told by our parents over and over again, ‘Work hard in school so you can get into a good college.’ ‘Work hard in college you can get a good job,’ and so on,” Brigham said. “We’re told that we have to do these things that we don’t want to do and don’t enjoy so that our future selves will be happy.” Fly View Productions via Getty Images “Chronically postponing enjoyment increases our impulse to numb ourselves when we feel overwhelmed or too stressed to function,” said therapist Hayli Evans. Why It’s Unhelpful To Think Of Happiness As An End Goal For starters, this type of thinking makes us more likely to feel unhappy (and when happiness is so close!). Evans said many people think they’ll be happy once they’ve attended to their (never-ending) responsibilities. But besides robbing us of the joys of the present moment, this can lead to a plethora of negative emotions. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “We end up being more anxious, more depressed and less satisfied in our lives,” Evans said. “Chronically postponing enjoyment increases our impulse to numb ourselves when we feel overwhelmed or too stressed to function .” In an attempt to avoid the dreariness, she said, we may reach for substances or social media , which keeps us from “investing our time and energy in the relationships and activities that will bring true fulfillment.” Next, this kind of mindset can keep us from having complete, intimate relationships. Smolarski has heard many people say they “just want to be happy,” and she’ll challenge them to see the upside of occasional negative emotions. “[Just being happy] makes it difficult for them to be empathic to their own or someone else’s experience that conflicts with or threatens their protective stance around being happy,” she explained. “For some people, this becomes an avoidance strategy, whereby they push aside the full range of emotions, and instead aim to keep the peace with people who may be afraid of conflict.” Additionally, if you put too much pressure on the idea of happiness, and you expect perfection, you may struggle to feel like you’ll ever attain it. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Because we are unable to sustain happiness, we are always confronted with the feeling that we have somehow fallen short,” Smolarski said. “In fact, what has happened is that we have lost touch with the state of being, in which we are content with what is.” Shame can play a role, too. “You’re consciously, or unconsciously, telling yourself the person you are today isn’t enough,” Brigham said. Finally, this mentality inhibits you from living your life in the moment. Have you ever looked at a picture of your body years ago , or recalled a memory, and wished you appreciated it more? It’s easy to forget to be mindful and grateful, but that’s one thing that keeps us stuck in discontentment. “It’s unhelpful because you’re not really living your life,” Brigham said. “Your life is happening now, and the more you live in the past or future, you’re not allowing yourself to be in the moment and enjoy what you’re experiencing.” Maskot via Getty Images Knowing that constant happiness isn't the goal, and allowing yourself to be grateful for little moments, will increase your perceived joy. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Better Ways To Feel Happiness, According To Therapists There are several solutions, both in the short and the long term, that can help you think of happiness differently and feel it more regularly. They include: Recognizing that happiness can exist in any moment. In hard times, happiness requires more work — but it’s doable. “Happiness exists in the moment that we experience it,” Evans said. “Happiness is experienced through mindfulness ... When we are mindful, we are able to tune in to pleasure, gratitude, joy — the ingredients that make up ‘happiness.’” This could involve taking a moment to appreciate nature, or being grateful you have a job (even when it’s stressful). Knowing that constant happiness isn’t actually the goal. Emotions are supposed to change, and they all have a purpose. Anger, for example, tells us that something isn’t OK. “We need to experience a full range of emotions,” Evans said. “However, if we find that we are sitting in stress, sadness [or] anxiety, but never allow ourselves to experience happiness, we might need to investigate what’s going on.” She recommended addressing this with loved ones and a trusted mental health professional.

Do you have perceptions of what happiness is, or ideas about when you can or can’t feel it, that might be holding you back? “Shifting our mindset about happiness and about our present moment can help us to give permission to experience it more frequently,” Evans said. She loves Zabie Yamasaki’s trauma-informed yoga affirmation card deck. Being more mindful of the present moment, and practicing gratitude. Evans said the purpose is to “be here, now.” Silent walks , meditation, breath work and journaling are all ways to practice this. Along the way, Evans encouraged noticing and exploring any thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations that arise. Additionally, gratitude can bring happiness through similar actions and pursuits, such as journaling, spirituality, bringing your mind to the present and listing what you’re thankful for ― for example, a supportive friend, an apartment or a sunny day. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Afterward, Evans said to “spend a few moments really sitting in what that gratitude feels like. Notice your body’s response to gratitude.” Rolling with whatever feeling comes your way. When we feel an emotion we don’t want to feel, it’s easy to experience shame or hopelessness as a result. Try acceptance and self-compassion instead. “Instead of fighting negative feelings, roll with them,” Maenpaa advised. Journaling. Specifically, with pen and paper. Maenpaa said research shows that physically writing things down activates parts of the brain that typing doesn’t. “Writing down our worries and fears actually releases them from our short-term memories, allowing us to feel that space with new thoughts, ones that can be happier and more rewarding,” she said. Creating meaningful daily rituals. First, consider what makes you happy and aligns with your purpose (if you have an idea of what that is). Then, brainstorm how to turn that into a ritual. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Focus on the little things, such as a morning cup of coffee, hugging your kid, writing for a half hour per day, fixing a plumbing issue or planning a date night with your partner,” Smolarski suggested. Reminding yourself of what is in your control. Happiness is created within, but it can be affected by external events ― anything from a friend’s betrayal to a health diagnosis to oppression. It’s OK to validate that; there’s no need for toxic positivity . What might be more helpful after validating yourself, though, is focusing on what you can do. “If you’re not happy and you’ve identified the reasons why are in your control, great — you can now start doing things to change it,” Brigham said. “If you determine that your happiness or unhappiness is out of your control, then you can acknowledge this is how you feel and accept it.” She added that statements like “I’m feeling sad and there’s nothing I can do about it, but I know it will pass” can actually help you move through and process your feelings faster. In short, don’t wait until you get married or promoted to be happy. Engage in micro-acts of joy every day with gratitude.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Oscar Wong via Getty Images Some people don't even realize they're dealing with a form of depression. While it’s not an official medical diagnosis, high-functioning depression is more common than most people think. That’s because, as the name suggests, a person with high-functioning depression doesn’t fit the “typical” profile that may come to mind when we think of someone living with depression. People with high-functioning depression don’t sleep all day, and their colleagues or family members might not suspect anything is wrong. Instead, “the struggles are often hidden behind success and productivity,” explained licensed psychologist Natasha Trujillo . Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Someone with high-functioning depression will probably not have issues performing well at work or fulfilling responsibilities at home. They may even use these productive actions to cope. Often, someone with high-functioning depression might not even know they’re depressed at all. So, what are the signs to look out for if you suspect you might be dealing with high-functioning depression? And what can you do about it? We asked mental health experts, and here’s what they had to say. Advertisement The top sign of high-functioning depression most people miss Trujillo says the top high-functioning depression sign to look out for is that you don’t experience any sustained sense of joy or pleasure, despite good things happening. “People with high-functioning depression remain productive, successful, and able to achieve,” she said. “And yet, the person may not be able to maintain a mood of pride, joy, or pleasure for long, or they may pick apart a compliment or achievement to somehow make it ‘less than’ or inadequate in some way, emphasizing that they may not be deserving or they just got lucky.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Therapist Becca Reed agrees with this. “Someone with high-functioning depression might feel disconnected, as if they are going through the motions without genuine engagement or joy,” she said. “This detachment can manifest as a lack of interest in activities they once enjoyed, a sense of being stuck in a routine or feeling emotionally flat even in situations that would typically bring about strong emotions.” Trujillo emphasized that there are other signs a person might have high-functioning depression. These may include: Forcing themselves to be social and go through the motions, even if they want to withdraw Doing everything they’re supposed to do, but feeling like it takes more effort than it should Having a hard time concentrating Feeling fatigued, hopeless or worthless, even though they can’t explain why Feeling sad most of the time, with little or no relief Changes in sleeping and eating patterns simon2579 via Getty Images Therapy can be beneficial for people living with high-functioning depression. What to do if you suspect you or a loved one is suffering from high-functioning depression High-functioning depression is serious, and just as with more overt forms of depression, its consequences if untreated can include substance misuse and suicidal ideation. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); In fact, someone with high-functioning depression might actually be at greater risk for suicide attempts because they feel so isolated in their experience, according to Saba Harouni Lurie , a licensed marriage and family therapist. So, getting help is key. The first thing Trujillo encouraged is to work on being more open with loved ones about what you are experiencing. “Being more vulnerable can help you gain support and connection,” she said. “You can also work on focusing on what in your life isn’t actually working for you, and initiate ways to change what’s maintaining your depression.” And of course, finding help from a mental health professional should be a priority. “The most important thing to do is to seek [professional] support,” Lurie said. “Many people with high-functioning depression don’t seek out help, because they interpret their ability to still function relatively normally as a sign that they aren’t struggling as much as others with more overt symptoms may be.” Reed noted that a therapist can provide you with someone to talk through difficult emotions with, and can offer invaluable coping skills that you may not be able to get from friends or family members. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “A therapist can provide you with tools to help you regulate your nervous system in an effort to increase resiliency and overall mood,” she said. “It can also be helpful to incorporate activities that nurture well-being, such as exercise, hobbies, and social time.” Medications like SSRIs, also called antidepressants, are always an option as well, and they work well for many people . A psychiatrist or doctor should be able to chat with you about exploring a prescription. High-functioning depression is tricky, and it can be hard to know if you’re dealing with it — and even harder to tell if a loved one is. But by looking out for certain signs, you can identify the issue and work toward getting necessary help as quickly as possible. If you or someone you know needs help, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org for mental health support.

Too many Americans are trapped in toxic jobs, a problem employers and employees need to take more seriously. Jeffrey Pfeffer, an organizational behavior professor at Stanford who wrote the book “ Dying for a Paycheck ,” found through his research that poor management in U.S. companies accounted for up to 8 percent of annual health costs and was associated with 120,000 excess deaths every year. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Your body may know before you fully do that your job is to blame for your stress symptoms, sending you red alerts that you are not okay. You can’t sleep “A lot of times the first thing we’ll hear about is sleepless nights ,” said Maryland-based clinical psychologist Monique Reynolds of the Center for Anxiety and Behavior Change . “ People report either not being able to sleep because their mind is racing or not being able to stay asleep. They wake up in the middle of the night thinking about their to-do list.” Advertisement A few restless nights is not a huge deal, but if it becomes a pattern, that may be a sign your job stress has become toxic. “If it’s consistently related to work, that is a sign that something is off-balance,” Reynolds said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); You get headaches Your muscles tense up to guard your body from injury. When you see the workplace as a danger zone, it keeps your muscles wound tight, according to the American Psychological Association . Chronic tension in the neck, shoulders and head can be associated with migraines and tension headaches . “Stress creates physiological symptoms, and that manifests as pain,” said Reynolds. Your muscles in general ache When your job is toxic, it can feel like you’re fighting off a wild tiger at your desk. Under a perceived threat, your brains flood your system with adrenaline and other stress hormones. “Our nervous systems in toxic jobs are constantly on edge,” Reynolds said. “We are constantly anticipating, ready to react to an unpleasant boss or co-worker.” If you are always typing “just following up” emails with your shoulders hunched and your jaw clenched, this could be a sign that your job is impacting your health. Your mental health gets worse Reynolds noted that increased stress can exacerbate existing mental health issues. “Someone who might be a worrier in a really toxic work environment; that worry will often exacerbate to cross the clinical threshold,” she said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); If you feel like your boss is always out to get you, your mental health pays a price. One 2012 analysis of 279 studies linked perceptions of organizational unfairness with employee health complaints such as overeating and depression. E. Kevin Kelloway, the Canada Research Chair in Occupational Health Psychology at St. Mary’s University, said that unfair treatment at work can cause us outsized stress. “Injustice is a particularly toxic stressor because it strikes at the core of who we are,” he said. “When you treat me unfairly you attack my dignity as a person —essentially saying that I don’t deserve fair treatment or to be treated the same as others.” You get sick more often If you are catching colds constantly, consider how you are feeling about your job. A large body of research shows that chronic stress can compromise the immune system, making you more susceptible to illness. You lose interest in sex How you spend your time reflects what you value. When you bring your work home with you, your relationships can suffer. The American Psychological Association notes that when women have to juggle professional stress on top of their ongoing personal and financial obligations, it can reduce sexual desire. For men, this chronic stress can result in lower testosterone production, which in turn leads to lower libido. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “There has to be a certain amount of relaxation in order to allow the arousal feeling to arise,” Reynolds said. “Then there’s the time factor. People report not having enough time to have sex.” You are tired all the time This is fatigue, a bone-deep weariness that no nap or weekend lie-in seems to cure. Kelloway noted that “there is no set way that individuals react to a toxic workplace,” but he said that fatigue is in the range of physical symptoms employees may feel. Toxic jobs can create a cycle that drains us, said Pfeffer. “ You’re feeling overwhelmed, because you’re working too long, and you’re working too long because you’re feeling overwhelmed,” he said. Your stomach is acting up Indigestion, constipation, bloating can all be associated with stress, because stress impacts what the gut digests and can also change our gut bacteria, which in turn impacts our mood. It’s why you may get stomach pangs when you are upset, said Kelloway, who experienced this himself in one toxic job. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “About six months in I started to notice that every Sunday afternoon I developed a pain in my stomach. It was not the symptom but the timing (just as I was starting to think about what I had to do on Monday morning) that alerted me to the connection to the job,” he said. “All symptoms went away when I quit the job and moved on to something else.” Your appetite changes Your appetite is closely linked to your brain. Under acute stress, your fight-or-flight response releases adrenaline, telling your body to suppress digestion to focus on saving us from a perceived danger, according to the Harvard Health Letter . Under long-term stress, though, your body’s adrenal glands release and build up cortisol, a hormone which can increase hunger. When your job is causing long-term emotional distress, you may turn to food for comfort. Harvard also reports that eating sugary foods may blunt stress-related responses and emotions, which is why they’re often seen as comfort foods ― but that’s an unhealthy habit you should avoid. What you can do to combat this Take breaks. After your body goes on high alert to defend you from unreasonable demands and bad bosses, you need to give it time off. “When we don’t give our nervous system an opportunity to relax and reset itself, it starts to cause long-term damage,” Reynolds explained. She said that companionship outside of the workplace , meditation and exercise can help to offset the stress symptoms. Reframe negative thinking. One of the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy is that how you think can change how you feel. “It’s not possible for everyone to switch jobs, but we can focus on the situation that we can control,” Reynolds said. We can use mindfulness to manage our unhelpful rumination about how the presentation went or what our colleagues are thinking about us. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Leave. See this as the warning that you need to get a new job or else. Pfeffer said that long hours, absence of autonomy, uncertain scheduling and economic insecurity at jobs are all factors that contribute to a toxic workplace environment that employees need to leave behind, not just cope with. “You need to fix the underlying problem, not deal with the symptoms,” he said.

    "article_content": "In a viral X (formerly Twitter) post shared last month, @mu2myoc claimed a Gen Z applicant refused to do a 90-minute Excel task in the interview stage because it \"looks like a lot of work.\" The applicant reasoned that \"without knowing where I stand in the process, I’m not comfortable spending 90 minutes in Excel,\" the poster said. Me: really enjoyed the call. Please see attached financial modeling test Gen Z applicant: this looks like a lot of work. Without knowing where I stand in the process, I’m not comfortable spending 90 minutes in Excel Me:…well…I can tell you where you stand now — m. stanfield (@mu2myoc) April 23, 2024 The post, which has been viewed almost eight million times as of the time of writing, ended with the interviewer saying \"well... I can tell you where you stand now,\" implying the poster was unimpressed by the move and would not give him a job on the basis of it. But not everyone agreed that the applicant was wrong. NBC Many people stood with the worker, including one user who wrote, \"To be fair, a lot of places are just using applicants for free labour. The job doesn't exist. The 'test' is the only work they need done.\" To be fair, a lot of places are just using applicants for free labor. The job doesn't exist.

But last time I did this, the company ghosted me after I spent a weekend on a take home. So I don’t mind this stance. If you don’t like me protecting my time now, you’re not going to like me working for you anyways. — Nathan Drake (@nathandrake) April 23, 2024 The original poster made a point of mentioning that the applicant was Gen Z, and another X user commented on generational changes regarding how we approach work. They praised the applicant, saying \"The kid isn't wrong just because we accepted this type of behavior from the Boomer employers our whole lives.\" Because he values his time? The kid isn't wrong just because we accepted this type of behavior from the Boomer employers our whole lives. — Matt Eshelman (@TheMattEsh) April 23, 2024 Yet another poster said that it wasn't the request that was so much the issue as it was that the applicant wasn't getting paid. \"Effort vs reward [is] definitely not there for this. Good for him,\" they wrote. Applicant is right. Unless you offered to compensate for that 90 minutes. He has no idea how many applicants remain in the process. He probably has interviews with other businesses. Effort vs reward definitely not there for this. Good for him. — Adam (@Adam_Is_Pneuma) April 23, 2024 Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); The interviewer clarified that they would have actually been fine with paying the applicant if they'd asked, and that the move may have even helped his application. \"A response I would have actually enjoyed would have been, 'I’m good at this and [don't] work for free. Give me $1,000 and I’ll break this deal down in amazing detail' would have gladly paid and probably hired,\" they wrote. A response I would have actually enjoyed would have been. “I’m good at this and do t work for free. Give me $1,000 and I’ll break this deal down in amazing detail” Would have gladly paid and probably hired — m. stanfield (@mu2myoc) April 23, 2024 But people pointed out that the applicant shouldn't have had to make that explicit in the first place. \"No one is obtuse enough to suggest to their future employer to pay them $1000 for completing an interview assessment; him declining shows he understands his value,\" an X user commented. But this is pretty much the subtext of his email, no? No one is obtuse enough to suggest to their future employer to pay them $1000 for completing an interview assessment; him declining shows he understands his value and has options — zachy (@_theta_gang) April 24, 2024 Still, some people were on the side of the company. Though one user said that they \"get why people can be suspicious,\" having spent four hours on an interview task before to no avail, they thought that a 90-minute task was \"reasonable.\" I once had a place give me a four hour data analysis and modelling test packet. Told me they loved the work, and then the next day laid off 30% of staff.

The extra couple of hours upfront is worth it to see what they can do and be sure they’re a fit so you’re all happy, and I’m sorry if anyone doesn’t like it.\" Having made applicants do intense case studies when I was at a boutique I bank, I’ll tell you they’re 100% worth it. I don’t care if it’s a lot of your time. It’s unreal how hard it is to find good people. I’ve watched people that present themselves so well fall flat when asked… — Open Source (@EgweneAlVer) April 23, 2024 And yet another recruiter wrote they couldn't agree more, saying \"If people raise concerns about doing an unpaid test, it is the best feeling [in] the world because I know we dodged a bullet.\" Couldn’t have given you a better signal. We require applicants to do a 1 hour graphic design test. If people raise concerns about doing an unpaid test, it is the best feeling the world because I know we dodged a bullet. — SMM Guy (@SMMAgencyGuy) April 23, 2024 The debate went so viral that an article about it ended up in Reddit's r/AntiWork, with the post gaining over 10,000 upvotes. The top comment, from u/GhostShark, referenced a company's alleged tactic \"where they would have applicants give them ideas, not hire the applicants but still use their concepts.\" They called it a \"Great reminder not to work for free.\" Westend61 / Getty Images/Westend61 Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); \"Many companies post fake jobs just to farm resumes and sell their data,\" Redditor u/jaspsev agreed, while site user u/whiskeylips88 wrote, \"My father had this happen in the '80s.

No!\" @reamichellew via TikTok \"Basically, they just want some free work out of people,\" they added . \"Companies are known to do this, where they get 'potential employees' to do 90 minutes of free work, right?

Promising review: \"I use this product to charge my iPhone 13, AirPods, and Apple Watch. Prior to this 3-in-1 compact purchase, I have purchased three different kinds of 3-in-1 chargers. I frequently travel between school and home with carry-on bags on airlines and all of the previous stand version chargers doesn't fit well in my bags or I am always worried I would break. This is compact and folds so well that I can fit in my carry-on or in any zipper pockets without having to worry about breaking anything. Charger works really well and it is the best compact one you can find in market. Love it and been using it for two months now and no issues!!\" — SBREDDY $33.99 at Amazon 2 Amazon An expandable jacket and bag gripper for your suitcase or backpack Promising review: \"I had this travel strap attached to my backpack as a just in case. It's small and hardly noticeable so it wasn't in the way. When I finally needed it while on a trip, it was a lifesaver. I was able to attach some shopping bags, thankfully being able to keep my hands free.\" — Jonesy96 $12.99 at Amazon 3 www.amazon.com A hands-free (rotating!) phone mount designed for use on all airlines Perilogics is a small business creating hyper-functional tool holsters and bags for carrying your stuff on the go. Promising review : \"I bought this nifty gadget about six months ago for a multi-leg, ultra long-haul trip and it more than held up the entire duration . I was able to finagle it to fit the tray tables on different planes and like others, I find the height just nice when clamped onto a stowed tray table . It also works on my roller carry-on handle during layovers.\" — Earendil $12.97 at Amazon Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); 4 Amazon A compact but mighty 2-in-1 wall charger and portable power bank Promising review : \"I traveled for four weeks and this nice unit was perfect — charged everyone's iPhones during the day, and my iPad and my computer while taking the train for a few hours at a time.

I got this one after getting a different brand that is smaller. I love the extra pockets on this and the roomie section for ANY water bottle or a smaller water bottle and other stuff. The zipped pocket holds my iPhone Max just fine . Just took this on a cruise and several people commented wishing they had one . So much easier than a backpack or something for your water bottle.\" — Judy $17.99 at Amazon 6 Amazon An Airplane Pocket tray cover that slides seamlessly over an airplane tray Check out a TikTok of the Airplane Pockets tray table cover in action. Airplane Pockets is a small business that specializes in sanitary, portable travel organization products. I used this on a roundtrip from NYC to Tokyo, both with connecting flights in Canada, and cannot sing its praises enough. It fit all four of the different tray tables I used it on and was so ridiculously handy for keeping track of all my littler odds and ends like AirPods, the plane's headphones, earplugs, a sleep mask, a book, gum, a scrunchie, and little snacks. The hanging end of it easily tucked into the built-in sleeve of the seat in front of me for takeoff and when other passengers needed to scoot past me in my aisle seat. Usually, I feel like a hot mess and get frustrated rooting around in the grimy sleeve for my stuff, and this was such a refreshing solution! Several flight attendants even asked where I got it to buy one for themselves! $29.99 at Amazon Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); 7 Amazon Plus a patterned travel tray for kids to keep messes to a minimum Lusso Gear is a small business that specializes in travel products.

We bought this for a recent trip with our daughter and it made snack time and playtime on the flight so much easier and mess-free . It’s sturdy, high-quality, and fits perfectly on the tray table and tablet. It’s also a nice extra layer of protection from germs when traveling. Our daughter loved the cute mermaid design too!\" — Laura Knotts $24.95 at Amazon 8 www.amazon.com A flat RFID-blocking fanny pack Promising review : \"Discreet yet spacious. I purchased this for a recent trip. I was able to fit my phone, passport, credit cards, and cash in it easily and it wasn’t bulky or obvious under my clothing . It was comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.\" — KailensMom $9.99+ at Amazon 9 www.amazon.com A set of silicone \"EarPlanes\" designed with a twist-on structure Promising review: \"This product has changed my life. I travel fairly frequently and always have issues with ear pressure on the plane. My ears will be clogged up, and it is painful to swallow for a day or two after short-distance flights. But now, I use these and fly incident-free. You are supposed to insert them before the plane takes off and then before landing. I have found that it works best if I leave them in the entire flight from before takeoff until landing, but they work almost as well if you take them out once you reach cruising altitude. \" — Thomasina $8.68 at Amazon Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 10 Emma Lord/BuzzFeed A vacuum-free space-saving compression bag HELLO, I AM OBSESSED WITH THESE. Despite all the rave reviews I was definitely skeptical of space-saving bags that didn't require a vacuum, and even as they were actively squishing my clothes into oblivion I still couldn't quite believe it. I had easily two suitcases worth of clothes I wanted to pack for a three-week trip to London, and I managed to neatly pack the entirety of my wardrobe in one roller carry-on bag. Truly all I had to do was put my clothes in the bag, push them to the bottom, and then sit on it to get the air out before sealing it up. I had tons of extra bags and make a habit of taking them with me in case other people joining me on trips need them to be able to pack souvenirs on the way home. I'm never taking a long trip without these again — these are worth every damn penny. $15.97 at Amazon 11 Amazon An adjustable universal travel harness seat for kids ages six months and up Liuliuby is a New York-based small business that specializes in stroller and car seat accessories.

Very lightweight and packable, a vacation must-have!\" — Kireme1 $24.99 at Amazon 12 www.amazon.com A rechargeable itty bitty mini white noise maker Promising review: \"I am a flight attendant and sometimes have a hard time falling asleep while away in my hotels without my home white noise maker. This is compact and rechargeable so it is super easy to keep with me on my trips! It also has great volume range from very low to quite loud! I would recommend even for home use if you don’t have a ton of space but want to use a white noise machine.\" — Faith Morris $18.99 at Amazon Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 13 www.amazon.com A collapsible leakproof water bottle Promising review: \"I just bought this bottle and I’m already obsessed. I even ordered four more to bring with me on vacation and share with my family. I love how easily it folds back up and it doesn’t leak at all . I just wish it came in more colors and can’t wait to show everyone my cool new bottle!\" — Brittany $9.99 at Amazon 14 www.amazon.com A portable hanging luggage organizer Bonus: This works with your existing suitcase, unlike versions of this that come pre-built into more expensive versions! Promising review: \"I was able to pack seven outfits and have way more space in this organizer. I just packed the clothes in the organizer, closed it up, and placed it in my carry on. Once I got to the hotel, I just hung it in my closet. It would be perfect for cruises since their is never any drawer space and very little room to move around.\" — jess $27.39 at Amazon 15 Emma Lord/BuzzFeed A hanging cosmetic bag I will scream this thing's virtues on every corner of this earth. I used this on an eight-day international trip. It fit a veritable arsenal of products — all of my skincare, makeup, hair supplies, toothbrush, toothpaste, and deodorant were wedged in the different pockets, and still compacted easily and went right into my carryon backpack . It made setting up at the hotel a two-second process of hanging it up and having all my products instantly accessible to me and easy to put away. I cannot imagine traveling without it, especially now that I've used it on a multi-city trip where it was so handy to fold back up and take through several hotels. At one point, I forgot to properly close a lotion, and it exploded a bit, and the bag was super easy to clean from the inside! $22.99+ at Amazon Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 16 www.amazon.com Or for shorter trips, a flat-lay makeup bag Promising review: \"I had my eye on the round sack-style drawstring bags that open flat because of the appeal of being able to easily see all of my products, but didn’t like the idea that things might fall out through the gathered hole of the drawstring. This bag solves that while maintaining the easy visibility/access I was seeking! Very wipeable surface, holds lots, very functional. The material isn’t the highest quality, heaviest feel, but I don’t mind that.\" — Amazon Customer $10.99+ at Amazon 17 www.amazon.com A newly-updated AirFly, a handy gadget you can use to connect your wireless headphones to the headphone jacks on flights Here's what BuzzFeeder Chelsea Stuart has to say about them: \"Last year I splurged on some AirPod Maxes and for the amount of money I threw down on them, I was determined to get as much use out of them as possible and that included on plane rides. With the AirFly Pro, I can connect my headphones via Bluetooth and use the seat-back screen without having to fiddle with the free wired headphones they hand out that 1.) have horrible sound quality and 2.) don't fit my ears in the slightest. (I swear my ear canals are tiny or something??)\" Promising review : \"I saw this on TikTok and bought it instantly for an upcoming trip. I wish I knew about this sooner so I could enjoy inflight entertainment without needed additional headphones. This allows for that, which is great. It works so well, my husband bought one as well. Highly recommend.\" — Amazon Customer $34.99 at Amazon 18 Jasmin Sandal / BuzzFeed The iconic Alleyoop Pen Pal, which features four quick, easy-to-use products in one tiny package Alleyoop is a woman-owned small business that specializes in functional makeup products. Here's what former BuzzFeeder Jasmin Sandal has to say about it: \"I gotta say, I love the concept of the Pen Pal from Alleyoop ! After using all of the functions (eyeliner, highlighter, lip liner, eyebrow pencil) and as someone who LOVES makeup but was applying as little as humanly possible during lockdown, I think it’s a great tool for anyone looking to streamline their routine. It's ideal to use for touchups come the end of the work day, or a subtle, minimalist way to apply makeup in the a.m. The brow pencil is particularly soft and pigmented, and filled in my eyebrows quickly. I just adore the ease of application of each product, and appreciate the universal, does-it-all-for-you concept. Plus, it saves me so much room in my already-overflowing makeup bag!\" $20 at Alleyoop Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 19 www.amazon.com A stuffable travel luggage pillow Tube is a small business that specializes in uniquely-designed storage travel pillows. Promising review: \"I bought this looking to both save space and gain comfort for those long airplane rides. I was pleasantly surprised that they worked so well and fit so much into them while not sacrificing baggage space. I could fit at least a full day's worth of clothes in it. Also works well if you have one of those backpacks with the attachment clip and loop system as you can use this as a strap to avoid purchasing another carry-on bag from airlines.\" — Victor Tolentino $37.95 at Amazon 20 www.amazon.com A window seat BevLedge that defies the time-space-economy-class continuum BevLedge is a small business that specializes in travel accessories. Promising review: \"A friend recommended this to me as a vital travel companion, now that I've returned to frequent flying. I initially thought of it as a novelty, but now that I've used it, it's a necessity. It keeps the workspace clear for my laptop, but it also organizes all the little pieces that can become so annoying to keep up with — glasses, earphones, etc. It got my seat mate's immediate attention, as well as a few other folks nearby. I suspect they'll have one soon. Watch for one soon in a window near you!\" — Timothy G. Wolfe $19.99 at Amazon 21 www.amazon.com A car backseat organizer Promising review: \"These are worth their weight in gold when you’re traveling with kids and pets! They are sturdy and well made, very simple to use and install, and to take out for cleaning if you have an inevitable spill. They keep everything neat and out of reach of the dogs. They are an attractive design that looks nice as well — they don’t look cheap. Everyone’s drinks and snacks stay nice and stable even on curvy back roads.

It helps me a lot! Last time I took a plane with a suitcase and a cup of coffee, when it’s my turn to check my passport and ticket, the coffee cup fell to the ground and coffee sprinkled. It was a nightmare! This time I bought this cup holder, it did do me a favor! I don't have to worry about where my cup and phone are! I can free my hands to do other things. I love it so much! Hope you love it too.\" — Philip $9.99 at Amazon 24 Amazon Plus an attachable luggage table Promising review : \"Ingenious.

Promising review: \"It does as it says it does, allowing my Dell XPS15 to operate a pair of USB devices from my lightning port! The laptop has two USB ports, one of which is always occupied by my USB mouse dongle and the other by my protected USB drive. If I wanted to plug in my phone to switch data or add another thumb drive to transfer a device, everything might have to be disconnected, but not anymore.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Illustration: HuffPost; Photos: Apple Here are some of the biggest new iPhone features that may radically change how you communicate — and get your point across. On Monday, Apple announced new features that are on the way at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Our cellphones have become one of the primary ways we talk to each other, and there are upcoming iPhone features for iOS 18 that are giving users more ways to express how they feel, organize their thoughts, and stay in touch with family off the grid. Here’s how: Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); 1. You will be able to schedule a message ahead in iPhones. For fans of Gmail’s feature for scheduling emails to send at a later time, you’re in luck –– Apple is rolling out a similar feature for iMessage. Gone are the days of worrying about waking up in time to send that birthday text or early morning reminder to the group chat. In its press release, Apple said that users will have the ability to cancel or edit the message at any time. You’ll also be able to see that your message has been scheduled. Advertisement 2. It will be much easier to record and read transcriptions of phone calls. Being able to quickly skim through a transcribed conversation is a huge time-saver. And if you currently use a third-party service to transcribe phone conversations (looking at you, fellow journalists), you might be pleased to learn that Apple has announced its own upcoming feature. After the iOS update, people using the Phone app will be able to record calls and read transcriptions and AI-powered summaries of the conversation after the fact. Apple is calling its AI features “Apple Intelligence” and announced that they will launch in beta this fall for iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); At its developer conference, Apple said that the person on the other line would first get an automatic heads-up that they are being recorded. Illustration: HuffPost; Photos: Apple In the new iOS update, iPhone users will gain the ability to schedule texts for a later date. 3. You have more ways to express how you feel in texts, including emoji reactions and formatted text. Formatting your words with a playfully bolded phrase can help get your meaning across more than just text alone. After the new iMessages app update, iPhone users will be able to underline, bold, strikethrough and italicize texts. You will also be able to react to messages with any emoji, rather than just the thumbs up, exclamation points and other limited options we currently have. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); You can even create your own emoji with an AI-powered feature Apple is calling “Genmoji.” In Genmoji, users can type “Labrador with red glasses” in the iMessage emoji search bar and get an AI version of what that will look like, as one example . 4. You can ask Siri for help with remembering that photo or text. Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant, will have new capabilities and be able to answer more questions in the iOS 18 update. In the new Siri, you can ask it text-based questions as well as voiced ones. Can’t remember when you took that photo and which album you put it in? You will be able to ask Siri to pull up photos, links and PDFs, as well as edit images or move items across various apps, according to Apple. As one example, Apple shared that Siri can pull up a photo of your driver’s license and copy-paste the number into a form or can pull up an old link your friend shared with you. 5. You will be able to text even when you do not have cell service. Apple is building off of its Emergency SOS feature and will allow iPhone iOS 18 users to do SMS texting over its satellite. This way, you can shoot off a text to or share a video with a loved one even when you do not have cell service or a Wi-Fi connection. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 6. You can have AI rewrite your emails. At WWDC, Justin Titi, Apple’s director of intelligent system experience engineering, announced a Rewrite feature that will be available in Mail, Notes, Pages, third-party apps, and systemwide for macOS Sequoia. In the demo, we see Rewrite being used in the Mail app where a woman is following up after a networking conversation in an email. Using the Rewrite options allows the user toggle between “professional,” “friendly” and “concise” versions of that email. There will also be a new proofreading service that can give you grammar and sentence structure suggestions on your messages. 7. You can make apps harder for other people to randomly access. If you handed over your phone, is there a dating app or a photo that you would be embarrassed if someone else saw? Apple is making it a little harder for strangers to tap and access sensitive information. Under the new iOS update, you will be able to lock specific apps on your iPhone, so that you can only access them through authentication features like Face ID, Touch ID or your passcode. After selecting this feature, information from those apps would not show up in your search bar, notifications or Siri suggestions. What else is coming? Beyond these specific iPhone features, there are other updates that may make your life a little more convenient. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); After the new macOS Sequoia update , people will be able to mirror and control their iPhone screen directly on their Mac. This way, you can click through your phone on your Mac device without using a touchscreen. But while you’re using the mirror feature on your Mac device, the iPhone will temporarily lock itself, so no one else can access your iPhone. And there are new security options being rolled out. Similar to existing password managers like LastPass and 1Password, Apple is introducing its own passwords app that will access your credentials, generate complex passwords, and securely store them all in one place. Apple said the new Passwords app will soon be available on Mac, iPad, iPhone, Vision Pro, and on Windows through iCloud. Talk about upgrades.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Apple+ TV On \"Severance,\" work-life balance gets taken to a new extreme. Above, we see \"innie\" Mark (Adam Scott) while he is working for mysterious conglomerate Lumon. What if there was a way you could permanently leave your work at work and live your life free of job worries? On “ Severance ,” the new Apple TV+ series that concluded its first season this week, that is the promise Lumon offers to its “severed” employees, who agree to have their memories surgically divided between their work and personal lives as part of their employment contract. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); For Lumon, severance is a nondisclosure agreement taken to new extremes. As soon as severed employees step out of a Lumon elevator, they have no memory of who they work with or what they work on. Advertisement The show follows Mark, played by Adam Scott . At home, he’s a lonesome man grieving the loss of his wife, while at work he’s an obedient company man leading Lumon’s severed Macrodata Refinement team. For Mark, working for Lumon is an eight-hour reprieve when he is not haunted by his grief. His “innie,” as Lumon management call his work side, knows no family and sees no people other than his co-workers. He doesn’t know what sleep is like. “I find it helps to focus on the effects of sleep since we don’t get to experience it,” Mark tries to reassure his new direct report. It’s bleak. All severed Mark knows about the world is the windowless building he works in, and for the most part, he has made his peace with the arrangement. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Innie Mark is more self-assured than his grief-stricken outie. He walks straighter and parrots back the company handbook sayings, like “the work is mysterious and important,” without irony. But as the season unfurls, we see severed employees who are not willing to work forever just for the reward of a quarterly waffle party. And that’s where “Severance” shines at highlighting how ridiculous and inhumane workplace culture can be. “Severance” skewers familiar corporate language and perks. One part that “Severance” nails is how business language can distort itself to the point where words mean nothing. Mark and his team all work in “Macrodata Refinement,” and even after watching the finale I am no closer to understanding what exactly is getting refined. At Lumon, obtuse business language is also a euphemism for corporate misdeeds. T he break room is actually a detention center designed to break employee’s spirits. An “overtime contingency” mechanism is a sinister surveillance tool that violates employees’ privacy. Lumon’s severed floor is really where the show pokes fun at sad corporate perks. Irving, the most-senior macrodata refiner (played wonderfully by John Turturro ), remembers a time when employees were incentivized with coffee creamer. Dylan, another refiner, is pleased by the finger trap puzzle and cartoon caricatures he earns as he completes a task. When an employee earns an MDE, it’s a five-minute Music Dance Experience for which the employee gets to pick a song and boogie around their desk. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); When this is all the stimulus your mind gets to experience, even a brief hip-shaking dance to “defiant jazz” with your evil manager can seem like a break from the drudgery and horror of endless toil. Apple+ TV Helly, a severed employee, chooses the \"defiant jazz\" soundtrack for her Music Dance Experience perk. “Severance” spins work-life balance advice on its head. “Don’t live to work. Work to live” is the commercial slogan printed on Lumon’s severance chip. Lumon’s girlboss public spokesperson (Sydney Cole Alexander) describes severance as a way to put the “human first.” It’s a perverse interpretation of work-life balance. When newest Lumon trainee Helly (Britt Lower) is onboarded, we see the human sacrifices that make a life free of work troubles possible. After Helly undergoes severance, she wakes up on a conference table, not knowing where she is, or who she is. When she realizes that her life will now be spent endlessly toiling away on a computer, she has a reasonable response: “I quit. I don’t want to do the file-sorting thing or the never-seeing-the-sun thing.“ Mark tries to reassure her with the facts of their employment: “Every time you find yourself here, it’s because you chose to come back.” But Helly refuses to accept that this is her life, and sends many resignation requests to her outie. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Helly’s refusal to work the job escalates to a point where innie Helly threatens to chop off her fingers with a paper cutter unless her outie lets her quit. Through a video message to innie Helly, her counterpart lays down the law of her existence. Outie Helly says she understands that her work self may be unhappy, but this is the lot she has been given. “I am a person. You are not. I make the decisions. You do not. And if you ever do anything to my fingers, know that I will keep you horribly alive to regret that,” outer Helly firmly and coolly continues. “Your resignation request is denied.” This is where the show succeeds at using Helly’s bizarre battle with herself to talk about a familiar work conundrum: What’s the ideal boundary to set between work and the rest of your life? It’s normal to act differently at your job than in the privacy of your home . Researchers call people who draw hard work-life boundaries “ extreme segmenters. ” Segmenters separate work and home through objects ― for example, by having separate calendars, uniforms or keys for each place or activity. Segmenters love ending the work day at the same time every day. “Integrators,” on the other hand, are workers, researchers find, that prefer for everything to be intertwined, and don’t need hard lines between where work starts and begins. Integrators don’t mind taking an hour break at lunch and then going back to work. The researchers on preferred work styles have found that no matter if you are an integrator or a segmenter, you still need recovery time. “Severance” shows the fallout of what happens when “extreme segmenters” get no breaks. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); To get true recovery from work, researchers find that you need detachment from the job, relaxation, time to gain a sense of mastery over a skill, or time to do what you will . The tragedy of each severed worker is that they get no time to recharge. Take Mark. During the weekends away from Lumon, he drinks and isolates himself from his loved ones, and that carries over to his work self. His body keeps score of what his mind is trying to forget. As ex-colleague Petey shares with outie Mark, he could always tell when Mark spent the morning before work crying: “You carry the hurt with you. You feel it down there too. You just don’t know what it is.“ The most horrific parts of “Severance” remind me of the film “ Sleep Dealer ,” which is also a dystopian workplace nightmare. “Sleep Dealer” follows a Mexican man named Memo who works a “node job” where employees have to get cyber implants. While his body is in stasis in a factory, Memo’s cyber arms virtually power robots constructing skyscrapers and robots mowing lawns in America. As one character in the film puts it, “We give the United States what they always wanted: All the work without the workers.” No spoilers for the “Severance” finale, but what this sci-fi thriller and films like “Sleep Dealer” do best is show the inhumanity of bosses forcing workers to do work without considering any of their human needs. Luckily, even when companies do their best to subjugate workers into compliance , there are still parts of humanity that will always rebel and harbor dreams of autonomy and true rest. The body remembers.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Formula 1: Drive to Survive - Production Stills Netflix's \"Formula 1: Drive To Survive\" follows stars like Lewis Hamilton vying for a championship, along with midfield teams simply struggling to finish a race intact. In many workplaces, there’s an unspoken truth that who you know matters more than what you do when it comes to being successful. But in Netflix ’s racing reality show “ Formula 1: Drive To Survive ,” workplace politics is no unspoken secret. Don’t let the beautiful race backdrops of verdant Belgian hillsides and yachts in Monaco fool you: Formula 1 is a ruthless, hyper-competitive workplace. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); As someone who didn’t know anything about the sport before bingeing the show, I found it to be refreshingly direct in dispelling the myth that hard work speaks for itself . Working hard doesn’t automatically lead to success for drivers who are dealing with a poorly built car or a team that wants to replace them for someone more “sellable” to sponsors. This workplace is not a meritocracy; the more money a team has, the better its car will typically be, and the more likely it is to go faster. Advertisement “Cash is king,” says seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton , the sport’s most famous face, in one episode. In Formula 1 these days, it’s totally common for a billionaire sponsor to sweep in and keep a team afloat in exchange for his son securing a spot as a driver. “ This is no magic, this sport,” says Guenther Steiner, team principal of the cash-strapped and perennial loser Haas team in one conversation. “This sport is hard work, fucking dedication, and money to keep it all going.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Steiner would know; in one memorable scene, he poses in front of toy boats and saunas for a brochure of one of Haas’ sponsors, the discount supermarket chain Aldi. “I’m not too proud to do these things,” he says. It’s true and hilarious. Netflix's \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive\" Production Stills \"Drive to Survive\" follows dominant teams like Mercedes and Red Bull Racing as well as scrappy underdogs like the American team Haas and its team principal Guenther Steiner, above. The Netflix series, which so far has covered seasons from 2018-2021 in four seasons of television, is so popular that viewership of F1 races in the U.S. spiked 41% in 2021. I can understand why. What makes Formula 1 an entertaining soap opera is the circus of team principals whose egos war with ambitious drivers and billionaire stakeholders. When asked by his pop star wife Geri Halliwell to name his favorite driver, Red Bull Racing boss Christian Horner answers, “Whoever is winning for us.” The drivers are the stars, but we also see polished public relations representatives looming over their charges, engineers trapped in tense meetings with team principals after a technical failure and pit crews gasping in horror when a car crashes. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The show is not without faults. Red Bull driver Max Verstappen stopped participating after seeing early episodes, telling The Associated Press that the series has “faked a few rivalries which they don’t really exist.” And the show makes glaring omissions about sketchy sponsors and sexual harassment allegations . But overall, it’s a show that depicts messy interpersonal team dynamics in a unique way I have not seen anywhere else. You may not be in the driver’s seat of an expensive, elite Formula 1 car, but there are compelling management case studies we can all learn from. It’s a case study in how people learn from failure — and how they don’t. In F1, teams deal with constant reminders that they are only as good as their last race. In one brutal example, rising star Alex Albon replaces struggling Pierre Gasly in the Red Bull Racing team. A team photographer shows Albon a promo photo of Gasly in his Red Bull racing suit, telling Albon, “We just have to shoot you in a similar pose, because we’re going to remove that subject and put you in place.” It’s an oblique way of saying, “We’re Photoshopping out the guy being demoted and editing you in,” and a stark reminder of drivers’ replaceability. In this volatile environment, it’s no wonder that so many drivers buckle under the pressure. To feel psychologically safe at work, we have to feel free to speak up and share bad news without fear of blame. But most of us — including F1 drivers, who often blame things like bad weather and their engines for their poor performance — have what is known as “ fundamental attribution error ,” by which we minimize our own role in a failure and place outsized blame on external or situational factors. When we sidestep accountability, we prevent ourselves from learning. Some teams talk about addressing this. Mercedes’ team principal Toto Wolff says his organization has a “no-blame” culture and doesn’t point fingers when things go wrong, but as the team who has the world’s most-winning F1 driver in Hamilton, I was less than convinced by his pep talks. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); It’s much more interesting to watch the rallying tactics of teams that know they do not have competitive cars. Steiner, who greets perpetual failures with optimism, first curses and bluntly names what goes wrong. “ We look like a bunch of fucking wankers ,” he tells team owner Gene Haas after a poor outing. Meanwhile, Jost Capito, who becomes Williams Racing’s CEO in Season 4, shares that his team has to do a daily “walk of shame” past all the others because for each race, team hubs are assigned locations in order of success. “It’s physically painful to pass all the teams ahead of you. I told the team they have always to do the whole walk and stop at the point where they want to be next year,” Capito says. “Every single time you walk through the paddock, it gives you the pure reality check of where you are.“ The first step to learning from failure is to accept the reality of it happening. It shows the limits of being loyal to an employer or employee. Time and time again, people call F1 a family, but these families frequently break up for business demands. Case in point: Haas drivers Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnusson. Steiner calls them part of the longstanding Haas “family” in an F1 media session in Season 3, but when money runs dry, he cuts them both for drivers that will bring more sponsorship money. It’s a reminder of how the bottom line ultimately determines who stays and who gets fired. Drivers with the pedigree of a famous or rich family have an advantage. In Season 3 of the show, Sergio “Checo” Pérez comes to the rude realization that he is being replaced on his current team for Sebastian Vettel, a previous world champion with a bigger name, even though Perez is having a career-best year and had a great job review. “I felt the decision had nothing to do with performance,” he says. In a good family, your inclusion is not conditional, but in a business, it can be. Of course, putting business moves before personal camaraderie goes both ways. In Season 3, Renault driver Daniel Ricciardo announces he’s signed up with Renault’s biggest competitor, McLaren, citing the realization he cannot win in a Renault if all cars finish a race. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); But Ricciardo still needs to finish the rest of the season with Renault before switching teams. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner likens the situation to a girlfriend staying in your house after a split. Renault team principal Cyril Abiteboul admits, “With the breakup, there was a period of time where we’ve not spoken ... I am emotional. I am not going to change what I am.” Netflix's \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive\" Production Stills When then-team principal Cyril Abiteboul (above) realizes that his driver Daniel Ricciardo is planning to leave Renault for a competitor, the fallout is like a breakup. There is an awkward scene in the show where we watch the pair greet each other, but Abiteboul does not linger and keeps walking away. “Oh wow,” Ricciardo sighs after the frigid interaction with his boss. Eventually, Abiteboul and Ricciardo make up, and at the end of the season, Abiteboul gets a tattoo to fulfill a bet with Ricciardo. The work relationship is ultimately repaired, but it’s a lesson to bosses everywhere: Loyalty to a brand is conditional upon an employer’s performance, too. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The series showcases how hard it is to sacrifice your ambition for the team’s needs. Formula 1 has 10 teams that each have two drivers responsible for bringing in points for the team based on how fast they finish. Yet despite this shared responsibility, it’s typical for an F1 driver to groan when their teammate is doing a good job, because it puts their own seat in jeopardy. When Ricciardo is the hot new driver on the Renault team in Season 2, he frankly states, “You don’t want your teammate to come in and ruin your career early ... There might always be a little threat whenever you have a new teammate.” Netflix/Photograph by Vladimir Rys Daniel Ricciardo starts out the show as a dominant driver winning podiums. But in later seasons, he deals with inconsistent performance. Some drivers are more collegial to their teammates than others, but none of the drivers actively practice “Shine Theory,” a term coined by Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman . Shine theory is when professionals mutually invest in each other’s careers, even if they are technically competitors, because they do not see that person’s success as a personal threat. “Shine Theory is an investment, over the long term, in helping someone be their best self — and relying on their help in return,” as Friedman and Sow explain it on their website. “It is a conscious decision to bring your full self to your friendships, and to not let insecurity or envy ravage them.“ Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); In Formula 1, team drivers pose united in front of cameras, but alone with the camera, they are frank about the threat they believe a successful teammate poses. There’s only so much they are willing to do to help a teammate do well on the track. In Season 4, Ricciardo is struggling on his new team at McLaren, and he is the one feeling threatened by a hot young driver. But his teammate Lando Norris has no sympathy for Daniel not being able to come to grips with the car. “What I said is the just the truth,” he says after an article is written about his lack of sympathy for Ricciardo’s struggles. “I don’t feel sympathy for him. Why should I? No driver on the grid would feel sympathy for another driver.” The tension between what’s good for driver’s careers and what’s good for a team’s championship chances guarantees dysfunctional work partnerships when teams are losing. But it certainly makes for great TV.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life FX In \"The Bear,\" Jeremy Allen White, left, stars as Carmy Berzatto, a restaurant owner dealing with a staff that's resistant to change. One of them is Ebon Moss-Bachrach, right, as Richie Jerimovich. In the new FX series “ The Bear ,” there are no breaks. There are too many messes to clean up, too many crises to settle. The comedy-drama, now streaming on Hulu, centers on Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto, played by Jeremy Allen White, who inherits his late brother’s sandwich restaurant along with its skeptical employees, who are wary of change. He also inherits dirty floors, broken toilets, piles of unpaid bills and a $300,000 loan his uncle wants to collect. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Carmy takes it all on to honor his brother’s memory, but he’s not exactly given a hero’s welcome. Although he’s an award-winning fine-dining chef, he has not earned the respect of his new staff. He gets hazed and his knives go missing; any attempts to change “the system” at the Original Beef of Chicagoland are met with displeasure. Advertisement “Don’t mess up our place,” one employee warns him, while his own cousin Richie, a longtime manager who is resentful he did not inherit the Beef himself, tells him, “This is a delicate ecosystem.“ At the Beef, there is no time for Carmy to slowly build trust with staff and repair tensions. Lunch orders need to be served ASAP. It’s a world in which shouting is normal ― “Hands!” “Corner!” “Behind!” ― in the claustrophobically tight quarters of the kitchen. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); The Beef is a fictional restaurant, but the conundrums that come with being the new guard at an old establishment are universal problems. The show shines at unpacking these queasy tensions of workplace hierarchies. There are years of history built into the loaded glances and passive-aggressive comments about competence that Carmy and his employees trade. And with the high jinks and schemes it takes to win over customers and staff, “The Bear” makes what could be a stressful half hour funny and heartwarming, too. Everyone gets humbled. I laughed when prideful Richie has to cater a kiddie hot dog party with Carmy to pay back their uncle’s loan. Carmy announces to his staff that he knows exactly what a creaking sound in the bathroom means, and also gets a surprise spray of toilet water in his mouth. Refreshingly, “The Bear” does not focus on any romance, either at work or outside of it. We get limited information about who any of the chefs are when they punch out and go home. This is a show about the frenetic demands of working in a cash-strapped restaurant, trying to get orders out on time. It’s about navigating your colleagues’ fears and anxieties, and the care you can show co-workers, with whom you spend more time than your own family. Here are the most relatable work takeaways: Too much immediate change by a new manager is not going to be taken well. In an attempt to bring order to the Beef’s chaos, Carmy enlists the help of his newest hire, Sydney, played wonderfully by Ayo Edebiri. Sydney is young and ambitious. She wants more work to do, but she doesn’t want to do the task Carmy asks of her ― leading a fine dining-style French “brigade” chain of command for each cook in the kitchen to follow. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “It’ll create a toxic, hierarchal shit show,” Sydney warns. “With that type of system, I’d have less of a voice.” But Carmy says this is what’s necessary to change the Beef’s chemistry, and it’s what “real kitchens do.” The old guard is skeptical when told of the news. Ebra, one of the longtime staff members, says the division of labor is just a hierarchy. Sydney unconvincingly tries to frame it as “more like regular chill-archy... because I’m the sous, right? I just follow orders, even if it leads to tension and chaos and resentment, and ultimately doesn’t work.” Ultimately, it does turn out how Sydney predicted. Unwilling to take orders from a newcomer, the cooks make her chopped-up onions vanish and turn her burner up too high in acts of sabotage. Pissed off, Sydney declines their help to lift a vat of veal stock, and it spills everywhere. The spectacular failure of the brigade reminds me of the critical mistake a lot of first-time managers make : They try to do too much, too fast, to make their mark on an organization, without accounting for how staff feel about losing their predictable routines. To do our jobs well, we all need certainty about when things will occur and how we can prepare for future challenges, as illustrated in a behavioral model developed by the performance coach Paloma Medina. If Carmy really wanted his brigade to succeed, he would not have left it all up to Sydney to execute, as he later acknowledges in an apology. And he would have incorporated more staff input about what they most wanted changed in the first place. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); In “The Bear,” chefs try to be better bosses than those they worked for. But as in real life, rudeness is contagious. Throughout the series, Sydney and Carmy both allude to the toxic kitchen environments they’ve worked in and are trying to escape. “I think this place could be so different from all the other places we’ve been at,” Sydney tells her new boss. “I don’t want to be wasting my time working on another line or tweezing herbs on a dish, or running brunch, God forbid.” Carmy can relate. In one flashback, we see the tyrannical boss he worked under at a swanky New York City restaurant. This bad boss (played by Joel McHale) believes a pep talk consists of telling Carmy: “Why do you hire fucking idiots? Do you like working with fucking idiots? Say ‘Yes, Chef.’ ... You are bullshit. You are talentless ... You should be dead.” Compared to this kind of bad boss, Carmy’s tolerance of his staff’s outbursts and eccentricities seems downright kind. He calls every staff member “Chef” as a sign of respect, and frequently asks “Are you good?” if he notices someone buckling under pressure. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); But in the penultimate episode of the season, all of Carmy’s promises of being a better listener crumble on his own bad day. It’s a pile-on of errors: Sydney leaves the pre-order option on by accident, so they now need to fulfill orders of 255 beef sandwiches in eight minutes; pastry chef Marcus is so focused on making the perfect doughnut that he has not cut any cakes. Carmy blows up under the stress and yells at Sydney: “I told you to be more fucking ready!” He brings up past grievances and kicks her out of her station, becoming the bad boss he promised not to be. This, in turn, causes Sydney to yell at staff, too. “Hey, you don’t need to be screaming and shit. That’s not you,” one employee says to Sydney. “You know, maybe it is,” Sydney replies, mulishly. The toxic behavior spreads to the rest of the staff, and everyone is soon sniping at each other with sarcastic, mean comments. Research does show that if you are a bystander to rude behavior, you are more likely to become mean yourself . In a series of experiments , organizational management researchers found the more that people saw and were the victims of rudeness, the more likely they were to become rude and hostile themselves at work. Sydney becomes the bad boss Carmy once had when she stands beside Richie as he prepares giardiniera, a task she thinks she should be doing herself. Sydney goes beyond critiquing his vegetable prep, telling him: “I see you for the loser you fucking are. And everybody knows it ... Your daughter probably knows it.” The line is crossed, and now Sydney, who started the series as an ambitious, polite employee, has become an unforgivably mean boss under stress. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); At its best, “The Bear” acknowledges how weird and tense it can be to spend hours of your life each day in close proximity to people who are so different from you. It can be supremely awkward to apologize, and your grievances can get personal. But unlike at many toxic workplaces, the staff here do the work of learning to be better. After a cooling-off period, everyone at the Beef is willing to be accountable for their actions. Or as Carmy, Sydney and the rest of the Beef staff would say when giving their full attention to each other after a mess-up: “Heard, chef.” Related Hulu FX Toxic workplace work on film the bear Netflix's 'Drive To Survive' Is The Most Fun Dysfunctional Work Drama You'll Ever See 'Severance' Really Nails How Absolutely Inhumane Our Work Culture Is 23 Years Later, 'Office Space' Still Nails 3 Crucial Workplace Truths Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up An essential daily guide to achieving the good life Subscribe to our lifestyle email.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Illustration: Jianan Liu/ HuffPost; Photo: Getty Images The address you list on a résumé can make or break your job application in certain cases. As a job seeker, it is frustrating when your amazing résumé gets no responses. There are many reasons outside of your control as to why you’re hearing silence , but one clear reason might be because of your address. That’s because the address you list on your résumé –– or lack thereof –– can rule you out of contention before you have a chance to make your case to a hiring manager. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Ashley Watkins Thomas , a job search coach, said that when she worked as a corporate recruiter for on-site jobs, her “spidey senses” would kick in when she saw résumés with no address listed at all. “When you intentionally leave pertinent information off of your documents, we know you’re hiding something,” Watkins Thomas said, noting that the missing information signals that you likely live out of town. Advertisement “You’re saying that you live in Florida, yet your experience section says that you’re in Tennessee, so which is it?” she said recruiters will question. So the first mistake is thinking you can get away with listing no address for hybrid or fully onsite jobs. On the other hand, how you word your address can also be a dealbreaker for certain jobs. Here’s why: Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Your local address can make or break your job application. Jessica Hernandez , a career development coach with more than 10 years of human resources experience, said for remote jobs, “the only element that will matter is the country.” In those cases, you just need to clearly state that you’re based in the United States for a U.S.-based role, for example. But you will need to be more specific for hybrid or on-site jobs. Hernandez said the biggest résumé mistake she sees on listing an address is not including a local address when they’re open to relocating. “If a recruiter is looking for a local candidate and the person has an address that isn’t near the location, for instance ... then this candidate may be excluded from the search,” she said. “I’ve heard of many job seekers who struggle to relocate because their current address is on their résumé instead of the address for where they are relocating to.” To work around this, Hernandez recommends using the address of a friend or family member in the area where you hope to relocate. And if you do not have a trusted friend, “you can always get a UPS box at a local UPS store, and it will give an actual street address,” she advised. Watkins Thomas, however, said it is better to be transparent about where you live and to avoid using other people’s addresses. She said an employer could find out your location through a background check, and you will come across as “being dishonest.” Additionally, being upfront about where you live can make you eligible for potential relocation benefits, “because companies will make changes for who they want.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Recruiters often exclude candidates outside of a certain radius because the job requires local connections. They also might assume you will not be able to start working within a tight timeframe. To counter that, Watkins Thomas said job seekers can signal their readiness by including a sentence at the top of their résumé alongside contact information that says: “Willing to relocate by July 2024.” And you can reinforce this message with more details in your cover letter. damircudic via Getty Images There are ways you can share your address while making it known you're willing to move for the right opportunity. Saying too much about your address is also a mistake. One other big mistake is listing your full street address on job applications that do not require it. You typically just need a city, state, and zip code for recruiters doing location-based searches, experts said. With a full street address on a résumé, recruiters can make assumptions about your race and socioeconomic status, Watkins Thomas said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); It’s OK to leave off your small town in favor of a more well-known metro region, though. Watkins Thomas said some of her clients in smaller towns have gotten callbacks after saying they live in the “Atlanta, Georgia, area,” for instance. Don’t give more than one address, though. Watkins Thomas said she commonly sees college students put both a permanent and current address, which she advises against doing. For one, it clutters your résumé, and “when things are cluttered, we’re more likely to skim over them and not pay any attention to them.” Additionally, it’s a signal that you are a new graduate entering the job market for the first time. “A lot of times, that’s a dead giveaway that you’re a college student,” Watkins Thomas said. “And you don’t want people focusing on the fact that you just graduated; let them focus on things like the value that you bring, the problems that you solve.” How you can greatly increase your odds of getting interviewed. You can spend hours agonizing over the exact wording of your résumé, but Watkins Thomas said that candidates who need to relocate have a much stronger chance of getting interviewed if they network with people who can advocate on their behalf. “If it’s your target company, you should already be building those relationships and already having those conversations,” Watkins Thomas advised. In these informational interviews , you can ask them, “Are you familiar with the hiring manager and whether or not they have specific requirements about location?” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “If you have someone on the inside who has some influence with the organization, they can vouch for you and say, ‘Hey, I’ve got this person here, they’re easy to relocate,’” Watkins Thomas said. “They can help tell that story for you and advocate for you versus you being just among the number of résumés received for a particular position.” Related Unemployment resumes finding jobs addresses This Exec Says 'Jumpy' Résumés Are A Red Flag.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Westend61 via Getty Images HSPs process information more deeply than the average person. Their sensitivity can actually be a superpower at work, once it's clear how to use it well. Have you been told you are “too sensitive”? Do interruptions throw off your whole day? Can you instantly read the emotions in a room? There’s a name for what you might be: a “highly sensitive person,” or an HSP. It’s a personality trait that was first defined by psychologist Elaine Aron and was popularized by her 1996 book, “ The Highly Sensitive Person. ” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); If you’re an HSP, you have what is known as sensory processing sensitivity. Highly sensitive people are easily overstimulated and process information more deeply. Studies have found that it is a trait that evolved in humans and in other animals to notice environmental dangers others may miss. By Aron’s estimate, 15% to 20% of people in the world are highly sensitive. “Put very simply, it means that you have a more reactive nervous system,” said Melody Wilding , a licensed social worker and executive coach who identifies as an HSP. Advertisement “Highly sensitive people will often say, ‘I feel everything more deeply. And I’m so much more aware and vigilant of other people’s behavior and emotions,’” Wilding explained. “Our brains are literally spending more time processing all of that information more deeply, too.” Being an HSP is going to affect all your relationships, including how you do your job. Here are some common ways it might show up at work: Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); 1. You need to analyze everything before you make a decision. Alane Freund , a licensed marriage and family therapist and international consultant on HSPs, said highly sensitive people operate under a “do it once and do it right” mindset. “They’re more reflective and responsive to their environment. They pause before they react, and they process what they see before they act,” she said. “I won’t just give you my off-the-cuff initial response. When I give you a response or when I do a project, I’m going to do it really thoughtfully,” added Freund, who also identifies as an HSP. Wilding said that an HSP’s ability to think deeply can be a huge strength, but it can also be a challenge when it turns into “overanalyzing every little interaction or why someone used a period instead of an exclamation point.” “It can also be really hard for HSPs sometimes to be able to make a decision because they can see all the options and they can see the pluses and minuses of everything,” Wilding noted. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 2. You may not be the first to speak up in a meeting. Wilding said a lot of her HSP clients struggle with speaking up in meetings. Because HSPs have a highly reactive nervous system, they may freeze up in stressful group environments. Or they may doubt their own ideas because they do not hear anyone else noticing the same opportunities or risks that they see. But this does not need to be a challenge. Wilding said HSPs can lean into their strengths to ask a really thoughtful question or build on somebody else’s point: “Like, ‘Mark, that’s a great idea. I hadn’t considered that before. And I’d also like to add XYZ.’” 3. You find the open-plan office overwhelming. An open-plan office can be an HSP’s nightmare. The noise, movement and distracting fluorescent lights can be “disturbing enough to make it really hard” for an HSP to concentrate, Freund said. Freund said she recommends that sensitive people find a way to help supervisors and co-workers understand “what it means to be highly sensitive.” That way you can get more leeway to say “Let me get back to you on that,” or you have the ability to work alone more. 4. You need more downtime throughout the workday. We all need breaks during hectic workdays. But when you are an HSP, you don’t just prefer downtime, you need it for your brain to function well. One 2021 study found that highly sensitive people’s brains showed enhanced connectivity even during a resting state after they’d completed a task. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “In order for our brains to work their best, we need to do lots of micro-breaks throughout the day,” Freund said. For HSPs, she suggested short HSP naps , when you can elevate your legs and lie down with your eyes closed. That way you can block out some of what can be overstimulating you. HSPs benefit from work/life boundaries, so try taking a pit stop in nature on the way home if you’re expected to go straight from work to a draining family interaction. Or if you are at your desk, just briefly close your eyes to block out some of the distractions around you. “Even just 30 seconds of having your eyes closed at your desk helps bring more downtime,” Freund said. 5. You may have trouble saying no to people. One of the strengths of HSPs is that they are conscientious, committed and “tend to be very loyal,” Wilding said. But these same strengths can be what holds HSPs back at work. Wilding said her desire to help others became a people-pleasing tendency, and it was her hardest challenge with being an HSP at work. That’s because HSPs have a highly attuned internal threat-detection system. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); An HSP may think, “If I say no to this, I’m going to be fired, this person is going to hate me. They’re going to think I’m lazy,” Wilding explained. “And so it can be really painful for HSPs to say no.” 6. You’re known as an empathetic team player. HSPs notice subtle cues and can show great empathy toward their colleagues, which is a great skill. That’s what makes HSPs good team members. But if you are taking on everybody else’s stresses and problems, it can also lead HSPs to burn out quickly, Wilding cautioned. “Sometimes we’re more invested. We want something more than other people want it for themselves.” Wilding said that she has had HSP clients who ran themselves into the ground, “trying to be the hero and the one taking care of everyone else around them.” What you can do if you are an HSP at work If these signs are resonating with your experience, Aron has developed a test, which you can take here , to see if you are highly sensitive. There are also a few steps you can take to make your workday a little easier: Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Give your unique brain the tools it needs to succeed at work. When you’re an HSP, it helps if you can design your workday to honor the fact that your brain needs to process information deeply and that it can become easily stimulated. And if you’re a manager of an HSP, help them out by sending agendas out in advance and giving everyone more time to think before brainstorms or decisions. The manager of an HSP could signal this by saying, “I would love to hear from you all if you have some initial ideas now, but you’re also welcome to sit with this and follow up with me about whatever comes back to you,” Wilding suggested. And if you’re an HSP, it helps to plan to be at every scheduled event 30 minutes early. “You have a little extra time to rest, get your bearings, set your workstation up, that kind of thing,” Freund said. “Changed my life when I started doing that.” And if you don’t have that extra time, just mentally start prepping for that next event in your head. Accept your sensitivity. Being a HSP can have job challenges, but being highly perceptive can also be a competitive advantage at work. “I would often be able to sense that there was a change coming ... before it was publicly announced,” Wilding said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Freund said that when you are an HSP, you may be the one who can calm down a upset client or be the person who is really conscientious at making sure that all elements of a strategy are thought through. “Those are huge advantages that you bring to the table that other people may not have.” The empathy of HSPs, who are often driven by a need for fairness and justice, can also make them highly valued bridge-builders, Wilding said. “They tend to be good at brokering relationships across an organization,” she said. “Because we’re more attuned to people’s needs, pain points, motivations, that actually makes us really good persuaders and influencers.” So HSPs should take pride in their innate skills, because it is not a character defect. “There’s a lot of misconceptions around what it means to be sensitive,” Wilding added. “It’s just the way it is. ... It’s a part of your personality.“ Once you accept your HSP trait, you may find that there is a community that is waiting for you. “The more you talk about your trait, the more you’ll find your people, and the more other people will learn that it is simply a different way that your brain works,” Freund said. “It’s mostly a gift, so I think we need a little HSP pride.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Related highly sensitive people work habits 4 Signs Your Perfectionism Is Becoming Toxic 5 Signs That You Have Burnout From A Job You Love Here's What Happens to Your Body When You Hate Your Job Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up An essential daily guide to achieving the good life Subscribe to our lifestyle email.

And it could be harming your professional reputation. In a recent study published in Personnel Psychology, Jessica Rodell , a researcher from the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business, along with her colleagues, found that people who brag about feeling stressed at work are seen as less competent and likable by their co-workers. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “We want other people to like us and think that we’re smart. But if we say it directly, then we innately kind of know it’s not going to work,” Rodell told HuffPost, adding that stress bragging can be an indirect attempt to communicate that you are a valuable hard worker, “but it doesn’t work.” If you work long enough, you will encounter a stress bragger who needs to impress you with their challenging, tough job ― or you might be the stress bragger yourself. Advertisement “A large reason why stress bragging commonly happens is that we still live in a society that glorifies being busy,” said Shannon Garcia, a psychotherapist at States of Wellness Counseling based in Illinois and Wisconsin. “If we are pushing ourselves to the max and beyond at work, we want people to know about it.” Why stress bragging backfires at work In an experiment part of Rodell’s study, 360 participants were asked to read different scenarios about a fictional colleague who had just returned from a work conference, with one of the scenarios being about a stress bragger. This co-worker complained that the conference was “just one more thing on my full plate. And I was already stressed to the max … you have no idea the stress that I am under.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Participants rated that colleague as significantly less warm and competent than another employee who simply said it was “good” but also stressful, or one who boasted about how awesome the conference was. “Even though someone may think, ‘Oh, this is conveying that I have a lot of responsibility and demands at work,’ what someone else is seeing with stress bragging is, ‘You’re not good enough to keep up with your job,’” Rodell said. “And the overt, explicit kind of direct talking about it as if it’s a badge of honor is the part that lowers the likability. We value humility and relatability with others, and that bragging makes us like people less,” she added. This behavior has the potential for long-term negative consequences; participants in the experiment said they were less likely to go out of their way to help a stress bragger, for example. “They’re not going to offer to help you with a project or speak highly about you to somebody else,” Rodell said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); What to do if you are a stress bragger ― or work with one ― at your job The takeaway from the study is not that you cannot ever admit to feeling stressed at work, but to be considerate of how you express it. Psychologist and executive coach Lauren Appio said stress bragging might be a way for people to communicate their needs indirectly “and hope someone else will pick up on them without having to do the hard or embarrassing thing of speaking up more transparently.” But people often “chafe” at indirect communication and can become “annoyed that you won’t just come out with it,” Appio noted. So instead of doing passive-aggressive stress bragging, she suggested trying to directly communicate your experience with, “I’m overwhelmed and really need to adjust my workload” or “I’m really proud I got tapped for this big project!” And remember that if you’re stressed, it’s likely your co-workers are, too. So don’t forget to ask them how they are doing. That’s a key difference between a draining vent session and a commiserating two-way conversation with a colleague. “Statements like, ‘It’s a lot today, isn’t it?’ or ‘It’s been a hard week’ are both ways to invite that they may also be feeling the pressure of work,” Garcia said. “Acknowledging co-workers’ efforts and challenges shows that you recognize everyone has their own burdens.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); And if you work with a stress bragger, you need to be vigilant about protecting your energy because stress bragging has a “contagion effect” on workplaces, Rodell said. In another experiment for Rodell’s study, 187 pairs of employees were surveyed over weeks about the stresses of working with each other. The employees who worked closely with stress-bragging colleagues reported higher levels of personal stress and burnout. “The more you are with somebody who’s bragging about stress, the more stressed you are likely to feel,” Rodell said, adding that in worst cases, it can create a workplace where it becomes an expectation to be stressed and to value that stress. In this way, stress bragging has higher stakes than one disgruntled co-worker — it can start to take down and lower the energies of a whole team. “If you’re already stressed and your co-worker starts unloading about their stress, you may not have the emotional capacity to hear it. So you may feel frustrated and resentful toward the stress bragger for adding more to your emotional plate,” Appio said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); So for the sake of your own wellbeing, it’s important to walk away or redirect the conversation back to work if your debriefs with peers keep turning into stress-bragging sessions. “What this is showing is we internalize [stress] without realizing [it],” Rodell said about her study. “And so we should be careful not to overly indulge the stress braggart, because we will take on some of that stress over time.” Related Stress Work burnout Black People Who Follow This Common Career Advice Face Backlash From White Managers When Living For The Weekend Becomes A Sign Of Job Burnout How To Make Sure Your Work Is Noticed (Without Being Obnoxious) Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up An essential daily guide to achieving the good life Subscribe to our lifestyle email.

When you are hunting for a job, you know how hard it can be to find a position that can boost your career. But even after you secure an offer, your work is not done. You need to think carefully about which city the job is in. That’s because, even if you get your dream job, its location can determine the size of your wallet ― especially if it requires you to make a pricey move. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “Before you say ‘yes’ to a job, it’s essential to understand the cost of living in another city, especially if your current location is more affordable,” career strategist Ana Goehner told HuffPost. “You may need more than the salary you agree upon to cover your cost of living.” And in the United States, there are cities where it will be significantly easier for young professionals to get ahead in their careers, according to a new report by personal finance company WalletHub. For the ranking, more than 180 U.S. cities were considered on 26 key metrics. These ranged from the availability of entry-level jobs and unemployment rates to the average monthly starting salary and housing affordability. Advertisement Based on the criteria, there was a clear winner and loser for where young professionals should build their careers. Here’s what to know: Atlanta came out on top as the best city to start a career. Atlanta beat out the rest of U.S. cities for young professionals due to its high median income growth rate, abundant job opportunities, and high job satisfaction. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “The city offers plenty of entry-level job opportunities, a high number of quality employers, and a strong average starting salary of $4,342” per month, according to WalletHub analyst Cassandra Happe. “Its vibrant atmosphere is reflected in a young, educated population and high rankings for fun and entertainment, making it appealing for singles and young professionals.” Here are the other top nine cities: Orlando, Florida Salt Lake City, Utah Tampa, Florida Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Portland, Maine Charleston, South Carolina Austin, Texas Miami, Florida Knoxville, Tennessee To grow your career, you need the ability to have a thriving network and booming businesses that can pay salaries that match your value. Atlanta is one of those cities for new graduates and emerging professionals. But regardless of which city you live in, it’s important to ask yourself: “Is this the center of gravity for where things happen in this industry or company? It’s a lot easier to rub shoulders with the decision-makers if it is,” suggested Gorick Ng, a Harvard career adviser and creator of the “ How To Say It ” flashcard professional communication series. New York City ranked dead last to launch a career. New York City was last in the ranking due to its high cost of living, lack of affordable housing, and relatively few entry-level job openings, which present high hurdles for new professionals. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “The high cost of living and lengthy commute times make it particularly challenging for recent graduates entering the job market,” Happe said. If you live in New York City, good luck finding an apartment that will not eat up your whole paycheck. The median asking rent in New York City has risen by 1.7% year over year to $3,700 in April, according to a recent report by StreetEasy, a real estate company. Emiko Powers, 24, works as an assistant to three NBC anchors in New York City. When she first moved to the city in 2022 for the company’s page program, she was earning $18.50 an hour and fully supporting herself. “It’s a lot more convenient to live in New York when you have a lot of money, because you can pay for Uber s and moving and all these different things,” Powers said. “Whereas if you don’t have money, you’re paying for it in other ways where it’s taking a toll on your body.” Winning the city’s affordable housing lottery with a roommate “has definitely taken a weight off [her] shoulders,” she said.

If you want to work in a pricey city, first ask yourself: “Is this a temporary stop or my forever city?” Ng said. “If it’s your forever city because you have family or a particular attachment to the place, there’s clearly something special about this place that transcends any list,” he said. “If this is a temporary stop, however, then it’s time to ask yourself: ‘When will I know that I’ve gotten the most of this place ― and what’s my ‘next best place’?” And get a roommate. Ng said it is a lot easier to meet new people with roommates, and it can be easier to land a job if your roommate works there or knows someone who works there.

She did not go for the “glitz and the glamour,” she said, but because of the teaching opportunities and the culture and community the city offers. To make ends meet, she splits her $2,800 Manhattan rent with her roommate, cooks most of her meals, buys thrifted clothes and is strict about paying off her credit card each week. She knew New York City would have a high cost of living, but for Shekian, it is worth it. “Having access to all those amazing museums and being right in the hub of the city is just something I’ve prioritized in my life,” Shekian said. But the world is a big place, and there’s a limit to how many sacrifices you need to endure to build your career. Powers said she does not recommend moving to an expensive city without a job lined up: “I don’t think that I would have been able to handle the stress of looking for a job, not having an income while living in a city as expensive as New York.” Use cost-of-living calculators that compare rent, groceries, gas prices, transportation, and utilities in your chosen city. You do not want to work in an expensive city that has you barely scraping by each month, Goehner said. “That won’t make you satisfied with your life and job for too long. You’ll often feel stressed over money,” she said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “If you can’t afford to pay rent, if you can’t afford to get groceries ... then I don’t think it’s worth it. Because living in that state of stress just for the city is not ideal,” Shekian said. Additionally, be mindful of the friends you hang out with, because they can make it easier or harder to stay within your budget. Powers said that, after college, some of her friends went on to make “six figures” while “I’m not even close to that.” Know that you do not need to be spending money to have a fun time. For the most part, Powers said, her local friends are in similar income brackets as she is, so she does not think, “‘I wish I could be doing that,’ because we’re all kind of just doing things that we’re able to do together.” Only you can know when it’s best to leave or stay in a city for your peace of mind and career. Powers knows she could have a better quality of life that wouldn’t be as expensive in a different city, “but I feel like the experiences that I’m gaining right now are irreplaceable and valuable.” “I don’t plan on leaving anytime soon,” Powers added. “But that’s definitely always something to keep in the back of my mind, like, ‘Is this the best place for me right now?’” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Related Careers job market The 1 Question You Should Always Ask A New Roommate After Your Internship Ends, Make Sure To Do These 5 Things We've All Had A 'Bridge Job' — And There's No Shame In It Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up An essential daily guide to achieving the good life Subscribe to our lifestyle email.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost I was settling in for an interview over Zoom when I glanced at my baby monitor and saw it: the unmistakable wiggle of a toddler who’d pooped himself awake from a nap. I sighed and set the monitor aside. I had no choice but to wait till after the call to check on him. When the Zoom ended, I dashed in to clean him up, then texted my friend a photo of the three of us (my baby, myself and my laptop). “Look at me,” I wrote wryly. “I have it all.” I started thinking a lot about “having it all” after my son was born in late 2021. I went back to work after four months of parental leave, breast-pumping my way through phone calls and changing diapers on the sly. I loved being close to my son and was lucky to have a husband who thrived as a stay-at-home dad, but it was all so completely exhausting. For every stolen midday snuggle there was sobbing (on both sides of the door) when I had to close my eyes and tune out my son’s cries for Mommy as I buckled down to get a project done. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Surely, I often thought to myself, this isn’t what Helen Gurley Brown had in mind when she published “Having It All,” her famed book of advice on balancing sex, work, relationships and more, in 1982. I may have a career and a family, but I often “have it all” — or, rather, do it all — at the exact same time. Stephanie Hallett The author at work at home. In the summer of 2012, just a couple of years into my journalism career, The Atlantic published Anne-Marie Slaughter’s culture-defining text, “ Why Women Still Can’t Have It All .” In it, she described stepping back from powerful government work to be closer to home and more available to her two teenage sons, and she outlined the workplace changes she saw as necessary to allow ambitious women to pursue big careers and remain present mothers. I read it hungrily, feeling smug about my own ambivalence toward motherhood. At 25, I was climbing the career ladder fast and loving it. Why derail the train with a baby when the ride was so exciting? Plus, I couldn’t imagine a world where Slaughter’s proposed changes — more flexible schedules, remote work, less business travel, teleconferencing instead of in-person meetings — would materialize. Little did I know a global pandemic would abruptly shift that tide. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); A decade later, in a post-COVID world, I had, in many ways, exactly what Slaughter had described: an exciting career with a flexible, remote job that allowed me to be close to the baby I’d decided I wanted. But I also had a hefty dose of burnout. For me, it was all too much — the constant doing it all. And I was losing my ambition as a result. I’m not the first millennial mom with an office job to feel this way. Between lazy girl jobs , the death of the girlboss and the countless ambitious women who’ve written about losing their drive in recent years , the collapse of millennial women’s ambition is well-documented. Heck, we now even have the millennial mom midlife crisis . But it’s no wonder: Millennial moms work more than previous generations of mothers , and we spend more time parenting our kids , plus our parents can’t or don’t want to help us out (or need care themselves). And then there’s the astronomical cost of child care. We are at capacity all the time, even with the trappings of professional flexibility. I decided to ask Anne-Marie Slaughter what comes next. The workplace transition isn’t over yet. Slaughter acknowledged that we’ve made strides toward her envisioned workplace, but we’re not there yet. “We’ve transitioned the where we can work, and we have the flexibility — so now, if your kid is sick or you have a teacher’s conference or you need to take a parent to a doctor’s appointment, you have the flexibility to do that,” she said. But we haven’t reached the place where professional and personal ambition can coexist. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Aside from major structural changes we know are needed to support families — such as 12 months of parental leave, plentiful and affordable child care, free pre-kindergarten and well-funded public schools — there is one big thing that needs to change in the workplace, according to Slaughter: management practices. Face time is still the reigning tool for performance measurement, and that disadvantages anyone working remotely. “If you’re in the office and that other person is in the office, you are still going to have a better sense that they are working than the person who is not [in the office],” she said. “I’ve said for a long time, to really make this work, you have to have much more objective and precise management practices, and that takes more work. I don’t think we’re there yet.” Indeed, McKinsey’s Women in the Workforce reports from both 2022 and 2023 found that women in leadership are leaving their roles in record numbers, in part because their labor isn’t being recognized by their superiors. They’re taking on diversity, equity and inclusion work or heading up employee resource groups in addition to their full-time roles, for example, but it’s not being counted toward their overall performance, and they’re working remotely (often to juggle family responsibilities), which is being counted against them. “They are looking for the ability to advance. They are looking for flexibility and choice in terms of where, when and how they work. They are looking for companies that authentically prioritize DE&I. They are looking for people who are backing their careers,” said McKinsey senior partner Lareina Yee in a podcast about the 2022 report . But, quite frankly, she said, “companies haven’t stepped up.” Beyond changes in performance evaluation and management, Slaughter also advocates for what she described in her Atlantic article as “investment intervals,” the idea that you grind hard in certain periods of your work life ― early in your career before you have kids, for example ― and then make different choices as your career moves forward, including saying no to promotions that won’t work for your family life or taking time off from full-time work to consult, take a sabbatical or accept project-based work. Then when your kids are grown, you can lean back in and keep rising. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); In my view, when it comes to frazzled millennial moms, a wholesale shift in the way we understand and reward professional ambition is due. Forget this idea that moving up, down, back or sideways in your career is a sign that you’re not committed. Instead, we must think of ambition as a tide — sometimes rolling in, sometimes rolling out, always doing its part. Under this rubric, millennial moms aren’t losing their ambition, they’re simply moving with the tide, and there’s no reason to feel ashamed about that. We shouldn’t be sent back to square one in our careers simply because the tide of our ambition went out while our children needed us most. Slaughter said that taking a break to have kids or to work on professional development isn’t the kiss of death that it used to be, but “there are still plenty of workplaces where, if you get knocked off that straight-up path, it’s going to be very, very hard to get back on. I can see it changing; it just hasn’t changed yet.” At her company, New America , Slaughter said she’s found that a flexible and supportive culture, which includes hybrid work, paid parental leave and a “family comes first” mantra, has ensured the work always gets done without sacrificing people’s personal lives and has also helped more junior staff find opportunities to rise and be seen. Parental leave, for example, “creates opportunities for other people, younger people, other members of the team” to step in and work with Slaughter and other senior staff who they might not have otherwise crossed paths with directly. “It builds resilience in the workplace.” Embrace a holistic view of ambition. Slaughter sees millennial and Gen Z workers rejecting the old hustle-culture model and applauds it, but also notes that many of us aren’t sure where to go from here. “There’s a sense that the world that we knew is coming apart in many ways, and people are not sure what they should be wanting,” she said. “But they know that the traditional whatever it was that was going to make you happy is not likely to.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); That said, she thinks the idea of striving to be a “whole, healthy person” is a move in the right direction. “By whole, I really do mean having different dimensions to your life. That could be work and family, that could be sports, hobbies, friendships.” She doesn’t even use the phrase “having it all” anymore. “The whole framing makes me uncomfortable, even though that is the phrase I grew up with that meant having a career and a family,” she said. “There’s a hyper-capitalist dimension to it” that runs counter to the way most millennials and Gen Zers think about their lives. It’s time we tossed it for good and focused on building workplaces that support the multidimensional lives of all workers. As for our millennial mom midlife crises and waning ambition? Slaughter advises us all to hang in there. “It is a life passage that many, many, many people go through. We are maturing into our fuller selves who realize that there’s more to life and there’s more to ambition. I have plenty of ambition. It’s just not expressed in the way that it once was, to climb to the top of a particular ladder.” Related Motherhood burnout the good life millenials working women 6 'Invisible' Household Tasks That Eat Up Moms' Time And Energy These Comics Highlight The Unfair Ways Society Views Moms Vs.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Illustration: Damon Dahlen/HuffPost; Photos: Getty The textbook meaning of \"sure\" suggests certainty and affirmation, but in online texts, it can imply that you are not enthusiastic. About a year ago, Isabel Steckel texted her 30-year-old older brother about hanging out the following afternoon. She received a one-word reply: “Sure.” “If you’re bringing ‘sure’ attitude, then let’s not do it,” Steckel countered. “And he said, ‘lol,’ and I said, ‘I’m not kidding, lol.’” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); This May, the New York City-based comedian shared a screenshot of this conversation on X, formerly Twitter, and received more than 11,000 likes. The “sure” haters rose up to share how answering “sure” sounds passive and dispiriting. A “sure” texter apologized in a reply for the violence he had “inflicted while trying to appear easy and breezy.” This is only the latest entry in a perennial and continuously divisive debate over what “sure” really means. One Reddit user in the subreddit for “unpopular opinions” declared that the word “sure” is “synonymous with ‘yes’ and shouldn’t be associated with sarcasm and attitude,” while a commentator for the Outline wrote in 2018 that the word is “the most passive-aggressive affirmative phrase” that is “a thumbs up to your face, and a jerkoff motion behind your back.” Advertisement Clearly, we are not sure about what “sure” should mean. Although the dictionary meaning of “sure” is affirmation and certainty, its meaning can be anything but certain but in a text conversation. Why “sure” sounds so passive and indecisive in texts, according to a sociolinguist Steckel said the word’s meaning is context dependent. She noted that replying “sure” for an errand or task is fine, but it sounds more devastating to hear when you are inviting someone to spend time with you. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “Asking someone to hang out for me is like a very vulnerable move. So when I’m getting that ‘sure,’ I’m like, ‘Alright, fuck it. I’m not doing it,’” she said. Steckel said a “sure” reply sounds like the other person would rather “die than hang out” and “forcing someone to hang out with you is the worst feeling in the world.” The problem with “sure” is that it sounds more tentative and less enthusiastic than an outright “yes!” or “absolutely,” especially when you do not have body language or vocal cues to reassure you. “Sure is sort of indecisive, or has kind of a hesitant quality to it. Like, ‘Do want to go to the movies?’ ‘Sure.’ Do you really want to go?” explained Georgetown University sociolinguist Cynthia Gordon . Gordon said the different meanings of “sure” might also be generational. “The younger generation expects more enthusiasm in texting in general than older folks do,” she said. She also noted that “women tend to expect more of those explicit markers of enthusiasm.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); In a text, the length of a message can also take on outsized importance in the absence of in-person cues. Similar to why a one-word “OK” or “k” reply sounds so alarming and curt to receive, shorter answers imply lesser effort. Meanwhile, Gordon said that the effort to write a full sentence or to write some extra exclamation points suggests, “Yeah, I really am enthusiastic about this.” It’s why a one-word “sure” stirs doubt, but “sure thing” ― my own standard reply ― can sound slightly more genuine, if you are truly down to follow through on a request. One helpful tip if you do get a bland “sure” is to take a step back and remember that it’s not automatically a sign of disinterest. Gordon said every person thinks their own way of communication is the natural way and “we all need to be more generous in our interpretations.” Gordon cited the “Key & Peele” sketch between comedians Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele as a classic example of this. In the video , “there’s a whole miscommunication just because one person misinterprets the other’s kind of short, casual messages as being like, ‘I don’t care, I don’t care.’ But that’s not what’s going on,” Gordon explained. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); In the sketch, it’s not until the anxious friend character sees his smiling buddy’s face at the bar that he realizes that his friend actually wanted to hang out with him. It’s a reminder that in-person intonation can provide more valuable information about the state of your relationship than just a one-word “sure” text. But until you meet up in-person, it does not hurt to give your conversation partner a little more reassurance. “I would be less happy if I invited someone somewhere and they said, ‘Sure.’ I think I’d want more enthusiasm for some social kind of engagement,” Gordon said. “If you’re making the effort to connect with somebody, and kind of put it out there that you do something together and the other person says, ‘sure,’ it wouldn’t meet my expectations for suggesting it was going to be a good time.“ Padding your “sure” with a cheerful exclamation or even an extra word or two can make it clearer that you are truly agreeable to what the other person is saying. “I do think a ‘sure’ with an exclamation point is worlds different than just a normal ‘sure,’” Steckel said. All to say: You can be “sure,” or you can be “sure!” Do you want to possibly send your friend or family member into an anxious spiral or do you want to spend one additional second adding that bubbly exclamation point or extra word?

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Laurence Fishburne as beleaguered Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers in the new FX series \"Clipped,\" which depicts the downfall of the racist Clippers owner Donald Sterling in 2014. Kelsey McNeal/FX Watching the new FX series “Clipped” made me nostalgic for a particular era of the internet. 2014 was a boom time for digital media and the peak of the blogging era. Lots of websites were publishing smart and snarky reporting and writing. Twitter, though not without its faults, was a place where you could actually have some robust convers ations, rather than a pit latrine of conspiracy theories and sponsored content overseen by a manchild. In the spring of 2014, the story of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling exploded onto the internet, when TMZ published leaked audio of him going on a racist rant, as secretly recorded by his assistant and girlfriend V. Stiviano. There was a lot of sharp and thoughtful writing and reporting on all angles of the story ― what it said about the NBA and professional sports as institutions, and how it also went way beyond that. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); The Sterling saga yielded online conversations about an abundance of big subjects. People wrote all kinds of incisive pieces about race, gender, class, celebrity, labor, activism and housing policy. For years, Sterling and his wife Shelly had been stiffing and discriminating against Black and brown tenants in Los Angeles — not unlike another famous Donald on the other coast, who would run for president a year later. In addition to the serious discourse, people also had a lot of fun with the story, circulating jokes and memes on Twitter , a hallmark of this type of news cycle. (It also made an impression on me personally: As a junior in college at the time, starting to seriously pursue a journalism career, I have a distinct memory of the Sterling saga as emblematic of that era of digital media. Each day, I loved logging on to Twitter and finding the work of so many smart writers, dreaming of being part of it myself.) The visual tapestry of “Clipped” is reminiscent of that time, such as how each episode transitions between scenes using scrolling Instagram feeds — specifically, Instagram as it looked in 2014. But the six-episode limited series, premiering Tuesday on Hulu, loses a lot of the necessary context that the internet gave the story at the time. Based on “ The Sterling Affairs ,” a 2019 podcast from ESPN’s “30 for 30” series, the show would have worked better as a docuseries (perhaps on ESPN itself). By zooming out and featuring commentary from people who were involved in or covered the story contemporaneously, a docuseries could have brought more viewers into the enormous scope of this story and reflected on it a decade later. Dramatizing the Sterling saga in a prestige limited series, despite its many excellent performances, is an approach that’s unable to give the story the context it needs. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Jacki Weaver as Shelly Sterling, Ed O'Neill as Donald Sterling and Cleopatra Coleman as V. Stiviano in \"Clipped.\" Kelsey McNeal/FX But hoo boy, do the show’s actors make a scrumptious meal out of these characters. Ed O’Neill brings the requisite amount of cartoon villain energy to Sterling. Laurence Fishburne brings both gravitas and crankiness to Clippers coach and NBA legend Doc Rivers. Cleopatra Coleman and Jacki Weaver as V. Stiviano and Shelly Sterling, respectively, are also fantastic. Coleman in particular brings welcome depth and complexity to Stiviano, who in the public narrative at the time was often flattened and reduced to “the mistress.” The cast formidably accentuates the larger-than-life qualities of the characters in this saga. But the maximalism of some of the acting and the dramatic heights of the show inadvertently distract from the bigger issues at play, which the series gives short shrift. It even left me wondering if “Clipped” is unintentionally reproducing the salaciousness of the story itself. So much of the great writing about the Sterling saga at the time was able to scrutinize the initial tabloid coverage of the story, and underscore how all of it was so much more than a spectacle. By contrast, a dramatization with an excellent cast of boldface names playing these real-life people, all of whom have big personalities, invites and inserts more spectacle. Other than a few standout moments in the middle of the series, as well as a flashback episode that feels shoehorned in, the show is too limited in its scope, never pulling back the lens far enough. Fishburne, O'Neill and Weaver in \"Clipped.\" Kelsey McNeal/FX Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); I can understand not wanting to make a show that hews too closely to the format of the original source material, essentially making a visual version of the podcast. Different mediums can serve different purposes and reach different audiences. If you’re interested in the drama and spectacle of this cast of characters, a limited series might be your preferred vehicle for consuming this story. But if you’re interested in the context, you won’t get much of that here. That’s a loss for viewers. So much of the Sterling saga wasn’t just about the story — it was about how it was covered, and how each news cycle found more and more layers to it. Sadly, a lot of those pieces are lost to time and bad decisions by media CEOs, who wiped away the work of plenty of talented writers. That era of the internet is long gone.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost Tom Pecinka is a 2024 Tony Award nominee for his performance in \"Stereophonic,\" now playing in New York. via Associated Press As the ruthlessly ambitious Peter in Broadway’s “ Stereophonic ,” Tom Pecinka gets to live out a 1970s rock star fantasy — replete with the sex, drugs and retro fashion — onstage. Though the actor describes his Tony-nominated performance as a full-throttle, emotional purge, he’s grateful to leave that experience behind after curtain call. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “There are things I get to do as Peter that I don’t get to do in my life,” Pecinka, who is making his Broadway debut, told HuffPost. “Peter allows himself to blow up, and I’d be lying if I said getting to scream at someone wasn’t cathartic. But I like to keep him at the theater. I do a ritual every night where I take off the necklace I wear and say goodbye to him, because he’s not the most fun person to live with.” Now playing at New York’s Golden Theatre, “Stereophonic” has been nominated for 13 Tony Awards — the most ever for a Broadway play. On Tuesday, the show’s run was extended through Jan. 5 after originally being slated to close next month. Written by David Adjmi and directed by Daniel Aukin , the drama follows a Laurel Canyon-era rock band in the throes of recording an album. Peter is the band’s hot-headed guitarist and is involved in a tempestuous, on-and-off relationship with singer-songwriter Diana ( Sarah Pidgeon ). Tom Pecinka, Will Brill and Sarah Pidgeon in \"Stereophonic.\" Julieta Cervantes Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Peter and Diana’s bandmates are three Brits: bassist Reg (Will Brill) and keyboardist Holly ( Juliana Canfield ), who are a married couple, and drummer Simon (Chris Stack). They’re joined in their Sausalito, California, studio by a pair of hapless engineers, Grover ( Eli Gelb ) and Charlie (Andrew R. Butler). The band’s recording sessions are, of course, a fiery clash of egos. Over the course of three hours, the characters reveal their inner turmoil in between laying down music, which includes performing original songs by musician Will Butler, formerly of the band Arcade Fire. “Artists come to the show, and they go: ‘Oh, I know the pain and the joy of that process,’” Pecinka said. “But anyone who’s done a group project in elementary school where they were paired with someone they hate, or maybe they had to do all of the work because no one else did ... can also relate.” Watch the video for “Masquerade” from Broadway’s “Stereophonic” cast recording below. Much of the buzz on “Stereophonic” has emphasized the fictional band’s many parallels to Fleetwood Mac, whose masterpiece 1977 album “Rumours” was recorded as members Christine McVie and John McVie were on the brink of divorce, while Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks had also called it quits on their relationship. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Pecinka spent months in guitar lessons in preparation for his role, sending videos to the show’s creative team to keep them abreast of his weekly progress. Though he looked to Buckingham early on, his interpretation of Peter also winks at Mick Jagger, Robert Plant and James Taylor, among other ’70s music icons. “I never felt like it was the Fleetwood Mac story, because these characters are so fleshed out, they felt like their own people,” he said. Vocally, he added, “my touchstone was 1970s Billy Joel, because that was the music I grew up with from that period. So it was already sort of in me.” A Wantagh, New York, native, Pecinka auditioned for “Stereophonic” in 2020, mere days before COVID-19 shuttered theaters nationwide. The play received its premiere off-Broadway staging in fall of 2023, and the actor said the chance to work with a contemporary writer was worth the wait. “Until then, my career had mostly been Shakespeare and Chekhov and Ibsen — dead people,” he quipped. \"I never felt like it was the Fleetwood Mac story, because these characters are so fully fleshed out, they felt like their own people,\" said Pecinka (on left, with Pidgeon). Julieta Cervantes Though “Stereophonic” is billed as a “play with music” rather than a musical, Pecinka and his cast mates were able to document the show’s songs for posterity on a new cast album . Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); It’s an achievement the actor, who was told by casting agents that his rock tilt was ill-suited for traditional musical theater, is especially proud of: “It always caused me shame and sadness that I wasn’t able to do those things, but now I’m singing in the way I want to sing on Broadway.” Most of Pecinka’s off-stage time these days is spent preparing for the June 16 Tony Awards, where he’s nominated for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play alongside Brill and Gelb. Looking beyond “Stereophonic,” he’s eager to parlay his newfound acclaim into television and film work as well as theater. As for future roles, he believes they may have yet to be written. “I used to be more like Peter when I was younger ― a person who’s chasing success and working really hard,” he said. ”[But] the thing Peter has taught me is that my dream role may not even exist yet. I don’t feel like I’ve been pigeonholed. If I can maintain that, I’ll be a very happy clam.” \"I like playing someone who is very complicated, and there are things I get to do as Peter that I don’t get to do in my life,\" Pecinka said.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost The musical adaptation of \"The Outsiders\" is now playing at New York's Jacobs Theatre. Matthew Murphy When S.E. Hinton published “The Outsiders” in 1967, many were surprised to learn that an author who so deftly probed young men’s experiences with toxic masculinity and class conflict was a woman. As a female director, Danya Taymor knew she’d similarly be going against expectations in bringing the musical adaptation of “The Outsiders” to Broadway. After all, the 1983 movie version of Hinton’s story was directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Going back to the source material, however, Taymor felt an instant “kinship” with Hinton’s coming-of-age tale. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “My older brother, Ari, had his friends over at our house all the time when I was growing up, and I saw them in so many facets of being,” Taymor told HuffPost. “I saw them vulnerable, I saw them aggressive. I saw them interact with girls.” Hinton “felt compelled to write about these boys who were her chosen family with a compassionate gaze,” she continued. “I tried to direct this thinking of my 15-year-old self, because the story has an ability to put you back in touch with that self, when so many formative things happened.” Danya Taymor and Brody Grant are 2024 Tony Award nominees for \"The Outsiders\" for Best Direction in a Musical and Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical, respectively. Bruce Glikas via Getty Images Featuring a score by folk-rock duo Jamestown Revival and writer Justin Levine, “The Outsiders” opened on Broadway in April. At Sunday’s Tony Awards, the show is nominated in 12 categories , including Best Musical and Best Direction of a Musical for Taymor. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Like Hinton’s book, the musical is told from the perspective of 14-year-old Ponyboy Curtis (played by Brody Grant ), one of three orphaned brothers and a member of a working-class “Greasers” gang in Tulsa, Oklahoma, circa 1967. Ponyboy is thrust into the center of rising tensions between the Greasers and a rival, upper-middle-class gang called the “Socs” after bonding with Sherri “Cherry” Valance (Emma Pittman), whose boyfriend, Bob Sheldon (Kevin William Paul), is the Socs’ ringleader. When a reckless altercation between the Greasers and the Socs ends in tragedy, Ponyboy and his best friend, Johnny Cade ( Sky Lakota-Lynch ), flee town. Emma Pittman, as Cherry Valance, and Grant, as Ponyboy Curtis, in Broadway's \"The Outsiders.\" Matthew Murphy The threat of violence still looms, however, resulting in the much-buzzed-about “rumble” sequence , which involves dirt, rain, stage blood and some of the most breathtaking choreography on Broadway. “The Outsiders” marks Taymor’s return to Broadway after directing the 2021 play “ Pass Over .” Playwright Adam Rapp approached Taymor about “The Outsiders” after catching an early “Pass Over” performance ― an experience that Taymor now views as “kismet.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “For ‘Pass Over’ to be the project that connected me to ‘The Outsiders’ just felt right, because it’s so representative of who I am as an artist,” she said. “I trusted that.” In translating “The Outsiders” to the stage, Taymor pored through photo books on rural America by Larry Clark and Richard Avedon, while she and the cast visited Hinton , now 75, in her Oklahoma home. Also critical was the involvement of Angelina Jolie , who joined the creative team as a producer following the show’s 2023 run in La Jolla, California. In fact, it was Jolie’s 15-year-old daughter, Vivienne, who convinced her mom to sign on. The \"rumble\" sequence of \"The Outsiders\" involves dirt, rain, stage blood and breathtaking choreography. Matthew Murphy Praising Jolie’s “rigorous artistry,” Taymor says the Oscar winner was a “fearless” presence in rehearsals and made herself accessible to the show’s mostly young cast. As for Vivienne, she noted: “Having an actual teenager around giving us feedback on what she was seeing was so important.” Taymor’s other professional guides include her aunt, film and theater director Julie Taymor , known for the stage adaptation of Disney’s “ The Lion King ” and the 2002 Frida Kahlo biopic “ Frida ,” starring Salma Hayek. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “To see a woman succeed at the level she has, and with the integrity that she has, definitely had a profound effect on me,” Taymor said of her aunt. “She’s always encouraged me not to stay trapped in the box that the industry wants to put you in.” Moving forward, Taymor would also like to try her hand at film, though she has no intention of abandoning theater. While “The Outsiders” continues to draw enthusiastic crowds on Broadway, she’s excited to see the show staged regionally and in schools across the U.S. in years to come. “One of my hopes is that people will take it and make it their own and cast it in a way that feels necessary for their communities,” she said. “It speaks to everybody as an equal.” \"I tried to direct this thinking of my 15-year-old self, because the story has an ability to put you back in touch with that self, when so many formative things happened,\" Taymor said.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter Director Alex Stapleton's new docuseries, \"How Music Got Free,\" examines the rise and fall of music piracy in the late '90s to the early '00s. It also raises questions about how the consumer reconciles rising costs to access their favorite music and movies today. Paramount+ It used to be that consumers never really cared how they accessed their favorite entertainment just as long as they could. Bootlegged blockbusters, still raking in millions at the movie theater, often came directly to them in plastic bags for cheap at the barbershop or hair salon. The hottest music could be downloaded onto their computers, compliments of sites like Napster or Limewire. Concerts were affordable even for young people with $6-an-hour part-time jobs in the late ’90s. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Well, no one cares about access until it’s taken away from them — like when a federal court ruled in 2001 that Napster had to shut down after it was found liable for copyright infringement — or until it becomes a money-devouring complication. That latter fact was a catalyst for the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit just this year against Live Nation, which owns Ticketmaster, a major ticketing site that reached its pinnacle of disaster after some Swifties tried in vain to get tickets to see their girl perform live in 2022. We’ve now reached a point when the issue at the core of all of this can’t be ignored: the bureaucratic and often racialized structure of access. That was top of mind while watching “How Music Got Free,” director Alex Stapleton’s thoughtful new docuseries that traces the humble origins and spectacular fallout of music piracy. Inspired, in part, by the 2015 New Yorker article “ The Man Who Broke the Music Business ” by Stephen Witt, who’s also a producer of “How Music Got Free,” the docuseries illuminates the messy, legal and urgent problem of music access. And the series centers the brilliant, and until recently, anonymous Black mind behind it all. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “How Music Got Free” is told through both archival and new interviews with experts, pirates, law officials, artists like Rhymefest and Eminem, record exec Steve Stoute, Interscope co-founder Jimmy Iovine, journalists like Rocsi Diaz, and high-level music marketers at Universal and Interscope. Record producer and entrepreneur Jimmy Iovine is interviewed in \"How Music Got Free.\" Paramount+ They help contextualize the story as they still struggle to untangle and reconcile the two-episode series’ pressing themes. I raised its foremost issue of the bureaucracy of accessing music early in a one-hour call with Stapleton. She immediately caught my drift. “First of all,” the director began, “I think that the bureaucratic nature of the labels and just industry standards is something that we’re always at odds with as both consumers and makers.” The story at the center of “How Music Got Free” is just one example, Stapleton added. “What we’re in right now with the music industry is where so much of the money is made in touring for artists and live performances,” she said. “Wherever you see that, you’ll see the prices just go up and up and up and up.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); I’ll finish that… and up. For example, premium Taylor Swift tickets can be resold for upwards of $200K, while Beyoncé’s can be at over $1K. To put things into further perspective, the average ticket price in 2000 was $40.74, according to the International Journal of Music Business Research . Even with inflation, that price would only be $74.18 today. Throughout the late ’90s and early ’00s, the era on which “How I Got Free” mostly reflects, piracy became the perfect solution for fans that just wanted to access their favorite songs at a cheaper price (or totally free), and the perfect problem for recording artists and labels alike. For context, CDs cost the consumer on average $17, yet around $1 to manufacture at the time for both complicated and “arbitrary” reasons . But this was long before Spotify and Netflix, and before most people were fluent in the internet and MP3 downloading. Pirating was in all intents and purposes illegal. The labels, working with the FBI, saw to that. With “How I Got Free,” Stapleton argues that that was to the detriment of the industry, particularly because CDs would soon be obsolete and singles were rising in demand. Ludacris and OutKast are a few of the hip-hop artists who made up Stapleton's huge digital music library in the late '90s and early '00s — and it was all pirated music. Theo Wargo via Getty Images Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “What I did want to pick at was this idea of what lengths the industry, or these corporate kinds of places, will go to,” she said. “It’s wild how little they won’t do. They won’t move off the dime. If they’re making money, it’s really hard for them to accept innovation and create change.” What’s particularly interesting about that presumed threat of piracy, as well as leaks, is that practically everyone was participating in this activity at the time — including Stapleton. After growing up on Southern hip-hop in Houston, the filmmaker moved to New York City in the ’90s and meticulously selected roommates based on whoever had the best digital music library. “Because we would share music, you know,” she laughed. “That was a prerequisite.” Stapleton’s personal contribution was a gold mine. “It wasn’t just hip-hop,” she recalled. “I loved finding weird treasures, like covers of Radiohead or other bands that I really loved. In that period, I loved Luda. Like, love, love, LOVED. And definitely OutKast. ‘Bombs Over Baghdad’ was t he Holy Grail moment.” Much of that music could be heard in “How Music Got Free.” “It was a soundtrack to my life — and it was all pirated,” Stapleton said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Her love of hip-hop is part of what drew her to the docuseries. Having worked with LeBron James’ production company SpringHill on her 2018 docuseries, “Shut Up and Dribble,” she was looking to collaborate with the team again when executive Philip Byron brought Witt’s article to her attention. “I was hooked,” Stapleton remembered. “Like, instantly.” A former CD plant factory worker named Bennie Lydell Glover from Shelby, North Carolina, is considered the mastermind behind bringing some of the most popular music and films directly to fans' computers. Paramount+ She started coming up with ideas after reading Witt’s 2016 book, which bears the same title as the docuseries, that expands on his article — a sprawling investigation of the societal, industry and personal motivations that contributed to the rise and fall of piracy. “As a Black Southerner, I loved reading a story where at the center of it was this Black guy from Shelby, North Carolina,” Stapleton said. “And it was a hip-hop story.” Indeed one of the most fascinating parts about Witt’s story, and Stapleton’s adaptation of it, is Bennie Lydell Glover, a Black, and by most means ordinary, CD plant employee from the tiny town of Shelby. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); In the ’90s, Glover began smuggling music out of the plant to a covert online network of pirates. He soon made more money doing that than his full-time job there, and successfully built his own film and music pirating network. But by the end of the 2000s, Glover, amid an increased crackdown on piracy, was indicted on one count of felony conspiracy to commit copyright infringement and served three months in federal prison. Navigating multiple setbacks while shooting during the pandemic in 2021, Stapleton traveled to Shelby for interviews with Glover, who appears so disarming even on camera that everyone — no matter their relationship with him — knows him as simply Dell. With the assistance of Witt, who is also interviewed in the series, the director built enough trust with Glover that he helped her land interviews with people in the area that were close to the story, including other factory workers at the time. “Dell was an open book,” Stapleton told me. Dell Glover speaks during a Q&A following the world premiere of \"How Music Got Free\" on March 9 at Stateside Theater in Austin, Texas, during the SXSW Conference and Festival. Daniel Boczarski via Getty Images Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); With Witt’s work as the canvas, Stapleton’s “How Music Got Free” does an impressive job further illustrating the mundanity of Glover’s life and incredible hustle. “He wanted to provide, like most Americans want to provide for their families,” Stapleton said. “And he had this gift, where he saw an opportunity. That’s very American to be an entrepreneur. Then he got busted — I mean, it was the worst time to be busted with a crime like this.” Not like any era is really an ideal time to be convicted of a federal crime, but, as Stapleton said, “No one understood.” Even investigators interviewed in the series scrambled to understand the laws that were being written in real time as more information about the internet and piracy became available to them. Glover’s story is the heart of “How Music Got Free,” in large part due to Stapleton’s obvious compassion toward him and what he laid the groundwork for, and makes a compelling case for the role of racism in the justice system. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); This is a southern Black man with shoddy legal representation, according to his own ponderings in Witt’s article, against multimillion-dollar and mostly white-owned corporations, and alongside mostly white accomplices with often more financial privilege. Glover didn’t stand a chance. “In the IRL world, he had no access,” Stapleton said. “But on the internet, he was the king maker of access. And I think that there’s something in that.” She grappled with that a bit before she got to a more pointed question: “How is he any different from Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates or Paul Allen?” Stapleton argues that while tech entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs (pictured here) are heralded as innovators, Dell Glover and other pirates who helped prove his technology worked now have criminal records. John G. Mabanglo via Getty Images Beyond the obvious racial difference, those white guys — along with Steve Jobs, who Stapleton also mentions — are recognized as technology game changers. Glover, even knowing what we know now, is not. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The Jobs comparison is a critical point for her. Yes, he was an innovator, the director acknowledges. “But what he built was a gateway drug for people,” she said. “The only reason it was successful was because of an illegal activity: piracy.” That’s a fair point. Both iTunes and the iPod launched in 2001, and most iPod users filled theirs with pirated music. “The fact that he put a ‘don’t download’ sticker on it and that made it OK is really wild to me,” she continued, adding that that is not a diss at Apple. “It’s more like, let’s look at the inverse negative part of this, which is the guys who proved that the technology worked and helped make you money all went to federal prison.” Stapleton’s valid insight there is especially striking because much of it isn’t in the docuseries. It is inferred, but there isn’t a voice that really puts this into such a sharp perspective. While the director admitted that “there were so many other worlds that I would’ve wanted to explore and to have gotten into” had she had more time with the project, the more implicit examination of the role of race and racism in “How Music Got Free” is intentional. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Some of my past work was very like, ‘I’m going to tell you what I mean,’” Stapleton explained. “Like, ‘Shut Up and Dribble’ or my film about white privilege [‘Hello, Privilege. It’s Me, Chelsea’]. Some people sit down for that. A lot of people just judge the film by the title and won’t sit for it.” Fair point. As \"How Music Got Free\" reflects, all of the pirates at the time were men. Most of them were white. Glover was an exception. Paramount+ “I thought with this one — it’s very in your face, when you really look at it,” she continued. “I just wanted people to meet Dell where he was. I wanted to trust the audience.” Still, on a similar point about the role of race, “How I Got Free” does reflect that a large number of pirated music disproportionately impacted Black and/or hip-hop artists. Part of that is wrapped up in the fact that Universal and Interscope were at their height, and hip-hop, which dominated their catalogs, had a lot of crossover demand particularly from middle American young white guys. That demographic is also represented among most of the pirates. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Stapleton said Witt’s book digs a bit deeper into the hip-hop part of this story and the influence of Universal and Interscope at the time, and she had hoped to do that more in the series as well. But she contextualized all of that a bit more with me. “The reason why the world got so many leaks that were hip-hop-related was because what kept the lights on at the plant, for the most part, was printing Universal CDs,” she explained. “And specifically, all of Interscope’s artists were printed there.” This was also around the time when West Coast hip-hop, Dr. Dre especially, blew up. “The rise in ’92, ’93, when Dre put out ‘The Chronic,’ that was kind of the first album that white kids started to listen to in suburbia,” she said, agreeing with my earlier point. “But it only got bigger and crazier. The numbers were insane.” According to Stapleton, \"The reason why the world got so many leaks that were hip-hop-related was because what kept the lights on at the plant, for the most part, was printing Universal CDs.\" This was also around the time when West Coast hip-hop, Dr. Dre especially, blew up. mark peterson via Getty Images While none of the artists interviewed, or even shown in archival footage, were thrilled about their music being pirated, people like 50 Cent, Eminem and Tupac were bigger than ever. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “The piracy wouldn’t have worked if the demand for the music wasn’t there,” Stapleton said. Sure, but as Eminem says in the series, there are many other people beyond him that need to be paid off one record. A whole team of creatives weren’t considered in the piracy game. Timbaland, 50 Cent and Eminem all talk about going to extreme measures (Eminem mentioned that he had his team disguise his CDs while still in production, so no one would know what they were), paranoid that they might have been working or were friends with a mole. Meanwhile, the record labels were trying, and often, to counteract piracy and leaks. “I think it was a financial thing,” Stapleton said. “But I think from an artistic perspective, it definitely hurt? I can’t imagine people getting rough cuts of my films. I would be mortified. So, I can understand. I think that the debate became very two-dimensional, right?” Let’s break that down then. “In the era of Napster and [its founder] Shawn Fanning and all that stuff, it was just, artists make too much money = bad, kids downloading music = good,” she continued. “And even though I will support kids downloading music till the cows come home, it was a lot more complex than that.” Eminem, one of the most-leaked artists at the time, is interviewed in and is a producer of \"How Music Got Free.\" Paramount+ Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); She argued that that would have been the perfect time to have a more complex conversation about what was happening and what needed to happen: “Because we could have potentially figured out some new shit, but nobody really wanted to have that conversation.” “How Music Got Free,” then, ultimately vindicates the pirates and piracy. How do interviewees including Eminem, who’s also a producer on the series, feel about that? “He would have to ultimately answer that question,” Stapleton replied. “But I think that all of the artists realize, ‘Damn, if only we had known what the fuck was going on…’ Most were literally too obsessed and freaking out that it was somebody in the studio, someone close to them.” Stapleton also recognized that Eminem was one of the most leaked artists at that time, and could understand why he was upset. Each of the artists interviewed run a gamut of emotions as the story unravels in the series. “I think it’s cool and interesting for Eminem to kind of own up and not try to switch the narrative,” Stapleton said. “It was important to show how not cool he was with piracy and leaks.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); That’s real. We’re still grappling with the consumer-artist-corporate entertainment relationship today as at-home technology continues to rapidly evolve. It seems like every day now there’s a new article panicking about the lack of movie theater attendance. Meanwhile, a single ticket costs on average $20, and it’s likely that the movie will be on a streamer within a month anyway. Or pirated for you to watch somewhere for free. Miquel Iceta, then Spain's minister of culture and sport, speaks during a presentation at the annual observatory on piracy on Sept. 11, 2023, at the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid. Europa Press News via Getty Images Stapleton is sensitive to how that all folds into the conversation around consumer access. “I think the film industry is probably having a really huge reckoning, thanks to technology and everything we learned during COVID, and all the things we can do in a remote situation without having to interface,” she said. She thought about that some more before adding: “It’s not even so much the streamers right now. It’s the status quo of even other production companies. They just don’t want to change.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); With “How Music Got Free,” she said she’s trying to bring home the point that change remains as inevitable as it ever was, but innovation can still be possible and beneficial. “When you come to a fork in the road where technology meets art, meets how we receive product, you can get with the program and try to figure it out, or resist and lose out,” she said. “The music industry is still in a fallout period. It’s never going to be the same as it was.” Stapleton then said this: “And I think that’s good and bad, for artists.” Sure, because no one, including the artists, wants to lose a nickel on a chance. “Yeah, absolutely,” she said. “I think what will be interesting is: Will these industries go, ‘Well, we can still be profitable. Our profits won’t be astronomical because that’s not sustainable. But how can we still create things?’” 50 Cent is among several artists interviewed in \"How Music Got Free\" who continues to grapple with the complicated effects of piracy. Paramount+ That’s the crucial question. “I think that most artists, from people who make music to people who make films to people who write — we want to be paid for what we do,” Stapleton continued. “So that we can put food on the table and support ourselves, for our families or for ourselves.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Of course. “We want people to be able to access what we make,” she added. “And I think that these are all questions that I have. How do we all enjoy art but in a way that’s economically viable and fair while still allowing artists not to fall into the trope of the starving artist their whole life?” The answer to that, even for Stapleton, remains elusive. Or perhaps overlooked, as with the untapped potential of piracy in Glover’s time. “How Music Got Free” makes you sit with that. “If we’re just having a conversation in an echo chamber with Silicon Valley and the huge corporations and the richest artists of all time,” Stapleton said, “we probably will be missing out on some really interesting and out-of-the-box solutions.” “How Music Got Free” premieres on Paramount+ June 11.

Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Let’s get into the story of the week. For all the naysayers who thought Will Smith wouldn’t and couldn’t do numbers after that incident, how are you feeling now? “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” is absolutely crushing the box office, proving that Smith and Martin Lawrence — who returned as detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett in the fourth installment of the successful, high-octane franchise — are still a dynamic duo. The film has shattered Hollywood’s expectations, reminding everyone that these actors are still box-office heavyweights. The movie earned $56 million from 3,885 theaters in its domestic debut and opened with $48.6 million internationally. That put its global total at $104.6 million, surpassing its production budget. After an interactive press tour and hyping up fans by sharing behind-the-scenes moments, you would think the world would be singing Smith’s praises. Unfortunately, that wasn’t always the case here. On social media, The Hollywood Reporter shared an article under the title “Box Office Upset: Will Smith’s ‘Bad Boys 4’ Delivers Huge Victory for Actor With $56M U.S. Debut, $104.6M Globally.” The post sparked negative reactions online, with users questioning what was so “upsetting” about the film’s impressive performance. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); So let me get this straight. For weeks it’s been doom and gloom for theaters and now because it’s Will Smith you’re upset the film did well? The racism is blatantly showing. https://t.co/M23Zm2360A — Sharronda Williams (@payorwait) June 9, 2024 Yall better have the same energy for when Brad Pitt next movie comes out — The Heir For A Day (@tha_jerk2012) June 9, 2024 ‘Upset’ because yall thought that the slap had upended his career.

(@TheOnlyRSJ) June 9, 2024 Can’t just let the man live without bringing up that slap huh - had to add in that “Huge Victory for Actor” line instead of just saying its performing well. — Kari (@SneakerPhetish) June 9, 2024 Naturally, public figures had to weigh in, too. Stephen A. Smith shared his thoughts on his YouTube show . While conceding that he’s still a fan of Will Smith, the sports commentator went on a tangent about not wanting to see the “Hitch” actor in movies. Instead, he wants Smith to sit down for an interview and explain why he struck Chris Rock at the 2022 Academy Awards. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “I’m just saying a lot of folks ain’t get over what happened,” he said in his rant. “A lot of folks find it hard to just go to the movies to watch you. I’m one of those people, and I never missed a Will Smith movie.” Well, Stephen, you and everyone else who can’t seem to move past the slap will just have to wait on that. Quite frankly, it’s 2024 — and I’m ready for this discussion to be over. It’s interesting that we can’t just celebrate the success of the “Bad Boys” franchise without diminishing its accolades by bringing up old news. Will Smith already apologized to Rock for the slap incident. His new film even makes a nod to the slap in a pitch-perfect moment during the fourth act. (Notably, the movie also nods at Lawrence’s infamous 1996 incident in which he walked into traffic and yelled at cars.) The only person who should have any sort of feelings or response to Smith is Rock himself. If you are not him, it’s OK to stay quiet. It’s time to MOVE ON! I don’t care nor want to hear it anymore.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter (Left to right) Jon Cryer, Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy on set of \"Pretty In Pink\" in 1986. Paramount Pictures via Getty Images It takes about 30 minutes of writer-director Andrew McCarthy’s new documentary “Brats” to realize that it’s not really about anything. Or rather, it’s about vaguely hurt feelings. That’s not to seem inconsiderate. Celebrities are human and well within their right, just as much as anyone else, to explore the difficult emotions they have about something that has impacted them — for better and worse. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “Brats” is trying to have a complex conversation, though it mostly exists on vibes. The film reflects on the effects of the “Brat Pack” moniker, given to a group of young white movie stars in the ’80s, including McCarthy, by journalist David Blum in a 1985 New York magazine article . It was a nod to the “Rat Pack,” which referenced a similarly popular group of entertainers but from the ’40s and ’50s — including Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin — that was a catchy phrase to describe wildly successful superstars/friends who often partied and worked together. According to legend , it was actor Lauren Bacall who originally came up with the otherwise throwaway name when she walked in on Davis, Frank Sinatra, Martin and the others having an alcohol-fueled good time in Vegas one evening and said, “You look like a goddamn rat pack.” Then she turned on her heels and walked away, probably. OK, that last line was added there for effect. But also to highlight a phrase Bacall likely instantly forgot about. Davis, Sinatra and the others were well respected and enjoyed success throughout the end of their lives, apparently unaffected by the “Rat Pack” label. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); (Left to right) Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop, aka the \"Rat Pack,\" in 1960. GAB Archive via Getty Images McCarthy has a different perspective of what happened to him and his group, though. Or so he aims to articulate in “Brats.” Yes, he and his peers — including Molly Ringwald, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe and Emilio Estevez — were making big money, went to clubs and often co-starred in films like 1985’s “St. Elmo’s Fire.” But they were also, as per the director’s biggest gripe, serious actors . They were in great films like 1980’s “Ordinary People,” 1982’s “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” 1983’s “The Outsiders” and “Risky Business,” and 1985’s “Back to the Future” and “The Breakfast Club.” McCarthy feels like the article and moniker that followed the actors in other interviews, which he includes in archival form in the film, didn’t capture that. For whatever it’s worth at this point, Blum’s article does a very good job of dropping the reader right into the scene, illuminating its actor subjects exactly where they’re at (a bustling scene at the Hard Rock Cafe in LA, to be exact) ― which is the mark of any great writing. It captures the point that they’re young, white-hot in Hollywood and having lots of fun with their new fame. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); What it doesn’t do is create a particularly flattering image of the stars. They come off a little flighty and self-involved. For instance, Estevez checks out a “Playmate of the Month” nearby. It’s also sarcastic at times, complete with a list of Brat Pack superlatives, such as “The Hottest of Them All — Tom Cruise, 23” or “The Most Gifted of Them All — Sean Penn, 24.” It’s cheeky, and gets its largest point across that a traditionally older Hollywood had seemingly suddenly birthed a previously elusive class of young actors in their 20s that were thriving. The cast of \"St. Elmo's Fire\" in 1985. (Left to right) Rob Lowe, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore, Emilio Estevez, Mare Winningham, Judd Nelson and Andrew McCarthy. Silver Screen Collection via Getty Images To put this into a more current perspective, consider it along the lines of how Elle magazine recently published its “ Hollywood Rising Class of 2024 ” package highlighting the new and hot young stars on the block. Blum’s article pulls off the veneer, but it accomplishes a similar thing. From a journalist perspective, the “Brat Pack” piece, which only mentions McCarthy once, by the way, is a masterful snapshot that serves as a good reminder that journalists aren’t interviewing stars to be their friends. They’re there to tell the truth about what they see and what you tell them. Nothing more. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); That’s a hard fact that McCarthy only kinda realizes in “Brats,” even though Estevez, who the director interviews at what appears to be a mansion in the film, is the one to raise this point for him. “Brats” follows McCarthy as he attempts to reunite with some of the actors mentioned in or associated with the “Brat Pack” article to hear their thoughts on how it affected them. In short, it didn’t seem to have as grave an impact on them as it did on McCarthy’s sense of self and his own career. Moore, who recently garnered acclaim at the Cannes International Film Festival for “The Substance,” adds crucial nuance, reminding McCarthy that they were all young and, for her in particular, juggling both ambition and excess . They were far from perfect. Lowe playfully asks McCarthy whether a certain drunken night even happened, alluding to an evening where Davis himself appeared, during a rare clashing of both worlds. Lowe’s and McCarthy’s conversation infuses the film with a hint of nostalgia while reflecting on hard-learned facts about themselves and the privilege they all had early in their careers. McCarthy and Rob Lowe in 1985. ABC News Studios The interviews with actors Lea Thompson, Ally Sheedy, Jon Cryer and Timothy Hutton, who are all steadily working as the aforementioned, are versions of the same thing, and once again raise a critical question about “Brats”: What is it about, actually? We don’t really get the answer. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); McCarthy continues to seek a sense of justification for his feelings as he meets with “Pretty in Pink” and “St. Elmo’s Fire” producer, Lauren Shuler Donner, who rightfully tells him that “Brat Pack” was one of the best things that actually happened to his career. Because then everybody knew his name . Bingo. Not every actor gets to say that. As if finally coming to terms with what he’s projecting with the title of his film, it’s scenes that highlight McCarthy’s curiosity and humility that are far more interesting to watch yet few and far between. Like when the director sits down with Blum, who graciously appears in the film and essentially tells him that he would write the exact same article today after he’s pressed about it. It’s clear that McCarthy in this moment seeks some kind of acknowledgment of wrongdoing that he doesn’t ever really get. They have a very thoughtful conversation that may or may not have satisfied the director, but certainly crystallizes the obvious misunderstanding between journalist and subject. The recognition of privilege is something no one puts into sharper focus than Ira Madison III, a Black and queer cultural critic who is also the only non-white person in the entire documentary. Madison tells McCarthy that Black folks like him who grew up watching films with “Brat Pack” members were compelled to see themselves in their stories. And they often did so fondly. Frustratingly, McCarthy doesn’t really engage with what Madison is actually saying there. He acknowledges it as true, but it would have behooved the director, amid his own seemingly self-obsessed rant about a nearly 40-year-old moniker, to also think about the advantages he was also granted with it that eluded many others. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Demi Moore and McCarthy in a moment from \"Brats.\" ABC News Studios There are several discussions that would have deepened “Brats,” which ultimately leaves the audience with the question of, well, were they brats, actually? Was the label deserved in that way? Considering the way the documentary unfolds, an even more awkward question rises to the fore: Is McCarthy still a brat? Maybe that’s his point, but that would be a bit of a cop-out. There’s a great opportunity here to truly delve into what it feels like to have to wrestle with whether you’re a good actor or just famous, young and white? Blum’s article, to McCarthy’s overarching point, leaves that unclear. But that’s how a lot of media labels function. They don’t exist to validate the actor or their talent. (That’s what their management team should be doing). They’re there to engage with their readers and audience, to help identify this person or group of people in a fun and/or truthful way so that they’re remembered at all . Many celebs are vying for the attention of audiences. Not all of them get to be part of a “Brat Pack” or be the “Sexiest Man Alive,” or certainly not a “Nepo Baby,” a phrase that merely speaks to an undeniable truth about privilege in Hollywood yet somehow still manages to confuse . These are labels that make up some semblance of truth about who they are as celebrities. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); By the end of “Brats,” it’s hard to tell whether McCarthy actually reconciles any of that. Actor Judd Nelson, one of several actors he spends much of the film trying in vain to connect with (Ringwald is another one), finally calls him back. Will that conversation be just another trip down memory lane to satisfy nostalgia-hungry audiences or another effort for McCarthy to validate his own conflicted feelings? Or will he actually feel challenged? We never get to see how the conversation with Nelson plays out. The movie ends there, and so does any hope that anyone learns anything from this. “Brats” premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival and will drop on Hulu June 13.

    "article_content": "Senior Culture Reporter At its best, writer-director Lagueria Davis' film aims to challenge the level of responsibility placed onto Black Barbie and Mattel. Courtesy of Netflix In many ways, the release of “Black Barbie: A Documentary” was inevitable. Months after “ Barbie ” hit theaters and melted the minds of white feminists everywhere, an examination of the actually groundbreaking path of the single Black doll at the periphery of that movie seems marginally necessary. That’s partly because pop culture has been in a yearslong “representation” phase in which, for example, a film that rightfully asserts the existence of Blackness in a stereotypically white space like Barbie’s is sometimes considered essential for that alone. But is “Black Barbie” good? It occasionally feels like that should be less important than what it’s about. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); From writer-director Lagueria Davis, “Black Barbie” tells the doll’s origin story, in part through the testimonies of the Black women who helped bring her to fruition. One of those women is the filmmaker’s own aunt: Beulah Mae Mitchell, who in 1955 was one of the first and only Black employees at Mattel hired as a toy tester. This affectionate and personal spirit is an undercurrent of the documentary, in which Davis is also a character. Through voice-over narration, she tells the audience that she’s anti-doll or, perhaps more accurately, a Barbie skeptic who is initially unable to see why so many people, particularly Black women like her aunt, would still today be captivated by a toy. Most of “Black Barbie” — the whole first hour of its 90 minutes, to be exact — illuminates that through a long-gestating narrative around representation. Prior to 1980, all Barbies were white. It wasn’t until Mattel hired its first Black designer — Kitty Black Perkins, who is interviewed in the documentary — in 1978 that the reality of a Black Barbie was seriously considered. Before then, it was just something that Mitchell and a few others pitched to the otherwise white and noncommittal Mattel team. With Perkins leading the charge, Black Barbie was born. And subsequently, a generation of Black girls — at the risk of sounding trite, though that would mimic many of the sentiments repeated in “Black Barbie” — began to see themselves reflected in the dolls. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Principal fashion designer Kitty Black Perkins shows off two of her creations for Barbie dolls at the Mattel offices in 1991. Los Angeles Times via Getty Images “Crowning this doll as Barbie is telling the world that Black is beautiful, too,” actor Ashley Blaine Featherson says in the film. Former Miss Black California Isis Mckenzie Johnson gets emotional thinking about what the doll meant to her: “There was nothing that I could relate to when I watched television that I could associate with myself and find an escape from the reality that was beating me up because of the way that I looked.” Monica L. Bailey, a community coordinator and storyteller, recalls putting hair grease on her white Barbie dolls and coloring their eyes brown to connect them to her. “Having that as a standard made me and other Black girls feel inadequate,” she says. “I needed to be them.” She begins to cry during what she says next: “I just remember not feeling like I was beautiful because of my skin and my hair texture, and being around people who didn’t look like me, didn’t accept me. It was very trying.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); There are several more moments like that throughout “Black Barbie,” successfully capturing the doll’s impact on Black girls in particular. But at the same time, these feel heavy-handed and don’t really challenge the narrative or move it beyond what you might expect to see in a story like this. To add to that, there are platitudes about Black Barbie from others interviewed — like “it allowed the Black girl to be the heroine of the story,” a line from Patricia A. Turner, a professor in the African American Studies Department at the University of California, Los Angeles. Or this note about white Barbie from Shonda Rhimes, an executive producer of the film: “When you’ve gone your whole life and have never seen anything made in your own image, there is damage done.” The accomplishments of Ibtihaj Muhammad (pictured), as well as other Black women who were firsts in their own right, are likened to the story of Black Barbie in Davis' documentary. Courtesy of Netflix “Black Barbie” also includes interviews with various Black women who were firsts in their own right and now have Barbie dolls modeled after them. But it feels as though their accomplishments are being likened to the existence of a toy. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Among them are Misty Copeland, the first Black woman to become principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre; Ibtihaj Muhammad, the first woman to wear a hijab while competing for the U.S. in the Olympics; and Rhimes, the first woman to create three hit shows with more than 100 episodes each. Davis’ apparent effort to have firsts celebrating a first, while as hackneyed as some of the earlier moments in the film, gets the point across. But “Black Barbie” highlights a far more interesting statement in its last act as the film interrogates the real-world impact of Barbie on racially diverse kids today, which finally shakes the table in this otherwise conventional story. “I think Barbie is not going to do anything that you have not done,” says Antwann Michael Simpkins, a candidate of philosophy in UCLA’s Sociology Department. “And that’s on the parent end, as well as Mattel’s end. I don’t want to place onto Barbie the work that we should be doing as a society to dismantle.” Simpkins goes on to suggest that neither Barbie nor Mattel should bear the sole responsibility of affirming children’s self-worth and identity. “The ultimate in-work of authentic diversity, equity and inclusion is to disrupt the institutions, the violent structures, the violent dolls, the doll-like worlds that exist because of the long legacy of colonialism,” Simpkins adds. “Until we are doing that work, we’re just playing with ourselves.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); This is such a mic-drop moment that the documentary literally just moves on to the next scene entirely. But, thankfully, it doesn’t drift away from actual conversations in the classroom and the real world, making the last half hour of “Black Barbie” the most fulfilling part. Two Black children push a white doll in a toy baby carriage down the sidewalk in the Walnut Hills neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1921. Cincinnati Museum Center via Getty Images That’s because it does what the bulk of the film isn’t bold enough to do: explore the limitations and, oftentimes, the futility of representation, as well as some of the dialogues around it. For example, “Black Barbie” re-creates Mamie and Kenneth Clark’s “ doll test ” from the 1940s, when the two psychologists showed kids a Black doll and a white doll — identical in every way except the color of their skin — and asked them which they one preferred. The results often concluded that kids across the racial spectrum were conditioned to think the white doll was better. Beyond its eye-opening roundtable of researchers and educators, led by Amirah Saafir, a professor of child and adolescent studies, “Black Barbie” follows relationship expert Yeshiva Davis, a licensed marriage and family therapist, as she duplicates the doll test today. This time, she uses dolls spanning the racial and gender spectrum. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The conclusions are not much different than they were in the 1940s. At one point in the film, a young Black boy points to a white Barbie doll when asked which is prettiest, while several Black girls consider a few of the Black Barbies pretty and take pride in the fact that they affirm their own beauty. But when asked which of the Barbies is the real Barbie, they all point to the white doll. It’s a startling reflection of how far we haven’t come, in spite of the first hour of the film painstakingly ruminating on the opposite. Or maybe it’s more that representation is relative. Actor Gabourey Sidibe, for instance, chides the look of the original Black Barbie for being “light-skinned,” while others point out the lack of kinks in her Afro. “I preferred that color,” Perkins says plainly when asked about the Barbie’s skin tone. Left to right: Mattel pioneers Stacey McBride-Irby, Perkins and Beulah Mae Mitchell are interviewed in \"Black Barbie\" Courtesy of Netflix The birth of Black Barbie showed that change was possible in the toy world. But how much has it actually done in the real world, especially today when children, as highlighted in other scenes throughout “Black Barbie,” are more particular about the images they want to ingest? It’s not just about the existence of a product, the toy’s booming popularity or even the billions of dollars it makes. It’s about how kids feel about themselves, beyond the ability to play with a doll that might look like them. While their self-affirmation on account of the toy is uncertain, the success of the still largely white and male Mattel has essentially always been guaranteed. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); In fact, in the years after Perkins and her successor, Stacey McBride-Irby, left Mattel, a white man named Bill Greening became the designer of Black Barbie. “Black Barbie,” gratefully, doesn’t shy away from challenging why that is, including in interviews with Greening and others at Mattel that tout how far the doll has come while occasionally deflecting valid criticism. (Awkwardly, Mattel seems to have considered the issues raised in the documentary, since the film’s postscript includes a statement noting examples of progress. These include the company’s Future Leaders Innovating Play initiative, which provides internships to Black undergrads across the nation. It also explains that three participants in the program have been hired as full-time employees.) Like with last year’s “Barbie,” the question becomes whether commercialized representation is enough to satisfy underserved communities, or if we’re going to do the real-world work of demolishing societal, educational and familial conditioning that influences self-worth starting at a young age. We can talk about representation as it pertains to the art we consume or the toys that we gleefully play with all day — and we already have, exhaustively. But beyond making white corporations more money, it really does too often feel like, to borrow Simpkins’ words in “Black Barbie,” we’re just playing with ourselves. “Black Barbie: A Documentary” hits Netflix on Wednesday, June 19.

Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); It looks like Taylor Swift is swiftly becoming known as a thief to the public — and I’m gonna break it all down for you. Let’s get into why the girls are giving Ms. Swift the bombastic side-eye. Swift has been dropping new editions of her album “The Tortured Poets Department” since it was initially released on April 19. Earlier this year, fans speculated that Billie Eilish might be shading Swift after she told Billboard it’s “wasteful” when artists release multiple versions of vinyl albums. “I find it really frustrating as someone who tries to be sustainable,” Eilish said. “Then you see some of the biggest artists in the world making 40 different vinyl packages with unique features just to get you to buy more.” Whew. In the same month, Eilish announced her new album, “Hit Me Hard and Soft,” which was set for release on May 17. But guess what? Swift dropped three new editions of “The Tortured Poets Department ″ album just one day before Eilish’s new release. Social media went wild, with one fan calling Swift “greedy.” i love you taylor, but this is just greedy. couldn’t have released this last week or next week? but now that you know there’s competition for #1 this week, you gotta go and play these stunts. it’s honestly tiring because you did this with sza too. just stop and let other people… — steven ☀️ (@arianaunext) May 17, 2024 Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); love how billie said she’d wait till ariana released eternal sunshine to release her album & here’s taylor mass releasing to block billie...mind u she just released an album with 31 tracks...just greedy 💀 pic.twitter.com/RccoagMxJ1 https://t.co/XpD7Wx1oLZ — dev ²•⁰ 💋 (@sunshineatari) May 16, 2024 in regards to what taylor swift has done to olivia, sza and now billie i just don’t understand the greed. you debuted with 2M+ first week, what more could you want? the greed is just otherworldly to me. https://t.co/01Q7BrpPOH — tyler ☀️ (@ghostinbIood) May 17, 2024 Oh, but there’s more. It was projected, according to The Guardian, that Charli XCX’s album “Brat” would reach No. 1 in the U.K. during the week of June 14. But then Swift released six U.K.-only album variants around the same time, so instead she nabbed the No. 1 spot, blocking Charli XCX from the feat. Of course, fans didn’t hold their tongues about it. that's pathetic as hell — DOZEN (@XxDozenRosesxX) June 13, 2024 i’m so over this woman. blocked. removed from spotify — tuqqqd (@LadyGagasiPhone) June 14, 2024 Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); I’m disappointed that Taylor Swift seemingly would try to block Charli XCX and Billie Eilish from achieving the top spot on the charts. Given Swift’s immense status in the music world, it feels unnecessary and somewhat selfish to use these tactics to keep rising to the top. She has already accomplished so much and has a massive fan base that ensures her success. should’ve been #72 but anti feminist taylor swift blocked her 🤬🤬 https://t.co/uyep4D47TI — 𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐲 🪶 (@xThisIsAndyG) June 18, 2024 @allaboutadam24 In my opinion Taylor Swift has gone too far now to even be considered a girls girl. Chasing the charts is such a weird flex. But what do you think? #taylorswift #brat #ttpd #charlixcx #billieeilish #charts ♬ original sound - Planet Adam The way Taylor Swift preaches \"feminism\" while constantly tearing down other female artists is gross — Dakota Cook (@dakotakcook) June 18, 2024 You’d think Swift would be celebrating and embracing new talent, not trying to overshadow them. Her focus should be on enjoying her well-earned success and supporting emerging artists. By doing this, she could help foster a more inclusive and supportive music industry where everyone has a fair shot at the spotlight.

A proposed law , introduced Tuesday by Democratic state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, takes aim squarely at Glock. The Austrian company, whose polymer-framed pistols have played a dominant role in the handgun market since the 1980s, has faced growing criticism from gun safety groups for declining to modify a design that easily converts into an automatic weapon. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “Any business operating in New York State must take basic responsibility for its behavior in the marketplace,” Myrie said in a press release. “When an industry knows the harm its products are causing, but refuses to take meaningful steps to prevent it, government must step up to protect New Yorkers.” If the bill passes, gun dealers who continue to sell easily convertible pistols could face felony charges.

Boston Globe via Getty Images The bill defines “convertible pistols” as those that “can be converted into a machine-gun solely by the installation or attachment of a pistol converter.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); A separate proposed law would require firearms manufacturers to take “reasonable steps to prevent the installation and use of a pistol converter.” If that bill were to become law, companies that fail to take such action could be sued under a New York law passed in 2021 that allows people affected by gun violence to sue for damages in civil court. Glock did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But if Myrie’s bill were to become law, the company would likely challenge it, leading to a prolonged legal battle. Tom King, the president of the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, said the proposed law’s language was “very vague,” contending that aftermarket tinkerers would keep finding ways to modify firearms. “An engineer or an inventor or a designer can overcome whatever the new characteristics of the redesigned firearm would be,” King told HuffPost. “Technology moves on.” The spokesperson for the National Shooting Sports Federation, Mark Oliva, said the bill as written would apply to far more guns than Glocks. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “This bill would outlaw any firearm that they very vaguely define as ‘easily modified,’” Oliva said. “At a minimum, that’s every striker-fired pistol out there.” Glocks are not the only firearms that can be turned into a machine gun, but they are the ones that are most commonly altered in this way. Unlike many popular pistols, Glocks typically feature a removable slide plate. When a Glock pistol is fired, the recoil from the explosion within the gun forces the slide back. As it resets, a part called the trigger bar rises to catch it, which holds back the firing pin, preventing another shot. Replacing the slide plate with a small device popularly known as a “Glock switch,” however, allows the shooter to toggle into fully automatic fire. The switch works by holding down the trigger bar, which prevents it from resetting. Such devices, generically called “autosears,” have long been available for many brands and types of firearms, including semiautomatic rifles. But the ease with which Glocks can be converted into machine guns has created a thriving black market targeting the company’s pistols. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives recovered more than 31,000 such devices over the last five years . Many are shipped from foreign countries and sold on websites providing false information about their legality. They can be made cheaply on 3D printers. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Federal law classifies autosears, including Glock switches, as machine guns. Possessing one is a felony under federal law, even if the device is not attached to a firearm. Myrie’s proposed law would make possession of an autosear a state felony as well. The law aims to combat that rising public safety threat, said Nick Suplina, the senior vice president of law and police at Everytown for Gun Safety, which helped craft the measure. The devices are increasingly turning up at crime scenes nationwide — perhaps most famously in the 2022 mass shooting that left six dead and 12 injured in Sacramento. “Only one brand makes it so easy to turn a semiautomatic pistol into a machine gun and that brand is Glock,” Suplina told HuffPost. “A Glock switch costs $25 and a few minutes of time to put an automatic weapon in someone’s hands. That makes this the number one threat in the era of reemergence of machine guns.” The nonprofit Everytown For Gun Safety is also helping represent the city of Chicago in a lawsuit filed against Glock last month, which accuses the company of endangering city residents by refusing to make the guns harder to convert. Democrats control both houses of the New York legislature, and the state has a Democratic governor. New York has passed a flurry of gun control legislation — including a “red flag” law and raising the age to buy a semi-automatic rifle to 21 — after an 18-year-old white supremacist killed 10 Black people in a mass shooting in Buffalo two years ago.

Trump currently faces a total of 88 felony counts in four separate indictments — including the trial now underway in a Manhattan court for allegedly falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels just 12 days before the 2016 presidential election. Federal law bars those facing felony indictments from buying, transporting or receiving firearms or ammunition, but that law has faced legal challenges. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); But Trump has long cultivated close ties with the NRA, whose membership is largely conservative. His appearance Saturday at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center will mark the ninth time that he has addressed NRA members at a major public gathering. Former President Donald Trump emphasized his support for gun rights on Feb. 9 at the National Rifle Association's presidential forum in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Trump is considered the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Spencer Platt via Getty Images Trump spoke at the NRA’s Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in February, telling the group’s members he would roll back reforms created under President Joe Biden , including revoking licenses from gun dealers who break federal gun laws and placing new restrictions on pistol braces, which have been used in mass killings. “Your Second Amendment will always be safe with me as your president,” Trump said in Pennsylvania, according to The Associated Press. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); But Trump’s problems with the law make him an awkward spokesperson for gun rights. He mused about the possibility of buying a Glock pistol during a campaign stop in South Carolina last year, apparently unaware that federal law barred him from doing so. The NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the decision to have a keynote speaker who is prohibited from buying guns. But a statement from Andrew Arulanandam, the NRA’s interim executive vice president and CEO, cast Trump as a target of politically motivated attacks. “President Trump is under relentless attacks because he is not afraid to fight for those who share his American values,” Arulanandam wrote. “He is uniquely qualified to address our members who know what it’s like to stand for something, even when it’s hard. The NRA and our millions of members around the country have President Trump’s back, and we know he has ours.” Trump is scheduled to speak at the NRA Leadership Forum at 2 p.m. Saturday. Guns will not be permitted at the event, which is not unusual at the NRA’s annual gatherings. The long list of other banned items includes gun parts, holsters, magazines, toy guns, knives, drones, Mace and “weapons of any kind.” Related Donald Trump national rifle association gun ownership Washington State Bans Sale Of Semi-Automatic Rifles New York Is Coming For A Major Gun Company Semi-Automatic Rifle Ban Passes Washington State Legislature Supreme Court Will Take Up The Legal Fight Over Ghost Guns Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up Politics HuffPost's top politics stories, straight to your inbox.

Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) and Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) are demanding an update on the Department of Homeland Security’s efforts to quash racism and bigotry within its ranks after HuffPost reporting revealed widespread use of anti-immigrant slurs among Border Patrol agents. A series of communications disclosed to HuffPost under the Freedom of Information Act earlier this year showed Border Patrol agents, including several in supervisory roles, routinely using the derogatory slur “tonk.” The term has an uncertain origin, but Border Patrol agents who use it widely believe that it comes from the sound of bashing a migrant in the head with a heavy-duty flashlight. The records also showed Border Patrol agents joking about killing migrant children by donating faulty car seats to a charity drive or spiking Rice Krispy Treats with cyanide. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill July 17, 2023 in Washington. Drew Angerer via Getty Images HuffPost’s reporting “raises concerning questions and highlights a continuing pattern of unacceptable and derogatory rhetoric,” the members of Congress wrote in a letter sent Friday to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller. “I’m an immigrant myself and from an immigrant family, so obviously I was just really heartbroken and angered that this kind of language is being used,” Garcia said in an interview with HuffPost. “Obviously migrant children and families are not a joke. They’re suffering. They’re oftentimes running away from extreme and tragic conditions. So it’s really important that there’s oversight.” The letter requests a detailed accounting of Homeland Security’s disciplinary actions since November of last year. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); It asks how many employees of Customs and Border Protection, Border Patrol’s parent agency, have appeared before the Discipline Review Board since then and how many were disciplined. The letter also asks DHS to disclose how many public complaints to its Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties’ Compliance Branch resulted in investigations and disciplinary action. And the congressmen’s letter also asks Mayorkas and Miller to disclose whether the department had taken steps to investigate or discipline CBP employees whose “derogatory rhetoric and potential misconduct” were highlighted in HuffPost’s reporting. “Folks that are demeaning or slandering migrants, the people they’re sworn to protect and serve, should not be in that line of business,” Garcia said. “What I think is most important is that we have a thorough review of the disciplinary process for the CBP agents and that it’s extensive and we get answers for what happened.” Garcia and Goldman, both of whom sit on the Homeland Security Committee, have been pressing DHS to be more transparent about how it maintains internal discipline. They joined a group of 65 members of Congress last year calling for Mayorkas to explain how it planned to address the infiltration of domestic terrorists within the agency, after a report from the Project on Government Oversight revealed that more than 300 current and former DHS employees had belonged to the Oath Keepers, an anti-government extremist group. The group’s founder, Elmer Stewart Rhodes III, was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the Jan. 6 attacks on the Capitol and sentenced last year to a prison term of 18 years.

Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., is seen outside the U.S. Capitol after last votes of the week on Thursday, December 7, 2023. Tom Williams via Getty Images A working group fielded by Mayorkas acknowledged “significant gaps” in its ability to detect extremist activity, including the lack of an official definition for “domestic violent extremist,” or specialized training to recognize behaviors that might indicate violent extremism. Garcia said he felt confident that law enforcement officers at Homeland Security were generally well-qualified people who want to serve others and keep the country safe. “But we also have folks that are doing these horrific actions along the border that are saying and doing horrific things — and they need to be held accountable,” Garcia said. “This is just another instance where Homeland Security Democrats, and especially those of us who are progressives, can push and really have an impact,” Garcia said. “When you have an agency like CBP that’s so large, you have to keep pushing to get answers.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Related Border Patrol Dan Goldman robert garcia 'House Of The Dragon' Star Spills On 'Animalistic' Sex Scene Ex-Trump Attorney Jenna Ellis Pleads Not Guilty To Arizona Election Conspiracy Anthony Scaramucci Scorches CEOs With 1 Blistering Description Over Trump Meeting Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up Politics HuffPost's top politics stories, straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "National Reporter, HuffPost Illustration: Benjamin Currie/HuffPost In a video clip uploaded three months ago, one of YouTube’s most prominent gun reviewers took aim at a steel target with a Glock 17 pistol equipped with a device called an autosear. “All right, full auto!” he said as about half the spray of bullets ricocheted off the coffin-shaped target while the rest flew into the dirt behind it. He burst through the entire magazine in less than a second. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “I can’t believe how many rounds I burned through already,” Hickok45 said after ringing more steel, then exploding a terra cotta pot, popping several soda bottles and knocking over a bowling pin. “It’s fun. And we wanted to bring the fun to you.” The video has attracted 681,000 views. Congress first tightened regulation of machine guns back in 1934, in response to Prohibition-era gang violence. Modern machine guns and conversion devices have been banned from civilian use since 1986. Unlawful possession of an autosear can land an offender in prison for up to a decade, whether or not the device is attached to a pistol. But machine guns are making a fast comeback. Tinkerers are constantly devising new ways to shoot semiautomatics faster. The 3D printer has made it possible to turn a common pistol into a machine gun for less than $100. And the spread of information in the digital age has made it easier for enthusiasts like Greg Kinman of Tennessee, who posts on social media as Hickok45, to jump through the hoops necessary to buy or build fully automatic weapons legally. That rapidly growing market has created new challenges for law enforcement. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is waging a public education campaign to help dispel the notion that machine gun conversion devices like the ones portrayed in Hickok45′s video are legal. Some Democratic-led jurisdictions are taking legal action against Glock in an attempt to make its guns harder to modify. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); But lawmakers and regulators face a complex problem that piecemeal efforts are unlikely to solve. The result is that faster-shooting guns — both legal and illegal — are likely to become an increasingly common fact of modern American life. Civilian-Legal Machine Guns Machine guns have played a niche role in the civilian firearms market for about as long as they’ve existed. Congress sharply restricted civilian access with the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) but didn’t ban machine guns entirely. Instead, it required civilians to register fully automatic weapons and pay a $200 tax each time one changes hands. The transfer cost — roughly equivalent to $4,732 today , after nearly a century of inflation — made machine gun ownership prohibitively expensive for most Americans. Congress did not criminalize civilian machine gun possession until it passed the Firearm Protection Act of 1986. That law, however, allowed machine guns produced on or before that year. About one-third of the states prohibit machine guns, regardless of when they were made. Americans who want to buy a legal machine gun today need to track down a legally registered one, apply for a transfer and pay the tax — which is still $200. The tight supply of pre-1986 machine guns means that most of them easily fetch five-figure prices. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); As of 2021, Americans had registered about 741,000 machine guns in the United States under this process, according to ATF data, up from 457,000 in 2011. It’s hard to tell what that 62% jump in federally registered automatic weapons really means because the ATF does not publish how many of those weapons are in civilian hands. Private sellers who make or sell modern automatic firearms directly to law enforcement agencies also have to register them under the NFA, which lumps them into the same statistical category as civilian-owned, pre-1986 machine guns. A Tinkering Renaissance The biggest growth in legal access to faster rates of fire has come from tinkerers who have spent the last two decades devising ways to make semiautomatic guns fire faster. Manufacturers submit new designs for products that will make guns fire faster to the ATF to assess their legality before taking them to market. The federal definition of a machine gun is one that fires multiple shots by a “single function of the trigger.” That wording gives creative minds a lot of leeway. The Akins Accelerator, patented in 2000, pioneered the technique of harnessing a semiautomatic rifle’s recoil to make it shoot faster. The spring-operated sliding stock allowed the gun to move back and forth in the shooter’s hands. By pushing forward with the non-shooting hand and keeping pressure against the trigger, the shooter could fire bullets at a rate of about 800 per minute. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The ATF approved it in 2002. Then, in 2005, the agency changed its mind, issuing a new rule that classified the Akins Accelerator as a machine gun. By then, however, a separate device based on the Akins Accelerator, the “bump stock,” had hit the market. The only significant difference between the two items was that the bump stock lacked the spring found inside the Akins Accelerator. Still, the ATF classified bump stocks as firearm parts instead of machine guns, allowing their sale to civilians for more than a decade. An employee of North Raleigh Guns in Raleigh, North Carolina, demonstrates how a bump stock works in 2013. via Associated Press That changed with the 2017 mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival on the Las Vegas Strip, when a gunman on the 32nd floor of a hotel sprayed more than 1,000 rounds into the crowd below from semiautomatic rifles equipped with extended magazines and bump stocks. The shooting left 60 dead and more than 850 injured, making it the deadliest mass shooting carried out by a lone gunman in American history. The massacre fostered wide bipartisan consensus in favor of banning bump stocks. But Congress did not move forward with a bill. Instead, then-President Donald Trump directed the ATF to reclassify bump stocks as machine guns. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); That strategy frustrated the gun industry and reformers alike. The National Shooting Sports Federation (NSSF), the trade group for the firearms industry, faulted the ATF for reversing its decision instead of deferring to Congress. “People build businesses around ATF’s determination letters, but when it became politically expedient, the ATF pulls the rug out and moves the goal posts,” said Larry Keane, NSSF’s senior vice president and general counsel. “The ATF is making law and exceeding the statute that Congress wrote.” Eric Rubin, a legal fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, also questioned the legal logic of shoehorning bump stocks into a definition for “machine guns” written in the 1930s instead of more straightforward congressional action. “There’s a story of political dysfunction when it comes to bump stocks that has gotten overlooked. How is it that a device that resulted in the worst mass shooting in American history — and that says a lot — and has no utility for self-defense or hunting can’t be banned through a law?” Rubin said. “Legislators should respond in an ideal world, when that’s consistent with the will of the electorate. We can’t stop technology from advancing.” Austin, Texas, gun store owner and firearms instructor Michael Cargill sued the ATF the day the bump stock ban went into effect, arguing that only Congress had the power to change the rule and that a bump stock did not meet the definition of automatic fire because the shooter still physically taps the trigger every time a shot is fired. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The U.S. Supreme Court appeared sympathetic to Cargill’s arguments when it heard the case in February, repeatedly questioning Deputy Solicitor General Brian Fletcher about why Congress hadn’t specifically banned the devices and raising concerns that people who had bought the devices legally would be exposed to felony prosecution because of the ATF’s flip-flopping. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case next month. Regardless of how they rule, people still have easy access to semiautomatics that shoot with similar speed. The binary trigger, for example, allows the shooter to fire a round when pulling the trigger and another when releasing, effectively doubling the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons. The ATF does not classify the binary trigger as a machine gun because it counts the pull and release of the trigger as two separate functions of the trigger instead of a single function. And those willing to take the time to learn can bump-fire pretty much any semiautomatic weapon using only their hands and a rubber band or belt loop. Federally Licensed YouTubers Enthusiasts who want truly unfettered access to modern machine guns are taking advantage of the most glaring loophole by becoming federally licensed firearms dealers. Individuals can obtain a Federal Firearms License, or FFL, and sell guns out of their homes. An FFL holder can then apply for a Special Occupational Tax, or SOT, that allows the holder to possess and transfer modern machine guns legally. A separate SOT allows the holder to build machine guns, including at home. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Kinman did not respond to a request for comment for this story, but the Hickok45 poster says in one of his videos that he holds an FFL/SOT combination that allows him to possess automatic weapons legally. Those who deal in machine guns are free to shoot them, noted Cargill. Cargill holds an FFL/SOT combination that allows him to manufacture automatic weapons. “I can build my own machine gun — a modern-day machine gun,” Cargill said. “I can take it to the range and shoot it every day, as long as that machine gun comes back to the store every night. It has to go to sleep in the gun store.” A longstanding ATF ruling holds that making legally obtained machine guns available for others to shoot at an onsite shooting range owned by the FFL holder is “not considered to be a sale, disposition, or delivery of the firearms,” an ATF official wrote in an email to HuffPost. “The on-premises rental of NFA firearms owned by an FFL is therefore permitted.” The ATF requires machine gun sellers to have a business intent when applying for their license — it’s not supposed to act as a backdoor to owning machine guns. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “It has to be for a legal purpose,” an ATF official told HuffPost. “It cannot just be, ‘I got my FFL and SOT — I’m going to go and make all the machine guns I want.’ You cannot do that.” Several companies online offer to help the average citizen get their hands on a machine gun, often emphasizing the novelty of being able to access post-1986 machine guns. YouTube is chock-full of machine gun demonstrations by people claiming to possess legal authority to shoot automatic weapons. “This is a machine gun,” a YouTuber who posts as “PSR” says in one video. “This is a Glock switch. It is not mine. I am not in possession of it. I am on the range and my friend, who has an FFL07, SOT Class 2, is the owner of this machine gun.” “While there are plenty of people running around with these illegally, of course, this is one that is legal, and my friend behind the camera is supervising me as I test fire this machine gun,” the YouTuber added. “With that said. Fuck the NFA. Fuck the machine gun ban.” A Thriving Black Market The same tinkering that birthed bumps stocks has turbocharged the black market for automatic weapons. It doesn’t take much technical expertise to convert many semiautomatic firearms into automatic ones. Attaching an autosear, like the one in Hickok45′s video, onto the firearm will do the job. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The autosear has existed for a long time. But over the last few years, autosears fitted for Glock pistols have proliferated to such a degree that many people have come to call them “Glock switches.” The overwhelming majority of them are made illegally with 3D printers or sold on shady websites and imported from China and Russia. They often come equipped with trademark-infringing branding that gives the false impression that they’re made by Glock itself. The ATF has confiscated some 31,000 of them over the last five years . Glocks equipped with switches are increasingly showing up at crime scenes — most notably a mass shooting in Sacramento that left six dead and a dozen more wounded in 2022. The Boston bureau of the ATF shows a machine gun conversion device for a Glock handgun. The device, which can be made with a 3D printer, can convert the Glock into a machine gun after the \"switch\" is installed. John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images Reformers have taken aim at Glock itself, accusing the gun maker of failing to act while criminals take advantage of a flaw in its pistols’ design. Unlike many other popular pistols, Glocks typically feature a removable slide plate. Once removed, turning the pistol into an automatic weapon is a simple job — a small protrusion from the autosear blocks a part of the gun called the trigger bar from rising and halting the firing pin from firing another round. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The city of Chicago sued Glock last month under a new Illinois law that exposes firearm manufacturers to civil claims from people harmed by gun violence. The lawsuit asks the courts to force Glock to modify its pistol designs to make them harder to convert into machine guns. The city of Honolulu voted last month to file a similar lawsuit , though it has yet to do so. And this month, New York state Sen. Zellnor Myrie filed a bill that would ban the sale of “easily modified pistols.” Though the text names no brand, Myrie’s proposition was directed squarely at Glock. Glock did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment about the legal actions filed against it. But the National Shooting Sports Federation, the firearm industry trade group, views the attacks on Glock as misguided and questions the legal logic of the proposed New York bill. The proposal, which lacks a technical definition of “easily modifiable pistol,” would criminalize pretty much all striker-fired pistols, according to Keane. “Changing the design of a gun is not an easy thing to do,” Keane said. “[Glock] is doing what it can, but changing the design and making a less-reliable design is not advisable. … Reliability is safety.” Even if reformers compelled Glock to modify its design tomorrow, there would still be millions of the current generations lingering on the market indefinitely. Those willing to break the law would have a wide array of options for turning semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. Other pistol-makers struggle with the same problem of black market modifications as Glock. And firearms are simple machines. A savvy enthusiast can turn an an AR-15 into a machine gun with a coat hanger . Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “It’s not difficult to do any of this stuff,” said Cargill, the gun store owner. “It’s a matter of do you want to become a felon or not. Most people want to do things the right way.” Related Guns bump stock ATF National Firearms Act machine guns Supreme Court Will Take Up The Legal Fight Over Ghost Guns Chicago Sues Glock Over Pistols That 'Can Easily Be Turned into Machine Guns' Iowa Police Chief Convicted Of Lying To Feds To Acquire Machine Guns Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up Politics HuffPost's top politics stories, straight to your inbox.

Trump has long enjoyed strong support from the largely conservative gun rights movement, repeatedly addressing gatherings of the National Rifle Association and recently vowing to roll back firearm restrictions that the Biden administration had pushed through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Former President Donald Trump speaks during the NRA ILA Leadership Forum at the National Rifle Association Annual Meeting & Exhibits at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center on May 18 in Dallas. Justin Sullivan via Getty Images Those facing federal indictments, as Trump has since last year, cannot legally buy firearms . But Trump was allowed to retain the guns he previously owned while the cases moved forward without running afoul of the law, provided he did not transport them across state lines. With his 34 felony convictions, however, Trump is now officially a prohibited person. The Gun Control Act of 1968 bars those convicted of crimes punishable by up to one year in prison from buying or possessing firearms or ammunition. Trump’s convictions are each punishable by sentences up to four years in prison , though he has yet to be sentenced. Trump may avoid imprisonment and be sentenced to probation. In either case, he would remain barred from firearm possession. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Trump rarely discusses his personal use of firearms. But in a 2012 interview, he told The Washington Times that he held a concealed carry license in New York and owned two handguns — a .45-caliber H&K and a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson. Trump told French Magazine Valeurs Actuelles four years later, “I always carry a weapon on me.” Under New York law, a felony conviction revokes a concealed carry license and the court must order the convict to give up their guns. Because the convictions were issued by a New York state court, a presidential pardon cannot expunge them. Still, Trump may not have lost his gun rights forever. They could be restored if an appeals court were to overturn his convictions. And ongoing litigation since the conservative-tilted Supreme Court vastly expanded Second Amendment rights two years ago has raised constitutional challenges to the law barring felons from possessing firearms.

The slaughter ends a three-year standoff with game rancher Robert Williams, 85. His tenacious legal challenges had raised the prospect that the deer breeders who supply the state’s high-fenced game ranches with big-antlered bucks might impede a strict euthanasia policy aimed at shielding wild deer from new CWD infections. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); A herd of captive deer stands beneath the shade of a tree at RW Trophy Ranch on July 27, 2023. Roque Planas/HuffPost Like mad cow disease in cattle or scrapie in sheep, CWD causes brain proteins known as prions to misfold, leading to a prolonged death by neurodegeneration. Biologists widely view the spreading disease as the single greatest threat facing North America’s herds of wild cervids, a family that includes deer, elk, moose and caribou. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends against eating CWD-contaminated meat due to concerns that the disease could jump to humans, like mad cow did. Texas wildlife officials generally kill all captive deer at sites where any deer tests positive for CWD, then require extensive sterilization procedures that include removing a layer of topsoil from deer pens and burying it six feet deep. CWD-contaminated sites cannot host captive deer for at least five years. Williams, a CWD skeptic who eats infected venison without concern, waged a three-year legal battle to keep the state from killing the deer on his ranch southeast of Dallas, enlisting the support of Republican Texas state legislator Bob Hall and right-wing rocker Ted Nugent. Williams encouraged other breeders to follow suit. He implored Texas officials to let him release his bucks for wounded veterans to hunt for free. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); The state’s ability to enter privately owned breeding pens to euthanize diseased deer is well established in Texas law, which regards the deer as wildlife and, therefore, public property. But a Kaufman County judge repeatedly granted restraining orders to avoid the slaughter, and ordered a trial to determine whether Williams had a property interest that could impede depopulation. After months of legal wrangling, the Texas Supreme Court ruled last month that the depopulation could proceed, though the dispute with the Kaufman County court did not resolve until May 24. “This is a task we never take lightly and that is always a last resort, but that has proven the most prudent and standard practice for managing prion diseases in wildlife,” the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department wrote in a statement. The legal battle ultimately proved financially disastrous for Williams, who absorbed the cost of feeding approximately 500 captive deer that he could neither sell nor turn loose for paying hunters. The land’s value, which was tied to its attractiveness for deer hunting, has tumbled. “I won some battles, but I lost the war,” Williams said. “They just ruined me.” Robert Williams admires mounts made of sheds from captive deer he bred at RW Trophy ranch on July 27, 2023. Roque Planas/HuffPost Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); He and his daughter, Maree Lou, put down three deer themselves — including a tame doe that they viewed as a pet and allowed to enter the house — to avoid having wildlife officials shoot them. Texas wildlife officials prohibited the Williams family from entering the breeder pens as the deer were euthanized on Tuesday, according to Williams. But he said they could hear the muffled sound of what he believed were subsonic pistol rounds firing repeatedly. Texas wildlife officials dispatched most of the deer using suppressed centerfire rifles, according to an agency spokesperson. In three cases, they used pistols to dispatch individual deer. “When I walked by and looked at those empty pens where those bucks used to be, I just cried,” Williams said. “I couldn’t help it.” Wildlife conservationists, however, applauded the euthanization of Williams’ herd, viewing it as a necessary measure to protect native wildlife. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Euthanizing those deer is very good for wild deer,” said Kip Adams, communications director for the National Deer Association. “We know CWD was on this place ... The longer those deer are allowed to live, the more they have the opportunity to affect other deer.” The state of Texas has struggled for the last three years to contain a CWD outbreak in deer-breeding facilities. Deer typically spread the disease to one another through body fluids like saliva. Williams’ ranch is one of the first in a series of unexplained cases to crop up in breeder pens since the spring of 2021. Williams’ RW Trophy Ranch was located in a CWD-free county and had not sent or received any new deer for several years before the outbreak. Captive deer represent a small but lucrative corner of the Texas hunting industry. Federal law generally classifies wildlife as a public resource administered by the states. Texas is one of about a dozen states that allow private citizens to breed deer, while classifying the animals as wildlife rather than livestock. Breeders like Williams use selective breeding and high-protein feed to raise bucks with antlers far larger than those that deer typically grow in the wild. Breeders then sell those bucks to high-fenced game ranches that charge prices into the tens of thousands of dollars to shoot one. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The small size of breeder pens unnaturally concentrates deer, which can facilitate the spread of CWD once the disease appears. Over the time that Williams avoided depopulation, some 254 of the deer he bred tested positive for the disease, with a prevalence rate of 72%, according to Texas Parks and Wildlife. The ranch’s pens held 637 deer at the time the first case of CWD was discovered in March 2021. The herd dwindled by more than half in the three years that followed — a rate of 2% per week, according to state officials. The state is still waiting for test results showing how many of the 249 deer euthanized at RW Trophy Ranch this week had been infected with CWD, but wildlife officials expected many to test positive. “During a May 14, 2024 inspection of the deer at the ranch, TPWD staff observed a number of deer displaying general signs of clinical CWD, including droopy ears and disorientation,” Texas Parks and Wildlife wrote in a statement. “One deer was visibly shaking and had tremors.” Another 12 deer tested positive at release sites on or associated with RW Trophy Ranch, including at least one wild doe. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Mortality surveillance results at RW Trophy Ranch show the devastating effect of an uncontrolled CWD outbreak in a breeding facility,” TPWD’s statement said.

The lawsuit adds a new dimension to a longstanding fight over the environmental impacts of aggressively harvesting menhaden from U.S. coastal waters. Conservationists have campaigned for years to limit menhaden fishing in the Chesapeake Bay, arguing that overharvesting the small, fatty fish too close to shore imperils marine wildlife that depends on them , including predatory fish, ospreys, bald eagles, dolphins and whales. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Many conservationists are especially concerned that dwindling menhaden stocks may be playing a role in the decline of striped bass, a species that follows menhaden migrations along the Atlantic Coast and spawns in the Chesapeake Bay. Recreational fishing for striped bass contributes roughly $8 billion annually to the U.S. gross domestic economy, according to a 2019 study by the McGraw Center for Conservation Leadership . The complaint against Cooke Inc. and its subsidiaries and partners, filed in the Southern District of New York by two individuals on behalf of the federal government, was unsealed in April, but received little attention beyond the trade press. It asks a federal judge to levy fines that could total more than $2 billion. Virginia is the only state on the Atlantic Coast that still allows commercial ships to net menhaden in state waters in order to process them into oil and feed — a once-common practice in the region, known as “reduction fishing.” Canada’s Cooke Inc. bought Omega Protein, the American company that has long dominated that market, in 2017. Omega Protein also fishes for menhaden in the Gulf Coast. Barrel of menhaden bait fish on the Potomac River near Fort Washington, Maryland. Edwin Remsberg/VW PICS/UIG via Getty Image Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Federal law bars foreign ships from commercial fishing in U.S. waters. But the lawsuit accuses the two companies of conspiring to create the illusion that its ships operate as independent, American-owned vessels by transferring Omega Protein’s fleet to a shell company controlled by Cooke employees and family members who hold U.S. citizenship. “It’s pure fraud,” the plaintiffs lawyer, Brendon DeMay, told HuffPost. “It’s totally illegal. They didn’t think anyone would find out, but we found out.” Cooke Seafood insisted its arrangement with Omega Protein and the fishing vessels the company contracts are all legal, though the company declined to discuss the lawsuit. “Cooke has no comment except to state that it denies any and all allegations of wrongdoing in the recently filed lawsuit,” spokesperson Joel Richardson wrote in an email to HuffPost. A Troubled History Reduction fishing for menhaden was once common across the Atlantic coast. But as states pushed the practice away from shore, the industry declined and consolidated. Omega Protein emerged as the last major company dedicated to the fishery on the Atlantic coast by the early 2000s. It has one other major competitor in the Gulf Coast, called Daybrook Fisheries, which is also foreign-owned. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); At its height, Omega Protein operated as a publicly traded company in the United States, using the fish to produce omega-3 oil supplements and livestock feed. But the company repeatedly ran afoul of federal law. Omega Protein pleaded guilty to Clean Water Act violations in 2013 for intentionally discharging fish waste mixed with chemicals within 3 miles of the Chesapeake Bay shoreline. The company paid $7.5 million in damages and spent three years on probation. Three years later, a federal judge in Louisiana found Omega Protein guilty of breaking the Clean Water Act again — an offense that violated the terms of its probation.

ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images When a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the company became public in 2017, Omega Protein’s stock tumbled. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Cooke Inc. bought the company that year, using it as an opportunity to fuel its growing farmed salmon operation by acquiring one of its main suppliers of menhaden feed. Menhaden fishing has grown increasingly contentious in recent years. Omega Protein openly defied the harvest cap set by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission in 2019, citing “poor ocean conditions and an abundance of menhaden just inside the Bay.” Thousands of pounds of fish washed up on Virginia’s Eastern Shore after widely publicized spills from fishing boats tied to the company. Conservationists presented Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin with a petition bearing 11,000 signatures two years ago asking for a moratorium on menhaden fishing, without success. An Unusual Lawsuit Executives for both Cooke Inc. and Omega Protein knew that the American Fisheries Act’s citizenship requirement — which forbids any vessel owned or controlled by foreign citizens from commercial fishing — would bar Omega’s fleet from fishing U.S. waters, the lawsuit says. Cooke Inc. allegedly created a holding company to skirt the requirement, installing as directors its employees Seth and Gregory Dunlop — who both hold U.S. citizenship and are directly related to Cooke CEO Glenn Cooke. Omega Protein sold its fishing vessels and the planes it uses to spot menhaden schools from the sky to the holding company. Omega Protein then contracted itself as the sole buyer of the fleet’s harvest, the complaint says. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Neither director of the company that owns the fishing fleet ― which is now called Ocean Harvesters, and is a subsidiary of Ocean Fleet Services ― can sell his interest in the company without the consent of the other, unless he sells to a direct relative of the Cooke CEO, the lawsuit says. Cooke Inc., Omega Protein, and Ocean Fleet Services all share the same address in Suffolk. “The sole purpose of this circuitous approach was to facilitate false certifications of compliance with the AFA Citizenship Requirement and to facilitate a scheme to fraudulently induce the Government into allowing Defendants to take fish from U.S. waters,” the lawsuit says. That new structure was designed to trick federal regulators into thinking that those operating the fishing fleet and spotter planes worked as independent contractors who would demand a fair price for the fish they netted, according to the lawsuit. Instead, Cooke Inc.’s acquisition of Omega Protein allowed the Canadian company to lower costs for its salmon feed. Despite its well-known ties to the Canadian seafood giant, each of the ships under Ocean Fleet Services’ control certified each year to two federal agencies — the U.S. Coast Guard and the Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration — that they were not controlled by a foreign owner, according to the complaint. “The law is very clear,” DeMay said. “You absolutely cannot have a scenario where the guy who owns everything on paper is a U.S. citizen, but he’s taking orders from a foreign company.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Ben Landry, Ocean Fleet Services’ vice president of public affairs, declined to address the allegations in detail, but said his company’s arrangement with Omega Protein and Cooke Inc. did not violate federal law. “As this case proceeds, we look forward to establishing that accusations of failure to disclose appropriate information are inaccurate,” Landry wrote in an emailed statement. “Ocean Harvesters is committed to compliance with all applicable laws and to continuing to conduct responsible, sustainable fishing operations along the Atlantic coast and in the Gulf of Mexico.” Violating the citizenship requirement for commercial fishing in U.S. waters is punishable by up to $16,687 in fines per vessel, per day on the water. Falsifying or withholding information affecting the citizenship requirement for commercial fishing ships is punishable by fines up to $100,000 per day. The complaint estimates the total fines easily reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars and could top $2 billion. While the company hid its foreign ties from federal authorities, it advertised them to potential investors in order to assure them that the acquisition would drive profits, according to the complaint. “As a result of their fraudulent scheme, Defendants have illegally harvested from United States waters many millions of dollars’ worth of fish to which they are not entitled,” the lawsuit says. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The case was originally filed in 2021 under the False Claims Act on behalf of two private investigators, Benson Chiles and Chris Manthey, who had been scrutinizing Omega Protein’s operations in the years leading up to the Cooke purchase. The False Claims Act, which was passed in 1863 to crack down on defense contracting fraud during the Civil War , allows private citizens to file lawsuits to recover on the federal government’s behalf to recover damages from fraud. The Justice Department has already reviewed the lawsuit and declined to join it. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said the DOJ was allowing the lawsuit to proceed. However, the department has declined to join the suit.

In a 6-3 decision penned by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court found that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had exceeded its authority by reclassifying the devices as “machine guns” in response to an unprecedentedly violent mass shooting. The ruling will reopen America’s market for bump stocks after a six-year ban. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Plaintiff Michael Cargill, an Austin, Texas, gun store owner, did not claim that the Second Amendment protected his right to own a bump stock. The case focused narrowly on the administrative process by which the ATF banned bump stocks, which harness a firearm’s recoil to achieve rates of firing that approach those of automatic weapons. The ATF issued a rule in 2018 reclassifying bump stocks as machine guns, making them illegal for civilians to own under federal law. The bureau passed the rule in response to the massacre at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, 2017, when a single shooter fired more than 1,000 rounds into a concert crowd, killing 60 people and injuring 850 more. But the Supreme Court found that bump stocks did not meet the statutory definition of a “machine gun,” which requires that a gun fire automatically “by a single function of the trigger.” An employee of a gun store in Raleigh, North Carolina, demonstrates how a bump stock works on Feb. 1, 2013. The gun accessory makes semiautomatic weapons fire faster. Allen Breed/Associated Press Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “A bump stock does not convert a semiautomatic rifle into a machinegun any more than a shooter with a lightning-fast trigger finger does,” Justice Thomas wrote in an opinion speckled with illustrations documenting the workings of an AR-15 trigger. The ATF had held in at least 10 separate instances before the Las Vegas shooting that affixing a bump stock to a semiautomatic weapon did not turn it into a machine gun, the opinion noted. Thomas also described the ATF’s position on bump stocks as “logically inconsistent,” since a shooter can bump fire a semiautomatic weapon using their hands alone, but the agency does not classify bump-fired semiautomatic firearms as machine guns. The court’s three liberal justices — Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Katanji Brown Jackson — dissented, viewing bump stocks as similar enough to machine guns to warrant ATF’s 2018 reclassification. “This is not a hard case,” Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion. “All of the textual evidence points to the same interpretation. A bump-stock-equipped semiautomatic rifle is a machinegun because (1) with a single pull of the trigger, a shooter can (2) fire continuous shots without any human input beyond maintaining forward pressure.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The ruling in Garland v. Cargill deals a heavy blow to gun reformers, who viewed a ban on bump stocks as a commonsense response to the deadliness such devices can wield in mass shootings. “The majority of justices today sided with the gun lobby instead of the safety of the American people. This is a shameful decision,” Esther Sanchez-Gomez, litigation director of Giffords Law Center, wrote in an emailed statement. “Congress must act to undo the damage and make clear that bump stocks, and all automatic conversion devices, are illegal under federal law.” But Friday’s ruling also highlighted the fragility of an agency-enacted ban that reformers had in many cases feared would not withstand judicial scrutiny . After the Las Vegas shooting, a broad consensus formed that bump stocks, a small segment of the overall firearms industry, should be banned. Congress, however, did not move swiftly to ban bump stocks in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting. Instead, then-President Donald Trump directed the ATF to restrict the devices. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The new Supreme Court ruling clarifies that Congress would have to impose the bump stock ban in order to remove the devices from the market. “There is a simple remedy for the disparate treatment of bump stocks and machineguns,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in a concurring opinion. “Congress can amend the law — and perhaps would have done so already if ATF had stuck with its earlier interpretation. Now that the situation is clear, Congress can act.” Shortly after the ruling, Biden urged Congress to enact a ban, saying that “Americans should not have to live in fear of this mass devastation.” “We know thoughts and prayers are not enough,” Biden’s statement said. “I call on Congress to ban bump stocks, pass an assault weapon ban, and take additional action to save lives — send me a bill and I will sign it immediately.” But it remains to be seen whether such a measure can overcome the GOP’s historic opposition to gun reform in Congress, especially now that the sense of urgency following the Las Vegas shooting has dissipated. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Reporters asked Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), one of Trump’s biggest boosters in the House, if there would be any appetite for reviving Trump’s bump stock ban. “No, I don’t think so,” Donalds said. “I think it’s probably going to be left where it is.” Arthur Delaney contributed reporting.

In an 8-1 decision, the Supreme Court affirmed that the federal government can temporarily restrict a person’s right to possess firearms without violating the Second Amendment. Only Justice Clarence Thomas dissented. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “Our tradition of firearm regulation allows the Government to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to the physical safety of others,” Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority’s ruling. The case of United States v. Rahimi emerged as a high-profile test of how far the Supreme Court was willing to go in expanding gun rights after its sweeping reinterpretation of the Second Amendment two years ago directed courts to stop considering public safety when assessing the constitutionality of firearm restrictions. Under the Supreme Court’s new doctrine, gun restrictions are only constitutional when they fit within a centuries-old historical tradition of firearm regulation. Public defenders representing Rahimi had argued that the United States did not develop a legal tradition of disarming people for domestic abuse until the 20th century. Activists rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court before the start of oral arguments in United States v. Rahimi, a Second Amendment case, on Nov. 7, 2023. Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); But the ruling found that the law barring domestic abusers from possessing guns fit within a long tradition of keeping guns away from dangerous people. State constitutions at the time of the nation’s founding allowed governments to restrict firearm possession from people who posed a threat of violence to others under criminal laws, the ruling noted. The ruling also pointed to surety laws, which required someone with a history of violence to post a bond that could be revoked if they committed new crimes. Some states used surety laws as a way to disarm people with a history of violence. Restrictions against brandishing weapons publicly to terrorize people have also long been part of American law, the ruling says. “Taken together, the surety and going armed laws confirm what common sense suggests: When an individual poses a clear threat of physical violence to another, the threatening individual may be disarmed,” Roberts wrote. Thomas took the lonely position that only an exact match for the 1994 federal law barring those subject to protective orders would survive the court’s new Second Amendment standard. “Not a single historical regulation justifies the statute at issue,” Thomas wrote. The ruling comes as a relief to gun reformers, who had viewed the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in the Rahimi case as a disturbing precedent that privileged the gun rights of abusers over the safety of their victims. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “This is a win for women, children and anyone who has expressed domestic abuse,” former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who now runs a group to combat gun violence, wrote in a statement. “We know that firearms make domestic abuse situations significantly more deadly, and firearms’ effects on women’s safety is a crisis. This ruling is a small step in the fight to stop violence against women.” A court in Tarrant County, Texas, placed Zackey Rahimi under a protective order on Feb. 5, 2020, after he assaulted his former girlfriend. Prosecutors accused him of shooting guns in public in at least six separate instances while subject to the protective order — including once at a woman he allegedly lured into a parking lot , two instances of alleged road rage and one instance in which he allegedly fired a rifle into someone’s home. When police investigating those shootings searched Rahimi’s room on Jan. 14, 2021, they discovered a semiautomatic rifle under the bed and a pistol with an extended magazine on the nightstand, along with a copy of the protective order. A 1994 federal law makes it a felony to possess firearms while subject to a protective order in a domestic violence case. Rahimi, facing an open-and-shut case, pleaded guilty. But in 2022, Justice Clarence Thomas laid out a new constitutional standard for assessing gun restrictions when the Supreme Court ruled on the case of New York State Rifle and Pistol Assn. v. Bruen. The new standard directed courts to judge the constitutionality of gun laws by narrowly focusing on whether a given restriction fit within a history of regulation dating back to some time between the signing of the Bill of Rights in 1789 and the end of the Civil War in 1865. The ruling set off dozens of Second Amendment challenges to long-standing gun laws, many of which are still playing out. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); But the Supreme Court’s lopsided ruling Friday made gun laws appear far less vulnerable than they have since the post-Bruen legal onslaught. Roberts warned that “some courts have misunderstood the methodology of our recent Second Amendment cases,” referring to a string of decisions dating back to 2008, when the high court established that the right to bear arms extended to individuals rather than just the militias that the Bill of Rights references in its text. Rahimi’s was among the most highly publicized decisions after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the Second Amendment protected his right to bear arms despite allegedly using them to commit several other crimes. The decision set off a firestorm of criticism from gun law reformers and advocates for victims of domestic violence, who feared that overturning the 1994 law would empower abusers. Gun rights groups, which normally challenge firearm restrictions they oppose in civil court, had only reluctantly taken a stand on the Rahimi case, featuring a criminal defendant accused of multiple violent crimes. The National Rifle Association argued in an amicus brief last year that courts should strip Rahimi of his gun rights based on criminal convictions alone, rather than a protective order related to domestic violence. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); While that argument failed, Randy Kozuch, the executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, played down the impact of the Supreme Court’s ruling Friday. “The Supreme Court’s narrow opinion offers no endorsement of red flag laws or of the dozens of other unconstitutional laws that the NRA is challenging across the country that burden the right of peaceable Americans to keep and bear arms,” Kozuch wrote in a statement . “This decision holds only that an individual who poses a clear threat of violence may be temporarily disarmed after a judicial finding of dangerousness.” The decision means that Rahimi will almost surely face a significant federal prison sentence, in addition to possible jail time for his alleged state crimes. Rahimi’s state cases have remained pending while the Supreme Court considered the issue. He also faces a state felony charge for possession of fentanyl. Sebastian Murdock contributed reporting.

Pete Best, who was the band’s drummer in the early 1960s, posted the tribute to McCartney on social media Wednesday, wishing the rock icon a happy birthday. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); But Best also made an appeal ― to be the opening act for McCartney in Manchester, England, where he’s scheduled to play in December. “Happy Belated Birthday. Not far behind you,” the drummer wrote . “Reach out if you’d like me to open for you in Manchester. Imagine. Now that would be something.” Happy Belated Birthday. Not far behind you. Reach out if you’d like me to open for you in Manchester. Imagine. Now that would be something. pic.twitter.com/RfUFS8yNcn — Pete Best (@BeatlesPeteBest) June 19, 2024 As one might expect, there’s a bit of history between the two former Beatles. Best was famously replaced by Ringo Starr as the band’s drummer in August 1962, after purportedly failing to impress producer George Martin with his time-keeping skills. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Best has claimed that he was never given an explanation for why he was pushed out of the group. Still, he told The Irish Times in 2020 that he doesn’t hold his dismissal against McCartney. So far, the “Maybe I’m Amazed” singer hasn’t responded to Best’s generous offer to open for him, but that’s par for the course. Although McCartney is said to have reached out to Best around the time that the Beatles’ “Anthology” albums were released in the 1990s, Best told The Irish Times that he hasn’t spoken with any of his former bandmates since leaving the group.

For those keeping up with the show, however, Cooke’s character, Queen Alicent Hightower, is clearly still a red-blooded royal. Hightower notably explored her carnal lust and pleasures with Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel) in Sunday’s Season 2 premiere and, as a young mother of three who married her friend’s father, Viserys Targaryen, as a child, never got to have a flirtatious youth herself. “I think for her, it represents teenagedom,” she told Elle. “It’s passion. She’s never had that.” “I thought there’d be way more,” she added about her sex scenes in the show, “and so I’m relieved that when it has been used for me, it’s showing Alicent being pleasured, which is amazing and doesn’t feel gratuitous. It feels like we’re telling a story.” Cooke plays Queen Alicent Hightower in the fantasy prequel series to \"Game of Thrones.\" Benjamin Cremel/AFP/Getty Images Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “Dragon” premiered three years after the contentious finale of “Game of Thrones,” both of which are based on the “A Song of Ice and Fire” novels by George RR Martin. The sexual violence, meanwhile, is notably less egregious in the prequel series than in “Thrones.” Former co-showrunner Miguel Sapochnik told The Hollywood Reporter ahead of the first “Dragon” season that it “pulls back” from sex, but that they also “don’t shy away from it” — as “violence perpetrated on women by men in that time … “shouldn’t be downplayed.” Cooke finds the anguish of her character’s crumbling friendship with Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D’Arcy) just as engrossing since the two royals grew up together as best friends — only for the scheme-laden world of politics to pull them apart. “They practiced proper adult relationships on each other,” Cook told Elle. “When you break up with a friend, it’s so much more heartbreaking than breaking up with a lover a lot of the time, because they know every single part of you, and it’s so much more vulnerable.” The Season 2 premiere of “House of the Dragon” is now available on Max.

The “Better Sister” star showed up bright and early Tuesday on the Manhattan set of her upcoming series, mere hours after Justin Timberlake — with whom she shares two young children — was charged with driving while under the influence in Sag Harbor, New York. It was the first time that Biel, whose blonde bob complemented her tan and black dress, was seen in public since his arrest. Biel was spotted one day earlier filming in Central Park with co-stars Corey Stoll and Elizabeth Banks, who is also her co-executive producer on the thriller . Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Timberlake was arrested around 1 a.m. Tuesday after an officer allegedly saw him fail to stay in his lane and run a stop sign, the Sag Harbor Police Department said in a statement. Footage of him driving mere moments earlier has since been shared by TMZ . “He had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot and he performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests,” the officer said, adding Timberlake smelled of alcohol, had “bloodshot and glassy” eyes, and repeatedly refused a chemical test on the scene. Timberlake told the arresting officer that he had “one martini” and was following his friend home, according to court records obtained by CNN . He was arraigned in the morning on one count of driving while intoxicated — and pleaded not guilty to the charge. The *NSYNC member was released by 9:30 a.m. Tuesday and is reportedly due back in court on July 26. Timberlake, who recently embarked on his first world tour in nearly six years, is notably scheduled to perform in Krakow, Poland, that evening.

Sag Harbor Police Department/Getty Images “I look forward to vigorously defending Mr. Timberlake on these allegations,” his attorney Edward Burke Jr. told NBC News on Wednesday . “I will have a lot to say at the appropriate time but am currently awaiting full discovery from the District Attorney’s office.” Biel, who had gushed about Timberlake on Instagram earlier in the week, started dating the singer in 2007. They briefly separated in 2011 but ended the year with an engagement and, after tying the knot in 2012 , welcomed sons Silas and Phineas in 2015 and 2021. “You’re so many things to so many people,” Biel wrote Sunday in a Father’s Day tribute to Timberlake. “But to us you are THE ROCK ... we climb on, we lean against. The rock that shades us from the sun. And when we recline on you, as we always do, hopefully our butts will keep you eternally grounded.” “We LOVE YOU,” she concluded.

    "article_content": "Trends Reporter The year’s most anticipated sporting event continues to spawn triumph and tragedy . French swimmer Rafael Fente-Damers successfully qualified for the Paris Olympics on Tuesday, but while punching the pool waters in joyous celebration at the French Championships in Chartres, the 17-year-old athlete reportedly dislocated his shoulder. Fente-Damers had just secured his spot on the team by placing second in the 100-meter freestyle final behind Maxime Grousset, when, as seen in footage of his reaction that has since gone viral on social media , he winced in pain before pointing to his shoulder. While the swimmer has yet to comment on the incident or disclose an exact diagnosis, French outlet L’Equipe reported Tuesday that he dislocated his shoulder. Grousset, who naturally wants the second-best Frenchman by his side at the Olympics, remains hopeful. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “I hope it goes well for him because we’re waiting for him for the relay,” said Grousset, who helped Fente-Damers out of the pool and flagged down medics, per Reuters . “He’s a bit crazy, that’s why he’s good. He’s not afraid of anything and I think he’s going to progress.” HuffPost has reached out to the French Swimming Federation for comment. Fente-Damers was certainly all smiles in photos taken later at the winners’ podium despite having his left arm in a swing. L’Equipe reported that his dislocated shoulder — an injury in which the upper arm bone pops out of its socket — had been treated at a local hospital. The 17-year-old athlete winced in pain before pointing to his shoulder and exiting the pool. Sebastien Bozon/AFP/Getty Images Fente-Damers, who completed the freestyle final in 48.14 seconds after Grousset’s time of 47.33 , isn’t the first athlete to injure himself ahead of the Olympics. WNBA star Cameron Brink tore her ACL on Tuesday after making the U.S. 3x3 basketball team. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); While the injured Los Angeles Sparks rookie is officially getting replaced, Fente-Damers is currently still expected to compete.

And what did they do for Black lives?” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “It is outrageous to see people ask you for reparations, even though they never went through slavery,” the 25-year-old Colombia-born Republican continued. “These ungrateful people should be celebrating because they were born in the greatest nation to ever exist.” Gomez clearly failed to grasp that Black Lives Matter wasn’t founded for reparations, but as a protest movement against police brutality , and seemed confused in decrying reparations for people who “never went through slavery” — as that’s precisely who they’re for. “Here’s a tip,” she nonetheless declared. “If you don’t like America, kindly, get the fuck out.” Juneteenth was officially proclaimed a national holiday by President Joe Biden in 2021, but has been celebrated by Black families in the U.S. for decades, as it commemorates the liberation of America’s last slaves being emancipated in Galveston, Texas, in 1865. Juneteenth is ratchet, and I agree with @RealCandaceO 🇺🇸If you don’t like America, gtfo. pic.twitter.com/RR63dBKtcB — Valentina Gomez (@ValentinaForSOS) June 18, 2024 Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); The holiday was expectedly opposed by numerous Republicans , including Black right-wing pundit Candace Owens, who claimed in 2021 that Democrats are “trying to repackage segregation” and called the holiday “ghetto and made up” in 2023. “America is the Greatest Country in the World,” Gomez told HuffPost in a statement Tuesday. “If you are not a slave, then you DO NOT deserve any reparations. Straight White men built the roads we drive on, the buildings where we live, and the ones that fought and declared independence from the tyranny of the British for us to have freedom and the pursuit of happiness. To ANYONE that does not like America, GTFO.” She added: “President Trump is the Greatest President of All Time, and I look forward to accepting his endorsement.” While her social media stunts have successfully drawn attention to her campaign in the Aug. 6 primaries, they also bear all the signs of an online troll who’ll do anything to go viral. The MAGA-aligned real estate investor has previously supported that perspective herself. Gomez not only used a flamethrower to torch books with LGBTQ themes earlier this year in an attempt to rally her reactionary base, but told them “don’t be weak and gay” in an actual campaign ad last month — and donned a shirt with the slogan in Tuesday’s video. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); While many on social media commented in support, Gomez caught warranted flack as well.

The hip-hop feud reached a fever pitch Wednesday in Los Angeles when Lamar, the hometown hero of South Central, hosted a celebratory Juneteenth concert titled The Pop Out: Ken & Friends at the Kia Forum. At the concert, he performed his Billboard-charting Drake diss “Not Like Us” five times in a row. Thousands rapped along as Lamar spit his fiery verses onstage at the star-studded affair, which was live-streamed on Amazon . The concert event also included guests Tyler, the Creator and YG. NBA stars Russell Westbrook and LeBron James, as well as singer The Weeknd, were in the crowd as Lamar brought dozens of rival gang members onstage. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “This shit gets me emotional, dog,” he told the crowd . “We done lost a lot of homies to this music shit, lot of homies to some street shit, and for all of us to be on this stage together; unity from each side of motherfucking L.A., crips, bloods, pirus — this shit is special, man. The beef between the two hip-hip titans kicked off in March when the rappers directly engaged each other on wax after years of subtle shots. Lamar fans would note that his “Not Like Us” is already hip-hop’s unofficial summer anthem. The concert attracted about 17,000 attendees. One social media user wrote on X, formerly Twitter , “This Kendrick show is the blueprint for a hometown event.” Lamar, a Pulitzer Prize winner, slammed his Canadian opponent in a diss as \"a scam artist.\" Christopher Polk via Getty Images Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Lamar apparently named the show after his espoused ethos on “Not Like Us” that “you gotta pop out” to squash the competition sometimes. He gave 15 relatively unknown local acts the stage to open for him. Lamar held the concert on Juneteenth in commemoration of the last enslaved people in the U.S. being liberated in 1865 — after Drake accused him in a diss of “always rapping like you bout to get the slaves freed.” Lamar took a moment onstage to address Drake, saying, “Give me Tupac’s ring back.” The Canadian rapper purchased one of Shakur’s rings last year for over $1 million. While some fans are adamant the beef isn’t over, others see The Pop Out as the final nail in the coffin that is Drake’s rap career.

The tight end, who received his third ring after defeating the San Francisco 49ers at this year’s Super Bowl, hilariously reacted to the error on Wednesday’s episode of his “New Heights” podcast . Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “One major little goof on the ring: Miami is listed as the seventh seed,” brother Jason Kelce noted on the show, using the term for a team’s spot in the NFL playoffs. “Miami was actually the sixth seed.” Travis Kelce appeared indifferent to the Miami Dolphins mistake, which had been identified by social media users last week as Chiefs players received their $40,000 rings in a Missouri ceremony. “I don’t give a shit,” he told his sibling. “I like it that we didn’t give a fuck about what seed Miami is. Fuck it! Yeah, they were the seventh — who cares? They could’ve done no seeds on the side of them [the rings], I would’ve been fine.” He added: “I think it makes it more unique, like, ‘Oh, yeah, we made it really detailed and, oops, we screwed up.’ Just makes it more exclusive, like we screwed up about something that means nothing.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Travis Kelce, left, and his teammate Patrick Mahomes are seen at last year's Super Bowl ring ceremony. Kansas City Chiefs/Getty Images Each ring contains 529 diamonds and 38 rubies, with a total of 14.8 carats . Nineteen of the diamonds celebrate the Chiefs as the first team in as many years to win back-to-back Super Bowls, while four marquise stones symbolize their total victories at the annual event. Travis Kelce didn’t argue when his brother said the jewelry has gotten more “ostentatious” over the years. When asked which of his three rings is his favorite, he said “the one from last year,” as “it has a clasp where you can wear it in different ways.” The tight end notably defeated his brother at the 2023 Super Bowl , in which the Chiefs faced off against the Philadelphia Eagles . Travis Kelce also said that last week’s ring ceremony in Missouri was “fun,” but noted that the Chiefs are “focused to keep our eyes on the prize” — hinting that they hope to become the first team in NFL history to win three back-to-back Super Bowls.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Illustration:Jianan Liu/HuffPost; Photo:Amelia J. Moore;Getty Images \"Authentic is what is authentic to me — what I have grown up with, been influenced by, or want to create.\" Maneet Chauhan is an Indian American celebrity chef, restaurant owner and cookbook author. She launched the first ever Indian dining concept at a Disney park in Orlando, eet by Maneet Chuahan , and became the first two-time champion of Food Network’s highest-rated culinary competition series, ” Tournament of Champions .” In this edition of Voices in Food , Chauhan explains how she takes issue with people who question “authenticity” in her cooking. She advises chefs and diners to loosen the criticism of authenticity, and have more fun through personal expression. I grew up in a small town in Ranchi, India. The community that I grew up in had people from all over the country. Each region of India — Punjab, Andhra, Bengal, Rajasthan — has a distinct cuisine of its own. I was that obnoxious kid who would eat dinner at home and then go to my neighbor’s home and tell them that my parents did not feed me so I could try their regional food, too. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); As I got older, our family friends started asking me to come to the dinner parties earlier, to help cook with them. It was fascinating, because I got to learn about different ingredients and techniques from these aunties, which was “authentic to them” home cooking. I myself started playing around with combinations and textures that I enjoyed. I would take my own cooked food to my older sister in college and became the most popular kid on campus. I realized I could have a conversation with anyone over food. Instead of following the common professional aspirations of becoming a doctor or engineer, I wanted to be a chef. My parents encouraged me. I went to the best hotel management school in Manipal, India. Then, I had my eyes on the best culinary school in the world – Culinary Institute of America (CIA). When I got there in 1998, I was the only Indian student at the CIA for a long time. The awareness of Indian food in the U.S. was the dismal all-you-can-eat, $10-or-less lunch buffets. It was shocking because I had grown up with seasonal ingredients and many evolved flavors. Advertisement “When diners or the media attack me that my food is not authentic, I tell them that authenticity is an opinion and it is OK to have a conversation around your experiences.” - Maneet Chauhan But instead of feeling pigeonholed, I was excited to learn new techniques. At CIA, when we had to make focaccia with our own signature topping for our bread-making class, I [used] bhindi bhaji (Indian-style okra) and chana daal (chickpea curry) toppings. Everyone loved the flavors and the chef-instructor encouraged me to express myself in my cooking.

We were serving what people thought of as authentic Indian food, and it gave me insight into what Indian food could be if it was treated with respect. I introduced the diners to dishes they had never even heard of before, or would write off as “unauthentic.” For example, most people associate chaat with northern India and expect certain ingredients in it. I traveled around India to research for my cookbook and found there were so many versions of chaat – including idli chaat from southern India. Even today, my chicken tikka poutine is controversial, but my most popular dish. When people come to my restaurants and remark that my food is not authentic Indian, I ask them: What is authentic? India, as a country it is today, is an aggregation of cultures. Chicken tikka masala is not authentic Indian; it is a British invention. Goan Vindaloo has vinegar from Portuguese influence. Indo Chinese comes from the Chinese migration of Tangra cuisine. Most people associate naan with Indian food, but that came from when Persian kingdoms settled in India. Even key ingredients used in everyday Indian cooking, like tomatoes and chilies, originally came from Mexico. If you go further back in history, Indian food was Dravidian or Satvik (ayurvedic), and back in time, we were all hunters and gatherers cooking on fire. In fact, no cuisine in the world can be called authentic. If so, we would say there was no authentic French cuisine prior to Auguste Escoffier documenting mother sauces. Authentic is a weak word. It is open to personal interpretation. Authentic is what is authentic to me — what I have grown up with, been influenced by, or want to create. There are thousands of ways saag paneer is made across India. Even my maternal and paternal grandmothers from the same region made it differently. So, am I confused about my authenticity? I am not an historian, I am an artist. Cooking is open to my interpretation of flavors. And there are different kinds of artists — some are great at copying exactly, others interpret something from real life. At the end of the day, chefs are artists, some put their own flavor and design, others do it as they see it. My food is authentic Maneet.

Your nonna was probably using a mortar and pestle instead of a grinder, and cooking on an open fire instead of a temperature-controlled commercial oven. There is charm in knowing where we came from, but also excitement in where we have come. Change is a part of our evolution. Chefs may start with the romanticized idea of cooking what their grandmother made, but every generation adds its own signature on the dish. Instead of hanging on rigidly to the word “authentic,” you can be open to translation. Authenticity is a vague word that comes down to personal perception. Each restaurant concept is authentic to the chef who created it. Chefs should stop calling their food “authentic” and should stand behind their own celebration of flavors they have been inspired by, and how they want to transfer their own emotion and passion across to diners through their creations. When diners or the media attack me that my food is not authentic, I tell them that authenticity is an opinion and it is OK to have a conversation around your experiences. You don’t need to be right or wrong. It is often people who have limited knowledge who dig their heels in to assume and criticize. Food is a powerful connector — it emotes love, and provides nourishment. I became a chef to make people happy. Naysayers will always be there. But if as a chef you are true to yourself, that’s all that matters.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost GMVozd via Getty Images You'll never look at that bowl of sour cream in the same way. If you have plans to eat at a Mexican restaurant for dinner in the States, you probably have a few expectations — complimentary baskets of golden tortilla chips and salsa, tacos, burritos, enchiladas and a whole section on the menu devoted to margaritas. Oh, and you expect it to be cheap . While many Mexican restaurants in the U.S. certainly deliver on all those fronts, it’s a giant misconception to believe a Mexican restaurant must check off all those boxes in order to be good or authentic. Mexican food is a lot more varied than many Americans realize, and numerous top Mexican chefs told HuffPost that there are a few myths — six big ones, in particular — many people believe that simply aren’t true. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); 1. Mexican food is essentially rice and beans. Rick Martinez , a Mexican chef living in Mazatlán and the author of “Mi Cocina,” told HuffPost that one misconception many Americans have about Mexican food is that it essentially comes down to five dishes: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, nachos and quesadillas — often with rice and beans being the core ingredients. “There is so much more diversity in Mexico and its food than people realize,” he said. José Cepeda , the executive chef at Quixote in The Lafayette Hotel and Club in San Diego, California, added to this, saying, “In the U.S, when [many Americans] think about Mexican food, it’s always tacos and burritos, cheese, chips and salsa with margaritas. I’m not saying it’s wrong, but Mexican food is a lot more than that.” Advertisement For example, Martinez shared that many Americans don’t realize that seafood is a big part of Mexican cuisine, including lobster, clams, shrimp and oysters. “Many [Americans] have a limited view of what Mexico has to offer by way of seafood and produce. For example, Mexico has amazing citrus fruits and coconut,” Martinez said. Martinez pointed out that Mexico is a big country and the cuisine varies by region — something many Americans may not realize. He explained that Mexican cuisine uses fresh ingredients native to the local region, which is different based on where in Mexico you are. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Mely Martínez, author of “Mexico in Your Kitchen,” expressed a similar sentiment, saying, “The idea that Mexican food is just what we usually see in the United States is not right because the food from Mexico has a lot of different styles and varieties. Mexico is formed by 32 states, each one with its own distinct gastronomy formed by local ingredients, cooking techniques and cultural influences.” She added that the cuisine can differ significantly from one region to another, showcasing a wide spectrum of flavors, textures and dishes that extend far beyond the limited offerings typically seen in American representations of Mexican food. “In the U.S., the exposure to Mexican cuisine often revolves around a handful of popular dishes that may not fully capture the extensiveness and complexity of Mexico’s gastronomy,” Mely Martínez said. 2. Mexican food should be cheap. Related to the myth that Mexican food primarily consists of rice and beans, Julian Medina , the owner and chef of Toloache , which has locations across New York City, said that many Americans expect that all Mexican food should be cheap. “Generally, I think Americans typically expect Mexican food to be cheap because it often features less expensive ingredients like rice and beans. However, upscale Mexican food centers around high-quality, fresh ingredients, with an extensive amount of time and labor going into making sauces like mole, which in some cases can take days to prepare,” he said. zoranm via Getty Images Mexican food is often centered on healthy ingredients, like the lean meat and vegetables seen here. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 3. Sour cream and cheese are core ingredients. If, for you, Taco Tuesday means a tub of Daisy sour cream and yellow cheese are front and center in the kitchen, your meal may taste great — but it isn’t exactly something you’ll come across in Mexico. “The use of sour cream and yellow cheese is not as common in traditional Mexican cuisine as it is in the ‘Mexican’ food found in the United States,” Mely Martínez told HuffPost. She explained that in Mexico, dishes might be topped with fresh local cheeses such as queso fresco or Mexican crema, which is a thinner, more flavorful counterpart to American sour cream. Medina added to this, saying that sour cream is not typically part of Mexican cuisine. “It’s America’s take on Mexican crema, which has a different flavor profile. It’s more sweet than sour,” he said. Again, totally fine if you like these ingredients on your tacos or in your quesadillas. Just expect something a little different if you go on vacation in Mexico or a Mexican friend invites you over for dinner. 4. Mexican food is unhealthy. Osiris Hoil, the co-founder and CEO at District Taco , with locations in Washington, D.C., Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, said that one common myth he’s often confronted with is that Mexican food is inherently unhealthy. “I want people to know that Mexican food can be balanced and healthy,” he said. Rick Martinez said this too, saying that there is so much amazing produce grown in Mexico like sweet potatoes, corn and berries. Hoil said that as Mexican restaurants gained popularity in America, many of the dishes adapted to include high-calorie topping and heavy sauces. “There’s also the idea that more is better — portion sizes have increased. When you add it all up, it gives people the impression that Mexican food is unhealthy,” he explained. But he emphasized that delicious Mexican food doesn’t require these extra, high-calorie ingredients. “You can have a taco with nothing more than lean, marinated grilled chicken, which we call pollo asado, freshly prepared pico de gallo — which is simply tomato, onion, lime juice and cilantro — and top it with roasted tomato-based salsa. You will be blown away by the flavor,” he said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 5. It’s spicy. If you’re someone with a low-threshold for spice, you may think Mexican food isn’t for you. But Mely Martínez told HuffPost this isn’t the case. “One common misconception about Mexican food that many Americans might have is the idea that all Mexican dishes are naturally spicy,” she said. “In reality, the flavors and ingredients in Mexican food are diverse and balanced. While it’s true that chili peppers, either dried or fresh, play an important role in Mexican cooking, they are often used merely to enhance the complexity and flavor of a dish, rather than to add heat. Not every Mexican dish is spicy, and many can be enjoyed by those who prefer milder tastes,” she explained. Medina shared a similar sentiment, saying, “Chilis are commonly used [in Mexican cuisine], but this is more so for flavor than spice.” Hoil echoed this, saying, “There are definitely some spicy options, but you can always adjust it to your preference.” If you’re eating out at a Mexican restaurant and can’t do spice, just tell the waiter. You’ll still end up with a delicious meal. 6. Authentic Mexican food never changes. If you go to a Mexican restaurant and see ingredients like kibbeh and tabbouleh (traditional Lebanese dishes) on the menu, you may think you’ve ended up in a “fusion” restaurant and not an “authentic” Mexican one. But Rick Martinez told HuffPost that it’s completely natural for Mexican food to change over time as people migrate to Mexico from other countries, including Lebanon and Haiti . These migrations change what Mexican food may look like, he said, but it doesn’t make it any less authentic. Martinez said the same is true of the evolution of Mexican food in the U.S. It’s only natural for second- and third-generation Mexican chefs to draw upon the types of foods they’re exposed to in America and integrate them into their Mexican cooking. “Kitchens in general are in constant change. There are exchanges and adaptations of both Mexican cuisine in the U.S., as well as U.S. cuisine in Mexico,” said chef Enrique Olvera , who lives in Mexico City. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Here’s what all the chefs say should be unchanging about Mexican food: It’s made primarily from fresh, local ingredients and not processed ones, combined in simplistic ways and not overdressed with heavy sauces or toppings. None of the chefs say there’s anything wrong with enjoying cheesy quesadillas topped with sour cream or paying a few bucks for tacos from a local food truck. But Medina did say that if you want to seek out Mexican food in a way that truly honors the culture, he recommends going to restaurants in neighborhoods where Mexicans live that are smaller and family-owned. And maybe extend your palate past rice and beans. There’s so much more to Mexican cuisine to discover.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Yagi Studio via Getty Images We have good news. According to the nutritionists we consulted, healthy hot dogs do exist. Hot dog season is officially upon us. As the weather warms up and we weigh the pros and cons of stuffing our faces with salty hot dogs on perfectly toasted buns with ketchup, mustard and sauerkraut, we have to wonder: How much better are those hot dogs and sausages at the grocery store that include labels like “low fat,” “organic,” “vegetarian/vegan,” “low-sodium,” “natural” and the list goes on? Are they really that much healthier than a traditional hot dog? In our never-ending quest to consume hot dogs all summer without wreaking havoc on our health, we consulted nutritionists to find out — here’s what they had to say. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); This is the truth about “healthy” hot dogs. We have good news. According to the nutritionists we consulted, healthy hot dogs do exist. “ LightLife hot dogs are my favorite,” Amy Goldsmith , a registered dietitian and owner of Kindred Nutrition, told HuffPost. “They taste great, and since they are plant-based, they have 0 grams of saturated fat and total fat while still providing 8 grams of protein.” Marissa Meshulam , a New York-based registered dietitian, loves Applegate Organics Turkey Hot Dogs . “They’re made with great quality ingredients like organic turkey meat and simple spices. All of the meat is humanely raised, which is healthier for the consumer as well,” she said. In general, humanely raised animals have better access to nutrient-dense food , thus delivering more vitamins and minerals to consumers. Additionally, meat products from humanely raised animals typically contain less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fat. Advertisement Registered dietitian Stephanie Dunne is also team Applegate Organics. “I love that I understand every ingredient in the list, that they are organic, and the animals are humanely raised,” she said. “Additionally, they don’t contain any gluten or casein, so they can be enjoyed by those who have allergies or sensitivities to those proteins. They also have delicious turkey and chicken hot dogs for those looking to reduce their overall or saturated fat intake.” But you do need to pay attention to the labels. Long story short: There are good “healthy” hot dogs out there, but also imposters. You should be wary of hot dogs marketed as healthy that are anything but. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “Many packages have claims like ‘no fillers!’ and ‘no MSG!’” Dunne said . “While both of these facts are good, people should always read the ingredients and nutrition facts label to be sure they are making the healthiest selection possible. For example, a sausage package might claim ‘no fillers!’ on the front but still contain 26 grams of fat and multiple preservatives.” Goldsmith added that just because a hot dog is made from chicken or turkey doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthier. “ I think people tend to think that hot dogs that are labeled as organic or made from chicken or turkey are naturally healthier,” she said. “Although they may have less fat and a little less saturated fat, they are still high in sodium.” Excess sodium intake ( more than 1,500 milligrams per day ) increases the risk of life-threatening health issues like high blood pressure, kidney disease, stroke, stomach cancer and more, according to the American Heart Association . Just because a hot dog is organic or made with chicken doesn’t mean it’s automatically lower in sodium, so always check your labels. Let’s talk about vegan and vegetarian hot dogs… At first glance, vegan and vegetarian hot dogs might appear healthier than meat. Plant-based products are always better, right? Not necessarily. “Plant-based hot dogs are a great alternative for people who prefer to avoid meat, for whatever reason,” Dunne said. “However, regardless of the source of filling, the healthiest hot dogs will be those with low sodium content, reasonable fat content and natural ingredients. From a health perspective (rather than a moral one or based on taste preference), I do not recommend substituting a plant-based hot dog that is high in sodium, added sugar, and has a long list of ingredients that I don’t understand.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Goldsmith agrees, saying that although, in general, plant-based hot dogs will have less saturated fat, that’s not always the case — and other ingredients matter, too. “There are specific things you want to assess,” she said. “First, how much saturated fat and total fat does it have? How much sodium, and what is the protein amount?” As with any hot dog you purchase, reading the label on vegetarian and vegan hot dogs will always be important. A sodium-packed vegan hot dog isn’t necessarily better than a turkey or chicken hot dog that packs less salt. How often can you eat healthy hot dogs? The good news is that you can buy hot dogs that are somewhat healthy. The bad news? You still probably shouldn’t eat them every day. “ Like all food groups, everything is fine in moderation,” Goldsmith said. “As a dietitian, I recommend focusing on a variety of protein sources. This can vary between poultry, pork, beef, fish and plant-sourced protein. My rule of thumb is to not repeat a source more than twice a week.” Dunne gets more specific, saying that when packing her daughter’s lunch, hot dogs make it in her lunchbox — but not every day. “I give my daughter a hot dog once per week in her lunchbox, as it is a source of protein that I know she will consume, and I wouldn’t hesitate to give her another on the weekend if I needed to,” she said. “However, because it is slightly higher in sodium than other protein sources, I ensure that I balance it out with crunchy snap peas or creamy homemade coleslaw.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); When making decisions about food frequency, Dunne emphasizes that it’s always important to consider the big picture. Even though certain hot dog picks at the grocery store are healthier than the “real thing,” eating them every day would still probably pack too much sodium into your week. So, if you want to eat them a few times a week, make sure you balance them with lower-sodium choices. To answer the initial question posed, yes — there is a point in eating healthy hot dogs. They’re a good source of protein, and some brands are significantly lower in saturated fat and sodium than the real thing. You probably still shouldn’t eat them every day, but hey — we’ll take our wins where we can.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost esseffe via Getty Images The sommelier is heading over to your table and you panic, jabbing your finger on the second-cheapest bottle . Someone gives you a good bottle of red wine, and you decide to store it in the closet for the day you finally retire. Or you’re at a party and someone hands you a bottle of Champagne, so you give it a good shake and point it into the crowd. Are these great ideas or egregious errors? Experts know, and they have thoughts. We asked winemakers, wine sellers and sommeliers to tell us the biggest misconceptions they notice among us non-wine-world civilians. Follow their advice, and you’ll never hyperventilate at the approach of the sommelier again. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Let’s start addressing the myths ... 1. The more money you spend, the more delicious the wine will be. (False) “Don’t think that paying more means you’re getting better wine,” said Rodolphe Boulanger , vice president of wine merchandising at Total Wine & More. Many factors go into the pricing of a bottle of wine, including quality, availability, demand and production cost. According to BinWise , a wine industry beverage management platform, retail wine prices are typically marked up 50% over wholesale prices. So, a wine that costs $7 from a wholesaler will be about $11 at a wine shop, it notes. Advertisement But with so many variables at play, some less expensive wines can taste terrific, and there are many hidden gems to be found. “One of my favorite wine experiences in the past month was enjoying a $12 French Pinot Noir from Cambos Feret ,” Boulanger said. “It surprised me by overdelivering on quality.” 2. Follow the wine critics’ ratings and scores, and you’ll always get a wine you like. (False) Wine critics and publications usually use a 100-point wine rating scale, so a wine rated 80 is considered good, and one rated at 95 or higher is exceptional. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); But, as with reviews from any subjective critic — such as in the realms of food or theater — those numbers represent informed opinions, not absolute facts. “The concept of critics’ ratings and scores can create a false sense that there’s only one true hierarchy of wine, or that a 100-point wine is objectively the best,” Boulanger said. “Ratings can be helpful when making a selection, but sometimes what’s more important is what you and your guests like.” 3. You shouldn’t put ice cubes in wine to chill it. (True) “No judgments, but if you truly want to enjoy a wine the way the winemaker intended, ice isn’t a good idea,” said Dana Spaulding , level 2 sommelier and CEO of single-serve wine brand Wander + Ivy. “Ice cubes will dilute the wine and water it down.” There are other options, she said. “A trend I’ve been noticing is keeping wine glasses in the freezer before serving, which is not only a smart idea, but very Instagrammable,” she added. “I also love the idea of using frozen whole grapes instead of ice cubes. As they thaw, they won’t change the composition of the wine.” 4. You should always store leftover wine in the fridge. (True) “The fridge is a good place to store any wine leftovers, because cooler temperatures slow down chemical processes, including oxidation,” said Michelle Feldman , the co-founder of Good Clean Wine. “A re-closed bottle of red or white wine, refrigerated, can stay relatively fresh for up to five days.” If you’re thinking red wine shouldn’t go near the fridge, you can let that idea go, because leftover red actually does fine under chilly conditions. “Storing opened and recorked red wine in the refrigerator doesn’t alter its profile,” Feldman said. “While the cool temperature can’t prevent oxidation, it significantly slows the process. It’s standard practice among restaurants, sommeliers and winemakers to store wine this way.” Even better, she pointed out that your leftover reds won’t need to be brought to room temperature before serving. “Once poured into a glass, refrigerated red wine will quickly reach the desired temperature,” she said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); MarkSwallow via Getty Images “No judgments, but if you truly want to enjoy a wine the way the winemaker intended, ice isn’t a good idea,” said Dana Spaulding, level 2 sommelier. 5. Wine never spoils. (False) Spaulding noted that, especially in warmer months, you should bring any wine bottles into the house as soon as possible. “Once wine is above 70 to 75 degrees F, it will start to spoil, which means, in the case of wine, that it will start to turn to vinegar,” she said. So, don’t stop by the wine shop and then keep the bottle in your trunk all day while you run errands. 6. It’s a great idea to store a bottle of wine for a ‘someday’ occasion. (False) “Unless you’re buying a specific wine that’s meant to be aged, don’t save your wine,” Feldman said. “Not all wines get better with age, and most wines should be opened and enjoyed now, or within a year of purchasing. Sparkling wines are meant to be enjoyed fresh, so go ahead and pop the bottle now. Still wines tend to reach peak maturity around two years after bottling.” Feldman pointed out that only 1% of all wine produced is intended for aging, so very few bottles actually benefit from the process. “Generally, wines with high acidity, tannins, sugar and alcohol content such as fortified wines, as well as complex premium wines, benefit from aging,” she said. 7. You should only drink Champagne from a flute. (False) Cameron Nadler , whose Instagram handle is “ everyday_sommelier ,” is wine director for New York’s Zero Bond and Sartiano’s at The Mercer . He said a flute is not required when you’re popping a bottle of fizz. “A good all-purpose wine glass is a great vessel for drinking champagne, because it really allows you to get all the flavors and experience the wine as the producer intended,” he said. “Champagne flutes are not a thing of the past, but I do find that it’s better to drink Champagne from a larger glass.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 8. Red wine should be served at room temperature, and white wine should be ultra-chilled. (Mostly true, but a little bit false) There’s a little more to it. Florent Latour is CEO of Maison Louis Latour , a merchant and owner of red and white wines in Burgundy, France, which has been independent and family-owned since 1797. “The proper temperature to serve red and white wines is often misunderstood, and people serve red wine too warm or white wine too cold, which can dull the flavor of the wines,” he said. “I’d recommend chilling red wine for 20 minutes before serving. On the other hand, pre-chilled white wines should be taken out of the refrigerator about 25 minutes before serving for optimal enjoyment.” 9. Red wine pairs with meat; white wine is for fish. (False) Nope. “A common mistake people make is overthinking their food and wine pairings, or being a little too by the book,” said Linda Trotta , director of winemaking at Bread & Butter Wines and vice president of global winemaking and sourcing at WX Brands . “If done correctly, you can enjoy a red wine with seafood or a high-end Champagne with fast-food french fries.” 10. The best way to open sparkling wine is with a big sports-celebration-type fizz-fest. ( False) Latour said there’s no need for the dramatic pop and subsequent gusher. “As fun as that may sound, it results in a huge, messy spray and, most importantly, a loss of wine,” he said. “When it comes to removing sparkling wine corks, I’d recommend carefully holding the cork and then slowly rotating the bottle with a kitchen towel covering the top of the bottle. This way, you’ll still hear the satisfying ‘pop,’ but you won’t make a mess.” 11. The sommelier is there to bully you into an expensive choice.

Most food lovers agree that when you’re on vacation, one of the perks of staying at a hotel is the free continental breakfast or breakfast buffet included with your visit. On the other hand, one of the biggest setbacks you can have on a vacation is being relegated to the bathroom after you’ve contracted a foodborne illness. And food that’s been sitting out all morning can be at high risk of potential bacteria contamination, so it’s important to know which items are safe to eat — and which you may want to skip. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “There are two main factors I think about … that can increase [the] risk of getting foodborne illness,” explained Dr. Ellen Shumaker , director of outreach for the Safe Plates program at North Carolina State University. “[Those are] temperature control of foods [and] … other guests potentially contaminating utensils or food due to lack of handwashing.” A lot of the time you can’t taste the difference when food is contaminated, so it’s key to know what to look out for ahead of time. Advertisement “There’s a number of different microorganisms [that can contaminate food and] can prove to be pathogenic or produce toxins,” said Dr. Bryan Quoc Le , food scientist and food science consultant. “For example, [with] certain species of E. coli, salmonella or listeria, you only need a couple cells to really cause havoc.” We talked to food safety experts about what they usually avoid at a hotel breakfast — and what they feel comfortable eating and drinking. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Avoid: Hot foods (like meat or egg products) that aren’t kept at a heated temperature. “Hot foods [should be] staying hot, and cold foods [should be] staying cold,” Shumaker said. “[This helps to] avoid … the temperature danger zone where bacteria like to grow.” When foods are left out in the “danger zone” (between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit) for more than two hours, germs that make you sick can rapidly reproduce, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And in a buffet or continental breakfast setting, food is likely sitting out longer than that. If you see sausage patties, bacon, scrambled eggs, quiches or other meat and egg products sitting out without any heating appliance, you’re going to want to skip those. These types of foods should be kept warm with a device such as a hot plate or chafing dish, Shumaker explained. “This does not give the exact temperature, of course, but is an indicator that measures are being taken to keep food in a safe temperature range,” she said. AscentXmedia via Getty Images Meat and eggs without a head source? That's a major red flag. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Avoid: Cold foods (like dairy products and fresh juices) that aren’t kept at cold temperatures. “If there’s milk that’s been sitting around and it’s not on ice or hasn’t been refrigerated, that’s certainly something that I’m planning on avoiding,” Le said. You’re going to want to make sure perishable items (like yogurt, cheeses and deli meats) are kept cold and stay out of the temperature “danger zone.” Some precut fruits and veggies (like tomatoes, leafy greens and melon) also should be chilled because “when cut, the fleshy part … has the level of moisture and pH to allow bacteria that can cause illness to grow,” according to Shumaker. As for juices, both fresh and pasteurized should be cold. Since fresh juice isn’t pasteurized, it’s at a higher risk for growing harmful bacteria when left out at room temperature. Shelf-stable juice packaged in boxes, bottles or cans don’t need to be refrigerated, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Individually wrapped creamers and butter packets also don’t need to be kept cold. These types of creamers have been treated to kill off bacteria, and the salt in the butter helps it maintain shelf stability, Shumaker explained. Avoid: Fruits and veggies that are soggy or tough to clean. While Le generally eats from the salad bar if it looks clean and fresh, he pays attention to signs that the fruits and veggies aren’t being properly handled. For example, if they have soft edges or if there’s any dirt or other material on the surfaces, this could indicate that they’re old or haven’t been thoroughly washed. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Melons, like cantaloupes, can be particularly risky because people often don’t wash the rinds, he said. If the rind is damaged and there’s bacteria on it, it can spread to the inside part of the melon. It can also cross-contaminate other fruits or veggies it touches. “Fresh vegetables that are normally picked from the ground, like a lettuce or a cabbage … can pick up dirt quite a bit and then spread that … if they haven’t been washed carefully,” Le added. “Dirt can … start to produce a number of different microorganisms.” Raw sprouts (such as alfalfa or mung bean) should be avoided, Shumaker explained. They’re grown from seeds and beans under warm, humid conditions, which are ideal for the growth of E. coli, salmonella and listeria, according to the FDA . “If just a few harmful bacteria are present in or on the seed, the bacteria can grow to high levels during sprouting.” Urilux via Getty Images Pre-sliced melon can carry contamination risks. Avoid: Anything from a shared bowl that doesn’t have a serving utensil. Sure, that tray of fruit may look appetizing — until you notice there’s no serving utensil for it and people are touching it with their bare hands. If they haven’t washed their hands after using the restroom, coughing or blowing their nose, they could be contaminating the other food on the plate, Shumaker said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); When you do use serving utensils or shared condiments that a lot of other people are touching, you want to make sure your hands are clean before picking up the food on your plate. “Other guests may have hands that have not been washed thoroughly after using the restroom or … have been in their mouths for their finger-licking first course,” said Dr. Jonathan Deutsch , professor of culinary arts and science at Drexel University. “I always try to sanitize my hands between making my plate and sitting down to eat.” Norovirus, known as the “stomach bug,” is the most likely culprit to be transferred from unclean hands to utensils and surfaces. “If not cleaned and sanitized, norovirus can persist on surfaces for weeks,” Shumaker said. What foods and drinks are safest to eat in a hotel breakfast setting? Making sure food and beverages are served at the appropriate temperature and washing your hands before eating are two of the most important guidelines. There are a few other items experts say are safest to consume. “I’m going to trust [packaged foods, like muffins or individual yogurts] more just because there’s a lot of processes that are involved to make sure that [they] are kept safe,” Le said. “[And] no one’s touching them or handling them.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Deutsch said whole fruits that haven’t been cut (like bananas or oranges), cooked-to-order options like omelets, and cereal in a dispenser (wash your hands after touching the handle) are also usually safe bets, particularly if you’re immunocompromised. For people who are at a higher risk of food poisoning (weakened immune system, pregnant, aged 65 and older, or younger than 5), they should especially be aware of options that are safer to eat and what to avoid. While anyone can get food poisoning, individuals in these groups could get severely sick from it, according to the CDC . Do your research — and follow your gut. Besides the above safety guidelines, you can also check out inspection reports for restaurants and hotels. (They are usually publicly available in the United States and many other countries, according to Deutsch.) And when you’re eating out at a restaurant or hotel, “don’t be afraid to ask questions regarding how food has been handled,” Deutsch said. “And follow your gut — if you see something that’s questionable or if you have a health condition that makes you particularly vulnerable, pack some protein bars.” Related Breakfast Food Safety hotel Is Your Food Package Bulging?

The entire country is confronted with the rising cost of groceries , which is only expected to continue. It really makes you think about just how badly you want those avocados , right? Though you can’t do anything about inflation, you can slash your grocery spending by making a few changes to the way you shop — while still enjoying your favorite meals and not going hungry. The secret is shopping smarter. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Experts who have mastered food shopping for cheap know the biggest pitfalls that trap people into overspending. Want to avoid them? Here are seven grocery mistakes to keep in mind the next time you do your weekly food haul. 1. Not Knowing How Much You’re Currently Spending On Food If you want to reduce your food costs, the first step is to figure out how much you’re currently spending, family budgeting expert Rob Bertman told HuffPost. “Sometimes, people will pick an amount out of thin air that they want their grocery budget to be, but that can be challenging to stick to if you don’t know how much you’re currently spending,” he said. For example, Bertman said if your goal is to spend $400 a month on groceries, and you guess that you’re typically spending $600 when you’re actually spending $1,000, your budget is unlikely to stick and could require some bigger changes. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Once you know how much you’re currently spending (by keeping the receipts from your grocery trips in the past month), Bertman said the next step is to think about the choices you can make to reduce that amount. Instead of trying to drastically cut your spending all at once, Bertman recommends making small, incremental changes — similar to how someone with a goal of eating healthier may find longer-lasting success by focusing on little adjustments at first, rather than suddenly adopting a super restrictive diet. This is where knowing some other common shopping mistakes can come in handy. 2. Not Making A Meal Plan Budget Bytes founder Beth Moncel told HuffPost that one of the most common grocery shopping mistakes is not creating a meal plan , or a guide for exactly how you’ll use everything you buy. Especially with produce, many people buy food that they aspire to eat but don’t end up doing so, Moncel said. “For some people, making sure you eat all the food you’re buying means writing on your calendar when you are going to prep and cook it,” Moncel added. Bertman is a big believer in meal planning too, but he emphasized that you should be realistic about it. “You can have a great meal plan in place for the week, but if you get home from work and you’re too tired to cook, you end up ordering in,” he said. “It’s important to be realistic about your time and ambition.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 3. Not Checking The Fridge First Before you walk out the door with your meal plan and grocery list, “Save Money on Groceries Without Losing Your Mind” author Tiffany Doerr Guerzon recommends doing yourself a solid by checking your refrigerator, freezer and pantry first. That way, you don’t end up with three half-used jars of salsa or other multiples at home. gilaxia via Getty Images Take a look inside your fridge before you buy that second bottle of ketchup. “Another way to cut waste is to challenge yourself to use only the groceries you already have at home every couple of months,” Guerzon told HuffPost. “You will probably need to pick up fresh items such as eggs and milk, but most people are surprised by what they have in their pantries, fridge and freezer.” Not sure how to combine what you have? Apps like SuperCook and Cooklist can give you some ideas. 4. Making Meat The Center Of Your Meals If you don’t want to reduce your meat consumption for ethical or health reasons , do it for your wallet. Even if you don’t give up meat completely, both Moncel and Guerzon said that cutting back can help save you money. Moncel pointed out that plant-based proteins such as lentils, chickpeas and beans are less expensive than meat. “One easy way to save money is to cut back on the amount of meat you use in a recipe,” Guerzon said. For example, if a casserole or stew calls for 1 pound of ground beef, you can use 3/4 of a pound instead, she said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “No one will notice the difference,” Guerzon explained. “If you buy ground beef in 1-pound packages, freeze the extra quarter-pound that you saved. And after you’ve prepared that recipe three times, you will have enough in the freezer for an extra meal.” 5. Only Buying Produce That’s Fresh Fruits and veggies are delicious and good for you, but some can spoil quickly. (Side-eye glance to mushrooms, berries and peaches.) For produce items that might go bad before you can eat them, Moncel and Guerzon recommend buying them frozen. “Freezing does change the texture of berries, but this isn’t noticeable when incorporating frozen berries into smoothies, baked goods [or] even for topping your breakfast oatmeal or yogurt,” Guerzon noted. When buying produce in the frozen section, Moncel recommends looking for them in their simplest form. Anything that’s covered in sauce or packaged in a microwaveable bag is likely going to cost extra. It bears repeating that if you are buying fresh produce, you should know exactly how you’re going to use it before it goes bad. Moncel said to keep this in mind when doing your meal planning and to focus on versatile veggies that can be used in various ways. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 6. Buying Tiny Jars Of Expensive Spices Guerzon suggested buying spices in bulk when you cook with them regularly. “Buying spices in bulk is my number-one [money-saving] tip because those little jars are expensive,” she said. “You can just reuse an empty spice jar and refill it from the bulk bins, or some stores that offer bulk spices even sell empty spice jars. I once refilled a $6.50 jar of dried basil from the bulk bin and it cost me less than 50 cents.” Other pantry items to buy in bulk include grain products like dried pasta, rolled oats and rice, Guerzon added. 7. Reaching For The First Item You See At Eye Level On The Shelf It’s natural to glance down at your shopping list, see what’s on it and grab the first version of it you see. But Guerzon said that simply checking the prices of items above and below eye level could save you money. “Human nature and a desire to get the shopping done quickly causes us to be more likely to reach for items at eye level,” she said. “Stores know this and place the more expensive items there. Next time you are in the store, take note of where items are placed. You may have to reach up or down for better deals.” Avoiding this mistake and others will surely save you money on groceries, but sometimes that’s simply not enough. If you aren’t able to afford food for you or your family no matter how many money-saving tricks you try, Bertman said to consider what kinds of assistance are available to you. In addition to seeing if you qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, he recommends doing a Google search for food banks in your area, as well as local nonprofits dedicated to helping families in need.

Put the experts’ tips into practice and reach out for supplemental support if you need it. With a plan in place, you’ll still be able to keep your kitchen stocked.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Jupiterimages via Getty Images Think twice before you use that ice in your drink. Summer celebrations can be some of the best times of the year, but warm temperatures also bring an increased chance that some of the food being served could contain dangerous bacteria. “The peak timing for foodborne illness is during the summer months, particularly in July and August,” said Dennis D’Amico , an associate professor in the department of animal science at the University of Connecticut. “This is the time of year associated with increased cases of listeriosis, campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); The connection between warm weather and food problems happens because the creepy critters love a warm place to settle in and multiply. Food scientist Bryan Quoc Le explained it this way: “ As temperatures become warmer, the rate at which microorganisms grow speeds up. While most spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms have very slow growth rates at refrigerator temperatures, they accelerate to 10 to 100 times the growth rate per hour at temperatures that reach 80°F to 85°F. That means the number of bacteria that can cause food poisoning will double at a much greater speed.” We asked food scientists to pinpoint some of the biggest potential dangers at outdoor events. They told us where to look for trouble — and how to avoid it. Advertisement 1. Undercooking meat (which is more common than you’d think) Glenn Morris , director of the University of Florida Emerging Pathogens Institute, said that bacteria like Salmonella and Campylobacter, which cause the greatest problems with foodborne illness, tend to be associated with raw meat and poultry. The best way to prevent sickness is to make sure all of your meat is heated to the right temperature. “These foodborne disease bacteria are killed by cooking, so make sure your chicken and hamburgers are well-cooked,” Morris said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); When you’re grilling, keep a thermometer near, D’Amico said. “Color and texture are not reliable indicators of food safety or doneness. Meats must be cooked to the proper internal temperature and verified using a food thermometer.” Ground meats must be cooked to 160°F, chicken to 165°F and fresh steaks and chops to 145°F. When the meat is cooked, don’t put it back on a plate that still has juices from the raw meat, Morris said. “Even though the meat is cooked, you can recontaminate it with bad bacteria from raw meat and poultry juices that linger on a platter.” 2. Keeping food out at room temperature The danger zone in which bacteria multiply is between 40°F and 140°F, so your food should always be either cooler or warmer than that. “Food that needs to stay cold needs to remain below 40°F, with plenty of ice and proper insulated storage, like coolers and Styrofoam chests,” Le said. “Food that has been warmed up should be kept over 140°F. You can keep it warm using the side of the grill rack or an alcohol burner.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); A good rule of thumb is to leave food out at room temperature for no more than two hours. Le explained why: “Bacteria can divide at room temperature every 15 to 20 minutes. So one single pathogenic bacteria can become 16 within the first hour, 256 in the second hour and over 4,000 in the third hour. Some species and strains can multiply at an even faster rate, depending on conditions in the food.” Depending on the toxins produced by the bacteria, some microorganisms can cause food poisoning with as little as 10 individual bacteria cells, while others require hundreds or thousands in number to cause sickness, Le said. If you’re more vulnerable, the risk is greater, and he noted that children, pregnant women and elderly individuals can have a weaker immune system that might be more severely affected by contaminated food. “Listeria monocytogenes can cause additional complications in pregnant women, and listeriosis can induce abortion, stillbirth, or meningitis in newborn babies,” he said. That’s why food cleanup should start when the meal is finished, not after you try one more round of volleyball with the fam. “The last thing you want to do is to leave food sitting out in the heat for a couple of hours, allowing the bacteria that may be present in them to grow luxuriantly,” Morris said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Matejay via Getty Images Don't forget that many potato salads contain eggs. 3. Deli salads, whether they’re homemade or store-bought Items that contain eggs — including homemade dressings, mayonnaise or dishes like deviled eggs or egg salad — are a concern, because eggs can be contaminated with the bacteria Salmonella or Campylobacter, which can cause serious illness. “Both are inactivated if ingredients are cooked properly, but they could remain present if the eggs are used raw or are undercooked,” D’Amico said. Another issue is premade or prepared salads like coleslaw, chicken, tuna, egg and potato salads. “They’re popular during the summer, but there’s a concern due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes,” he said. “This bacterium can be found in processing and deli environments and can contaminate prepared foods and their ingredients. Listeria can grow in the cold, so if a food is contaminated [with] Listeria, its numbers can increase even during cold storage at the deli.” 4. A lousy cooler The experts also noted that you need to make sure your cooler is working correctly. For that, you’ll need plenty of ice. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “A full cooler will maintain its cold temperatures longer than one that is partially filled, so it’s important to pack plenty of extra ice or freezer packs to ensure a constant cold temperature,” said Mary Anne Amalaradjou , associate professor of food microbiology in the University of Connecticut Department of Animal Science. Other cooling tips from her: “Keep the cooler out of the direct sun, and keep drinks in a separate cooler from foods. The beverage cooler will be opened more frequently, allowing the food cooler to stay cold.” 5. Repurposed ice Drink-worthy ice is not cooler ice, Morris said, noting that dirty coolers or cross-contaminating food juices could make a cold drink dangerous to consume. “Whenever you plan to serve drinks over ice, use clean ice in the glasses,” he said. “While it may be convenient to just reach into the cooler and pick up a handful of ice, think about what that ice has touched. It doesn’t belong in a drink. Instead, pack a zipper bag of drink-worthy ice cubes in the cooler and use that for your beverages.” Related Food Safety barbecue cookout Is Your Food Package Bulging?

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Westend61 via Getty Images There are some strong feelings about fettuccine Alfredo. If you’ve ever headed to a restaurant in the Little Italy section of an American city and sat down at a checkered tablecloth, there’s a good chance the dish you ordered wasn’t Italian at all. Instead, it likely fell into a culinary category known as “Italian American.” Beloved dishes like chicken Parmesan, baked ziti, and basically the entire Olive Garden menu all qualify as Italian American. This cuisine focuses on dishes invented by Italian immigrants using ingredients readily available in the United States. “ When Italians began to immigrate to the U.S., most hailed from poor, rural backgrounds and their cooking was leaner with few ingredients, dishes were mostly vegetarian, and they basically used whatever was available to them,” explained Gennaro Contaldo , a celebrated London-based chef and cookbook author best known for mentoring Jamie Oliver during his Italian cooking education. He explained that when Italian immigrants made it to the United States “a nd saw the abundance of ingredients available to them, the dishes they had learned to cook back home began to stray from the ‘cucina povera’ into a richer, often meatier cuisine.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Let’s be clear: Many people love Italian American cuisine and believe this type of dining created by Italians in the U.S. is completely authentic to its own history, its own creators, and its own culture. Giuseppe Gentile , executive chef of L’Antica Pizzeria da Michele in Naples, Italy, and its four U.S. locations in California and New York, also understands the appeal of Italian American cuisine, acknowledging that these dishes “ seem to be more comforting in some ways” than many dishes created in Italy proper. That said, if you want to dine the way Italians do in their home country, it’s important to understand that Italian cuisine follows very different rules than its Italian American counterpart. “The principle of Italian food is freshness. We like to keep recipes simple and want the customer to taste the ingredients, not have them camouflaged by heavy butter and cream,” explains Pietro Gallo , executive chef and co-owner of Civico 1845 in San Diego. Advertisement Giuseppe Gaeta , executive chef of Cipriani Las Vegas, also points out the importance of fresh and local ingredients to Italian food. “W e grew up eating what the field would provide that season in addition to what you farmed, hunted and fished,” Gaeta said. “By utilizing fresh ingredients, the flavors are more intense. Everything has a purpose.” By contrast, Italian American food “ often amps up the garlic, sauce and cheese, plus the portions are much bigger!” said Fabio Pizzigoni , executive chef of Ambrogio15 in Phoenix. Fabio Viviani , a “Top Chef” alum and prolific restaurateur, noted that “many Americans still expect a plate of pasta to be smothered in sauce, whereas in Italy, the pasta itself is the star, and the sauce is just there to enhance the flavor of the pasta.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); When visiting Italian restaurants in the United States, these Italian chefs agree that certain menu items either can’t fulfill their Italian origins or don’t exist in Italy at all (and therefore don’t play a role in authentic Italian cuisine). These seven dishes serve as prime examples. Fettuccine Alfredo When we surveyed this group of Italian chefs for the Italian American dish that most violates their Italian ideas of “good food,” they overwhelmingly agreed on the consistently popular fettuccine Alfredo. “ For an Italian, fettuccine Alfredo is a big no in the rule book!” said Jacopo Falleni , owner of Nonna in Westlake Village, California. “In Italy, pasta dishes are all about keeping it simple and letting each ingredient shine. But Alfredo is loaded with cream and butter, which is way too heavy. It really misses the mark on what Italian pasta is all about, which is simplicity and elegance. And then there’s the chicken — total disaster! It’s like putting ketchup on risotto. Just ... why? I wish I could use a hand gesture to show how wrong it is!” Marinara Sauce While marinara sauce is an item you can find in Italy, our chefs warn that the Italian version of marinara bears little resemblance to the American spin. “ I consider myself to be an open-minded chef, but when I go out, I cannot stand to order American marinara sauce or even make it at home, as there is usually a unique sweetness with flavors of fake oregano and garlic peppered in,” Gentile admitted. “ Unlike American marinara sauce, normally a good tomato sauce [in Italy] is a bit sour.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Pizzas With Unconventional Toppings These Italian chefs generally acknowledge that America has something to contribute to the pizza conversation (much to the relief of pizza snobs in New York, Chicago, New Haven and other pizza hot spots). But when it comes to “creative” toppings, the chefs find themselves no longer on board with the United States’ pizza innovations. “American pizzas have become too much, and some are too ‘out there,’ so I recommend sticking with simple ingredients,” Gaeta said. A specific American pizza topping that Italian chefs don’t appreciate is pineapple. “Pineapple doesn’t go on pizza. It’s a fruit that doesn’t match with Italian flavors. It’s too strong and the finish will cover most of the delicate flavors of the other ingredients,” said Matteo Venini , executive chef and co-owner of Stellina Pizzeria in Washington, D.C. He’s not entirely against fruit on pizza; Venini says that “at Stellina, we serve pizzas with figs or pears, which have a more balanced flavor profile, but not pineapple. I wouldn’t order pineapple on pizza at a different restaurant for the same reasons as above — it’s too sweet and overwhelms the other flavors.” Foodstock via Getty Images Say it isn't so! Spaghetti And Meatballs It’s hard for many Americans to acknowledge that spaghetti and meatballs is frowned upon by actual Italian chefs. But Viviani said, “A n Americanized Italian dish I would steer clear from is spaghetti with meatballs. In Italy, meatballs, or “polpette,” are typically served on their own, perhaps with bread or a side salad, but never over spaghetti. The combination is distinctly American, catering to the desire for protein-packed, substantial meals. While it’s popular and can be comforting, it’s something I wouldn’t cook or order because it lacks the authenticity and the balance of flavors that traditional Italian cooking is all about.” Pasta With Chicken According to Italian chefs, “Italian” restaurants in the U.S. really like to put chicken in places where it doesn’t belong. For example, you’ll never find chicken Parmesan at a restaurant in Italy; it’s an Americanized spin on “ Parmigiana di melanzane,” or eggplant Parmesan. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Italian American restaurants also like to “add chicken to a pasta dish that already has many components,” said Stefano Carniato , chef and owner of Piola Restaurants in Miami. He explained that “for [Italians], a few fresh, local ingredients suffice.” “A pasta al pomodoro with fresh basil and tomato is sublime and doesn’t need anything else. Less is always more,” he added. Garlic Bread Italian bread toasted in the oven after being slathered with butter, garlic and herbs is a staple of Italian American cuisine (and is the inspiration for Olive Garden’s famous breadsticks). But Contaldo says that “a s for garlic bread, this is stodgy and sickly and has absolutely nothing to do with delicate bruschetta, which is served in Italy with a light rubbing of garlic drizzled with extra virgin olive oil on slices of grilled rustic bread.” ‘Italian’ Dressing We’ve all seen “Italian” dressing in bottles at the supermarket and assumed it had some connection to dressings available in Italy. But Maria Liberati , author of “The Basic Art of Italian Cooking,” insists these oregano-packed bottled dressings bear no resemblance to dressings traditionally served on Italian salads. “In Italy, dressing for salads is usually just extra virgin olive oil and wine or balsamic vinegar,” she said.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Noel Hendrickson via Getty Images If you’re a meat eater shopping for dinner ingredients, heading to the butcher counter or refrigerated aisle at the grocery store is often the most convenient and affordable way to stock up on proteins. But according to professional butchers, the meat quality available in a grocery store or supermarket often falls below the standard that you’ll find at butcher shops that specialize in well-sourced animal products. “ The main difference between a butcher shop and a grocery store is the attention to detail that a butcher shop provides, beginning with prioritizing sourcing quality over the price,” said Mike Saperstein , co-owner of Sunshine Provisions in South Florida. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); As Saperstein suggests, buying meat from specialty butchers can be a pricey endeavor. However, James Peisker , co-founder of Porter Road, reminds us the higher price tags exist because “small butcher shops all over the country do a lot of extra work to seek out farms that take care of the land and the animals, which makes a better-for-you and better-tasting product.” Specialty butchers also have the skill set to cut meat more precisely than their grocery store counterparts. “The skilled tradespeople have worked hard to know and understand the different cuts,” Peisker said. “That knowledge and quality should be worth paying a little extra and supporting.” Advertisement When we spoke with professional butchers, they generally acknowledged that most American shoppers will buy meat at the grocery store at some point, and that they can generally get satisfactory products that way. But for the following five meat cuts and meat-related items, butchers urge you to steer clear of the supermarket and visit a butcher shop instead. Ground Beef And Poultry Because ground meats tend to be lower-cost than premium cuts and are usually used for dishes like burgers, meatloaf and meatballs (which involve other ingredients and toppings that obscure the meat’s flavor), we assumed that our experts would say it’s fine to purchase them at grocery stores. But butcher Luis Mata said, “G round meat products, particularly ground beef and chicken, are items I would avoid purchasing from grocery store butcher counters. The bulk of these products come pre-ground from large meat processing facilities, where the risk of contamination is significantly higher.” Mata tells us these contamination risks can cause foodborne illness and have, in some cases, “led to widespread recalls of products across vast geographic regions.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); By purchasing ground beef and poultry from butchers, you can both “reduce the risk of contamination but also ensure freshness and quality,” Mata said. Specialty butchers source their meat from smaller vendors, so they know how the animals are raised, how the meat is processed, and exactly what goes into each ground blend. “ Grocery store ground beef typically arrives pre-ground directly from slaughterhouses, where a mixture of various cuts — and not necessarily the best ones — is used. This process can compromise the flavor and quality of the meat,” Mata said. He pointed out that quality butchers usually grind their own meat and use “trimmings of premium muscles.” “This method allows them to control the quality and fat content of the ground beef, ensuring a superior product,” he said. ‘Fresh’ Fish And Seafood Grocery stores have been upping their game in the seafood department lately, with plenty of in-store butcher counters offering fish and shellfish that they advertise as “fresh.” Noel Hendrickson via Getty Images You may be better off buying frozen. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); But unless you’re buying from a grocery store that’s very close to a body of water, Rusty Bowers , owner and master butcher of Pine Street Market in Decatur, Georgia, warns that it’s worth questioning the “freshness” of grocery store seafood. “My general rule of thumb is that if you cannot do a quick 20-minute drive from the beach to that store, then buy your seafood from the freezer case” instead of the meat counter, Bowers said. He told us that, if visiting a dedicated fishmonger isn’t an option, frozen seafood is a better purchase because “most frozen seafood (as stated on the label) is processed and flash frozen on the boat to preserve its freshness shortly after being harvested from the sea.” “We have all walked past that land-locked grocery store fresh seafood case that smells like low tide on a hot day,” Bowers added. “Please be careful.” Aged Beef Aged beef is beloved among meat eaters for its tender texture and robust flavor. Artisanal butchers have used aging processes for centuries, and as conversations about beef aging move into the mainstream, we now see grocery stores trying to get in on the game. But according to Rich Silverman , head butcher of The Lambing Shed Farm Shop & Kitchen in Cheshire, England, supermarkets don’t have the time, equipment or setup to age their meats in a beneficial manner. “Local butchers have the time and space to dry-age the meat by hanging it on the bone as a full carcass. This is a far superior way of aging meat and gives a much more superior taste to the product. There is a lot less moisture in it, so it cooks better. This is a tried and tested method, done by butchers all over the world for centuries,” Silverman explained. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Grocery stores, however, tend to age their beef using “wet aging.” Silverman describes this process as involving “meat [that’s] pre-cut in packaging and then aged in that packaging.” “So when you see a label saying ‘21-day-aged’ in the supermarket, it’s not done on the carcass, so it’s not dry,” he said. “It’s done so the moisture can’t escape, so when you are cooking it, the moisture will steam the meat from the inside, making it chewy.” ‘Bone-In’ Meat Cuts Cuts of meat sold on-the-bone are a treat for flavorful braising, and the leftover bones can be used for homemade stock. However, Jerry Rempe , master butcher at Omaha Steaks, mentions that bone-in meat available in grocery store meat cases “tends to ‘sour’ more quickly than boneless products depending on the age of meats and how they’re stored.” The presence of the bone affects the meat’s pH, which can lead to “ a foul smell, slimy texture, and sometimes a change in color,” he said. “The sour smell often comes from the production of organic acids by the bacteria as they break down the proteins and fats in the meat.” Rempe told us meat can go bone sour “ due to the amount of air, enzymes and other compounds that affect it if the bone is in a region of the carcass that is not reached quickly and effectively by the refrigeration.” Because grocery store meat cuts typically aren’t flash-frozen, the clock begins to tick down on their freshness the moment they’re cut and packaged. Meat cases at supermarkets don’t have exact temperature precision, and packaged meat can sit there for more than a day, so the odds of bone sourness are higher than they’d be at a smaller craft butcher who replaces meat daily or at a larger operation that engages in flash-freezing. Pâté, Terrine And Organ Meats Some upscale grocery stores now carry liver, kidneys, sweetbreads and housemade pâté and terrine, which may seem like good news to those of us who love the richness and funk of organ meats. But Rosangela Teodoro , owner and butcher of Teodora’s Boucherie in Cohasset, Massachusetts, encourages shoppers to consider visiting a butcher who specializes in these tricky-to-prepare cuts. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “ As a specialty gourmet butcher, I also have trained expertise in customization and trimming required for specific cuts of meat. I use specialized equipment and maintain the meats at a consistent temperature to prevent spoilage. [That’s why] I would never purchase p âté and terrine from a grocery store butcher, as they require specialized equipment and expertise to prepare properly,” Teodoro said. When it comes to organs, executive chef Jeanne Oleksiak of Herd Provisions Restaurant and Butcher Shop in Charleston, South Carolina, also points out that “they’re usually frozen [at grocery stores] and are not in high demand, so they spend a lot of time moving from freezer to freezer, especially if they’re on sale.” At an artisanal butcher shop, organs are more likely to be freshly sourced and stored in optimal conditions.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Giovanni Bortolani via Getty Images An alcohol intolerance can develop quickly, for seemingly no reason. Here's how to spot the signs. When you have a few too many drinks, you might expect to wake up with a hangover and have nausea, a headache and extreme thirst. But you might not expect to experience these symptoms — along with flushed cheeks and a stuffy nose — after a single alcoholic beverage. It can happen, however, and it might signal that you’re developing an alcohol intolerance, which doctors say can arise seemingly out of nowhere. Even if you’ve never had a problem drinking a couple of glasses of wine or a martini or two, one day you might find that these drinks hit a little differently. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “It comes up a fair amount,” Jeffrey Factor , an allergist-immunologist and fellow of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, told HuffPost. “In reality, an alcohol intolerance is different from an alcohol allergy. Alcohol intolerances are much more common than a true alcohol allergy.” Your symptoms could be triggered by the alcohol itself, or by other ingredients or chemicals found in alcoholic beverages, like wheat, barley, yeast or histamine, explained Rani Maskatia , an allergist-immunologist and medical director of Latitude Food Allergy Care. Advertisement “This is even further complicated when you talk about cocktails, which can be mixed with anything,” said Trevor Craig , corporate director of technical training and consulting at Microbac Laboratories, an independent testing lab. If you start feeling unwell after drinking just a small amount of booze, you might want to get to the bottom of what’s going on. The only way to truly know is to see an allergist, Maskatia said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Here are some things to know about the difference between an alcohol allergy and an intolerance, why you might suddenly experience symptoms after drinking, and what to do about it. What’s the difference between an alcohol allergy and an intolerance? An alcohol allergy and an intolerance are sometimes confused, but they’re not the same, Factor said. With an alcohol allergy, your immune system reacts to something in an alcoholic beverage, like an ingredient, preservative or chemical, according to the Cleveland Clinic . The immune system then triggers cells to release immunoglobulin E antibodies to neutralize the allergen, and that causes allergic symptoms, according to the Mayo Clinic . Factor said true alcohol allergies are pretty rare. An intolerance, meanwhile, is any other type of reaction to alcohol that doesn’t involve the immune system, Factor explained. For instance, some people might not be able to metabolize alcohol properly. Intolerances can be genetic and are much more common than allergies, and may be more likely to affect people of East Asian descent , Factor said. What’s confusing about the two conditions is that their symptoms can overlap, Maskatia said. An alcohol allergy can cause a rash, swelling, vomiting and anaphylaxis in extreme cases. Flushing, nausea, vomiting, heart palpitations, headache, fatigue, stuffy nose and diarrhea are signs of intolerance, according to the Cleveland Clinic. “ So, you can’t look at a particular reaction and say, ‘Oh that’s definitely an allergy versus an intolerance to alcohol,’” Factor said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); SimpleImages via Getty Images If you experience nausea, a headache and extreme thirst after just one drink, it may be time to see an allergist. How do you know if you have an allergy or an intolerance? It can be tricky, Factor said. “There’s really no good testing available for allergy to alcohol.” Unlike other kinds of allergies, a skin test won’t specifically reveal an alcohol allergy, he explained. However, doctors will talk to you about your symptoms and when you experience them, Maskatia said. “A clinical history is usually sufficient for an allergist to distinguish between a suspected intolerance and a suspected IgE-mediated allergy.” A doctor might also do a blood or skin test, which can reveal allergies to substances in alcohol, such as yeast, barley, histamine, dairy or fruits, she explained. You can develop allergies to these substances at any age . Why alcohol allergies and intolerances can develop later in life It’s common for patients to come in describing symptoms or reactions to drinking alcohol that they only just developed, Factor said. It’s not clear why some people suddenly start experiencing these intolerances or allergies later in life. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Some people may be predisposed because of the onset of other medical conditions, like asthma, sinus diseases, medication allergies or changes to the body’s immune response, he explained. Genetics and environmental exposures are another factor, Maskatia said. There’s also new research suggesting such changes could be COVID-related. In a small case study published in the journal Cureus in 2023, four patients with long COVID self-reported new alcohol sensitivities following their infections, with symptoms including headaches, grogginess, anxiety, mood changes, flushing and fatigue. What to do if drinking alcohol triggers a reaction Under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 , the Food and Drug Administration requires packaged foods to list allergens like milk, egg, wheat, fish, shellfish, nuts, soybeans and sesame. But Maskatia said this doesn’t apply to alcoholic beverages. That’s because the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, not the FDA, oversees alcohol , and it makes allergen labeling on booze voluntary , Craig said. So i t’s not always evident what’s in the alcohol you’re drinking. “It’s tricky since there isn’t a requirement for a label, so it’s not always easy to look at it and decipher,” Craig explained. “Plus, you might be ordering from a bar and not even have access to the bottle.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Still, if you know that consuming grapes triggers symptoms for you, staying away from wine is a good idea, and if wheat or barley cause you problems, beer is best avoided. “If you don’t know what’s in your drink and your allergy is serious, then skip it,” Craig said. There’s no treatment for alcohol allergy or intolerance, so Factor’s best advice is to avoid drinking it if you react to it. You can adopt a dry lifestyle or just avoid certain drinks that cause your symptoms. “The bottom line is this: There’s no treatment, no testing of any significant value, and the solution is really just to avoid that alcohol, or alcohol in general,” Factor said. “It’s not a very pleasing solution for a lot of people, but that’s what it is.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this article identified Craig’s employer as Microbac Technologies, a food-safety consultant brand. In fact, it is Microbac Laboratories, an independent testing lab.

    "article_content": "Burke/Triolo Productions via Getty Images How do you take your dog? My vegetarian brother hovered over the stove, staring at a package of uncooked beef hot dogs that he graciously planned to cook for the rest of us, his omnivorous family (he was eating Beyond Brats). “What do I do with these?” he asked, and I chuckled to myself at his naiveté. But two days later, my meat-eating, hot-dog-loving friend asked me the same question, and I realized: Does no one actually know how to cook hot dogs? Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); First of all, most processed hot dogs are precooked, so you won’t likely give anyone food poisoning if you serve them cold, straight from the fridge in all their slippery, rubbery glory. (Reheating them, however, does ensure that you’ll kill any listeria that could potentially be lurking.) But you shouldn’t do that. The ideal hot dog is heated up until it’s nice and plump on the inside and golden (or even charred) on the outside. However, if you ask someone about the best way to prepare a hot dog, you should get ready for a fight. Few people agree on whether you should grill them, pan-fry them, microwave them, roast them in the oven or boil them. You can even spiral-cut them or cook them up into creepy little octopuses . Food writers have tested every which-way in the name of science , but there’s still no consensus. Advertisement However you want to cook your dog, there’s a simple technique for each method that you should master before cookout season approaches. Check them out below, ranked from our favorite to least favorite methods. 1. Pan-Frying (starting with a good steam) This ensures a plump interior and a crispy exterior, and allows you to control the level of golden brown on the outside. Don’t let the word “frying” fool you ― there’s no oil involved. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Put half an inch of water in a frying pan and let it come to a simmer on medium-high heat. Add the hot dogs to the pan, a few at a time, and pop a lid on the pan for about 2-3 minutes to let them steam. If the water boils off and the bottom of the pan is dry before the 2-3 minutes are up, just add some more water, a little at a time. After 2-3 minutes of steaming, remove the lid from the pan and let the water boil dry. Now roll the hot dogs around for a few minutes to get them browned on all sides. LauriPatterson via Getty Images Start grilled hot dogs over low heat and finish them over higher heat. 2. Grilling This’ll give you great char marks and a nice smoky flavor. Turn on your grill. You want one side of your grill to be hotter and one cooler. Start cooking the hot dogs on the cooler side of the grill (this prevents the outsides from burning too quickly). Cook them for one minute on each side. Move the hot dogs to the hot side of the grill until they reach the color you desire. 3. Oven-Roasting This method is ideal if you’re making a big batch for a crowd. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Put hot dogs on a cookie sheet that’s been lined with foil (this makes cleanup super easy!) and cook for 15 minutes. They’ll sizzle and start to turn brown, so keep an eye on them until you get your desired outcome. 4. Microwave The folks at Leite’s Culinaria have shared an essential hot dog microwaving trick that uses a paper towel. To microwave a better dog, just wrap it in a paper towel before nuking for 30 seconds at 80% power. Covering it with a paper towel holds in the steam ensuring a plump, juicy dog. Easy and delicious.

Boiling Just don’t do it. As the folks at Nathan’s Famous say, “Honestly we just don’t recommend it. We didn’t back in 1916 when Nathan Handwerker started it all, and we still don’t today. When you boil a Nathan’s, all that special flavor rushes out into the water. And let’s be frank: who wants to eat a watered-down hot dog?” (But if you insist, you should bring your water to a rolling boil and cook the hot dogs for 5-6 minutes.)

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Igor Suka via Getty Images If you intend to buy it, what's the harm in taking a bite? Well ... Nutrition experts caution against grocery shopping when you’re hungry, but that advice relates to making healthy food choices. It has little to do with a different, more polarizing issue: snacking in the supermarket. As some people wander the aisles, they might grab a small bag of pretzels and start munching. Or maybe they eat a handful or two of grapes, just to “test the ripeness,” of course. Some do it, and others find it unfathomable. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); But as long as you intend to pay for the food, snacking while grocery shopping is no biggie, right? Well, i t depends on who you ask. Shoppers on X (formerly known as Twitter) find the common practice “ wildly irritating ” and, based on their use of an “ Abbott Elementary” meme , cringe-inducing as well. Under a video that shows TikToker @cecilybauchmann handing a cashier an empty food container after eating in a store, commenters are divided. Some say it is “embarrassing” and “feels so illegal,” while others believe that it’s no problem if you eventually pay for them. Advertisement But grocery store employees themselves are here to provide clarity on the practice. I’Talia McCarthy, the general manager of Dill Pickle Food Co-Op in Chicago, has worked in grocery stores since 2007. She says it’s acceptable to munch on nonweighted items (like a carton of Goldfish or a box of cookies) if you pay for them before you leave. That means you generally won’t get flak for cracking open a bottle of pop and enjoying it as you stroll through the bread aisle, she said. However, foods that interfere with other shoppers’ experience, such as those with strong smells or those that create a sticky, crumby mess for employees to deal with later, shouldn’t be consumed in the store, she added. From a legal standpoint, eating before you buy could be problematic. As private entities, grocery stores have the right to establish their own policies on consuming products prior to purchase, and if a store has a regulation against it, doing so could technically be considered theft, said C.L. Mike Schmidt , an attorney at Schmidt & Clark LLP. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “Until you’ve paid for an item, it still belongs to the store. It’s akin to using someone’s property without their permission,” he explained. “While this might seem trivial when it comes to a few grapes or a bottle of soda, the principle remains the same.” That said, not all supermarkets have these policies or actively enforce them, Schmidt noted. ugurhan via Getty Images Don't even think about leaving crumbs in the aisles. The best rule of thumb is to pay for your low-profile food or drink before you enjoy it, said Mary Mullally, the interim general manager of Hunger Mountain Co-Op in Montpelier, Vermont. “You can get a ‘paid’ sticker from the cashier and continue to eat and shop — that’s totally fine,” she said. Just make sure to clean up after yourself and throw away any trash; don’t place your wrapper on a random shelf or hand it to an employee and expect them to toss it, she added. It’s particularly important to pay upfront for weighted goods, such as produce and bulk-bin items, according to the co-op employees. It’s all right to sample one strawberry or grape in the produce department to choose the best container for your taste buds, but wolfing down half of a package before you head to the checkout is a major no-no, McCarthy said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “We’ll have lots of people be like: ‘Oh, well, I ate half of this bag of grapes before I got to the registers. Can you charge me for that?’ And we’re like, ‘Well, how do you know you ate half?’” she said. “Our cashiers will try and find a nice medium for the customers because we still want them to come [back]. But for the most part, we’re just like: ‘Try one or two. Please don’t eat the whole bag.’” Revenue loss from these incidents may seem insignificant for large grocery chains. But consider the effect on your small, local co-ops. For these markets, the loss incurred from shoppers eating weighted foods before purchase will ultimately impact the business owners in your community, Mullally said. Not to mention that taste-testing from various produce bags — which other people may have also rifled through — is unsanitary, and fruits and veggies in the store are generally not washed and ready for consumption, McCarthy said. (It’s recommended to rinse fresh produce under running water to remove dirt, bacteria, garden pests and residual pesticides.) The bottom line? Do your grocery store employees a favor and pay for your mess-free, low-key snack before you start scarfing it down. And if you really want to try an item before purchase, whether it’s a new trail mix in the bulk department, an interesting jam or a unique cheese, don’t be afraid to ask an employee for a sample. “We’re really happy to open up a product for customers if they haven’t tried something, for example, as a way for them to test it out and see if they like it or not,” Mullally said. “And there’s no obligation on their part to buy it.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); For more invaluable grocery store hacks and tips to save money while shopping, listen to HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast episode on grocery shopping .

    "article_content": "On Assignment for HuffPost In the ’90s, choosing a box of macaroni and cheese was simple: Kraft reigned supreme . It wasn’t the only brand on the market, but those blue boxes were synonymous with the neon-orange delight. Today, the macaroni and cheese landscape has vastly transformed. Options abound with well-known brands like Annie’s and Cabot Creamery going up against up-and-comers like Goodles. When it comes to choosing a boxed mac and cheese now, it can be a little overwhelming: Which one is both healthy and delicious? We spoke with experts to help figure that out. First things first: No matter how great a boxed macaroni and cheese may seem, it’s important to remember that it’s an ultra-processed product, said Cayla Bousaba , a registered dietitian in Richmond, Virginia. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “We still use it,” she said. “My family is like, ‘Oh my gosh, we have to eat something.’ At least add some protein to it and hopefully some fiber. The reality is, sometimes life makes it hard to avoid the delicious, typically affordable product (like, say, you have kids or you lack energy to cook yourself a full meal) — but it’s all about balance.” One way to boost the nutritional profile of boxed mac and cheese is by adding veggies to it (spinach or frozen peas incorporate nicely) or swapping out the milk with plain yogurt (which also makes it creamier). Proteins like chicken or tuna also kick it up a notch. “The important part is looking at the bigger picture, and if you’re serving mac and cheese, you want to serve it with other nutrient-dense foods, like a side of fruit,” said Charleston-based dietitian Lauren Manaker . “We don’t just want to eat mac and cheese all day every day with nothing else.” Here are the brands registered dietitians and nutritionists prefer to keep in their cabinets. HuffPost Googles, Banza and GoodWheat make macaroni and cheese. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Goodles Cheddy Mac Pasta: wheat flour with chickpea protein Protein per 1 cup prepared: 15 grams Fiber per 1 cup prepared: 7 grams Aimee Gershberg, a clinical dietitian at NYC Health , opts for this brand, which was founded in 2021. “Goodles has additional protein because they use chickpea protein in their noodles. That also gives them some more fiber,” said Gershberg. “It’s going to keep you satiated. It’s going to prevent you from overeating.” She also appreciates that the noodles have nutrients extracted from different vegetables like broccoli, spinach, kale and pumpkin. “It would be great to get those nutrients from foods, but for someone that might be a picky eater, or with little kids where it’s hard to get these nutrients into them, this would be a great product,” Gershberg said. Banza Shells And Classic Cheddar Pasta: chickpea Protein per 1 cup prepared: 16 grams Fiber per 1 cup prepared: 5 grams Gershberg also appreciates Banza, the brand known for its chickpea flour pasta. Not only does she like the texture of the pasta used in the macaroni and cheese, but it has other positive aspects, too. “I like that they have the protein and the fiber added in there. I think that’s something that’s missing from a lot of the different mac and cheeses,” Gershberg said. “Especially with prepackaged foods in general, it’s easy to miss out on some of those things.” GoodWheat Classic Cheddar Mac And Cheese Pasta: wheat Protein per 1 cup prepared: 12 grams Fiber per 1 cup prepared: 8 grams A mom to an 8-year-old, Manaker is no stranger to the various macaroni and cheese brands at the grocery store. While her daughter loves Annie’s, Manaker is a fan of fibrous GoodWheat , which makes its pasta with semolina flour produced from their specially grown breed of wheat , and she appreciates its protein content. “My daughter doesn’t eat a ton of meat, so that’s something that’s appealing to me. I also like that it has 8 grams of fiber and that fiber seems to hold her over, so she’s not asking for tons of snacks before bedtime,” Manaker told HuffPost. “She’s not eating the bean-based or the chickpea-based pasta as much as I would love her to. She just isn’t doing it. So this is a nice option that tastes very similar to the Kraft or the Annie’s with some extra nutrients that helps her feel more satisfied.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); HuffPost Jovial, Annie's and Kraft also make macaroni and cheese. Jovial White Cheddar Mac And Cheese Pasta: brown rice Protein per 1 cup prepared: 9 grams Fiber per 1 cup prepared: 2 grams For those turned off by the texture of chickpea pasta but looking for a gluten-free option, Boubasa suggested Jovial. “I’ve just found that some kids don’t always like the chickpea pastas and it had a really good texture for gluten-free,” she said. “It’s not as gummy.” The cheese blend for Jovial is also pretty simple, Boubasa found, which bumped up its favor in her eyes. Annie’s Cheddar Mac And Cheese Pasta: wheat Protein per 1 cup prepared: 9 grams Fiber per 1 cup prepared: 3 grams As a single mom to three girls, in addition to being a registered dietitian, Malina Malkani knows a thing or two about the convenience of boxed macaroni and cheese. “My girls love the rich cheesy flavor of the white cheddar versions of Annie’s and I love that the brand offers whole-grain macaroni options with more fiber and protein to help keep them satisfied and energized for longer,” Malkani told HuffPost. When she serves Annie’s, it’s usually not the only thing on the table, however. “Sometimes I prepare it as a side for dinner and pair it with baked chicken and a vegetable, or I’ll add peas and carrots and send it to school in a packed lunch,” Malkani added. Kraft Original Mac And Cheese Pasta: wheat Protein per 1 cup prepared: 9 grams Fiber per 1 cup prepared: 2 grams Are you surprised to see Kraft on a list of dietitian-approved macaroni and cheeses? As Gershberg points out, most of the “healthier” macaroni and cheese brands are pricier, which is why she wants people to know that if Kraft is the best box within reach, that’s totally fine. “There’s nothing wrong with Kraft or your basic mac and cheese. It’s not so much taking away those types of things, but maybe looking at what we can add to those. So if we can add some protein, if we can add some fiber with vegetables or another protein or something, then anything can be part of a well-balanced diet,” she said.

    "article_content": "On Assignment for HuffPost Getty Images You may not realize when smells are coming from your drain, not your garbage. Kitchens are inherently smelly areas. Whether in the midst of cooking, preparing to empty out the fridge, or simply getting ready to clean up after having made dinner, you are likely smelling something in your kitchen. Given all that, it’s important to note when a smell should be cause for concern. We spoke to experts about which odors could indicate that your food isn’t safe to eat, which ones can signal that the safety of your home is in danger, and which mean it might be time for an appliance upgrade. And even better, we got tips on how to eliminate those odors. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Rule No. 1: Not all cheese is supposed to smell. When dealing with leftovers, or even fresh produce or meat products, one rule tops them all: If it smells bad, throw it out. When it comes to cheeses, though, a food that’s inherently smelly, the guidelines aren’t as straightforward. According to chef Kevin Ashton , the culinary adviser at Restaurantji, there are three ways to determine whether cheese has gone bad: the presence of abnormal mold, a change in color, or a strong smell. He notes that identifying a bad smell is the best way to determine whether cheese is safe for consumption. “If a mild cheese such as American or Jack smells strong like Limburger or blue cheese, you should throw it away,” Ashton explained. “Naturally pungent cheeses like Camembert will have a relatively strong ammonia smell when they go bad.” Overall, Ashton says, if you are familiar with the scent of a specific cheese and the one you have smells “like a more concentrated version of what you’re used to,” then you should avoid eating it. But why, exactly? Well ... Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “Spoiled cheese can harbor different types of foodborne bacteria, each of which can cause specific illnesses,” Ashton explained, specifically mentioning salmonella, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Each bacteria may lead to different issues. Salmonella infections, for example, are “characterized by abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea and fever,” he said. These symptoms aren’t immediate but can take between six hours and six days to show up. They may last up to a week. “Escherichia coli can cause various forms of gastroenteritis, including hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS),” Ashton added. Symptoms of such illnesses include bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps and vomiting. In extreme cases, they may lead to kidney failure. Ashton says young children and older people are most at risk when it comes to E. coli. Pregnant women, newborns and the immunocompromised, on the other hand, are the category of people susceptible to listeriosis, which is caused by Listeria monocytogenes. “Symptoms include nausea, muscle aches, fever and diarrhea,” Ashton said. All things we’d rather avoid! Rule No. 2: If it smells like gas but there’s no fire, call the authorities. According to energy company ConEdison , if you smell an odor that is similar to rotten eggs or gas in your home, you should leave and call the authorities — particularly if you have a gas stove or oven in your kitchen. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “The reason for quick action is the possibility of a gas leak, which is always dangerous and can be life-threatening,” said Hendrik Van De Poll , co-owner of Service Force Plumbing in Rockville, Maryland. Keep in mind, though, that if you smell gas but your stove’s burner is on, the odor might actually be nothing to worry about, especially if it seems to be fading away. Getty Images A gas smell coming from your stove is more dangerous if there's not a flame turned on. Usually, the presence of a flame indicates that the gas is being burned. However, the smell could suggest a potential leak in the system. ConEdison advises turning off the burner, ventilating the area, checking for leaks and, of course, calling a professional no matter what. There might be other culprits behind the odor as well. “Another more innocuous reason for a rotten egg smell is sometimes the anode rod in your water heater reacting with the water from incoming city or well water connection,” Van De Poll said. If that’s the case, he suggests replacing the standard anode rod with an aluminum-zinc one that “does not have the same type of reactivity.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Rule No. 3: Check your kitchen drain. Sometimes, the unpleasant food-like odor may not emanate from your fridge but your kitchen drain. This usually happens as a result of a buildup of food particles, grease and other debris . “Food particles that accumulate in the kitchen drain will eventually turn into a clog if not addressed promptly,” explained Justin Cornforth , owner of Ace Plumbing in Anderson, South Carolina. “The smells coming from the kitchen drain indicate that it’s time to do thorough drain cleaning, which typically involves using an enzymatic drain cleaner. Enzymatic drain cleaner are effective and safe for pipes compared to off-the-shelf cleaners that contain harsh chemicals.” If you avoid using chemicals and enzymatic cleaners in your kitchen, you can pour some vinegar and baking soda into the drain, let it sit for a few minutes or even overnight, and then follow it with a pan of boiled water, Cornforth outlined. The process may work well as a preventive measure, dissolving minor clogs and buildup on the walls of a drain, so you might want to go through the process once a week. That said, Cornforth warned that bigger clogs might require more than the vinegar and baking soda mixture. If you just can’t seem to get rid of the odor, you might want to consider removing the drain completely and replacing it with a new one. “If the odors are caused by severe clogs or extensive buildup, cleaning products won’t help because they cannot penetrate or dissolve the thick layers of accumulated debris and decaying organic matter,” Cornforth said. He warns against trying your hand at the installation yourself, though. It’s best to reach out to a professional before doing anything. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); How to ward off kitchen odors before they get bad. The more you leave an unpleasant odor unattended, the harder it will be to find the source and get rid of it. Cesar Fernandez , the culinary manager at Miele Great Britain, has a few tips to keep in mind. When dealing with food-adjacent stenches — whether post-cooking or related to cheese gone bad, for example — it’s important to note that neutral odors can overtake stronger ones. “So, if you’ve finished cooking and you want to get rid of the smell, simple actions such as boiling water with some lemon or white wine vinegar or freshly brewing coffee will remove any other smells,” he said. Lemon is your friend even when trying to clean out an actually smelly kitchen device or product. “If you’ve used your microwave and there was a little accident with food splattering all over or even leaving a lingering smell if food had a strong smell, the only thing that you need to do is to place half a lemon with a little water in a bowl and microwave on a high setting for a few minutes,” Fernandez said. “Then, leave the door closed for at least 10 minutes, and afterward your microwave will smell like new all over again.” Overall, though, Fernandez says, the most reliable way to avoid a smelly kitchen is the use of a proper cooker hood. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “It’s very important that the ducting is the right one when maximizing for efficiency,” he said.

We consume almost 6 billion pounds of pasta per year, proving that a heaping bowl of noodles is one of life’s great pleasures. The shapes, sizes and sauce combinations are endless, from spaghetti to rigatoni to cavatelli. But are some shapes better than others? We interviewed Italian chefs nationwide on what you should and shouldn’t order when pasta cravings come calling. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); The Best Pastas To Order At A Restaurant Spaghetti Arguably the world’s most popular pasta shape, there’s a reason it’s a carb lover’s go-to. “Spaghetti is definitely the best to order at a restaurant because it is a world-renowned shape. Many restaurants make their spaghetti in-house because of how iconic the shape is, making it very high quality,” said Nadia Caterina Munno , a chef and author known as The Pasta Queen . It’s also incredibly hard to mess up when cooking. “I usually order a longer noodle pasta like spaghetti. They’re usually more difficult to overcook, and generally, there’s a little more sauce to work with,” said Craig Richards , chef and owner of Lyla Lila in Atlanta, Georgia. Advertisement Tagliatelle Cris Cantón via Getty Images Tagliatelle with tomato sauce. This northern Italian egg pasta is known for its long ribbon-like strands. Folklore says a chef created it to honor the golden locks of his soon-to-be-wife. Although history has since debunked that romantic tale, the pasta shape remains incredibly popular paired with meaty sauces like bolognese. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “Anything labeled tagliatelle will denote a hand-cut noodle. It is a great way of gauging a restaurant’s noodle quality and is generally worth the price tag because of all the labor and love that goes into it,” said Natalie Gullish , culinary director for the Sesame Collective in Portland, Oregon. Paccheri Eugene Mymrin via Getty Images Paccheri with eggplant, tomato sauce and burrata. Ancient grains take on a new meaning with paccheri. This large tube-shaped pasta can be traced back to early Neapolitan times when it was considered peasant food. “It holds a nice fresh tomato or bolognese beautifully, and the al dente bite is amazing and easy to execute,” said Joey Maggiore , executive chef of The Maggiore Group in Scottsdale, Arizona. Gianluca Gugliemi , executive chef of Donato & Co . in Berkley, California, echoes why paccheri is so beloved. “ I believe those cuts of pasta are very hard to overcook, so you will get your pasta al dente like the Italians prefer,” he explained. Radiatori DeCecco Store-bought radiatori from DeCecco . Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); This relatively new pasta shape was invented sometime between World War I and II. Its name comes from its shape, which resembles a radiator. This small, rippled pasta is a sauce magnet and ideal for a fresh summer pasta salad. “Radiatori is my favorite and arguably the most versatile,” said Michael Kramer , the chef/owner Jianna in Greenville, South Carolina. “It can work well with light sauces like for vegetables or seafood but also works well with heavy meatier sauces like a short rib ragu or a bolognese.” Cavatelli alvarez via Getty Images Homemade cavatelli. Believed to be one of Southern Italy’s oldest pasta shapes, cavatelli means “little hollows.” Take one look at its small caved-in shape, and you’ll understand why. When you see it on a menu, there’s one big reason chefs say you should order it. “This pasta can only typically be made fresh, so you know it’s house-made,” said David Gross , executive chef at Panzano in Denver, Colorado. “The pasta dough contains ricotta cheese and can be made with different flours to keep it adventurous. Soft in texture, this pasta can go with many different sauces.” Fusilli Lauri Patterson via Getty Images Fusilli with cheese sauce. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Meaning “little spindle” in Italian, this beloved Southern Italian shape is made from spaghetti strands rolled around a wire to dry. “Fusilli is a great pasta shape because its unique texture allows the sauce to coat it evenly, making every bite enjoyable and delicious,” said Barbara Pollastrini , executive chef of Restaurant Da Barbara in Los Angeles, California. Ideal in soups, pasta salad or with a creamy, buttery sauce, its adaptability is another reason it’s a go-to in Italian restaurants around the world. Tortellini roberto grigio / 500px via Getty Images Homemade tortellini. This legendary pasta shape traces its origins back to a small town near Bologna in the 1500s. Legend says it was created after an innkeeper spied on weary mythical guests Zeus and Venus, he shaped this pasta after Venus’ navel. It is the only stuffed pasta to make the list; chefs recommend it for a very specific reason. “I think the notion of stuffed pasta can be such a blank canvas for creativity,” said Dane Baldwin , the chef/owner of The Diplomat in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. “The tortellini can be such a great vehicle for the sauce or broth, getting caught in the crevices of the pasta shape, and when paired with a harmonizing filling, wow, that is true synergy.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The Worst Pastas To Order At A Restaurant Cappellini Also known as angel hair, this is a much thinner and more delicate form of spaghetti. But for diners, it’s almost always a letdown. Difficult to perfect in a busy kitchen, it’s often found to be overcooked and clumpy. “ Cappellini is used only in soup in Italy due to it being an extremely thin and delicate pasta,” said Marcellino Verzino , chef and co-owner of Marcellino Ristorante in Scottsdale, Arizona. “Because of this, when served with any type of sauce, the pasta can “glue” together, and it is impossible to keep its identity.” Penne Often seen gracing the kids’ menus or accompanied by an a la vodka sauce, its inclusion on the list of worst pasta shapes to order may surprise you, but chefs agree: It doesn’t hold sauce or its shape well. “This tubal-shaped noodle can often collapse for many different reasons, such as over-hydrated dough or not a long enough dry time,” Gullish said. Gnocchi This Northern Italian pasta is actually made from potatoes. While it’s meant to be light and pillowy, it’s often served to diners thick and starchy, resulting in an extremely filling bowl of pasta. “ While the ingredients are simple (flour, potato and egg), gnocchi is a challenge to make well and is often bought ready in a bag,” Gugliemi said. “Unfortunately, if not made fresh or with a skilled hand, gnocchi can be gluey and unpleasant to eat.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Related Restaurants dining out pasta Italian Chefs Share The Mistake Way Too Many People Make When Boiling Pasta Common Reasons Your Pasta Salad Sucks, And How To Fix It Are 'Healthy' Pasta Alternatives Really That Much Better For You?

    "article_content": "soulful vegan author/advocate Getty Images Not all breakfasts are created equal, but does it even matter? Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. You’ve heard it, I’ve heard it, my stomach’s heard it, too. But my stomach doesn’t care, and I’m not alone. According to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, a quarter of Americans skip breakfast . So what are we doing to ourselves? Well, it depends on whom you ask. A strong case for eating breakfast. According to Dr. Emily Cooper of Cooper Center for Metabolism, you aren’t doing yourself any favors by skipping breakfast. “When people skip breakfast, a good percent will start disruption in insulin secretion,” Cooper said. In other words, low blood sugar, which can cause fatigue, brain fog and “exaggerated emotional response,” also known as a crappy mood. Having a meltdown? Maybe you just need a smoothie, according to Cooper’s thinking. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); People have many reasons for skipping breakfast — they’re rushing to get out the door in the morning, they don’t have reliable food access or maybe, like me, their circadian rhythm is such that their ghrelin — that’s the hunger hormone — doesn’t kick in till later. Cooper doesn’t care. Skipping breakfast is a deal-breaker for her patients. She practices what she preaches. She’d already had “two pieces of good local bakery sourdough whole grain toast with tahini and apricot jam” and was enjoying a bowl of raisins before 7 a.m. when I spoke to her. That’s complex carbs, protein, iron and healthy fats. But not every breakfast choice wears that kind of halo. Sugary cereal and processed meats, for example, deliver calories but few nutrients. Even so, Cooper says bad breakfast beats no breakfast. “If you don’t get enough to eat early in the day, ghrelin levels rise later. Your body is trying to make up for all the stuff you’ve missed,” she explained. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); You’re hungry, even hangry, which can lead to making poor choices. You’re liable to grab something that gives you the immediate lift you need, maybe an iced Frappucino, extra whip. So here you are mid-morning, loaded with calories, fizzing with caffeine and sugar, but without enough nutrients to sustain you. You’re a hot mess for your 3 p.m. Teams meeting. Keep that roller-coaster pattern up, and, studies indicate, including one from Cleveland Clinic, you’re looking at potential weight gain and diabesity — obesity-caused diabetes. That morning toast sounding better to you? Iryna Veklich via Getty Images Caffeinated beverages have been shown to be good for brain health. Breakfast’s effect on your brain cognition. Dr. Jonathan Rosand has seen those studies, too. As co-founder of Massachusetts General’s McCance Brain Care Center and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, it’s his business to understand factors that may lead to depression, stroke and dementia. Does skipping breakfast make the list? When I spoke to Rosand, he had eaten his oats this morning but said it’s OK that I hadn’t. He said, “I don’t know. There’s not a lot of evidence” between missing breakfast and cognition. In other words, skipping breakfast won’t make me stupid. Unlike Cooper, he focuses not on the when but the what: “Getting more stuff that’s good for you — a diet rich in vegetables and leafy greens,” as well as other foods linked to brain health, including fatty fish, berries and walnuts, which are rich in omega-3s and — caffeine fans, rejoice! — coffee and tea. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Check in with yourself, Rosand advises. “How do you feel? Are you cloudy? Clear?” If you’re feeling fine, don’t worry. What about young people? But Rosand suggests that breakfast isn’t a bad idea for children, teens and anyone with health issues. Science backs him up on this . The American Academy of Pediatrics has found that kids who eat breakfast typically learn better at school, have fewer behavior issues and buck the teen obesity trend by maintaining a healthy weight. Despite that, many of Yasi Ansari’s younger patients regularly skip breakfast. For Ansari, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Los Angeles, it’s a concern. “The problem with not getting our needs met, especially in the adolescent years, is that it can lead to unhealthy eating habits, unhealthy relationships with food,” she said. “Not getting their needs met during this time period can also put individuals at risk of stunting their growth and not being able to perform their best in the classroom or out on the field.” But, she admitted, the data is inconclusive. When working with patients, she considers other factors: “ Are they meeting enough of their nutrition needs throughout the rest of the day? Do they make time for movement in their day? Are they getting enough sleep? Is there a work-life balance? What do foods at lunch and dinner look like?” Ansari advises eating “ at regular intervals,” but just as important is to “listen to what your body needs.” Rosand agrees. “L istening to your appetite — that’s helpful,” he said. “Much of what you’re inclined to do for your body is probably OK.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); What about intermittent fasting? Isn’t that supposed to be healthy? And now the big IF is intermittent fasting . This eating trend du jour indicates fasting, skipping meals or stretching out the time between them forces your body to work more efficiently, so you’re running on ketones and fatty acids for energy, not glucose (sugar). Most people choose to stop eating around 8 p.m. and not eat again until noon the following day, meaning they skip breakfast. Intermittent fasting isn’t proven for weight loss, but studies like one in the New England Journal of Medicine show it can benefit the body. It decreases the risk of major diseases, including diabetes, reduces inflammation, and potentially leads to living healthier and longer. JGI/Jamie Grill via Getty Images The American Academy of Pediatrics has found that kids who eat breakfast on average learn better at school, have fewer behavior issues and buck the teen obesity trend by maintaining a healthy weight. Does skipping breakfast mean you’re in the ketone-burning club? Quite possibly. And it’s the most common way to practice intermittent fasting. Just don’t tell Cooper. “I’ve never been a fan. All these kinds of trends people get into — nothing good comes of it. It doesn’t make metabolic sense.” What about breakfast skippers? If you’re a member of the breakfast-skipping tribe, you’re in good company. St. Thomas Aquinas wasn’t a morning meal fan either. He believed breakfast led to gluttony, one of your seven deadly sins, and was immoral. Pete Wells , the New York Times restaurant critic, doesn’t think breakfast is immoral, but he just doesn’t eat it. Stands to reason. He tastes food — a lot of it — for a living. It’s not what he wants to do on his time off. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); If you’re expecting a lecture from nutrition and public health expert Marion Nestle , guess again. Nestle doesn’t do breakfast, either. “I prefer eating when I’m hungry, and I rarely get hungry before 10:30 or later,” she said. As for all those studies talking about breakfast being the most important meal of the day, Nestle advises reading the fine print. Who’s funding the study? Money for The International Breakfast Research Initiative, an exhaustive database of breakfast patterns and outcomes, came from Cereal Partners Worldwide in the U.S. and Canada by General Mills. The decision is up to you. To eat breakfast or not to eat breakfast? “O ne of the challenges when counseling people on a diet is our all-or-nothing culture,” Rosand said. “That’s not how we live.” Do you want to start eating breakfast? Great! “Make small changes over the course of weeks, months,” Rosand added. “Look for ways to improve.” Still not sold on the benefits of breakfast? That’s fine, too. “The goal is to feel comfortable, take better care of ourselves,” Rosand said. “Let’s give ourselves a break.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Related Health Nutrition Breakfast Want To Avoid Food Poisoning?

    "article_content": "Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost Illustration: HuffPost; Photo: Getty If there was an “it girl” food of the summer, this year, a Caesar salad, a side of fries and a dry martini would easily secure the spot. As one viral meme about the restaurant order goes, “Are you depressed or do you just really need a dry martini, a Caesar salad and a side order of fries?” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Sometimes, people sub in a diet or regular Coke, but the salty, umami-laden Caesar, and the carby goodness of the fries are always the anchor of the meal. “The new live laugh love just dropped,” Vox writer Rebecca Jennings joked of the meme last week on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Advertisement new live laugh love just dropped pic.twitter.com/56CuqErubT — rebecca jennings (@rebexxxxa) May 30, 2024 On TikTok , a search for “Caesar salad and fries” yields more than 60.3 million posts with people ― mostly young women ― singing the praises of the “elite” meal: “The feminine urge to get a Caesar salad with a side of fries,” one women says while she eats in a clip that has over one million views . Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “I need an espresso martini, Caesar salad, truffle fries, and a forehead kiss with $10k and some peonies on the side. Nothing too crazy,” another woman joked on X . Why are we all collectively yearning for this relatively basic restaurant order? To some extent, it’s a continuation of Girl Dinner , the trend from last year in which women cobbled together a few items ― a little wedge of parmesan reggiano, some olives, some chips and salsa leftover from your last Trader Joe’s run ― and calling it a meal. (As some noted, some version of “Girl Dinner” has existed in other cultures ― tapas, mezze and banchan ― for centuries.) men will never understand the chicken caesar salad, diet coke and french fries combo — emily (@titosoatmilk) May 28, 2024 Like Girl Dinner, this trend is weirdly gendered . Old stereotypes die hard and salad is traditionally associated with women in the same way a good steak is associated with dudes. Though fun fact: In the post-war 1940s, there was a moment where salad-making was considered quite masculine , at least by some food writers. “A good salad maker must have meticulousness, patience, cleanliness and a very alert sense of touch and taste,” Mario Thomas, Playboy magazine’s food and drink editor, wrote in his column around that time. “For some reason, it takes a man to master this really fine art.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Also like Girl Dinner, the Caesar/cocktail/fries meal has cost-effectiveness going for it: Generally speaking, it’s cheaper to buy a side salad and side fry versus an entree. “I don’t want to spend $30 or $40 on a main I might not like and likely won’t fill me up,” said Emily Lycopolus , an olive oil sommelier and cookbook author. “If I’m out with a few girls, we’ll often order a few different salads (iceberg wedge, Caesar, Cobb), then share the fries, and then share a dessert,” she said. “We all get what we want, and the night can linger on.” Caitlin PenzeyMoog , the author of the book “ On Spice: Advice, Wisdom, and History with a Grain of Saltiness,” thinks people gravitate to the Big Three because the order is hard to screw up, even at mid-tier restaurants. “I’m talking about the mediocre gastropub restaurants that are ubiquitous,” she said. “The ones where you can always get a table, where maybe there’s a nice outdoor patio, where it’s not amazing but not terrible, and its main draw is convenience.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Restaurants like that may struggle to cook your burger medium rare, but they can generally throw french fries in a deep fryer and whip up a decent Caesar dressing, PenzeyMoog said. Stefania Pelfini, La Waziya Photography via Getty Images “The dressing is assertive so the salad feels like a main component of the meal rather than an afterthought, the fries dipped in some of that dressing is what dreams are made of,” said Laura Vitale, a cookbook author and host of the YouTube channel, “Laura in the Kitchen.” And obviously, there’s the flavor profile: This “meal” packs so many outsized flavors and textures, it puts in work to be your favorite order: the brininess of the martini’s olives, the umami and tanginess of the anchovy-forward Caesar dressing, the fattiness of the fries, the crunch of the croutons ― it’s got it all. “The dressing is assertive so the salad feels like a main component of the meal rather than an afterthought, the fries dipped in some of that dressing is what dreams are made of,” said Laura Vitale , a cookbook author and host of the YouTube channel “Laura in the Kitchen. ” “Plus, I don’t leave the table feeling overly stuffed, I always feel satisfied and the flavors always hit the spot,” Vitale said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); I love having a caesar salad and fries because it is objectively so unhealthy but i’m like wellllll there’s lettuce… it’s literally a salad umm health goddess!!! — ellie schnitt! (@holy_schnitt) May 6, 2024 The dryness of the martini pairs perfectly with this meal because it cuts through the fat of the salad dressing and the fries, said Skyler Mapes, the co-founder of EXAU Olive Oil and author of “ The Olive Oil Enthusiast.” “Gin also often has very earthy, peppery or even nutty flavors which pair perfectly with freshly grated parmigiano reggiano in the salad,” she told HuffPost. In short, it’s the epitome of balance . Love this ‘elite meal,’ but want to vary your summer salads up a bit? Chefs have ideas. Though she’ll never quit Caesars, Mapes has a similar meal she loves eating come summer: grilled eggplant (her southern Italian mother-in-law’s recipe), fresh whole Italian anchovies from a tin with fresh bread and butter, and an extra dirty martini with extra olives. “It’s so good for summer because everything can be eaten at room temperature and picnic style if you want to share,” she said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); If you’re looking to get adventurous, you could also do a tahini Caesar salad, said Edy Massih , a chef and owner of Edy’s Grocer in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and the author of “ Keep It Zesty: A Celebration of Lebanese Flavors & Culture from Edy’s Grocer.” “I’d do that with Aleppo sesame breadcrumbs, which adds a bit of spice and bigger flavor to an already perfect salad dish,” he told HuffPost. “I always pair it with some mezze dips and pita, and of course a martini, my go-to drink in any and all situations.” If you’re more of a whiskey person than a gin or vodka martini girlie, Lycopolus recommends subbing the Caesar for a wedge. “I love blue cheese, so I often go for a blue cheese wedge, yam fries and an old-fashioned,” she said. “Bourbon, the sweetness of yam fries, salty bacon and tangy blue cheese are so good together.” If she’s at a good Italian restaurant, Lycopolus said she’ll do a burrata or caprese salad, some Carpaccio (the meat dish usually has enough arugula on it to pretend it’s a second salad) and a Manhattan. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); ThePalmer/ 5PH / 500px / Moncherie / Getty Images Cookbook author Emily Lycopolus offered up an Italian twist on the meal of the summer: a burrata or caprese salad, some Carpaccio and a Manhattan. “The complexity of the sweet and dry vermouth is the perfect balance to creamy cheese, sweetly acidic tomato, salty parmesan, melt-in-your-mouth beef, bitter arugula, and that squeeze of lemon,” Lycopolus said. “I’d top both dishes with a healthy drizzle of beautifully fragrant olive oil, like a Tuscan Frantoio or Andalusian Picual,” she added. But of course, you could always keep it classic and just order a side of fries, a vodka martini and a Caesar. And you have extra reason to do so this summer: The humble Caesar salad ― invented on a whim in the 1920s by an Italian chef in Tijuana, Mexico ― celebrates its centennial this upcoming July 4 .

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Thomas Barwick via Getty Images Do you find yourself yelling across the table to your dining mates? It can affect more than just your hearing. Nothing quite ruins a nice night out like a meal where you have to shout to talk to your dinner mate. And as it turns out, there’s scientific proof that loud noises aren’t just drowning out your conversations — they may also be influencing your meal choices. “There’s not a very high level of awareness and education about what comprises a dangerous sound environment,” said Gregory Scott, founder of SoundPrint , a smartphone application that allows users to measure and track decibel levels (dBA) in public places. Dealing with hearing loss, Scott created the app after his own frustration of not being able to have conversations with people in public spaces. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); People have “never been exposed to sound level guidelines or they misunderstand them,” Scott noted. While he is not a health professional or researcher, SoundPrint data provides a snapshot of U.S. restaurants and other public spaces, including cafes and movie theaters. From the data collected in 2023, SoundPrint found that 63% of restaurants were too loud for conversation. SoundPrint categorizes the sound levels of public spaces in four categories: quiet (under 70 dBA), moderate (71-75 dBA), loud (76-80 dBA) and very loud (over 81 dBA), which means that a majority of restaurants tested with the app were categorized as loud or very loud. Advertisement Loud noise can have a deleterious impact on people’s hearing. The National Council on Aging reports 70 dB is the threshold for healthy sounds; below 70 dB is safe, over 70 dB can be harmful. 60 dB is a normal conversation and 120 dB is an emergency vehicle or saw mill. Researchers point to recent changes in restaurant architecture, where sound-softening curtains and fabrics are replaced with bare wood and walls that amplify sound. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); These loud restaurants and public spaces may cause long-term hearing loss for both customers and restaurant staff. But that’s not all. The sound has an impact on how you eat. Researchers over the past few decades have been studying the impact of sound — everything from music type, loudness and tempo — on food. “What we hear has a much bigger impact on our eating and drinking behavior than any of us realize,” said Dr. Charles Spence , head of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at Oxford University and pioneer of the field of gastrophysics, a growing area of interdisciplinary research that looks at physics and chemistry of food and cooking. “In some sense, [we are] being manipulated without our awareness,” Spence said. Studies have suggested that people tend to drink more in louder environments than less noisy ones. People drink more in a shorter period of time and increase table turnover, both of which can increase profits overall. That can have an impact on people’s health since people may consume more than they need. Similar studies with rats have shown comparable results. “If it’s very loud, it’s almost the opposite of mindful eating,” explained Dr. Qian Janice Wang , associate professor of consumer psychology at the University of Copenhagen. The louder music may distract people from how full they are feeling and cause them to consume more than they need or intended to consume. Overeating may be a way of dealing with the awkwardness of not being able to talk to your companion, Wang explained. Dorling Kindersley via Getty Images Quiet restaurants provide an environment where it's easy to practice mindful eating. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Another possibility is that the louder noise may result in shorter decision-making and may result in folks choosing unhealthier options, explained Dr. Anna Brytek-Matera , professor of medical and health sciences at the University of Wroclaw, Poland. And it can actually impact your sense of taste, too. But that’s only one part of the sound and food story. Further research has suggested that people may experience tastes differently based on the pitch of the sound. Spence noted the experiment where people try dark chocolate while listening to both high- and low-pitched music. With the higher pitches, people experienced the chocolate as sweeter; with lower pitches, the chocolate tasted more bitter. Findings like this could potentially influence people’s health; they could perceive something is sweeter with a high-pitched sound without having higher sugar content. Spence called the impact of sound on food taste “sonic seasoning.” That’s only a tip of the proverbial iceberg (lettuce). Other studies have shown other ways sound changes our perception of food, such as loud noises enhancing umami while decreasing other tastes , or that the type of music can impact the enjoyment of wine . Brytek-Matera also cited a study where people who listen to nature sounds were more likely to choose healthier foods over unhealthy ones. But sound may not be the only factor. One’s mood may also impact taste perception as well as individual preferences. Some people want noisier environments; Scott noted that some people used the SoundPrint app to find places that were noisy. Other senses besides taste and sound can also influence the meal, from the color of the plating, the feel of the food, as well as the smell. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); But there’s also room for more research in the field, such as looking at individual preferences, cultural and national differences. Brytek-Matera noted that there are some contradictions between studies that require further investigation as well. Some restaurants use “sonic branding.” While some people may not realize the influence of sound has on food, some chefs are paying attention. High-end restaurants have been integrating soundscapes with their food for a while now. For instance, Federico Rottigni’s Milan-based restaurant Sensorium has a tasting menu with a soundscape synchronized for the entire meal with music ranging from Icelandic rock, opera, nature noises and more. Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck restaurant in the U.K. served a dish called “The Sound of the Sea” where patrons were served a seafood dish along with a conch shell containing an iPod and headphones that play the sounds of the sea. Some high-end restaurants have gone the other extreme and are not playing any music, letting the food speak for itself. You can still enjoy your next night out. What can customers do to have a better night out? Consider using apps like SoundPrint to find quieter places or feel empowered to say something to management, who may not even know there is an issue, Scott said. He noted that the percentage of restaurants that were too loud did drop during the pandemic, from 67% in 2019 to 63% in 2023, but that’s still a majority of restaurants tracked on the app. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Other options include going to restaurants during off-peak hours or asking for a table that’s shielded from the noise, Spence suggested. Wang recommended figuring out what you want beforehand and/or setting a limit in terms of beverages consumed, which is probably a good strategy regardless of the sound environment. But it’s also OK to enjoy some level of noise. People’s expectations about an eating facility are also important. “If it’s a fine dining restaurant, there’s probably expectations around what you’re going to hear in terms,” Steve Keller , sonic strategy director at SiriusXM, said. “If it’s a bar environment, you have the expectation that you’re going to hear louder conversations. That’s part of the ambience that you actually like, and that’s OK too.” But like everything related to food, the old saying goes — everything in moderation. Sound, too.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Getty Images Coffee may have the opposite impact on your focus as what you intended. ADHD aside, sometimes concentrating long enough to finish a work or school task feels impossible. You sit down at your computer with the best of intentions only to end up toggling between 10 different tabs because your focus is anywhere except on the task at hand. Anxiety, depression, not getting enough sleep and boredom can all cause trouble concentrating. But diet can also play a role. When it comes to this connection, registered dietitian Yaa Boakye told HuffPost, “It’s important to remember that individuals have different reactions to food and could be dealing with underlying health conditions.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); With that disclaimer in place, there are some foods and drinks that scientific research shows can really mess with your concentration. Here, doctors and dietitians reveal the biggest culprits. 1. Pastries And White Bread If you have a big muffin or slice of toasted white bread for breakfast, you aren’t exactly starting the day with brain food. Neurologist Dr. Arif Dalvi shared that simple carbs — like the aforementioned examples — can lead to a blood sugar spike, which in turn can cause trouble concentrating. Boakye agreed, explaining that when blood sugar is too high or too low, it can cause trouble concentrating, and simple carbs can jump-start this unfortunate roller coaster. Advertisement Boakye explained that while glucose — a type of carbohydrate — provides energy to brain cells , when glucose is absorbed in the bloodstream quickly (which is what happens when you eat foods like pastries and white bread) it creates a blood sugar imbalance. Scientific research shows that a side effect of this imbalance is … yep, trouble concentrating. Here’s the good news: Boakye says you can still enjoy pastries and bread without worrying if they’re going to get in the way of your productivity as long as you pair them with a healthy fat and protein source. “Healthy fats and proteins mitigate the extreme effects simple carbohydrates can have on blood sugar,” she said. So pair your pastry or toast with some avocado and smoked salmon and you’ll be good to go. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); 2. Very Salty Foods Blood sugar levels aren’t the only thing that can cause trouble concentrating. Dalvi shared that salty foods can, too. That means if you have instant soup, french fries, potato chips, or a sandwich with cold cuts for lunch, you might struggle to power through the afternoon. Foods high in salt “can trigger an electrolyte imbalance,” he explained. When this happens, it causes inflammation in the brain , which can interfere with short-term memory and concentration. To avoid this from happening, stick to consuming less than 3,400 milligrams of sodium a day and remember it can creep up in surprising places , like salad dressings, condiments and processed cheese. Monalyn Gracia/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images Your bowl of canned soup may contain enough sodium to affect your concentration. 3. Soda And Sugary Drinks Some people reach for a can of soda for a jolt of energy, but the doctors and dietitians we spoke to all said this is one drink that’s bound to backfire in the concentration department. That is because it impacts the brain similarly to eating pastries, white bread and other simple carbs. “Sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and juice can cause rapid increases in blood sugar, followed by a decline in blood sugar. So while these drinks initially flood the brain with glucose, which theoretically would aid in concentration, the subsequent sugar crash negates this brief benefit and actually makes it harder for us to maintain focused concentration,” said registered dietitian Claire Rifkin . Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); If you want what you’re sipping on to work for you and not against you in the brainpower department, Dalvi says not to overlook regular old H2O. Fun fact: Water accounts for 75% of brain mass . “When you’re dehydrated, you’re disrupting the electrolyte balance in the body as a whole, including within brain neurons, so not staying well-hydrated can certainly affect your concentration,” Dalvi said. Even being just 2% dehydrated can negatively impact brain function . To keep your concentration up, aim to drink between 11.5 and 15.5 cups a day , depending on your gender and activity levels. 4. Coffee Coffee is another drink many people turn to — even depend on — for brainpower, but Dalvi and Boakye both say that too much can make concentrating worse. “There’s certainly a U-shaped curve with coffee. If you drink a little bit, it can make you more alert, but if you keep drinking more and more of it, the benefits fade,” Dalvi said, noting this is because too much caffeine can make someone feel jittery or anxious. Boakye said it’s important to remember that caffeine affects people differently. For some people, even a small amount of coffee can cause them to become jittery, which can then cause them to have trouble concentrating. 5. Foods You Are Intolerant Or Sensitive To If you’re eating anything that’s causing you to experience gastrointestinal issues, all the doctors and dietitians interviewed said that is bound to mess with your concentration. After all, dealing with diarrhea is pretty distracting. Dr. Kevin Cooke , an internal medicine doctor at Aviv Clinics, told HuffPost that one common culprit is dairy. “When someone with a dairy intolerance consumes dairy products, it can trigger an inflammatory response in the body. This inflammation may affect cognitive functions, leading to symptoms commonly associated with brain fog such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness and confusion,” he said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); If you experience gastrointestinal issues frequently and have a hunch that it’s food related but aren’t sure what the cause is, Dalvi recommends keeping a food diary, logging what you eat and how you feel afterward, including mentally. When it comes to diet and brainpower, Rifkin and Boakye emphasize that maintaining a balanced diet is key. This, both explained, will help prevent the blood sugar ups and downs that can come with just eating simple carbs and also ensure the brain is getting enough nutrients to function. Dalvi added to this, saying that brain cells need energy to function just like the rest of the body does. When you don’t get the nutrients you need, you’re bound to have trouble concentrating. So if you’re hungry, eat! Just make sure it isn’t something loaded with sugar or salt, or something that will give you tummy troubles. That way, your food really does serve as brain fuel and not something that will slow you down.

Rounded up here are some of the bestselling kitchen tools on Amazon right now — all under $30. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); 1 Amazon A food scale that makes measuring portion sizes easy There are so many reasons why a food scale can come in handy. One, it makes sure your measurements are exact — cooking is a science, after all, and precision matters. It also converts measurements for you, which is helpful if you’re following a recipe from a blogger or chef who lives outside of the U.S. It also means there are no measuring cups to wash when you’re done cooking. This one is a favorite for many because it’s small; it doesn’t take up too much kitchen counter space. The LCD screen is backlit so it’s easy to read, even if you aren’t standing right in front of it. Promising Amazon review: “I cannot say enough good about this scale. I purchased it for baking and feeding my sourdough starter. I have been using it for about a month now. It is simple and straightforward. You can toggle between grams, kilograms and ounces with the simple touch of a button and I love the tare feature for weighing new items you add to the weight of your mixture. I’ve recommended this scale to so many friends and will continue to do so. Such a great little scale at an affordable price.” — Amazon customer $9.99 at Amazon 2 Amazon A meat thermometer to ensure you don’t give yourself food poisoning Guessing if your meat is cooked enough is a game you definitely don’t want to play. Having a food thermometer on hand is the best safety tool you can keep in the kitchen. More than 69,000 Amazon customers have purchased this one for less than $13, with the vast majority giving it a perfect five-star rating. Promising Amazon review: “I had an old candy thermometer that I used to use that was my wife’s. It was bulky and took a long time to get up to temp. This thing gets up to temp immediately telling you what temperature your meat is at. The probe can be opened to various angles so it’s very ergonomic and comfortable to use. It’s also long so you don’t have to stick your hand right down by the fire. Also, something super simple, but very convenient is that it gives you the meat temperatures you need right on the unit itself so you don’t have to keep consulting your phone to see what temp you should be cooking your porkchop to. Great purchase at a cheap price for something that works extremely well. The numbers light up for easy reading also.” — Norb C $15.99 at Amazon 3 Amazon A stainless steel food scale If you're looking for another popular food scale, Amazon shoppers are straight-up obsessed with this option. More than 87,000 people have purchased and rated it and it has a cumulative rating of 4.7 out of five stars. Promising Amazon review: “This scale is incredibly easy to use! Place a container or plate or even plastic wrap on the scale before turning it on and then the scale automatically calculates the tare weight. All you have to do is put the food in or on whatever you put on the scale. You can easily switch between solid and fluid measurements, between ounces and grams. I am so happy I bought this. I can portion out meat, cheese and baking ingredients with ease. Takes some of the anxiety out of measuring. Love it!” — Wendy Elam $12.59 at Amazon Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); 4 Amazon An olive oil sprayer for grilling, roasting, baking and salad-making Having an olive oil sprayer makes it easy to cook with while also ensuring you don’t overdo it, cooking with too much oil. You can use this baby to spray your grill, a sheet tray full of veggies, skillet or on top of a salad before you dig in. It reduces the spills and splatters that often happen in the kitchen, cutting down on cleanup time. Promising Amazon review: “I've been using this for four months. I bought it when I got a new air fryer. This sprayer did not disappoint. I previously have purchased two oil misters that would clog and not work at all even though they were well-known brands. This sprayer still delivers a fine spray and I'm much happier with it than with previous misters. It is not a fine mist, but still a fine enough spray that I am not using too much oil in my cooking. I'm convinced that the fine mist sprayers just cannot be long-lasting because the oil ends up gunking up the nozzle eventually. I appreciate that this is also easy to disassemble and clean. I use vegetable oil but am about to buy another for olive oil now that I know how well it works.” — Wendallyn $8.20 at Amazon 5 Amazon A milk frother so you can make fancy coffee drinks at home Savoring a latte or cappuccino is a microjoy you deserve to experience every day. Romanticize your life by making a frothy coffee drink at home to sip on while you work, curl up on the couch or while you watch your kids. This frother has a powerful-yet-quiet motor and comfortable grip. Promising Amazon review: “This small device was a game-changer for me! I initially bought it to mix my powder supplements, which it did a pretty decent job. I first used it to froth my milk for my morning coffee and I was blown away by how that little change made my coffee taste way better! I initially had a slight issue with the product and a representative from the company reached out to me and made sure I was extremely happy with the product I received! They went above and beyond my expectations! Most companies these days sell you the product and could care less about you after. Not this company! That's a rare thing to find these days! Without a doubt I would recommend this product to anyone that is in need of it. So refreshing to have a company like this around, others should learn from them! A++ customer service! I will check out other products from them in the future!” — Daniel $7.99 at Amazon 6 Amazon An egg maker that’s a must-have for meal-prepping Eggs are a goldmine of nutritional benefits, packed with protein, omega-3s and vitamin B. Their versatility (you can incorporate them into virtually any meal) makes them a meal-prepping favorite. This egg cooker hard boils six at once. It can cook eggs in all sorts of other ways too, including scrambling, poaching and making individual omelets. You get to choose how runny or cooked you want your eggs too. Promising Amazon review: “I have an egg cooker and when my mom visited she fell in love with mine. So after she returned home I bought this one for her. She loves it and she tells me it makes the best poached eggs and great omelets, plus it makes the fastest hard boiled eggs ever. I have to agree. She is 90 years old and she says it is a very easy product to use and this one makes a sound when it's done cooking. I like that and may buy myself a new one because my old one does not make a sound when it is done. Also after cooking each time there gets this rusty looking stain where the water heats up and through buying this one I found out it's easy to clean with just a little vinegar. After having mine for seven years, vinegar cleaned mine up too. I saw the vinegar clean up in a video I watched when purchasing.” — Margaret J. $19.99 at Amazon Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); 7 Amazon Air fryer paper liners that eliminates cleanup Obsessed with your air fryer ? If so, you need these paper liners that will help keep your beloved cooking appliance clean, minus any scrubbing. You can get a pack of 100 for less than $12. Promising Amazon review: “These work great out of the box. I have put the food directly in them and there is no drainage/spillage. If I want the food to drain, I place this liner underneath the wire rack and put the food on the rack. It works great. If you do not have a wire rack, you can poke holes in the liner. This lets grease drip to the bottom and allows some to stay on the food and limits the cleanup to grease in the bottom without having bits that need to be scrubbed off.” — Lara $12.99 at Amazon 8 Amazon A veggie chopper that majorly cuts cooking prep time down Chopping veggies is often the most time consuming part of active cooking. Not anymore with this gadget on hand! It can chop, dice and even spiralize whole veggies in mere seconds. Right now it’s almost half off, making it the best time to buy it. Promising Amazon review: “We use this for all of our veggie cutting needs. It seriously is so convenient for meal prepping veggies for the week for salads. If I don't cut up veggies for the salads I probably won't end up using it. This makes the meal prep for the week 10 times easier and I am not dreading all the cutting. The bigger attachment is so nice for chopping up sweet potatoes or other veggies. It is so easy I don't think we will ever not have one. We had another brand but it felt so flimsy and broke quickly. This one is heavy duty and a great value for the price! It's super durable and 10 times easier to clean than the other brand we had. 10/10 I would buy again!” — Kayleb Bills $24.99 at Amazon 9 Amazon A can opener that’s easy to handle A good can opener is one of those kitchen tools everyone uses, but you never think about buying until you actually need it. If you’re in the market for one, go for the can opener that more than 15,000 Amazon customers swear by. It’s stainless steel, has a comfy grippy handle and cuts smooth so you avoid coming into contact with any jagged edges. Promising Amazon review: “I’ve had electric can openers, but lately most of my cans have pull tops and don’t require a can opener. It seemed like a waste of counter space for an electric can opener to sit there doing nothing. This manual can opener is really easy to use, grips the can top tightly, and the extra padding ensures that the key wind grips easily and turns well. The handle is comfortable for my old arthritic hands and I like everything about this implement.” — Amazon customer $9.67+ at Amazon Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 10 Amazon Dishwasher-safe kitchen shears These kitchen shears can be used for everything from cutting herbs to breaking down poultry. This pair is sharp; it can handle some thick foods and food packaging. They’re also dishwasher safe, so you can properly clean them without worrying about them rusting. Promising Amazon review: “I purchased a two-pack of these, and they're great, considering the price! The handles are solid and not in danger of sliding off like some cheaper brands. The shears are sharp, and can handle medium-duty cutting. I love that the sheath clicks on snugly so it stays on even after being knocked around inside the kitchen drawer. I wash them in the dishwasher in the open position and carefully point it away from me so I can retrieve it safely. So far no signs of rust, and the joint has yet to loosen up, two things cheaper scissors always seem to do.” — Amazon customer $8.99+ at Amazon 11 Amazon High-tech salt and pepper shakers This set of salt and pepper shakers makes standard sets look like an antique relic. It allows you to control the coarseness you want and freshly grinds as soon as you flip it over. Promising Amazon review: “I have purchased several salt and pepper grinders over the years but I never found one that was easy to load and wouldn’t cause my wrists to cramp from constantly grinding. Then I found these beauties and everything changed. Just load the batteries, put in some salt or pepper and turn the grinder upside down. Then you have instant ground salt or pepper. And it only takes seconds to have enough. These look great in the kitchen or on the dining room table. They are easy to load with salt and pepper. The only downside I have found is each grinder requires six AAA batteries so you may want to purchase batteries also as the grinders do not include them. Happy cooking!!” — Amazon customer $19.99 at Amazon Related shopping cooking kitchen 42 Things That’ll Prove You Don’t Need To Renovate Your Kitchen To Make It Look Nicer Just 41 Very Nice Things For Your Kitchen 34 Cool Kitchen Products You Probably Haven't Heard Of Yet Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up An essential daily guide to achieving the good life Subscribe to our lifestyle email.

    "article_content": "Staff Writer RichLegg via Getty Images You don’t need a cafe-level setup to make quality iced coffee and cold brew at home. In fact, a coffee expert recently spilled the beans on a surprisingly simple trick to upgrade your morning cup. In a recent interview with HuffPost, expert barista and coffee consultant Laila Ghambari recommended storing your brewed coffee in a well-sealed container, so your other food can’t contaminate the flavor. “If you have fish sitting in your refrigerator, it will permeate and get into your coffee,” she said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Whether you’re making hot coffee that’s going in the fridge or doing the barista-approved “ flash brew ” method, Ghambari (who won the United States Barista Championship in 2014) says to get your coffee in the fridge quickly (after it’s completely brewed) to ensure freshness. You’ll also want to drink your iced coffee soon after you make it, as “[f]resh-brewed coffee is going to have the most intense aromatics.” If you want your cold coffee to last through the week, Ghambari recommends making cold brew (which is easier than you think). It requires steeping grounds in room temperature water overnight, then storing the coffee in a sealed container. To help you upgrade your home ice coffee and cold brew, we rounded up some highly-rated sealed containers and cold brew brewing vessels that also work as containers.

It also works for hot coffee, keeping that warm up to 24 hours. The bottle is made from vacuumed stainless steel that's easy to clean and looks sharp in the fridge. The opening is wide enough to fit most ice cubes inside and the handle makes it easy to carry and grab. Promising review: \"Not only did I get a lot of compliments, but I also recommend S'well to everyone. This bottle keeps my drink cold, not to mention it doesn't break on impact (I'm super clumsy).

The Ovalware RJ3 cold brew maker whips up four cups of coffee with a verticle brewing container that goes inside the carafe.

Their customer service is fantastic, I making the whole experience even better.\" — VC $39.99 at Amazon 5 Amazon A mason-jar style cold brew maker This adorable container looks like a vintage mason jar but actually is a dishwasher-safe, easy-brew cold brew maker. It has thousands of 5-star reviews and is a top seller here at HuffPost, probably because it's good-looking and super functional. Simply put, your ground beans in the filter, pour in water, let it brew, then take out the beans and filter and you're good to go. The leak-proof lid will keep your drink fresh and the handle makes it easy to pour from. Promising review: \"The absolute best purchase!!! Easy to use, great quality, great value for what you pay.

When we previously spoke to Hugh Morretta , co-owner of Rowhome Coffee in Philadelphia and Coffee Quality Manager at Peet’s Coffee, he said: \"I just weigh out maybe 50 grams of coarse ground coffee into a Chemex filter and tie it with a string, creating a kind of tea bag. Then I’ll place the bag in a Mason jar with water. I weigh the water in the jar to make sure it’s five times the amount of coffee. Let the coffee tea bag steep in the Mason jar overnight on the counter for about 8 hours.\" Other baristas also suggested using cheesecloth , disposable cold brew bags and even traditional coffee filters with rubber bands for a similar result. Promising review : \"We’ve used these for flower arrangements originally and once we started making cold brew coffee we realized how perfect they were. No leaking , the seal is great, I’m about to clean inside the jar with my hand instead of multiple brushes.

Tanner Colson, owner of Colson Coffee previously said when making cold brew in a French press, \"All you need to do is add your coffee grounds to the French press and pour in room temperature water. Then you add the lid on without pressing the mesh filter press down. Let it steep for 12-18 hours, and then you can press and serve!\" Promising review: \"This is my favorite cold brew press yet!

    "article_content": "Head of Life and Commerce Amazon Look how little space this takes up on your counter. Culinary school successfully brainwashed me to believe that when it comes to blenders , Vitamix reigns supreme. And in many cases, that’s true ― especially if you’re blending things in large batches. But if you primarily use your blender for single servings of smoothies , you’re well aware of how much space a dirty blender container takes up in your sink, taunting you as you procrastinate washing it. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); If only there were a tiny blender that could whip up smoothies in single batches! With a dishwasher-safe jar! And imagine if that blender jar could flip upside down, transforming into the cup from which you drink your smoothie! And then imagine if there were a lid you could screw on top, so you can take your smoothie with you to go. Good news: There is one. You can get it for under $90 right now , and I own two of them. $89.99 at Amazon (Regularly $119.99) $89.99 at Target (Regularly $119.99) I’m always skeptical of anything with the word “foodie” in the name, but a couple years ago I tried out the Ninja Foodi Smoothie Maker and Nutrient Extractor . I expected very little, but from the moment I gripped the suction cups of the machine’s tiny base to my countertop and turned it on, I could feel the blender’s sheer force as it sent vibrations through my entire kitchen. Air shot out of the bottom, sending random garlic peels flying across the countertop. And when the smoothie was finished, my protein powder was whipped into a delightful cloud and the seeds from the raspberries were so highly pulverized, they were nearly undetectable. I was sold. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); This particular model takes up just a few inches on your countertop, and it comes with a host of attachments and whirligigs that can make not only smoothies, but frozen smoothie bowls, pestos and nut butters, just to name a few examples. And frankly, I’ve been preferring the Ninja over my Vitamix for all these uses. I love it so much, I bought a second one to keep at my mom’s house for when I’m visiting. If you’re making a smoothie or a frozen bowl (an acai bowl , for example), there’s absolutely no guesswork involved ― just press the corresponding button on the machine, and it knows exactly how long to blend it ― the machine will turn off when it’s done. (Just one warning: the machine isn’t quiet!) But if you want a more manual option, the “pulse” button allows you to control exactly how long the blender runs. When it’s time to clean up, it couldn’t be easier ― just fill the blender jar halfway with water and a few drops of soap, and turn it on for a few seconds. It’ll come out perfectly clean after a quick rinse, and you’re good to go. If you or someone you know is constantly complaining about cleaning a giant blender, or simply can’t manage to get the chunks out of smoothies, I highly recommend this one, even though I still don’t like the name of it. And Amazon and Target reviewers agree about its performance. Although it’s currently sold out at Amazon, it is on major sale at Target right now for $30 off. Ninja Foodi Smoothie Maker and Nutrient Extractor Amazon Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); This tiny blender will almost literally blow you away. It has a 4.6-star rating at Target and a 4.5-star rating at Amazon. The set contains a 14-ounce smoothie bowl maker with built-in tamper that easily powers through frozen ingredients, two 24-ounce nutrient extraction cups to blend smoothies and other liquids, plus lids for all three containers. The 1,200-peak-watt motor has suction cups at the bottom to firmly attach to your countertop, and offers six programs for one-touch blend, pulse, smoothies, extractions, bowls and spreads. To make life even easier, all the parts (aside from the motor) are dishwasher safe. $89.99 at Amazon (Regularly $119.99) $89.99 at Target (originally $119.99) Promising reviews: “I bought this blender about 9 months ago - after I had already bought - and returned - FOUR other blenders. All but one of those other blenders had significantly more wattage - 1400, 1800, and even 2200 - but NONE could handle blending my smoothies as well as this one ! Not only that, but this model is far more compact and lightweight than all the others - some of which were quite heavy. So this Ninja is easily storable in the cabinet and takes up little room.” — Batlady at Amazon “I purchased this back in the spring of 2021. I had tongue cancer and could only do smoothies once I started eating again. I used this a few times a day for months. Then I had issues with my jaw due to radiation and had my mouth wired shut, then a full jaw replacement. For the first 6 months of this year, I could have nothing but smoothies. I used this at least 5X a day. Now I use it twice a day. Still going strong. I love this smoothie maker!!! It blends up ice, ice cream, even used it to purée up soups. I highly recommend this product. ” — Tiffany at Target “ Nothing could’ve prepared me for how powerful this blender was . Decided to buy this as I needed a new blender. Am shocked at how powerful this thing is. ... Super powerful was actually almost a little scared haha. It is loud though but what blender isn’t and that’s fine with me. It has suction cups on the bottom so it stays in place really nicely . It also has its own self timer/ setting for smoothies so can walk away and let it do it’s thing. No annoying missed chunks that didn’t get blended. Super quick.

As we approach the official start of the season, another beverage has emerged to compete for the title. A fairly simple but perfectly balanced cocktail called the batanga might be the next hot summer cocktail, with fans ranging from TikTok-famous bartenders to the team at Martha Stewart . Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); So what exactly is a batanga, and what makes it worthy of being the drink of the summer? We asked some cocktail experts to break it down. What is a batanga? “The batanga is a simple yet refreshing cocktail made with tequila, fresh lime juice and cola, served in a glass with a salted rim,” said bartender Lynnette Marrero, who is a partner and chief mixologist at Delola and co-founder of the speed bartending competition Speed Rack . Advertisement To make a batanga, you must first cut a lime and use a wedge to coat the rim of a highball glass before dipping it in salt (some versions call for an added pinch of salt directly in the glass). Next, squeeze fresh lime juice into the glass and add ice and tequila blanco. Top it off with cola and stir to combine. While the recommended ingredient portions vary depending on who you ask, we found many bartenders go with half an ounce of lime juice, or the juice of half a lime, and about 2 ounces of tequila blanco. One of the benefits of this drink is that you can tweak the ratio to your personal taste without compromising its overall identity. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Many describe the batanga as a take on a cuba libre with tequila instead of rum or a paloma with cola instead of grapefruit. The concoction is also sometimes called a charro negro, though the batanga differs in its specific inclusion of salt. Aficionados also recommend using Mexican Coke in keeping with the cocktail’s origins in the Jalisco region of Mexico. “The batanga is a very famous cocktail in the town of Tequila, and it was created by Don Javier Delgado Corona, who was the founder of La Capilla,” said Steffin Oghene, the vice president of international sales at El Tequileño . Frequently named one of the world’s best bars , La Capilla is the oldest cantina in Tequila, and it was there in 1961 that Corona served his first batanga ― made with tequila blanco from the nearby distillery El Tequileño. Another important feature of the batanga is the way it’s mixed. Corona famously stirred the ingredients with the same bar knife he used to cut the limes, infusing extra flavor into the cocktail. According to some accounts, that same knife was also used to cut tomatoes, onions, peppers and avocados for salsa and guacamole. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The batanga is in the “changuirongo” category of cocktails, a Mexican term referring to tequila mixed with any type of soda and sometimes citrus. As for the name, batanga was slang for “stocky” or “thick in the middle,” and the cocktail’s inventor reportedly drew inspiration from an inside joke involving a certain rotund friend, the glass used to serve the drink and/or a type of canoe. Although he passed away in 2020 at the age of 96, Corona’s family has continued the tradition of the batanga. “For all the global bartenders, tequila lovers and tourists who go to the town of Tequila, it’s a right of passage to have a batanga,” Oghene said. Courtesy of El Tequileño Batanga inventor Don Javier Delgado Corona used tequila blanco from the local distillery, El Tequileño, for his drink. Its reach beyond Mexico has been rapidly expanding in recent years. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Why is it having a moment? “Much like the paloma variation of tequila, citrus and sweet soda, the ‘changuirongo’ style cocktails reached peak popularity in the 1940s and throughout the midcentury,” said Bradley Thomas Stephens , vice president and education chair of the United States Bartenders’ Guild board of directors. More than six decades after its invention, the batanga remains a changuirongo staple for many. “It’s such an iconic cocktail within the town of Tequila,” Oghene said. “It tastes really great, and on very hot days, it’s very refreshing and delicious.” Although the batanga has long been famous with Tequila locals, the cocktail’s reach beyond Mexico has been rapidly expanding in recent years. “The drink has been popular in Europe and other regions around the globe since the ’90s, but has never fully reached the American fame it deserves,” Stephens said. “Recently, there has been a spike in American bartenders discovering the drink, and even a tequila brand named Batanga on shelves in many states in recent years. There is a strong chance many of us will start seeing variations on menus soon.” There are many potential reasons for this spread of batanga awareness. Perhaps the Coca-Cola and tequila lobbies are cornering the TikTok market, or maybe we’re just seeking an uncomplicated alternative to all the expensive, elaborate cocktails out there. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Tequila is having a major moment, and its growth and popularity have continued to soar,” Marrero said. “Naturally, more and more consumers will turn to classic cocktails featuring the spirit.” For novice mixologists dabbling in at-home cocktails, perfecting tequila-based drinks like margaritas might require a bit more work. But Marrero believes the batanga offers an easier alternative. “The batanga is simple, requires only a few basic ingredients and it’s incredibly simple to make,” she said. “The rise of better-for-you colas and craft ‘soda’ can also contribute to this growth.” Marrero pointed to an increase in tequila lovers traveling to Jalisco as well. “These trips often include visiting La Capilla, the bar where the batanga was created, resulting in the passing on of the cocktail to a wider audience,” she said. The travel aspect speaks to a larger interest in food and beverage traditions from other cultures. “People like stories ― they like history, they like heritage, and this drink has a lot of history and heritage,” Oghene said. “And it’s a favorite amongst locals, so people want to be involved in that experience.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Related drink cocktail beverages The Next 'It' Cocktail Has A Rather Raunchy Name Is It Rude To Send A Cocktail Back?

The no-frills method gets the job done, sure. But if you want to get the most out of your caffeinated beverage, you’ll need to put a bit more forethought and effort into your technique. Here, professional baristas share the mistakes you’re making when creating iced coffee at home — and what you should do instead for a balanced brew. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); 1. You’re Using Too Much Water With any iced coffee, the ice in your beverage will inevitably melt, leading to a diluted drink that may taste too weak, too watery, too warm or a combination of all three, said Kathleen McCarthy , a corporate trainer at Lavazza. The good news: You can reduce the odds of this unpleasant drinking experience by accounting for ice melt during the brewing process, she said. To do so, brew your coffee with a stronger grounds-to-water ratio. The typical recommendation is 1 gram of coffee to 16 grams of water, but when you’re planning to drink your coffee iced, use a slightly stronger ratio of 1:12 or a double-strength 1:8, McCarthy suggested. That way, your beverage will still taste strong even when the added ice begins to melt. Advertisement Make sure you’re not using too little water while brewing, either, which could lead to a sour cup. 2. You’re Pouring Hot Coffee Over Ice Compounding the dilution problem is the common practice of pouring a freshly brewed cup of joe directly over ice — without allowing it to cool first. “If your hot brew is poured directly over ice, that simply adds more water to your ratio when the ice melts,” leading to a weaker drink, McCarthy explained. Instead, chill your coffee in the fridge before you pour it over ice. Just know that your final beverage could still be diluted if you aren’t adjusting the strength of your grounds-to-water ratio, too. “The ice will eventually melt and, depending [on] how quickly you drink, the last half or so of your cup could be watered down,” McCarthy said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); RyanJLane via Getty Images Don't pour your hot coffee directly over ice. Give it a chill in the fridge first. If you simply can’t wait for your coffee to cool, swap your traditional ice cubes with coffee-based ones; fill an ice cube tray with coffee and freeze. When used, your beverage will stay cold without the risk of it becoming watered down, McCarthy said. The one exception to this rule: You’re making a flash brew, a favorite iced coffee method for two of the baristas we interviewed. You’ll brew your coffee — the pour-over and AeroPress techniques are most commonly recommended, but a drip machine works just fine — with less hot water than usual. You might brew with just two-thirds of the water you typically use. Then, replace the remaining one-third of water with ice, McCarthy explained. You can brew directly into your glass filled with ice or add the ice to your coffee later. “This is my preferred method because it doesn’t require any advanced prep and thought like cold brew does, and unlike a standard brewed hot coffee poured over ice, it won’t be diluted or weak,” McCarthy said. The final beverage won’t be incredibly cold, but the flash brew method is ideal for satisfying that iced coffee craving quickly, said Laila Ghambari , the 2014 United States Barista Champion . Plus, compared to other iced coffee techniques, “ it locks in the aromatics and results in a much more flavorful coffee,” she said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); If your standard brew ratio for hot coffee is 1 gram coffee to 16 grams water, adjust it to: 1 gram coffee to 12 grams water to 4 grams ice. You might brew 20 grams of coffee with 240 grams of hot water and serve it over 80 grams of ice, for example, McCarthy suggested. 3. You’re Storing Your Brewed Coffee Wrong Don’t just pop a glass filled with java into your fridge and wait an hour or two for it to chill. Coffee stored in an open container will inevitably take on some funky flavors, Ghambari said. “Even if you have fish sitting in your refrigerator, it will permeate and get into your coffee,” she added. Instead, pour your brew into a sealed vessel — and avoid leaving it on the kitchen counter, where it’s likely to mold more quickly than the cool fridge, Ghambari explained. 4. You’re Leaving The Coffee In The Fridge Too Long Before Using It Even if your brewed coffee is stored properly, you’ll want to use it soon after it cools. “The longer your brewed coffee sits before you drink it, the more it will acquire stale flavors,” McCarthy said. “The longer your cup of coffee sits, the more the natural oils present in your brewed coffee will develop unpleasant and potentially even rancid flavors.” Not to mention, aromatics contribute heavily to your drinking experience, Ghambari added. “Fresh-brewed coffee is going to have the most intense aromatics, and so the fresher is probably going to result in the better taste,” she noted. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Can’t be bothered to brew a fresh batch every day? Try prepping cold brew instead. The coffee is brewed at a cool temperature, so it doesn’t oxidize as quickly, develops fewer acidic flavors, and can be stored for one to two weeks without a significant change in taste, McCarthy said. 5. You’re Using the Wrong Brew Method For Your Flavor Preferences Each brewing method brings out a different flavor profile in your coffee. The pour-over technique tends to result in clearer, lighter coffee that’s typically best for lighter roasts and more acidic, fruity flavors, McCarthy said. Use this method if you’re searching for a refreshing flavor profile or you’re in the mood for a fruitier drink, McCarthy recommended. It may particularly appeal to folks who enjoy their iced coffee black, she noted. Make sure to wet the filter before adding your grounds (then dump that water out of your vessel) to remove any stray dust or paper particles and unpleasant paper taste, added Yoshawn Smith , the 2023 Barista League Champion and a barista with Califia Farms and Patria Coffee Roasters. The French press, however, generally produces coffee with a full, heavy body, so it syncs best with darker roasts and chocolatey, intense flavors, McCarthy said. This brewing technique will give you a strong coffee base that can be softened with milk and ice, she said. The Bottom Line The general advice for delicious coffee-making still applies to the iced beverage: Make sure your coffee is used according to the roast date for the best result, brew with filtered water, and stay focused so you don’t forget pulses for your pour-over or miss the time to plunge your French press or AeroPress, Smith said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); As you fiddle with your brewing practice, McCarthy suggested making just one change at a time; that way you can tell what’s actually improving your cup. Treat it like a science project and even take notes if you feel inclined to. Your perfect cup should be something you can enjoy and replicate on a daily basis, she added. Remember, making iced coffee shouldn’t be a stressful experience. “Experiment a little bit and find that perfect method for you,” Smith said. “Taste and smell are subjective, and with that being said, enjoy your iced coffee any way you like to. It’s yours, no one can tell you how to enjoy it but yourself.” Want to make a batch of iced coffee? These are our favorite tools.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Much of the cultural discourse around this time of year revolves around the “song of the summer,” as music lovers debate which new ditty will follow in the footsteps of hits like “Despacito,” “Butter” and “In My Feelings.” (For the record, my vote is Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso.”) But the warm weather also ushers in another important superlative in the food and beverage world: “drink of the summer.” It seems every year there’s a particularly delicious cocktail that the masses crave as they enjoy the season of outdoor bars, backyard barbecues and fabulous vacations. To inspire your seasonal sipping, we’re looking back at some of the cocktails that have been dubbed “drink of the summer” in recent years (and a couple of current contenders). Cheers! Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Batanga (2024) Illustration: HuffPost; Photo: Getty Images This zingy cola-based cocktail is vying for the title of 2024′s drink of the summer. The batanga is a refreshing drink made with fresh lime juice, tequila blanco and cola, served in a highball glass with a salted rim (and occasionally a pinch of salt directly in the cocktail). Advertisement The simple yet perfectly balanced libation is often compared to a Cuba libre with tequila instead of rum, or a paloma with cola instead of grapefruit. Although the ratios can vary, many bartenders stir half an ounce of lime juice and 2 ounces of tequila blanco in a tall glass filled with ice before filling the rest with cola. As the story goes, the iconic bar owner Don Javier Delgado Corona invented the batanga in the 1960s in the town of Tequila in Jalisco, Mexico. That’s why aficionados recommend using Mexican Coke and tequila blanco from the distillery El Tequileño to make a truly authentic version. Crucially, Don Javier also stirred his signature cocktail with the same bar knife he used to cut the limes, infusing extra flavor. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “People like stories ― they like history, they like heritage, and this drink has a lot of history and heritage,” Steffin Oghene, the vice president of international sales at El Tequileño , told HuffPost. “And it’s a favorite amongst locals, so people want to be involved in that experience.” Porn Star Martini (2024) Costi Moculescu/Getty Images Another cocktail that people have heralded as the defining drink of summer 2024 is the porn star martini . Despite its name, the beverage is not a true martini at all, but rather a very sweet concoction served in a chilled martini glass. The ingredients are: Two ounces of vanilla vodka, half an ounce of passion fruit liqueur, half an ounce of fresh lime juice, half an ounce of vanilla syrup and an ounce of passion fruit puree. The drink is traditionally accompanied by a decadent shot of chilled prosecco or champagne. Invented by London bartender Douglas Ankrah in 2002, the porn star martini has experienced waves of popularity across Europe, but recent years have elevated the cocktail to new heights of notoriety. Perhaps the raunchy, conversation-starting name as something to do with it. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Now it’s definitely catching on here in the U.S. ― just like how the espresso martini made its comeback,” said Adam Delaney, a cocktail and bar consultant and beverage director at John Sparr Tavern in Glendale, California. The Hugo (2023) Dulin via Getty Images Also known as a Hugo spritz, the Hugo was the prevailing choice for summer 2023′s signature cocktail. Exact ratios vary, but this refreshing beverage is often made with four ounces of prosecco, half an ounce of elderflower liqueur (usually St-Germain), two ounces of soda water and fresh mint, and is served over ice. Some also garnish with lime and/or add a dash of gin. “While it is technically an aperitif, and intended to be sipped on before a meal, it is easily enjoyed at any time, especially dining al fresco in warmer months,” cocktail expert Rysse Goldfarb told HuffPost last summer . Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); A lighter answer to the bitter Aperol spritz, the Hugo was reportedly invented around 2005 at a bar near the Austrian-Italian border. The cocktail quickly spread throughout Europe, and finally made a splash in the U.S., amid the rise of low-ABV drinks and renewed zest for international travel after the pandemic. Dirty Shirley (2022) The Rooftop at The Wayfarer Summer 2022 was a big time for the Dirty Shirley ― a grownup take on the Shirley Temple. Named for the non-alcoholic drink (named for the iconic child star), this cocktail offers a way to get tipsy while getting in touch with your inner child. Although there are many variations, the basic gist is you take the traditional Shirley Temple (8 ounces of ginger ale or lemon-lime soda, plus 1 ounce of grenadine and a maraschino cherry, over ice) and add a shot or so of vodka. “It’s a big seller with the 25-to-35 age demographic, I think because it’s nostalgic, fun and just flat-out tastes really good,” mixologist Lauren Pellecchia told HuffPost in 2022. “It’s not a serious drink, and after the last few very serious years we all deserve some lightheartedness. A Dirty Shirley is something that anyone can make at home and confidently order out at the bar — which is not always the case for other drinks that have been popular over the past few years.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The sweet but refreshing drink is a crowd pleaser, but if you aren’t a fan of vodka cocktails, you can opt for a version with dark rum and call it a Shirley Temple Black (a nod to the child star’s married name). Espresso Martini (2021) Juan Moyano via Getty Images Following the exhaustion and burnout of life amid the COVID-19 pandemic, perhaps it is unsurprising that many people were craving the jolt of an espresso martini in 2021 . That summer, the New York Times declared, “The espresso martini is everywhere (again).” Like the porn star martini, this cocktail was reportedly invented by a London bartender — but more than a decade earlier in the late ’80s. Espresso martinis were all the rage throughout the ’90s before the hype died down, as people seemed to become fatigued with sweet libations in V-shaped stemware. The 2020s revival was strong, however. Some point to the influence of reality shows like “Below Deck,” which frequently featured cast members drinking espresso martinis. Whatever the reason for the trend, there’s no denying we’re all the more caffeinated for it. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); To make an espresso martini, pour 2 ounces of vodka, half an ounce of coffee liqueur, 1 ounce of espresso and half an ounce simple syrup into an ice-filled shaker and give it a good shake before straining it into a chilled cocktail glass. Don’t forget to add a few coffee beans as a garnish. Aperol Spritz (2020) Stefania Pelfini, La Waziya Photography via Getty Images The Aperol Spritz has long been a signature summer drink in many parts of the world, but the simple ingredient list and lack of skill needed to make the classic aperitivo gave it a particular prominence in 2020, when most people were mixing up their own cocktails at home. “My go-to classic recipe for an Aperol Spritz is two half moon oranges, 2 ounces Aperol, 1 ounce soda water, 3 ounces prosecco, crushed ice and a fresh orange peel,” said Christina Demas, the beverage director of Maple & Ash + etta in Scottsdale, Arizona. Experts recommend choosing an extra dry or dry prosecco but not a full-on brut. Make sure to add the prosecco after the soda water and Aperol. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Hard Seltzer (2019) Cindy Ord via Getty Images “It’s the summer of hard seltzer!” declared countless publications in 2019 . Indeed, it was hard to go anywhere without spotting one of the many canned offerings from White Claw and Truly. In fact, Nielsen reported that the alcohol sales for hard seltzers at bars and restaurants grew by 73% between the spring and fall of 2019, and White Claw sales were were up about 250% that year compared to 2018. The trend has carried on into subsequent years as big brands like Budweiser and Corona capitalized on the low-ABV craze. Not everyone craves an ice cold beer on a summer day, but that doesn’t mean they have to forego the joy of cracking open a can of something boozy to quench their thirst. Black cherry, passionfruit, lime, peach, raspberry ― whatever your flavor preference, there’s a spiked seltzer for you. Frosé (2016) Image Professionals GmbH via Getty Images Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); As with the Aperol Spritz, rosé has long been a summertime sipping staple. But a frozen take on this pink-hued wine came into fashion in the 2010s. It was summer 2016 when the Washington Post declared: “Frosé is taking over D.C.” Frosé is typically made with rosé wine, strawberries, vodka and lemon juice or sugar blended with ice into a frozen slushie treat.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Illustration: Madeline McMahon For HuffPost Is It Rude To Stay Til Closing Time? Here’s What Restaurant Workers REALLY Think When it’s last call at a restaurant, you as a customer may think you have all the time in the world to hang out and order another round or one last bite to eat. But for restaurant workers, it can be a different story. “What [last call] really means is, ‘Hurry up and leave, please,’” said Elyanna Calle, a server in Austin, Texas, who is also the president of union Restaurant Workers United . Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Asking to dine in right before closing time can be rude, depending on when you show up and the kind of service you are expecting. “I don’t show up to a place less than 15 to 20 minutes before close,” said Bill Whitlow, a Covington, Kentucky-based restaurant operator. “But I don’t get upset if a guest comes in five minutes before we close.” Advertisement Calle said that an hour before it closes, she will go to a diner where she knows food comes out in 15 minutes. But she stays mindful of closing time. “If it closes at 10 p.m., I will be out by 10 p.m.,” Calle said. “I’ll be aware, like, at 9:50, get a box, box up my food, pay, and be able to walk out as soon as soon as the clock hits 10.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); How rude it is to stay after a restaurant closes? It depends on how long you are lingering. There’s a difference between staying past last call to finish your drink and staying past a restaurant’s closing hours. Izzy Alcheikh, a bartender for Huda , a New York City-based Levantine bistro, said it’s all right if you hear “last call” and actually get a drink that you enjoy sipping — “That’s completely fine,” he said. But if customers do not acknowledge last call and stay long past a bar is closed, ignoring that every other table has already been cleaned up except theirs, this comes off as rude, Alcheikh said. So if you are the last person at a closed restaurant and you are making no moves to leave, you are definitely being discourteous. “The rudest thing is if you’re purposely staying past close,” Calle said. “I would never stay an hour after closing,” Whitlow said. Just because you are not being kicked out doesn’t mean your continued presence is welcome. At her former job in a pizza restaurant, Calle said staff members were not allowed to ask customers to leave after closing time. “We can only take measures such as asking people if they want boxes, busing their tables, turning off the music, trying to flip chairs really loudly so they get the message,” she said. “It’s one of those things where even when people are like, ‘Sorry, I stayed so late,’ you just have to say, ‘Oh, it’s all good.’” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); In some cases, closing times are not personal — they are the law. “Our liquor licenses are all different depending where we are. Some restaurants can’t serve past 1 a.m.; some can,” said Gabriella Zottola, a restaurant manager based in Waltham, Massachusetts. Workers often cannot say what they really think about how late you are staying, or else they might risk their jobs. “You just have to be accommodating to the customer,” Calle said. So here’s the truth, according to restaurant workers who spoke with HuffPost: How To Not Be A Jerk About Last Call And Closing Time When it’s last call or closing time at a bar or restaurant, there are simple yet courteous actions you can take to make employees’ lives easier — and avoid becoming the customer every worker secretly hates. Pay Your Bill Right Away You should recognize that the staff and managers on a closing shift typically cannot leave the building until all customers do. “At closing time, my pet peeve is when we’ve given last call, they [have] received their final drink, and the check is in front of them waiting to close out,” Zottola said. “I don’t care how late you stay, just pay your bill!” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Zottola said that when a table or bar guest settles their tab right away, she can then complete her closing-out duties like writing the day’s report, distributing tips and rebalancing cash for the next shift. So when a guest pays right away, “I can at least finish my stuff and be ready to lock the door and walk out with them when it’s time to,” she said. Don’t Order A Complicated Drink — Or A Whole Bottle Of Wine Whitlow said that when it’s last call, he will avoid ordering a 10-ingredient cocktail and instead get something simple like a beer, a shot or a vodka soda, “because that bartender has to get 10 to 20 people their last call within a few minutes.” Be mindful of how much you are ordering right before closing time. “A bottle of wine, for example, 30 minutes before closing is a wild suggestion,” A lcheikh said. “That’s an hour [to drink]. You can’t kick them out.” Alcheikh added that it’s more courteous in such instances for customers to ask if they can take the bottle home. Don’t Keep Ordering Drinks After Last Call “For me, 30 minutes past last call is an adequate-enough time to have your drink, finish it and enjoy it without rushing, and get out,” Whitlow said, noting that the longer you linger after that, the harder you are making it on restaurant workers who would like to go home. If you order another drink after last call, you will have “your dishwasher, your bartender, your barback, your manager — there might be three or four people sitting there and waiting on you to leave,” Whitlow explained. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); And time spent waiting on customers is costing workers. “Let’s say you made 100 bucks that night for what would have been a five-hour shift, but they stuck around for an extra two hours. So I made 100 bucks over seven hours,” Whitlow said as an example. “Instead of making $20 an hour, I made $14 an hour.” Don’t Leave A Mess Whenever you do decide to head out, make sure you’re not leaving behind a mess, Calle said. “Consolidate the things on your table,” she suggested. “If you haven’t already, ask for the check, get your food boxed up.” Tip Well Ideally, once customers hear “last call” they should start wrapping everything up so they can leave soon. But if they stick around after closing time, it helps to tip well. “Even throwing [workers] $20 before they get up would make their lengthy stay a little less annoying,” Zottola said. “It would also make the bartenders remember them for the next time they come in as nice people who take care of them, not ‘the couple that stayed all night.’” And if you are a regular who keeps staying past closing time, you should not be a stingy tipper, because this does not endear you to the staff. “We’ll go in the back and be like: ‘Oh, Ben’s here again, I’m going to give him bad service because he never tips me,’” Calle said. “We’re very aware of that.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Find Another Late-Night Spot Instead of dragging out your stay and making restaurant workers wait for you to leave, head out by closing. That’s what restaurant workers do when they go out. Even if a bartender seems amenable, another staff member on the same late shift may not be as agreeable to you staying longer. “Maybe one person wants me to stay, but three others don’t,” Alcheikh said, explaining why he’ll leave by closing time. Another option is to find a restaurant or bar that is actually open later. “A lot of times I would go to somewhere that opened up a little bit later,” Alcheikh said. “Or I would just take a shot with the bartender and just call it a night, go home.” Related Work Restaurants dining out Etiquette Is It Selfish To Make An Elaborate Coffee Drink Order? 7 Things I Won't Do After Working As A Restaurant Host The 1 Thing You Should Always Do After Signing A Restaurant Receipt Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up An essential daily guide to achieving the good life Subscribe to our lifestyle email.

It’ll make you question whether you really have food poisoning at all. But as it turns out, it’s entirely possible that several people can eat the same food and only one person can contract food poisoning. “People always come into the emergency room stating, ‘I know I don’t have food poisoning because I’m the only one who got sick,’” said board-certified emergency physician Dr. Justin Mazur . “Patient education here is critical, as it is more common that not everyone gets sick from your garden variety food poisoning.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); If you’re not familiar with what food poisoning is, it refers to a plethora of gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever. “The symptoms are generally attributed to food that is contaminated with a virus, bacteria or, less commonly, a parasite,” Mazur said. Advertisement Being the only person to suffer a bout of food poisoning after a meal is a tough draw. But unfortunately, it’s a common occurrence, and there’s a reason some people may go unscathed by a little undercooked meat or an unwashed vegetable. Ahead, doctors explained why some people get food poisoning and others don’t, despite eating the same exact thing. Why do some people get food poisoning and others don’t after eating the same thing? To put it simply, your body may not be able to fight off food poisoning. Every single person is completely different in a multitude of ways, including their immune system and gut microbiome , the home of trillions of microorganisms that can influence your digestive system and overall health. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); When it comes to food poisoning, it completely disrupts your gut microbiome, which is why you feel so sick. If you and your friend eat the same undercooked hamburger and you have an unhealthy microbiome while they have a healthier one, you may experience a bit of an upset stomach afterward. “A person with an inadequate microbiome will experience food poisoning more often,” Mazur said. If you fuel your body with healthy foods, your microbiome will thrive. If you don’t, your gut microbiome may not be able to fight off bacteria from the undercooked or raw food that gave you food poisoning. Mazur said the characteristics of an inadequate microbiome are a lack of beneficial bacteria and microbial diversity, as well as high concentrations of pathogenic bacteria, which is a significant risk factor for frequent bouts of food poisoning. He also noted two other things that can affect whether someone gets sick or not: if they ate enough of the food to become infected, and what else they ate or drank that day. “If you started the day drinking alcohol heavily, you’ve already damaged your healthy microbiome for the day, making you more susceptible on that specific day,” Mazur said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Your diet plays a part in how healthy your gut microbiome is. Your eating habits and preferences can increase your risk of developing food poisoning. “Contaminated meat, poultry and seafood that is served raw or undercooked is a risk factor. Consuming raw dairy foods such as eggs, milk or raw dough is another risk factor,” Mazur said. In terms of a diet that will affect the health of your gut microbiome, Mazur said to avoid ” a diet high in refined carbohydrates, processed foods and sugar” and to maximize your intake of fiber, fruits and vegetables. He added that drinking alcohol may be at play with getting food poisoning, too. “Alcohol intake damages the microbiome and is a lesser-known cause of dysbiosis — overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria — and is another risk factor for an inadequate microbiome,” Mazur said. If your gut is inflamed from your diet, Dr. Elizabeth Sharp, a board-certified internal medicine physician, said it’s “more likely that pathogenic bacteria or viruses could penetrate and cause an infection.” Another reason you could be more susceptible to food poisoning is “if [someone has] a weakened immune system or less reserves to mount an immune response to fight off the pathogenic bacteria in the food,” she added. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); So how can you prevent food poisoning? Aside from reading the numerous articles HuffPost has published about food safety , proper preparation and storage methods, our experts believe that a healthy microbiome is also crucial. Mazur said this “may be the very best defense against invading pathogens. Entrenched healthy bacteria support each other preferentially and make it harder for new and/or invading bacteria to take root.” Related Nutrition Food Safety Do You Have Issues Sleeping?

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost LeoPatrizi via Getty Images Should wearing a pair of shorts or a baseball cap keep you from enjoying an expensive night on the town? At many upscale restaurants, potential customers are turned away if they’re wearing clothes that don’t match the classy vibe inside. Some diners have complained about discrimination , especially when dress codes seem to be enforced differently for certain people due to their race, class or gender. But others agree with restaurant owners who believe that maintaining a minimum standard in their luxury spaces allows patrons to fit in appropriately with the decor, creating an atmosphere that makes everyone to feel special. After all, they say, they’ve invested quite a lot in their business, and it’s not too much to ask customers to step up a little bit for a five-star experience. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); We spoke with experts in etiquette and dining out to explain why things are the way they are. Here’s why dress codes exist in the first place. Richard Ford literally wrote the book on dress codes. Ford, a Stanford Law School professor and the author of “ Dress Codes: How the Laws of Fashion Made History ,” said there’s a duality inherent in the creation and enforcement of rules about the kind of clothing people are allowed to wear. “On the reasonable side, dress communicates respect and professionalism, so schools, workplaces and venues have a good reason to insist on clothing that fits with the mission and purpose of the institution,” he said. “On the troubling side, sometimes dress codes are used to screen out stigmatized racial groups.” Advertisement He pointed to dress codes banning gold chains, dental grills or sagging pants. To add another layer to the issue, even establishments that cater to a largely Black customer base sometimes want to signal what Ford called “a certain type of bourgeois respectability.” “It’s true that some might find this objectionable, but it’s not exactly racist,” he said. Reuben Buford May , a sociology professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, studies discrimination in public accommodations like nightclubs, restaurants and bars. He agreed that while dress codes can be viewed as a way to attract a certain type of customer, they can also be understood as a means to keep others away. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “I’ve had an owner tell me, ‘Riffraff is bad for business,’ so he has a code in place to keep certain ‘types’ out of his establishment,” May said. In the past, you could likely recognize a high-status person by the way they were dressed. If it was after 6 p.m. and they were in a tux, for example, you knew they probably weren’t a farmer. (Thanks, “30 Rock.” ) But May pointed out that dress codes can be more difficult to justify now that popular styles are often about comfort. “You might have a hoodie-wearing guest who could buy the entire restaurant, but can’t be seated because of a dress code that requires a jacket,” he explained. These restaurant owners are happy to have dress codes. Juliet, a Houston-based steakhouse and fine-dining restaurant owned by Jamie Allen , says it “ enforces a strict upscale dress code .” Allen created the code himself, saying it signifies that Juliet is not an everyday spot to grab a quick meal, but a celebratory destination. “There’s a time and a place for everything,” Allen said. “I don’t want everyone dressed like they’re at a sports bar.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Sian Kennedy via Getty Images Wearing shorts and sandals? That could mean no service in some establishments. Allen, who is Black, said he has personally experienced racism when trying to enter certain venues, but noted that Juliet’s dress code is enforced equally. “I’ve been to places myself that have a dress code banning things Black people wear, like Jordans or big chains,” he said. “Our dress code isn’t intended to block any demographic, because Juliet is a space where all people and all races can feel comfortable.” The Juliet dress code states: “We do not allow gym attire, beachwear, jean shorts, provocative clothing, sleeveless shirts or tank tops. Athletic apparel, jerseys, beanies, ball caps, bandanas and plain white t shirts are prohibited. Clothing emitting offensive odors is not permitted to be worn anywhere on the property.” Another proponent of dress codes is Adrianne Calvo , the owner of Miami-based Chef Adrianne’s Vineyard Restaurant & Bar. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “I love that there are still some places in New York and Los Angeles that you can’t get into without a dinner jacket,” she said. Her restaurant’s dress code is business casual, banning athletic wear like basketball shorts, yoga shorts and sports bras. “I feel that if you see white linen and fresh roses on the table, that’s your sign to not come in pajamas or sweaty from the court,” Calvo said. “We also feel that if we went through all this thoughtful effort to provide an atmosphere for you to feel special and really embrace our theme, dressing inappropriately ruins the ambience and the feel.” This etiquette expert is also a dress code fan. Thomas P. Farley , an etiquette expert who goes by the name Mister Manners, agreed that there’s an upside to classy attire. “In the same way I wouldn’t show up for a friend’s dinner party looking as though I had just left a water park, I wouldn’t consider bringing down the mood in a restaurant by not being at my best — whether in my interactions with the staff, my conversations at the table or, yes, in my wardrobe choices,” he said. Farley said it’s time for all of us to, well, take a look in the mirror. “If encountering the occasional restaurant dress code policy is what it takes for Americans to begin reassessing the image they’re projecting when they are out in public, I’m all in favor,” he said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Like Allen, Farley is aware that “no exceptions” should mean just that. He applauded codes that are “thoroughly communicated, graciously conveyed, consistently applied and non-gender-specific,” adding that there should be no loopholes for labels. “So, ‘no tank tops’ must mean ‘no tank tops,’ whether the tank is from Target or from Tory Burch,” he said. This chef has a policy, but it’s pretty relaxed. At the Michelin-starred restaurant Cyrus in Geyserville, California, there’s a very short dress code: no shorts, flip-flops or white sleeveless undershirts. “It’s the minimum amount of policy we could enforce to walk the tight line of people being very relaxed and comfortable in Sonoma County in general, but still trying to maintain a policy that helps keep the culture of a special evening for the other guests,” explained James Beard Award-winning chef Douglas Keane . “We do communicate our policy ahead of time, so we’re able to refer back to that if there’s strong pushback from a customer.” Come as you are, these owners say. Vinyl Steakhouse, in New York City’s Flatiron District, takes a different approach. Co-owner and sommelier Sofia Flannery said, “We welcome any and all ways of dressing for our dining room.” One big reason? She’s never been a fan of any dress code policy herself. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “I’ve always thought it stifles individuality, and people are so interesting,” she said. “I hate not being able to see who a person is because they’re wearing something to abide by a rule.” Another reason for ditching the jacket-and-tie requirement is the restaurant’s Manhattan location. “New York has always been the city where you can fully be yourself, and we try to stand by that with our dress code,” Flannery said. “Tailored suits? Adidas tracksuit? Ball cap from a Yankees game you just came from? We love it all.” Flannery has a kindred spirit in Suzanne Podhaizer , a freelance food writer and recipe developer who owned the now-shuttered Salt Café in Montpelier, Vermont. The restaurant had no dress code for the staff or customers. “It was important to me that the cheesemakers, farmers and bakers from whom we sourced felt just as comfortable dining at the restaurant as did the lobbyists, doctors and tourists,” she said. “The hope was that those who loved dressing up would still do so, but that those who weren’t interested, were coming straight from work or who didn’t own dress clothes wouldn’t feel out of place. I believe it allowed more people to feel welcomed.” That view was echoed by John Sugimura , a corporate executive chef at food service management company Taher who is on a team working to reopen the shuttered Forepaugh’s , a historically white-tablecloth destination in St. Paul, Minnesota. While the restaurant might have had a dress code in the past, its new incarnation will not. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “I think a formal policy could be a buzzkill and could potentially have a chilling effect on revenue,” Sugimura said. “In this postpandemic world, our industry continues to struggle to survive, and I believe we all need to open our eyes to know our audience authentically. A dress code represents everything that’s wrong in hospitality.” If you have a code, consistency matters, staff members say. While restaurant owners may be the ones drafting a dress code, it’s typically up to the staff to enforce it in a consistent way. Rick Camac , the executive director of industry relations at the Institute of Culinary Education, once worked as the chief operating officer for an exclusive country club. “Their policy was nearly impossible to understand and even harder to enforce,” Camac said, adding that there were many times when it was ignored for certain members. “It was a club of millionaires, billionaires and famous people, so if they were either extremely difficult with the managers or very friendly with them, staff would often look the other way.” After that experience, Camac said: “I think any policy has to be appropriate, reasonable to comply with and always adhered to. But as a customer, as long as a policy makes sense and is consistent, I have no issue with it.” Keyatta Mincey Parker , the chief curating officer at Pictures and Cocktails LLC , previously worked for six years at a boutique hotel in Atlanta. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “We had a rooftop bar with a dress code that prohibited T-shirts, athletic wear, clothing with holes, flip-flops and sneakers,” she said. “The order came from the owners who kept saying they didn’t want ‘that crowd’ at the bar,” she explained. “The challenge was that hotel guests, who were paying top dollar, found it to be very problematic. Every night I had to explain to people they had to get dressed up to relax on the rooftop bar. At least once a week there was an issue.” As much as the owners denied it, racism was present in decisions about who was allowed and who was turned away, said Parker, who is Black. “If a person is fully dressed and presenting in a way that fits the vibe, let them have fun,” she said. “I think many places selectively discriminate under the veil of the dress code, and they don’t even hide it. If you’re going to have rules, then it has to be the same across the board, or it’s embarrassing and wrong.” ‘In 2024, we should worry about bigger things than dress policies.’ Even at the world’s most luxurious resorts, dress code issues can loom large. That’s been the experience of luxury hospitality veteran Melissa Sambugaro , the sales and marketing director at Iniala Group, which owns the luxury resort Iniala Beach House in Phuket, Thailand. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); She’s worked at places where guests are turned away for wearing open-toed shoes or men are prohibited from wearing shorts. From her perspective, those dress codes are outdated and due for reconsideration. “I think that in 2024, we should worry about bigger things than dress policies,” Sambugaro said. “Based on my personal experience, you really can’t judge the status of a person by how they dress. I’ve seen millionaires show up wearing sneakers and then leave the best tip of the night. I’ve also seen people wearing fancy clothes who walked out once they saw the prices on the menu.” Keane, who has a relaxed dress code at Cyrus, agreed with this. But he can also see things from a restaurant owner’s perspective. “I like to be comfortable, and I find most dress code policies, like mandatory jackets and ties, silly and outdated,” he said. “I also understand that it’s hard when you’re dealing with a wide range of the public and there’s no common rule, so I understand why places enact them. “The overall philosophy as a business owner should be that you want all guests to be comfortable. You need to come up [with] what you think is best and right for your clientele and your atmosphere, so that ultimately the dress code should reflect your personality or philosophy of hospitality.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Related discrimination Restaurants dining out Etiquette Turns Out, People Who Complain About Restaurants Being Too Loud Have A Point Is It Rude To Stay Till Closing Time?

    "article_content": "Suwinai Sukanant / 500px via Getty Images Matcha’s intense bitter and grassy taste — due to its high concentration of catechins — often leads people to sweeten it up with milk and syrups. Matcha is one of those “it’s been around for centuries but it’s suddenly trendy” drinks with a major health halo. Made of finely ground leaves from the Camellia sinensis plant, matcha is a type of green tea that originated in China and was first introduced to Japan in the 12th century. Today, you may drink matcha lattes and frothy iced matcha drinks because they’re “healthy,” but do you know why? And do you realize that the way you prepare your drink could undo some of the nutritional properties that make matcha healthy? These are the health benefits of matcha (before you add anything to it). Matcha is made through a meticulous process in which Camellia sinensis plants are shaded for several weeks before the youngest leaves are hand-picked, steamed shortly afterward to prevent oxidation, and ground into a fine powder using stone mills to preserve their nutrients and taste. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “Unlike regular green tea, where the leaves are steeped and then discarded, matcha involves consuming the whole leaf, which provides a higher concentration of nutrients and antioxidants,” explained Kimberley Wiemann , a registered dietitian. Packed with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most potent form of the phytochemicals known as catechins , studies suggest that matcha’s antioxidant properties can help boost metabolism and aid in weight loss , as well as reduce inflammation and oxidative stress , which are often the culprits behind chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. Advertisement “Matcha [also] contains caffeine and [amino acid] L-theanine, which can provide a calm yet alert feeling, making it suitable for morning consumption to kick-start the day or in the afternoon to combat midday fatigue,” added nutritionist Lisa Richards . Per cup, matcha has about 70 milligrams of caffeine , while an 8-ounce cup of black coffee has 95 to 200 milligrams . What’s the drawback of adding milk to matcha? Despite its health benefits, matcha’s intense bitter and grassy taste — due to its high concentration of catechins — leads some people to dilute and sweeten it with milk and syrups, a reason matcha lattes are such a hit. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Even when you add nothing but hot water, only about 16% to 20% of matcha’s catechins get absorbed into your bloodstream because of their poor solubility, said food scientist Bryan Quoc Le . Still, the ones that don’t make it into your bloodstream might nonetheless benefit your gastrointestinal tract. However, adding milk can further impede the body’s ability to absorb catechins. “The decrease in catechin bioavailability [after adding milk] is something like 5%, so from 16% to 11% ,” Le said. This is because catechins will chemically bind to caseins, which make up about 80% of the total protein in cow’s milk. “In a way, this is beneficial because then the body can break down the protein and absorb the catechin simultaneously,” Le explained. “But the issue is that in something like matcha, where the concentration of catechins is very high, some of the catechins inhibit the digestive enzymes in your stomach if you’re consuming the matcha with milk.” These digestive enzymes help break down the milk proteins for our body to absorb, so, with fewer of them available, “now your body has a harder time breaking down the protein itself because of all the inhibition going on. It’s a combination effect. If you’re drinking a lighter tea, like a white tea with low amounts of catechins, then there’s not going to be as much inhibitory effect if you’re drinking it with milk,” Le explained. What if you use plant-based milk? Le said plant-based milk doesn’t have as much of an impact on catechin absorption in the body. Plant proteins, like those found in oat and almond milk, “have fewer chemical components that interact with catechins so they make the inhibition process less likely to occur,” he said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); yunxi xie via Getty Images Look for matcha with a vibrant green color, labeled as ceremonial grade and made from 100% pure powdered green tea leaves. But if you’re thinking about switching up your milk choice, there’s a tradeoff. Plant-based milk contains less protein , so a matcha latte with oat milk means less protein in your diet, although your body will absorb more catechins. On the flip side, using cow’s milk gives you more protein, but your body will take in fewer catechins. So, which milk variety is best? “It’s ultimately a matter of which [nutrient] you’re going for, you can’t have it all in this case,” Le said. Here’s how to shop for matcha if you make your drinks at home. Milk choice aside, investing in high-quality matcha can help you get the most out of its health benefits. You want tea that is vibrant green, labeled “ceremonial grade” and made from 100% pure powdered green tea leaves, Richards advised. “The texture should be fine and silky, without clumps or grittiness, which ensures it mixes well and maintains its nutrient integrity,” she added. Look for matcha specifically from regions like Uji, Nishio or Kyoto in Japan, which is generally considered superior due to meticulous cultivation and processing methods. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Here’s how to properly prepare matcha for optimum health benefits. “ Many studies use a dosage of between two and four grams of matcha per day, often spread into a couple smaller servings, which equates to about two to four cups per day,” Wiemann said. “It’s important to remember that green tea, including matcha, contains caffeine and should be limited to avoid too much caffeine intake.” If you’re making matcha at home, it’s important to pay attention to the water temperature, since the right temperature will help you get the most nutritional benefits and the fullest flavor from the tea, Richards said. “When water is too hot, above 185°F, it can scald the matcha and potentially degrade some of its delicate nutrients.” Most of matcha’s beneficial health effects aren’t immediate. While how you prepare and consume matcha influences the absorption of nutrients in your body, the extent to which it positively impacts your health depends on various factors, including your gut microbiome, the amount of milk you use and the quality of the matcha you consume over time. “In the grand scheme of things, if you’re drinking tea, it’s always beneficial. If you’re drinking milk with tea, you’re still getting some benefit but it’s less than if you’re going to drink the tea directly,” Le said. “Your risk of cardiovascular disease may be lower and a lot of the processes with aging and chronic disease may slow down, but it’s really going to be about what you’re going to experience in five or ten years.” Related Health Nutrition Tea matcha 6 Boxed Macaroni And Cheese Brands Nutrition Experts Love Nutritionists Rank The Best And Worst Hot Dogs At The Grocery Store Is Orange Juice 'Bad' For You Or Not?

    "article_content": "My wife Sam and I recently had the luxury of watching an entire movie in one sitting. After getting our boys to bed early on a Sunday night, we tucked into “The Idea of You,” starring Anne Hathaway and Nicholas Galitzine. Our expectations were not excessive: We assumed the film would be sexy, a little dramatic and kind of cheesy. If nothing else, the leading man and leading lady are both achingly beautiful. We were not disappointed. (Note some spoilers below). The premise begins as follows: When 40-year-old mom Solène accidentally mistakes 20-something boy-band heartthrob Hayes Campbell’s trailer for the bathroom at Coachella, sparks fly. But she’s way too old for him, right? Over the course of a tumultuous few months, the pair fall madly and inconveniently in love. When Solène secretly joins Hayes on his European tour, the couple get handsy all over Barcelona, Rome and Paris. But it’s not long before their age difference, coupled with Hayes’ global fame, causes some friction. Solène is ridiculed by Hayes’ bandmate and his thong-clad girlfriends, while back in LA, her cheating ex and teenage daughter are ignorant of her romance. Even Solène’s dreamy little Silver Lake bungalow is no match for the harassment of the paparazzi and high school bullies, and she ultimately decides to put her daughter’s needs before her own. Solène breaks things off with Hayes. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Alisha Wetherill/Prime Anne Hathaway and Ella Rubin as mother and daughter in \"The Idea Of You.\" As the credits rolled, Sam and I agreed: It didn’t have to be so dramatic. “If she really wanted to get her daughter through high school, she only needed to wait a couple more years,” Sam pointed out. But why did she have to wait at all? Why was heartbreak the only solution? Was Solène right to end her relationship to protect her daughter, I wondered? Advertisement This idea that we have to give up our own desires to ensure the happiness of our children is tired — and frankly, incorrect. Moms especially are held to a harsh standard of selflessness when it comes to our kids. Samantha Tinter, a licensed clinical social worker and owner of Hudson Valley Counseling, believes that it’s essential for parents to prioritize themselves. “When we give everything we have to our children, and forget about ourselves, we become irritable, exhausted, resentful and easily overwhelmed. All in the name of dedicated parenting.” she said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Taking time away from our kids and spending it with adult friends, getting a manicure or exercising can all be necessary elements of self-care, Tinter argues. “All of these things matter and are important in not getting swallowed up into your role as a parent until you become unrecognizable to yourself,” she added. Hannah Samaha has experienced this push-and-pull both as a child therapist and as a mother. “The only situation to not prioritize your own needs is when it comes to situations that are dangerous or harmful to your child,” said Samaha, a child psychologist in private practice. “Our kids look to us for safety and security, and they’re very perceptive. If our behaviors are indicating that we don’t feel safe and secure, they’re going to perceive the world as a dangerous place,” she added. “Moms especially are held to a harsh standard of selflessness when it comes to our kids.” In my own home, my wife Sam and I have started reminding ourselves, “We are people, too.” Sometimes we say this aloud and let our children hear us — let them know we are flawed humans with wants and needs. I am multifaceted: I have good days and bad ones. I make mistakes. I get excited. I have interests outside of my children. I certainly don’t have all the answers. Why should I pretend otherwise? Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); According to Tanika Masse, a psychologist who specializes in working with children, parents prioritizing their own needs is beneficial to their children. “Taking care of yourself is essential, and it is not a luxury or option, but rather a vital means of ensuring one’s own survival and well-being,” she said. She implores parents to give themselves some grace as a starting point. “Practice self-compassion, be kind to yourself and recognize that it’s okay to prioritize your own needs sometimes. Let go of any guilt or pressure to constantly put your children first, and remember that taking care of yourself ultimately benefits them, too.” In the case of “The Idea of You,” Solène’s choice to end a relationship with a pop star isn’t a realistic example of the challenges of parenthood — that’s why this is a movie — but it does highlight an important issue. Even though Solène has friends, she feels emotionally isolated. Like her, there are many parents who don’t have the support of a community who can help them make “self-care” a reality. But removing guilt from the equation, like Masse suggested, is emotionally beneficial and available to everyone. When my wife and I care for ourselves as individuals and for our relationship, we are able to be more present for our kids. We are able to bring our emotionally healthiest selves to motherhood. So instead of constantly worrying about what’s best for our kids‚ like Solène does in the film, it’s time to consider our own needs. When we’re able to do that, we can make better decisions for our kids and find balance for our families.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer The author in her pajamas. Courtesy of Megan McCarthy I couldn’t get anyone to go with me. As a writer about pleasure, I felt compelled to experience a cuddle party, and I learned about one in New York City that claimed to be “a warm evening of connection, cuddles and consent.” My husband of 25 years, Mark, said the thing sounded “weird,” and my most daring friend simply wrinkled her nose. So I bought a single ticket on Eventbrite, as if this event was just another conventional form of entertainment, like a concert or a play. A cuddle party is a “social event where participants engage in consensual, non-sexual touch and affectionate physical contact,” or so says my new best friend ChatGPT4. Despite the bland description, just reading those words set my senses aglow. For $69 (oddly enough), I would soon be cuddling with strangers in a NYC loft. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); At 77, I’m fairly old, but I’m very fit, and I think I’m quite cute. My husband says I’m the most beautiful woman in the world, so I assumed I was cuddle-worthy. I do like a good cuddle, but I’ve only cuddled with people I know well: boyfriends, husbands and my sons when they were children. Now I nuzzle my granddaughters, ages 3 and 7, but only briefly, because unless they’re sleepy, they don’t stay still for long. Advertisement I’ve rarely felt the urge to cuddle a friend, but I now wondered what it would feel like to cuddle a woman. What about two women? Possibilities expanded. How about cuddling two men and a woman at once? Cuddling is defined as hugging, embracing, nestling, stroking. It’s not sexual, although it can easily become so, but not at the cuddle party. The website for the event was clear: “THIS EVENT IS NON-SEXUAL, DRUG AND ALCOHOL FREE, AND LIMITED TO PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE 18+.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); The site also posted a list of rules, including: “You don’t have to cuddle anyone... ever” and “You must ask permission and receive a verbal YES before you touch anyone. (Be as specific in your request as you can.)” Before we’d get to cuddle, there would be a one-hour workshop on consent. Consent is important, but I wondered why such a simple concept warranted an entire hour of discussion, and I fretted this would give us less time for the main activity. The website advised us to bring “comfy pajamas” (not lingerie) to change into and noted that pajamas were to remain on for the entire event. I wanted to wear my best PJs — teal blue trimmed with white rickrack — but they were short, possibly immodest, and my arms and legs might be cold, so I chose a long pair instead (a wise choice because the venue ended up being chilly). In the days leading up to the event, I kept daydreaming about the cuddle party. I imagined a sensual paradise — a radiant garden where attractive and open-minded people playfully intertwined. One person would stroke my hair. I would caress somebody’s shoulder. Somebody else would be pressed against my back, spooning me. My new friends and I would be touching right up to the sexual line (the collar bone but not the breast), and our restraint would be erotically charged. All would be guileless and guiltless. Pleasure in public with strangers! An extended sensuous carnival! What joy lay ahead! At the last minute, as I was packing my pajamas, Mark said, “Maybe I’ll come with you, after all,” but by then the event was sold out. So I went alone, just as I’d gone solo to Burning Man 15 years earlier (and what a time that had been!). Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); This particular cuddle party keeps a low profile. There was no sign for the event in the lobby, and the address, which was in Manhattan’s financial district, wasn’t provided to me until shortly before the event. When I got into the elevator, a young man was already inside and pressing the button for the cuddle party floor. If it’s usually awkward to be sharing a small elevator car with a stranger (you may nod in greeting, but you basically wall yourself off), it’s twice as awkward when you are both going to a cuddle party, where you might soon be touching. As we ascended, the young man and I avoided looking at each other. The elevator door opened directly into a loft. The foyer area was small and crowded, with many people in line for the single bathroom. A woman with a clipboard signed me in, and then I proceeded to the big room, where about thirty people were lolling about on couches and futons and pillows. I went into a screened-off cubicle, changed into my pajamas, and joined the others. I was impressed by how racially diverse the crowd was — just like Manhattan. Most people were in their 30s and 40s. I did see a few in their 20s and two or three people around my age. One woman was there with her daughter, who looked to be about 45. The facilitator, with his balding head and graying beard, also appeared to be around my age, which put me at my ease. I chatted with him as more people arrived and we waited for the program to start. He was genial, enthusiastic and kind. He’s been doing this work for years, and he told me his father is a cuddle party facilitator as well. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); I made a quick calculation. That meant his father must be at least 90 — how great that he was still working! “How old is your dad?” I asked the facilitator. “73,” he replied. I realized this man whom I thought was my age must be in his 40s. How could I be so far off? Perhaps I was this far off about many things. I looked around the room trying to decide if these folks were hot or not. The couple closest to me was definitely attractive, but most of the people in the room were of average appearance. There were a few participants I thought most people would happily pursue and a few most would not, and about 20 people in the middle. There seemed to be an equal number of women and men, a few of whom probably identified as LGBTQ+. “We did exercises where we asked for the kind of touch we wanted and were turned down, and we did exercises where we turned down others’ requests. This seemed silly at first, but the simulations achieved the goal of making us comfortable both requesting and turning down cuddles — and also getting rebuffed.” Although the website emphasized strict punctuality and said the doors would be locked at 7 p.m. sharp, we waited half an hour for the latecomers to straggle in. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); As we waited, I couldn’t help noticing the general grubbiness of the venue. I wish the organizers had hired a cleaning service or rented a higher-end loft. More disturbing was the huge window on the south wall of the space. It had no blinds or drapes, so people on the upper floors of the building across the street could look right in. Anybody with a telephoto lens could see and photograph any of us. Finally, the welcome circle was formed and the workshop began. We were told how to ask for and refuse consent. We did exercises where we asked for the kind of touch we wanted and were turned down, and we did exercises where we turned down others’ requests. This seemed silly at first, but the simulations achieved the goal of making us comfortable both requesting and turning down cuddles — and also getting rebuffed. They helped us verbalize our requests and responses frankly, without fear, and I realized that this experience could affect us well beyond cuddling with strangers. What seemed like a dreary preamble to the evening was actually providing us with a useful skill. Of course, there was the usual workshop jargon I’d encountered in similar situations. We were in a “safe space.” The room was our “container.” We should respect people’s boundaries. We should practice mindfulness. (And I should probably practice being nonjudgmental!) Finally, the workshop was over, and, as the website promised, we’d have “a couple of hours for free-style cuddle time” which we could use to “relax, chat, cuddle, have a snack, or just hang out.” I didn’t want to have a snack or just hang out. I looked longingly over at the attractive couple who had been sitting near me when I first arrived but now were further away and facing another direction. Was I paranoid or had they taken evasive action? I looked elsewhere. No one was looking at me or waving me over, but the exercises had emboldened me. I asked the person closest to me, a tall fellow of about 35, “Could I stroke your forearm?” He gave his consent, so I stroked his forearm. It wasn’t especially pleasurable, and it didn’t lead to further touch. After a while, I thanked him and moved on to a woman who agreed to let me caress her cheek. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); My few requests were never denied, but no one ever asked to touch me. After about half an hour, I began to feel — to misquote Nora Ephron — like a wallflower at the non-orgy. I noticed that many people were not cuddling, just awkwardly chatting with each other. I found the absence of alcohol or, for me, pot, made it harder to be sociable. Perhaps newbies to cuddle parties are often inhibited. I ended up on a banquette with another first-timer, a German woman around my age. We spoke about ourselves. I told her I was happily married. She said she was looking for a partner and showed me her “dating cards,” which she proactively gave to men who interested her, a gambit I admired. The cards contained only her first name and her phone number. She said she didn’t want prospective dates doing internet research on her (I wish I’d asked why!), and she didn’t want emails. She wanted calls. She wanted voices. She wanted true connection. She had come to the cuddle party for some touch, yet like perhaps half the people in the room, she wasn’t cuddling, she was talking. Maybe she and I could have cuddled, but at the time it didn’t occur to me. I moved toward the crackers and cheese. I did see some cuddling going on — a few people on the rug were hugging a pretty woman of about 30 — but I was never part of such a poly pile. I saw no people I wanted to embrace, and no one seemed eager to embrace me. My warmly envisioned garden was drying out and withering. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Or maybe only I was. Is any experience as thrilling as one’s fondest expectations? Perhaps only being a grandparent. And what did I expect — that I, a granny, would come to this party and be the belle of the ball? My loving husband had made me ridiculously self-confident. I slunk out before the closing circle. “I have to catch my train,” I said at the door, revealing myself as a suburbanite. I was suddenly eager to return to the man who’d cuddle me whenever I wanted, no consent required. The author and her husband, Mark Thompson. Courtesy of Megan McCarthy Mark was asleep when I crept into bed, with his back facing me, which I prefer. I snuggled against his back and put one leg over him. In his sleep, he held my foot. I was home. A few days later, I got a message from the German woman. She’d come down with Covid and asked how I felt.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Illustration: Jianan Liu/HuffPost; Photo: Getty Images, AP Courtroom artists revealed the fascinating details of their jobs — and the moments we rarely see. For Elizabeth Williams , one of the three courtroom artists inside the Manhattan courtroom for former President Donald Trump ’s trial, every day is a new challenge. Take last Tuesday, when defense attorney Todd Blanche cross-examined Trump’s fixer-turned-enemy Michael Cohen on the witness stand. She nailed the former president’s facial expression. “He tends to purse his lips forward when he gets really pissed off. And he was doing that,” Williams told HuffPost on Sunday. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); But on that particular drawing , she was less satisfied with how Cohen turned out, even though she felt she got his energy down. “Did I get a really great likeness of him? No, but that’s what the back-and-forth [between Blanche and Cohen] looked like.” That’s the daily challenge of a courtroom artist. “It’s not like you can say, ‘I’ve been doing this for so long. It’s just so easy now.’ That’s just unfortunately not true,” Williams said, noting that she goes through “a lot of paper.” Advertisement Elizabeth Williams \"You start with the most moving or the most important thing first, and then you build out of that,\" Williams said of her process. Above is the drawing she made last Tuesday of Cohen being cross-examined by defense attorney Todd Blanche. Trump is on trial in New York for allegedly covering up hush money payments Cohen made on his behalf to Stephanie Clifford, an adult film star who goes by Stormy Daniels, ahead of the 2016 presidential election. And unless you’re a juror or journalist, you’re most likely only seeing the trial through Williams’ and other courtroom artists’ sketches. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); New York remains one of the only jurisdictions that bans cameras in most courtrooms. In this high-profile criminal trial, as with many others where photography, broadcasting and livestreaming is limited or banned , courtroom art is one of the only ways that the public can see how the proceedings unfold. These artists become responsible for conveying what it’s like to be in that room. It’s their job to capture the colors, moods and participants’ gestures, however fleeting. What sets courtroom art from other mediums is how it can distill a scene into “the key most important elements and put them into an image. And it’s representative of the day’s story,” said Christine Cornell , one of the other courtroom artists covering the Trump trial. Cornell noticed that her first drawings of Daniels made her simply look pretty, but she was later struck by a moment during Daniels’ testimony when she was making a face with her jaw. “You want to just get it enough to show the agitation and that she’s expressing herself,” Cornell told HuffPost about why she chose that moment to zoom in on. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); In one of her own drawings of Daniels, Williams highlighted how closely the jury listened to her testimony. She could not get the jurors’ faces, but she made sure to draw their hands jotting down notes. “They were very attentive to her,” Williams said about the moment. “She’s talking to them. ... Some witnesses don’t really address the jury. She did.” What it’s really like to cover a historic trial Each day, the three veteran courtroom artists –– Williams, Cornell and Jane Rosenberg –– are seated in the third row on the right side of the courtroom. They rotate spots daily. Williams was scheduled to sit on Tuesday on the far right next to the wall, which she said would give her a chance to see the jury and what they’re doing, for example. Between them, the three artists have covered many famous cases, such as Tom Brady’s “ Deflategate ” saga, Harvey Weinstein’s 2020 rape trial and the trial of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein’s associate, Ghislaine Maxwell . However, all three said this trial stands out for the intense security presence around the proceedings, including from police and the Secret Service. “They won’t even excuse us to leave until all the prosecutors are gone and Trump’s been gone for 20 minutes,” Cornell said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Court artists are used to being able to draw people in seconds, she said. But it’s been hard to even catch a good glimpse of the star of the case, Trump, who is often blocked from view by court officers. “Every day, I have to wait till [the officers] move or squeeze a peek in between them,” Rosenberg told HuffPost. “But [Trump]’s really fun to draw. He’s got great expression on his face, that pouty look. He’s got great bushy eyebrows and his helmet hair.” Elizabeth Williams In Williams' sketch, she drew Reps. Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert sitting at Trump's hush money trial. Williams said she is proud of this drawing because it shows \"the public what it's really like to be in that courtroom\" with the high level of security. Williams, who works with the Associated Press, said she has to adhere to strict AP editorial guidelines. “I can’t take a picture of Donald Trump and ram him up next to the witness box,” she explained. Some of her work does not include Trump, simply because she cannot see him. As the weeks-long trial nears its conclusion, the artists have been pulling long hours to complete four to five sketches a day, which they shoot off to wire services or news outlets on breaks. Cornell said she’ll email her drawings in the bathroom. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “There’s a nice big window there with a counter. I set my drawings down, take a photograph and email it in. Very glamorous,” Cornell said. The long days can be “physically draining,” Rosenberg said. To get the best view, Rosenberg, who is right-handed, has to work with her left hand at times, which hurts her back. To help, she wakes up at 4 a.m. and does back exercises and meditates. “I’m exhausted right now, because I get up so early and I have such a long day, of course, but I don’t start drawing until like 9:30 [a.m.], when [Trump] walks in the room,” Rosenberg said. Cornell said for her job, she uses a “couple hundred” pastels, binoculars and a seat cushion to help her see over people. She estimates that her portfolio and art supplies weigh more than 20 pounds. And on the world stage, you have to be ready to face everybody’s opinion about your work. Critics often accuse courtroom artists of unfairly editorializing about the people they draw. At this year’s White House Correspondent’s Dinner, comedian Colin Jost said the artists were trying to make Trump look “like the Grinch” and “as bad as possible.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Rosenberg said that this critique is “ridiculous.” She said she’s has gotten more praise than criticism for her sketches during the trial — her arraignment sketch of Trump became a New Yorker magazine cover — but she does occasionally read negative feedback. Recently, she got an email from a person that said she inaccurately portrayed Cohen “as an old, sad, sick man” and Trump as “a strong middle-aged man.” She replied, saying that she was sorry that her work had let the person down. “It does make me feel bad,” she said of the criticism. “But I have to keep going.” A rewarding but dwindling profession Being a courtroom artist requires quick thinking and the ability to start over instantly if there’s a better scene to capture. It’s an “adrenaline rush,” Rosenberg said, noting that she sees her job as a “service for the public.“ But it’s a shrinking profession. Williams, who started doing courtroom art in 1980 after working as a fashion illustrator estimates there are only about 10 courtroom artists working across the nation right now. She said courtroom art is not her full-time job and she draws weddings and events on the side. JEFFERSON SIEGEL via Getty Images Above, (L-R) courtoom artists Elizabeth Williams, Jane Rosenberg and Christine Cornell wait to enter the courthouse for Trump's trial. Cornell and Rosenberg both said they would not recommend the profession to others, because it can be hard to find steadily paying gigs. Even though she is well established, Cornell said she can go weeks without work. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “I don’t think it’s a good way to earn a living,” Rosenberg said. But if you want to learn how to draw like one, grab a sketchbook, head to your local criminal courthouse and go to arraignment or a hearing. They are often open to the public and are the “bread-and-butter” assignments for courtroom artists, Williams said. “A lot of artists feel like, ‘Oh, I can draw from photographs, so I can do all this.’ ... Going from a photograph and drawing from life are totally different,” she said, noting how she has to deal with subjects who are constantly moving. “Draw a lot and draw quickly and look at the scene — the scene is the drawing,” Williams advised aspiring courtroom artists. “Do it a lot and then you’ll finally start to get ... something that you feel like, ‘Yeah, this is pretty good.’” It can be hard work, but for courtroom artists, the enduring appeal of their job is getting to draw people. “I don’t really want to draw trees and flowers,” Williams said. “A seascape is only interesting if it has people in it.” “People are so interesting. Just never boring,” Williams said. “A face has a multitude of muscles. That’s one of the things about Cohen, is that he has all these expressions, and just to grab one is really important. The eyebrows do all sorts of things.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Soon the demanding days of the Trump trial will come to a conclusion. Both Cornell and Rosenberg said they are looking forward to the end. On a recent day off, “I got up at 7:30 a.m. So late for me, I was so happy,” Rosenberg said. “It’s a luxury.” “My dog misses me,” Cornell said. “It’s going to be fabulous when it’s over, and I’m just really interested to see what happens.” Related Donald Trump michael cohen trump trial Trump Trial Chaos: Judge Clears Courtroom Over Witness Behavior Donald Trump's Hush Money Trial, Week 6: Live Updates Add Trump's Vow To Testify In His Trial To His Long List Of Broken Promises Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer The author at nine months pregnant, in February 2021. Courtesy of Aizhan Yesbolatova I grew up believing that being pregnant would be one of the best experiences of my life. I heard about the glow and all that bliss that comes with it. I expected nothing less than the pure joy of anticipating a baby, and I never imagined that my pregnancy could be brutally different from the way I had always imagined. Things began fairly typically. At first I got sick riding in a car and then I threw up again when I got home. The next morning, the nausea was back and remained with me throughout the day. I had been trying to get pregnant for three years, and, after being disappointed so many times, I put off taking a test for several days. When I finally did, the test was positive. Still, I was unconvinced, so my husband and I visited my OB-GYN. My doctor performed an ultrasound and confirmed I was eight weeks pregnant. When we heard our baby’s heartbeat, I burst into tears and finally let myself embrace what was happening. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); My husband and I were ecstatic. We hugged and laughed through our tears. Suddenly I got sick and threw up in a plastic bag. My doctor assured me I was just experiencing morning sickness. “Just make sure you drink enough liquids and eat,” she said. “You should be fine by the second trimester.” Advertisement Just a few more weeks , I thought to myself as I tried not to vomit again. The situation escalated dramatically in the following days. I was severely sick all day every day — not just in the mornings. I could barely eat anything. Whatever I put in my mouth came back up and was flushed into a toilet just a few minutes later. My nausea was so extreme that it wasn’t long before I completely stopped eating. Within a week I was so weak that couldn’t even get out of bed. My husband took me to the ER, where they hooked me up to IVs because I was dehydrated, and my ketone levels were elevated due to the loss of fluids. I was starving and in pain and my mind was foggy. I felt like I was dying, but everyone around me kept telling me “This happens all the time” and “Unfortunately, this is just a part of being pregnant.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); The author in August 2020, receiving intravenous hydration at Hoboken University Medical Center. Courtesy of Aizhan Yesbolatova The fluids only offered temporary relief. I sensed that what I was experiencing was different from what others typically went through. Could morning sickness be this brutal? By 12 weeks, I had dropped 9 pounds. There was no sign that my condition would subside by the second trimester, as my doctor had assured me. Instead of feeling better, I was bedridden and depressed. I couldn’t do anything without my husband’s support. I hadn’t showered once since the day I heard my baby’s heartbeat. I couldn’t brush my teeth. I cried all of the time. Not only was I severely nauseated, I also constantly felt dizzy. Almost anything — watching TV, listening to music, reading books or walking — could make me vomit. Sometimes I threw up 20 times in a single morning. I tried everything the nurses suggested: bed rest, acupuncture, breathing exercises, herbal tea, ginger chews and therapy. A shelf in our kitchen was overrun with Pepto and Mylanta bottles. Nothing helped. I felt betrayed by my body. Food, which has always been a significant and joyous part of my life, became my worst enemy. I could barely eat. A few sips of water and a couple of crackers throughout the day was all I could manage to keep down. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Our apartment — filled with piles of dust, unwashed bedding and dirty dishes — reflected my misery. I was locked in our home and I felt as though I had become one with our dreary bedroom. Unable to interact with anyone but my husband, I morphed into a sad gray creature who crawled out of bed only to use the bathroom. Days turned into weeks, and I just tried to hold on until I gave birth and hopefully my nightmare would be over. Outside, the seasons changed and the world went on without me. When I was about 18 weeks pregnant, after nothing had changed, my obstetrician suggested I might be suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, a “ potentially life-threatening pregnancy disease that may cause weight loss, malnutrition, dehydration, and debility due to severe nausea and/or vomiting, and may cause long-term health issues for mother and [babies],” according to the Hyperemesis Education and Research Foundation (HER). It’s estimated that 1% to 3% of pregnant people suffer from HG, but it could be as high as 10% . The September 2020 ultrasound photo taken of the author's daughter at 16 weeks. Courtesy of Aizhan Yesbolatova At first I was relieved to have a name for what I was going through. It made me feel less alone, knowing that other women also experienced this hell. I could finally stop blaming myself for being so flawed. I naively believed that having a diagnosis meant I could be treated, but my obstetrician crushed my hopes when I learned there wasn’t much she could do, that my HG would probably last my entire pregnancy. I did not know how — or if — I could survive five more months of misery. My doctor offered me a combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine, which didn’t stop my nausea or end my vomiting, but it did knock me out for 20 hours a day. While I slept, I kept having the same dream: I was at a table filled with delicious food, and I kept trying to reach it, but it was just beyond my grasp. I would begin to howl in desperation, and then I’d wake up — ravenous and nauseated again. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); After several days of deep sleep, the drugs seemed to have an effect. I woke up one morning, tried a piece of bread and didn’t vomit. I asked for another piece and then another. Eating bread and not throwing it up right away was the highlight of my pregnancy. The list of foods I could successfully keep down then widened to include boiled macaroni, potatoes, lemon sorbet, pastries and tomatoes. All other food still made me retch. Though I could eat, my life was stagnant. I was still too sick to do much of anything but doom-scroll between bouts of vomiting. I read about other women’s experiences with HG to feel less alone. I learned that many experts believe my favorite writer, Charlotte Brontë, died of hyperemesis. I tried to find out as much as I could about Kate Middleton’s HG journey, but the only information about the Duchess of Wales’ treatment was a vague statement about how she “may require supplementary hydration, medication and nutrients.” For some women, HG was so unbearable and life-threatening that they terminated their pregnancies, and others said they contemplated suicide . I was despondent thinking about how many scientific breakthroughs we’ve achieved, but when it came to hyperemesis gravidarum, medicine seemed to be stuck in medieval times, when women with morning sickness were treated with candied orange peels or advised to sniff a violet. It wasn’t just my physical misery that was taking a toll on me; it was living in a world that refuses to see HG as the debilitating and traumatizing condition it truly is. The author holding her 1-day-old daughter at Mount Sinai Hospital in March 2021. Courtesy of Aizhan Yesbolatova Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); People around me, except my husband and parents, didn’t truly believe how dire my condition was. They thought I was being overly dramatic and seeking attention. One acquaintance told me I was “too sensitive” and another suggested I must have had problems with my liver and that next time I should “do some cleansing and proper preparation before getting pregnant.” The therapist I contacted insisted that my extreme nausea and vomiting were due to my subconscious rejection of a baby. “You just don’t want to be pregnant, and your body is manifesting this,” she said with unshakable confidence. One of my pregnant friends who didn’t have HG told me she started thinking positively the day she learned she was pregnant, and, thanks to her affirmations, her whole experience was smooth. So many of the people I knew persistently told me that good nutrition was the most critical thing in pregnancy — as well as “peace of mind.” I had neither. Instead, I constantly worried about my baby, and every trip to the doctor’s office was filled with tremendous anxiety. Was the baby OK? Was she growing? Was the bread I was eating enough to sustain her? I had been so excited to finally be pregnant, but this kind of pregnancy wasn’t my choice. I wasn’t glowing or feeling as cheerful as I had always imagined I would be. There is no room for my hyperemesis in a space that too often demands the illusion of perfection. There are no movies with a protagonist who has hyperemesis gravidarum and few mainstream articles about trying to survive this condition. Nobody wants to talk about it. I was so grateful to have my husband and my family, but still I felt completely alone — trapped in a body that I wanted to love for creating my baby but that I hated for torturing me. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); My HG stopped the moment I gave birth to my daughter at 41 weeks. I suddenly didn’t feel any nausea, and the first thing I craved was the meat that I couldn’t even look at for more than half a year. Motherhood — even with all those sleepless nights, endless breastfeeding and everything else that was demanded of me — seemed so easy after being locked in my rebelling body for 33 long weeks. The author with her almost 1-year-old daughter in February 2022. Courtesy of Aizhan Yesbolatova When I look at my beautiful daughter, who is almost 3 now, I know it was all worth it. I’ve always wanted three children, but my mind and body recoil at the mere thought of being pregnant again, and I do not know if I would willingly accept the nightmare of HG again to have another child. I hope that if I did face HG again, the experience would be different, thanks to recent research discoveries. In December 2023, a study published in Nature identified a specific hormone, called GDF15, as the probable cause of morning sickness. Researchers suggested that “blocking GDF15 action in the pregnant mother should be a highly effective therapy for women suffering from HG,” which means better treatments for HG could be on the way. When I read the news, I was overwhelmed with a lot of competing emotions — elation, sorrow, wonder, solace. After suffering so deeply and for so long, I finally felt a shimmer of hope for myself and the countless other women who are battling or will battle HG. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); I’m optimistic that this new research and other studies will change how we deal with HG, but I worry about how long it may take before a viable treatment is available. I want to believe the urgency to provide relief to patients is finally recognized, but I also know how frequently women’s medical concerns are ignored or dismissed. We need more clinical trials, faster research-to-medication pathways and multiple approaches to relieving HG so that the needless suffering of pregnant women may finally be eased. I can picture a better reality where no mother suffers what I endured. I desperately hope it comes soon.

With the Senate’s confirmation of Angela Martinez to a U.S. district court in Arizona, Biden surpassed the number of lifetime federal judges that Donald Trump had confirmed by the same point in his presidency. Trump, who made judicial confirmations a major focus of his presidency , was at 196 at this point in his presidency. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); It is the diversity of Biden’s judges, though, that really jumps out. He has put more women, people of color, LGBTQ+ people and professionally diverse people into lifetime federal judgeships than any of his predecessors, and in some cases, more than any of them combined. Nearly two-thirds of Biden’s judges are women (127), and nearly two-thirds are people of color (125). About 40% of Biden’s judges are women of color (79). To put this into some context: A total of 3,254 white men have served on the Supreme Court, appeals courts or district courts since the U.S. federal court system was created in 1789, according to the Federal Judicial Center. In all that time, 416 judges have been white women, and 565 have been people of color. Just 197 have been women of color. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); The professional diversity of Biden’s judges is also off the charts. More than 40% of them (85) have backgrounds as public defenders or civil rights lawyers ― a huge break from the centuries-long tradition of plucking people for federal judgeships from their jobs as prosecutors or corporate attorneys. “When you walk into a courtroom and your freedom and your business and your family’s interests are at stake, you’d like to look up there and see a judge that you believe really understands your way of life,” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said at a press conference with civil rights leaders after the vote. Biden has ushered in historic firsts for the federal bench, too. He appointed the first openly LGBTQ+ woman to serve on a U.S. appeals court, Judge Beth Robinson of the 2nd Court of Appeals. He appointed the first Muslim American federal judge, Zahid Quraishi, to a U.S. district court. He has appointed four Native American people to lifetime federal judgeships, which is half of all the Native American federal judges appointed in U.S. history. And, of course, Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, making her the first Black woman and former public defender to serve on the nation’s top court. “This is a major milestone,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) celebrated on the Senate floor ahead of Martinez’s vote. “Simply put, our 200 judges comprise the most diverse slate of judicial nominations under any president in American history.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of Joe Biden's greatest successes as president. Tom Williams via Getty Images Broken down, the president has confirmed a total of one Supreme Court justice, 42 appeals court judges, 155 district court judges and two Court of International Trade judges. All of these judges are serving lifetime appointments. Biden “may well be able to match” Trump’s 174 confirmed district judges by the end of the year, speculated Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow with the Brookings Institution’s governance studies program and president of the Governance Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. “If he does, he would be second only to former President Jimmy Carter” in confirming that many district judges in a single term, Wheeler said. But Biden is not likely to fill as many appeals court vacancies as Trump did. By the end of Trump’s term, he had confirmed 54 appeals court judges. There simply aren’t enough vacancies for Biden to fill to hit that number by the end of the year. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Ultimately, though, the president’s goal has been to appoint “a lot of judges who were not white males,” Wheeler said. “He’s exceeded that.” “All things considered, I think he has a really impressive record,” he added. President Joe Biden wouldn't have gotten so many of his judges confirmed without the help of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senate Judiciary Committee chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). SHAWN THEW via Getty Images While Biden has had success with his judges, he’s facing some real challenges in the coming months, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia and a judicial nominations expert. There are still dozens of vacant district court seats, he said, and the majority of them don’t have a nominee. Many of those vacancies are in states represented by two GOP senators, meaning they have a say in who the White House picks for those seats. They can also jam the process entirely by not agreeing to any nominees — a political move that becomes increasingly likely as it gets closer to the November elections. “The Senate calendar is tough,” said Tobias, referring to the dwindling days lawmakers will be in Washington before they head back home to run for reelection. “ Democrats are defending more seats and need to campaign.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); For now, Biden seems pretty pleased with his record. “Today, we reached another milestone in the effort to protect the freedoms and liberties of all Americans,” he said in a statement. “These judges are exceptionally well-qualified. They come from every walk of life, and collectively, they form the most diverse group of judicial appointees ever put forward by a President,” the president said. “And despite differences in background and experience, they are all committed to principles that are at the core of our democracy: independence, freedom, and liberty.” Biden wouldn’t have been able to get so many judges through without Senate Democratic leaders making judicial confirmations a top priority. It’s particularly notable how much they’ve been able to deliver given their razor-thin majority in the chamber. Biden was working with a Senate evenly tied at 50-50 until December 2022, when Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) won in a runoff election and gave Democrats a 51-49 majority. Warnock said Wednesday that he didn’t realize at the time how significant his victory was for confirming judges. “I didn’t appreciate, as I do now, how deeply consequential that win would be,” Warnock told HuffPost. “The people of Georgia delivered this 200th judge.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Igor Bobic contributed reporting.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer The author in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, during a stop on her \"50 States Project.\" Courtesy of Shari Leid From coffee shops to dive bars to restaurants with white table linens, I found a kind of joy that’s hard to put into words. It’s a joy that’s woven into the fabric of shared meals, echoing laughter and the exchange of stories that flow as easily as the wine in our glasses. This journey, affectionately known as my “ 50 States Project ,” morphed from a simple goal into a profound exploration to find happiness, belonging, connection and a deeper understanding of myself — a narrative deeply entwined with my unique heritage. Adopted from South Korea by a Japanese American couple, I’ve always lived at the intersection of multiple identities. My father was born in 1922 in the basement of a rental home on Main Street in Seattle, while my mother’s roots trace back to her birth in 1929 on Bainbridge Island, a 30-minute ferry ride from Seattle. Their lives, and in turn, mine, were forever altered by the events of Dec. 7, 1941. The bombing of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent internment of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans under Executive Order 9066 cast a long shadow over our family narrative, embedding a sense of cautious belonging that followed us through generations. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); For my family, travel was tinged with the remnants of these fears. The echoes of internment camps, World War II and its lingering aftermath shaped a world where movements were guarded and the concept of belonging was complex. My childhood was thus a small universe anchored to the West Coast, with my dad feeling that we weren’t welcome in much of the U.S. due to being Asian. His beliefs were based on his own experiences, both during and after the war. As a child and young adult, I had unconsciously adopted these beliefs as my own. The author (right) as a child with Henry and Lilian Aoyama, her adoptive parents, both of whom are now deceased. Courtesy of Shari Leid Advertisement The inception of the 50 States Project was a declaration of my desire to transcend these inherited boundaries. It was an ambitious quest to forge connections across America and to discover that the essence of belonging is not about the physical spaces we occupy but the moments we share and the communities we build. As the United States grapples with its place on the global happiness scale , sliding in the rankings of the world’s happiest countries, this journey felt even more poignant. This wasn’t just about personal exploration; it was a reflection on what binds us in the pursuit of happiness. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Diving into this journey — and finding a connection in each state — was a daunting task. I started with familiar faces from my inbox: podcasters, vendors, the kind of people you feel like you know because you’ve traded emails or shared a laugh over a call. Yet, we’d never actually seen each other — not in the real, stand-in-the-same-room kind of way. Then there were the blasts from my past: friends who had drifted into the background noise of life, voices I hadn’t heard in over three decades. Reaching out to them felt like unearthing a time capsule buried in the backyard of my youth, dusting it off and peeking inside with bated breath. From this mix of the known and the long-lost, I connected with 27 women from 27 different states who were willing to take time out of their busy lives to share a meal with me. The author (right) with Kate in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, one of the stops on the 50 States Project. Courtesy of Shari Leid During the next phase, I turned to the digital world and threw out a call for connections in the gaps of my map in a professional group I frequented online. The response was heartwarming, with strangers reaching out to help me achieve my goal and sending well wishes for my endeavor. Social media was my last stop. Within a month of beginning my project, I had a beautiful, complete roster of women across all 50 states ready to break bread with me. This group of women — ranging in age from their 20s to their 60s and differing in race, education level, political and religious beliefs, sexual orientation and household income — provided the perfect mosaic for my journey. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The individual stories I encountered on this journey painted a vivid picture of America’s heart. In Connecticut, I met Kate, whose resilience in the face of her husband’s terminal illness underscored the strength found in community support. Her story, set against the backdrop of hospice care and the tireless web of friends and family that supported her, reminded me of the profound impact of human connection. Maine introduced me to Cameron, whose life, marked by numerous relocations, had found joy in the community she built around her, wherever she found herself. Our time together, which included collecting lobsters from local fishermen for a shared meal at her home, was a lesson in the art of creating a home wherever you are — a testament to the idea that belonging is about people, not places. As beautiful as my experiences were, I was also confronted by the darker threads of our nation’s fabric. On one part of the journey, just after I landed in Ohio, I passed a white supremacist rally that was taking place. Seeing it was a jarring reminder of the deep-seated divisions still present in our country. This encounter, as unsettling as it was, emphasized the significance of my project in navigating these divisions. The author (right) with Farrah in Cleveland, one of the stops on the 50 States Project. Courtesy of Shari Leid Despite its challenges, the project was a beacon of hope and understanding. Farrah, who was born and raised in Ohio, felt like a long-lost friend from the moment we met. She and I sat for hours at a restaurant she chose, and the waitress even commented that she thought we were best friends, not strangers who had just met. Afterward, I kept thinking about how amazing it was that I initially felt so uncomfortable in that state, only for someone from there to make me feel so at home and welcome. So much so that I found myself already making plans to return to Ohio to visit her. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Then, traveling to meet Twanna, who grew up in the only Black family in her town in West Virginia, expanded my understanding of connection beyond race. Her perspective on seeing friends as family — on the power of deep connections that transcend superficial differences — was a lesson in the joy of inclusivity. These are just some of the women who shared their experiences with me — and changed my own life in the process. This journey wasn’t just about ticking off states on a map. It was a heart-opening trek across the emotional landscapes of people’s lives and a deep dive into the corners of my own heart that I hadn’t explored. It taught me something vital: the places I longed to see were merely backdrops to the true adventure — connecting with others, hearing their stories and sharing moments of genuine laughter and companionship over meals. I transformed my belief from a fearful “I am not welcome” to a confident “I can find people everywhere who will welcome me.” More importantly, I learned that happiness and a sense of belonging sprout from these shared experiences, from understanding and acknowledging our collective past as we weave our present and future together. Bringing this spirit of discovery home, I’ve made it a point to reach out to old friends and invite new acquaintances to sit down and share a meal. There’s a unique magic in breaking bread with someone, whether they hold the same beliefs as you or see the world through a different lens. Every invitation is extended with genuine curiosity — an eagerness to understand and connect that turns a simple meal into a bridge between hearts. This practice, this simple act of gathering and sharing, doesn’t require an ambitious project or extensive travel. It’s something we can all do in the communities we live in with each other. Imagine if each of us took the time to invite a neighbor over to share a meal and stories — how much richer and happier our collective lives could be. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The author (right) with Twanna in Beckley, West Virginia, one of the stops on the 50 States Project. Courtesy of Shari Leid In these times, when so much in our society feels strained or even broken, this act of reaching out and fostering connections is more important than ever. The women of the 50 States Project are now connected through this experience, and we have Zoom calls every two months as they get to know one another virtually with hopes of one day meeting in person. My experience is a call to action for all of us — an invitation to create connections that can bolster the happiness and sense of belonging in our country. So, I encourage you, in your own way, to start this journey in your own neighborhood, one meal at a time. Together, we can create a ripple of connection that just might turn the tide, making our community and country a little happier — one shared story at a time.

    "article_content": "Contributing Writer Some people may believe that the end of Roe v. Wade was simply a matter of luck: Following the then-black swan event of Donald Trump winning the 2016 election, Trump got to appoint two Supreme Court Justices in his first two years and a third after an octogenarian passed away weeks before the 2020 election. The court then had a 6-3 conservative supermajority, and that was that. But the project to overturn the federal right to abortion was much more calculated, involving an alliance of Republican groups aiming to reshape Congress, the courts and American life. And while conservatives may have won a huge battle, it’s not the end of their unholy war. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); That’s the story New York Times reporters Elizabeth Dias and Lisa Lerer tell in their new book, “The Fall of Roe,” a deeply reported accounting of the machinations of anti-abortion activists and lawmakers to reverse the 1973 ruling that reshaped both society and women’s lives. The book recounts the conservative network’s past victories, yes, but is also a window into the future, highlighting just how crucial November’s elections are for our rights and freedoms. That’s because if Trump wins a second term, this conservative coalition will bring even more litigation to strip away people’s rights — and would likely face a Supreme Court that’s even more untouchable than it is now. \"While conservatives may have won a huge battle, it's not the end of their unholy war,\" says writer Susan Rinkunas, describing the message of journalists Elizabeth Dias and Lisa Lerer in their new book, \"The Fall of Roe.\" Photo: Flatiron Books The group most connected to Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe, is Alliance Defending Freedom, a far-right Christian advocacy group. But ADF certainly didn’t do it alone, per Dias and Lerer — correspondents on religion and politics, respectively. In many ways, two other organizations laid the groundwork for this victory: The Federalist Society, a judicial group that drafted a list of Trump’s Supreme Court nominees, judges Trump said were all opposed to Roe ; and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion political group with an affiliated PAC. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); And they’re all funded with massive amounts of dark money , including from billionaires like the Koch brothers . The 30,000-foot view is that these groups worked together to draft and pass unpopular state laws and have conservative lawyers defend them in front of friendly judges who had been confirmed to lifetime appointments by Republican senators. The network could use this playbook on any number of issues in the future. ADF wrote Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban at issue in the Dobbs litigation. Dias and Lerer report that a conservative Wisconsin lawyer suggested crafting a ban at exactly 15 weeks basically as a dare for abortion rights proponents to challenge it, believing the Supreme Court would find the ban reasonable and gut Roe without fully overturning it. The lawyer, Misha Tseytlin, allegedly floated the idea at a Trump victory party hosted by Federalist Society Chair Leonard Leo , and then someone connected to ADF heard it, and the organization had Tseytlin present his theory at a July 2017 ADF summit. (This story shows that conservatives picked 15 weeks not because of emerging medical research, but because abortion rights advocates had chosen not to sue over previous 20-week bans designed to challenge Roe .) ADF drafted a model bill, identified states that might pass it and that had anti-abortion attorneys general who would defend it, and started talking to lobbyists. Then-Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) signed the 15-week ban into law in 2018, and litigation began. By the time the Supreme Court was considering taking the case, it was early September 2020. Then Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, and Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett, giving a 5-4 court a 6-3 conservative supermajority, with three Justices appointed by Trump — a president who lost the popular vote. The court agreed to hear the case in May 2021, and the rest is history. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); That playbook worked for striking down Roe , but the coalition is not done. Dias and Lerer write that ADF, in particular, will “work to restore an understanding of marriage, the family and sexuality that reflects God’s creative order.” First, abortion opponents think Dobbs is not enough; they want a nationwide ban starting at egg fertilization. ADF is involved in two abortion-related Supreme Court cases this term, and Kristen Waggoner, its CEO and general counsel, admitted in March that its lawsuit over the abortion pill , mifepristone, is part of a long-term strategy to restrict abortion at the federal level because Dobbs was never the end goal. What is? A nationwide abortion ban rooted in the view that life begins when an egg is fertilized. “We believe that human life is precious, that it deserves protection from conception until natural death,” Waggoner told Politico this past March. “We believe that the 14th Amendment protects persons and that includes unborn persons, and that the right to life is protected in the Constitution and in our founding document.” The legal theory of personhood from fertilization could also be weaponized against the right to use contraception established in 1965’s Griswold v. Connecticut — a precedent Justice Clarence Thomas called on the court to overrule . Though many anti-abortion activists falsely claim that certain methods of birth control are abortions because they prevent fertilized eggs from implanting in the uterus, Waggoner chafed at the suggestion that ADF’s positions could lead to restrictions on contraception. She told Politico that “ADF has never advocated for limitations on access to contraception” while later conceding that it’s all about how you define abortion and contraception . “I’m getting uncomfortable with the way you’re asking questions, because the mechanism of action for birth control is different depending on what that birth control is,” she said, per Politico . “For example, Ella would be considered an abortifacient.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Ella is emergency contraception , and no credible doctor thinks it causes abortions, yet multiple states are already trying to legally reclassify emergency contraception as abortion. (Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst even explained her vote against the Right to Contraception Act by saying that she introduced a separate bill that doesn’t protect emergency contraception .) This is an area to watch in the coming months and years. But getting the court to declare fetal personhood might take a while, and a backup plan appears to be trying to resuscitate the Comstock Act of 1873. ADF is arguing in the abortion pill case that the long-dormant anti-vice law means no one can mail abortion pills to other states, even those where abortion is legal. And in arguments, two justices seemed open to the idea . Anti-abortion lawyer Jonathan Mitchell — the man who wrote the Texas bounty hunter law that nullified Roe months before Dobbs — is working with activist Mark Lee Dickson to pass local ordinances claiming Comstock bans the mailing of abortion pills. And he’s deploying the same tactic of pro-bono legal representation that ADF used in Mississippi. Mitchell told The Nation he hopes to get lawsuits over the measures in front of the Supreme Court “as quickly as possible.” (Mitchell, I must note, is also litigating a case that gutted minors’ access to birth control in Texas.) ADF also has its sights set on reversing the 2015 ruling establishing marriage equality , but Waggoner also seems to resent when journalists ask her about Obergefell v. Hodges . (That ruling was 5-4, and two of the Justices in the majority are no longer on the court — you only need four votes out of nine to take a case.) “I’m worried you’re gonna just use a choice little quote, and anybody that reads the article is going to think I’m abandoning Obergefell , and I am not,” she told The New Yorker . “I think it is wrong and it should be reversed, but I don’t wake up in the morning thinking about how to do that.” The group wants to roll back transgender rights in employment ( Bostock v. Clayton County , 2020) and expand parental rights ( Troxel v. Granville , 2000) so that parents can override the medical needs of their children with gender dysphoria, The New Yorker reports. ADF is also behind the rash of state laws banning gender-affirming care for minors and trans kids’ participation in sports — the group wrote model legislation. W e’re watching a redux of the anti-abortion battle plan in real time. “It’s not that the Court is going to say, ‘Gender ideology is bad,’” Waggoner told The New Yorker . “But I do think the Court could say, ‘Parental rights are fundamental rights.’” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); This far-right Christian coalition is coming for practically every civil right people in the U.S. have gained since the 1960s. It wants to oppress queer people, young people and women, and there are very few obstacles in the way of it getting everything it wants. That’s the larger message of “The Fall of Roe” — that religious conservatives are extremely organized and see their work as far from over. The next president could appoint multiple Supreme Court justices who may be asked to rule on cases challenging the precedents in the crosshairs of ADF, the Federalist Society and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito could retire, cementing a 6-3 court for another generation — or the balance could tip even further to 7-2 should tragedy befall a liberal Justice. Our freedoms in this country currently depend on the life expectancy of nine unelected people in robes, and the court absolutely needs reforms, including term limits. Keep all the right’s larger project in mind when you vote this fall, because this network of groups is counting on people to tune out.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington in Season 3 of Netflix's \"Bridgerton.\" Liam Daniel/Netflix “Who needs fresh air when there is fresh gossip?” quips Lady Danbury in the opening minutes of the second half of “Bridgerton” Season 3. It’s a sentiment to which both members of the ton ― that is, the upper stratum of society depicted in “Bridgerton” ― and fans of the show can relate, especially those who have been waiting four long weeks to hear Penelope’s answer to Colin’s post-carriage marriage proposal. It spoils nothing to reveal that Penelope (played by Nicola Coughlan) says yes, or that she shares her news with the ton in her next installment of her gossip column, Lady Whistledown’s Society Papers: “Dearest Reader, while most seasons of our fair marriage mart follow a predictable pattern, this author likes it most when there is a surprise.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Their engagement may be a shock to members of the ton, but both it and the progression of Colin (Luke Newton) and Penelope from friends to lovers will not surprise the viewer. The tension of Colin not knowing Penelope’s hidden identity, the threat her writing poses, and the implied social dangers of this revelation are predictable. Instead, the true surprise of this season’s final four episodes is not the friends-to-lovers romance but the way “Bridgerton” highlights friendships, especially those between women, and the way it follows in the tradition of spinoff “Queen Charlotte” to explore what marriage really means. While the first two seasons largely focus on why people get married (whether for love, duty or stability), this season follows in the footsteps of “Queen Charlotte” to examine what marriage means for a woman. How does it grant agency? How does it constrain it? What do you do if, like Penelope, you’ve managed to find independence and are now faced with the realities of giving it up? “Tick Tock,” the first episode of the season’s second half, opens with Colin leading Penelope into the drawing room of Bridgerton House to announce the news of their engagement to his family, including his betrothed’s former best friend, Eloise (Claudia Jessie). The news, and the fact that her brother still doesn’t know that Penelope is Whistledown, enrages Eloise. Her anger becomes even more complicated when Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel) announces a large monetary reward for anyone who can unmask the writer’s identity. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); In the second half of the season, the external threats posed by Queen Charlotte and Eloise (and her new friend Cressida Cowper, played by Jessica Madsen) are contrasted with the internal struggle Penelope faces. Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington and Polly Walker as Lady Portia Featherington in Season 3 of \"Bridgerton.\" Liam Daniel/Netflix “Ladies do not have dreams. They have husbands,” Lady Featherington (Polly Walker) tells her daughter shortly after the engagement, when Penelope feels she must give up her writing to become a wife. In this context, Penelope’s desire to have both a pen in her hand and a ring on her finger is just another way of posing the age-old question: Can you, especially if you’re a woman, have it all? To answer this question for herself while navigating the external threats of her hidden identity, Penelope turns to the women in her life. The conflict between Penelope and Colin drives the romance-focused plot, but these female-driven friendships, and the larger themes they explore, are what make the second half of this season worth watching, offering proof that the character development in the show is paying off. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The second half of the season shines in Penelope’s interactions, and ripples outward to touch Eloise’s relationship with Francesca (Hannah Dodd) and the Featherington family’s relationships with each other. Penelope gets a deeper understanding of her mother and the imperfect decisions she’s made, finds a way to repair her broken relationship with Eloise, and starts to show her sisters grace and opens herself up to receiving it back from them. This season’s joy is also felt in the friendships of the ton’s older set, especially among Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh), Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) and Queen Charlotte, who must all, in their own ways, reexamine the past to move forward (especially the part of the past that involves handmade birthday hats and feelings of powerlessness in the face of power). Some of the best moments occur when the older and younger women interact, especially the mothers and their daughters and Lady Danbury and Penelope. The emotion and depth of these female interactions are wonderful, but they make the second half of Colin and Penelope’s story feel shallow. Colin wants to be her knight in shining armor, but she does not want to be rescued — and he doesn’t know how to redefine his definition of “husband” or “masculinity” to accept Penelope as Whistledown, or support her when her identity is discovered. Luke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton, Hannah New as Lady Tilley Arnold, Luke Newton as Colin Bridgerton and Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington in episode 5 of the new season of \"Bridgerton.\" Liam Daniel/Netflix While Simon (Regé-Jean Page) and Anthony (Jonathan Bailey) had seasons that delved fully into their emotional worlds, Colin is not given the same treatment. This shortcoming turns the moments when Colin is challenged to change his stereotypical thinking or behavior into echoes of present-day masculinity crises , and ultimately makes the pair’s relationship, and the show as a whole, feel unbalanced. Colin is not given the opportunity to redefine what it means to be a husband in the same way that Penelope redefines what it means to be a wife. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); This shortfall is most apparent in the season’s climax, a moment at the last ball of the season that is so cheesy and over-the-top and full of on-the-nose CGI butterflies (Penelope’s transformation is complete!) that it borders on unwatchable. It undermines the depth the show has fought so hard to create — the loose threads it has woven did not need to be tied up into such a perfect bow. However, despite the overwrought ending, the female friendships of this third season’s second half won me over. While there has been criticism this year that the show is too predictable and potentially growing stale, I find ― leaving the ending aside ― that it uses the tropes and patterns of the romance genre to its advantage. In this way, the constraints of this traditionally feminine type of storytelling mirror the constraints traditionally imposed upon women. As “Bridgerton” depicts female characters finding their power in a society that constantly denies it to them, it parallels the way Shonda Rhimes and new showrunner Jess Brownell have reimagined a genre to amplify women’s voices. (They just need to remember those voices don’t always need a cheesy monologue accompanied by special effects.) Ultimately, this season proved that Penelope’s identity as Whistledown doesn’t negate her writing’s influence, and the same is true for “Bridgerton’s” classification as fun genre television. Relegating Penelope’s society paper to “just gossip” robs her words of their larger power in the same way that criticizing “Bridgerton” for its genre-defining characteristics undermines its impact. Both instances are further proof of what tends to happen when women create something commercially successful to be consumed largely by other women, especially when that something portrays sex and can be denigrated as a “guilty pleasure.” It may be two long years before the show’s next installment, but I’ll be looking forward to both the promise of another swoony, predictable romance and the voices of my favorite women in the ton. I expect the fourth season (presumably about Benedict) to follow the same patterns and tropes as the others, and I also anticipate it will use the female characters and friendships it’s developed to give those genre hallmarks greater depth. Hopefully, the next season can do the same for its leading man.

Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “I’m not going to wade you into the Seinfeld controversy because I think it has nothing to do with you, but I’d love to know what you think is funny now ... I think there’s a lot of talk about how comics can’t be funny now,” Swisher said. “I think that’s bullshit. Physical comedy and intellectual comedy, political comedy — I think, has never been more interesting because there’s so much to do,” Louis-Dreyfus said. “Comedy is risky, and it can be offensive, but that’s what makes it so enjoyable,” she added. “I personally don’t buy the conceit that this is an impossible time to be funny,” she continued. “Maybe some people aren’t laughing at your jokes, but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be made.” Louis-Dreyfus did not mention her former “Seinfeld” co-star while making the remarks. Seinfeld’s comments in an April New Yorker interview made headlines that month. In the interview, he asserted that the “extreme left and P.C. crap” was hurting televised comedy. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); In a New York Times profile published earlier this month, Louis-Dreyfus was asked about the controversial take, and she pushed back , saying it was a “red flag” to hear people complain about political correctness.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost Getty Images In 2024, being a food influencer seems like a pretty great gig. Influencers get to sit at home and bake delicious food, take pictures and videos of it, and then eat it (or give it to their friends, who will love them extra for it). As their follower counts grow on Instagram and TikTok, their feeds and Stories become populated with ads, for which we all assume they’re getting a solid chunk of change. But how much, exactly? According to Alice, an influencer and cookbook author whose name has been changed here to protect her identity, the truth is that it varies widely. Alice has about 500,000 Instagram followers, but pay rates don’t always depend on the amount of followers someone has. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “There’s a super broad range — I know influencers who have 500,000 followers and are making $150,000 a year, and I know ones with the same following who are making a million dollars a year,” she said. “It’s all about your engagement and how you monetize.” While Alice asked to remain anonymous, she was willing to get real about how much money she makes as a food influencer and recipe developer. Read on for all the juicy details, like how much she actually gets from ads, what her expenses look like, and exactly how much money she made in 2023 ― and how that stacks up against the mental health toll of being an influencer. Advertisement Here’s how much someone with 500,000 followers is probably making from Instagram ads You know that sponsored reel you just watched in your favorite influencer’s feed? They probably made a lot of money on it. “If you have 500,000 followers, you can probably expect to make about $10,000 to $20,000 on an Instagram reel, but that will depend on your engagement,” Alice said. By “engagement,” she means the number of people actually liking or commenting on posts. An influencer can have a lot of followers, but if those followers aren’t engaging with their account, a brand knows they won’t see much conversion from that. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); For Instagram Stories, Alice says an influencer will probably make a little bit less. “For three to five Instagram Stories, you can probably expect to get between $1,000 and $5,000, but again, there’s a range.” Expenses are steep While influencers might make a lot of money, they’re also spending it. “Expenses are high, especially for recipe development,” Alice said. “But I think a huge expense people don’t think about is looking good on camera, so lots of influencers spend a ton on hair, makeup and clothing, and feel a lot of pressure around how they look because they’re on camera all the time. I probably spend around $1,000 a month on all of this.” She also has a team of people helping her out, and they get a chunk of her monthly revenue as well. “Your manager or agent will take 15%,” she said. “If you’re an author and have a literary agent, they take 15% of your earnings. If you pay for PR it’s $5,000 to $10,000 a month. And lawyer costs (yes, lawyers are advised) are between $10,000 and $30,000 per year.” The exact amount of money Alice made in 2023 Now, the question you’ve all been waiting for: How much did Alice make in 2023? “I made about $900,000,” she said. “But that’s before expenses and taxes. And I had a lot of expenses last year.” Alice also noted that while she has published three books over the past seven years, including one in 2023, they don’t bring in much money compared with what she makes from social media and other avenues. “Books are great brand builders, but they’re not huge moneymakers,” she said.

Sure. But she also emphasized that there’s a mental health toll that comes from being always “on” and feeling the need to produce content for her followers 24/7 — not to mention the negative comments and messages that an influencer can expect to receive regularly. “I took zero days off last year,” she said. “I think if you’re going to talk influencer income, you also need to talk about how the vast majority of influencers are dealing with huge mental health issues from the job.” So while the world of influencing may be high-paying and glamorous, Alice is the first to admit that it comes with a price — and not the price you’re paying your lawyer or literary agent.

Logging on from home can help people manage their professional and personal responsibilities, allowing someone to pick up their children from school, for example, or squeeze in a workout during a lunch break. But remote work has also blurred the line that marks where the workplace ends and home begins, with many workers hopping back online throughout the evening and into the night to complete their assigned tasks before a deadline. The struggle to achieve that elusive work-life balance remains. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); An employer’s policies and workplace culture have a huge impact on how you are able to juggle work and a personal life, but the country you reside in also plays a decisive role. Laws regarding paid leave vary considerably across the globe, as does the average number of hours that workers put in. Compare the Market Australia, a company that provides comparisons of insurance rates, recently ranked 40 countries by the work-life balance they offer. Each nation’s 2024 standing was determined by eight factors: the average number of hours worked per year, minimums regarding paid annual leave and sick leave, maternity and paternity leave lengths and rates, and the country’s happiness score , based on Gallup World Poll surveys. Advertisement “Each of the factors was weighted equally when producing the final score,” Hannah Norton, a spokesperson for Compare the Market, told HuffPost. Nations in Europe dominated the entire first half of the list, “which indicates that the region does a great job of supporting employees in maintaining a positive work-life balance,” Norton said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Spain clinched the No. 1 spot, offering workers 30 days of annual paid leave and six (or more) weeks of paid sick leave, while also paying parents 100% of their salaries during their leaves. Most notably, Spain extends similar leaves to both mothers (16 weeks) and fathers (12 weeks), and grants significantly more leave to dads than most other countries. The next most generous paternal leaves are found in neighboring Portugal (five weeks at 100%) and Slovenia (four weeks at 100%). The first 20 countries on the list are: Spain. Luxembourg. France. The Netherlands. Finland. Bulgaria. Slovenia. Estonia. Lithuania. Austria. Portugal. Sweden. Denmark. Poland. Italy. Romania. Belgium. Hungary. Latvia. Greece. All of these countries offer 20-30 paid vacation days and six or more weeks of paid sick leave annually. Bulgaria offers the most maternity leave by far: 58 weeks at 90%. Greece offers no paternity leave at all, while the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy and Romania offer only one week. People in Germany (which does not rank in the top 20 overall) work the fewest hours annually, averaging 1,340.9. Workers in Denmark are next, logging 1,371.6 hours, followed by Norwegians at 1,424.6. Denmark also achieved one of the highest scores on the happiness index, topped only by Finland . Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria were high scorers as well. South American countries (none of which appears in the top 20 overall) earned the top three slots for the most hours worked. Colombians log the most, with 2,405.5 hours a year — 1.8 times as many as German workers. Mexico (with 2,226.3 hours) and Chile (with 1,962.8 hours) are close behind. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); In the U.S., the average for workers falls between their South American and European counterparts, at 1,810.9 hours worked per year. But it is our dismal lack of paid leave — annual, sick and family — that earned us the very last spot on the list overall. Canada and Ireland also ranked toward the bottom, Norton said. Surprisingly, then, the U.S. “performed reasonably well when it came to happiness score — the nation was 14th out of 40 countries for this factor, with a happiness score of 6.89,” Norton said. While we may be relatively happy overall, the early years of parenthood are a time of intense pressure for many U.S. families, who struggle to care for their children and make a living without the guarantees of paid leave or subsidized child care . Sherry Leiwant , a co-founder and co-president of A Better Balance, an organization that advocates for workers, described the situation to HuffPost: “At present, only 27% of private sector workers in the U.S. have access to paid family leave, which translates to almost 100 million U.S. workers without any access to paid family leave.” Yet these numbers have improved dramatically, Leiwant explained. In 2010, only 12% of private sector workers had access to paid family leave. These battles have been won not in boardrooms but in state legislatures, with 13 states plus Washington, D.C., having passed laws guaranteeing some weeks of family leave paid at a portion of a worker’s salary. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Still, the situation remains a “crisis,” Dawn Huckelbridge , the director of Paid Leave for All, an advocacy organization, told HuffPost. “As it stands, the United States is one of seven countries in the world that guarantees no form of paid leave for its people,” she said. “Only 1 in 4 of us have paid family leave through our jobs — and among the lowest-paid workers, it’s only 6%.” A mother returning to work just days after giving birth is a uniquely American phenomenon, Huckelbridge said. And the repercussions can be devastating. Families face losing their housing or food security if they are forced to take unpaid leave or quit their jobs to care for a family member. Paid leave, on the other hand, not only protects families from poverty, but keeps women connected to the workforce. “Paid leave is a tool for public health; it reduces infant and maternal mortality and postpartum depression, it improves physical and mental health for whole families and communities,” Huckelbridge said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Though critics often suggest that paid leave would be bad for business, advocates say that the opposite is true. Paid leave “enables employers to offer a benefit to their workers at very little cost to them,” Leiwant said. “The advantage for smaller or less profitable businesses is especially strong since those employers don’t have the resources to offer a strong paid family leave benefit and can’t compete on this important employee benefit with larger employers who can offer it.” Because the premiums for such programs (in the states where they have been enacted) “are spread out over all workers and employers,” they remain low and affordable for businesses, Leiwant noted. “The cost of premiums has been consistently small because it is spread out over all workers and employers in the state to pay benefits only when there is a covered need,” she continued. “Premium costs have remained low in all states (under 1%) and if premiums were spread out among all U.S. workers the costs would be similarly low for a national program.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Both Leiwant and Huckelbridge noted that the estimated economic loss of not having paid leave on a national level is around $22 billion per year. “Nearly every other country in the world has figured this out,” Huckelbridge said. “If we want to remain competitive in the world and a 21st century economy, we can’t afford not to pass paid leave.” Related Work work life balance paid leave The 10 Worst States To Have A Baby (And The 10 Best) These Are The 20 Best Cities For Working Parents These Are The 10 Most Family-Friendly Cities In The U.S. Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up An essential daily guide to achieving the good life Subscribe to our lifestyle email.

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost d3sign via Getty Images Taxes can be incredibly confusing, expensive and frustrating, leading to a series of errors. Tax season has rolled around once again, and so has the inevitable dread that comes with it. It’s understandable that a lot of us worry we’ll make one small, accidental mistake and then get in “big trouble” with the IRS after. W hen it comes to something as complicated and serious as taxes, it’s sometimes hard to feel confident that you’re doing it right. Enter accountants. Their entire job is to make sure their clients’ taxes ― and their own taxes ― are all squared away and mistake free. That’s why we asked them to share what they personally would never do (and warn others from doing) when filing. Steal their secrets below as you work on yours: Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); 1. They would never file without being sure all documents are in. For one, this means reporting all of your income, no matter how small. “If I were to file my tax return without reporting some income that was reported to me on my tax return, the IRS would likely catch it, calculate what my taxes should have been had I reported that income — often without giving me any credit for legitimate deductions or basis against that income — and send me a CP2000 notice,” said Logan Allec , a CPA and the owner of tax relief company Choice Tax Relief. He added that CP2000 notices are a pain to deal with and “might even propose to assess a substantial understatement penalty, which can be quite large.” Advertisement Documentation regards more than just income, too. To figure out what documents you specifically need to file, check out an individualized tax document checklist . For example, you may have extra documentation if you have dependents, student loans and more. Additionally, Allec suggested the following: Making a list of all the tax documents used to prepare the previous year’s return Recalling any new accounts opened, or new sources of income to add to the list Alternatively, another approach is to pull the wage and income transcript for the year directly from the IRS, he said, which shows all the tax documents that were issued to you that year. “However, since wage and income transcripts for last year typically aren’t ready until late spring or summer of the current year, I would have to file an extension of time to file and also ensure that I had paid in all the taxes I owe for last year (or my best estimate of this amount) by the original deadline,” he continued. 2. They wouldn’t rush to file instead of filing for an extension. It’s indeed OK to ask for an extension if needed, according to Victoria Rothbauer , a CPA and member experience manager at Collective , a back office platform for entrepreneurs. “An extension is just a tool to help relieve stress and ensure taxes are accurate,” she said. “They are free to file and, contrary to popular belief, it doesn’t raise red flags if you file an extension.” (You can file for an extension on the IRS website .) Further, rushing increases the risk of making a mistake, she continued, and extra time can be used to research tax deductions and make retirement contributions, which lower your taxable income. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “Just keep in mind an extension gives you more time to file your taxes, not pay them,” she said. Paying late can result in extra fees . 3. They wouldn’t file without understanding the rules behind tax deductions. Don’t write off items without doing your due diligence. “There’s a lot of bad advice out there promoting overly aggressive tax strategies without fully explaining the rules or requirements to take advantage of these deductions,” Allec said. “A common one is using bonus depreciation to write off the majority of the cost of a new car against your business income this year,” he continued. That’s not automatically illegitimate, he said, just one to be careful about since the rules and requirements are complex. “If you don’t want to spend the time researching the rules yourself, hire a tax professional to do your taxes for you,” he recommended. “The cost of doing so will be much less than the cost of hiring a professional to defend you in an IRS audit.” Ekaterina Goncharova via Getty Images Working for yourself can come with a lot of freedom — and complicated taxes. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 4. They wouldn’t deduct a business expense for something that isn’t 100% part of their business. Rothbauer also stressed that it’s best to understand what counts (and doesn’t count) as a tax deduction. “There are several deductions available to people who work for themselves, but the IRS maintains that anything deducted needs to be exclusively used for business,” she said. The rules around that are fairly strict, too. She recalled clients asking about emotional support animals, exercise bikes in the home office, event tickets for wooing new clients, home office space used to entertain guests, and wedding or event costs for content creators — all of which can’t be deducted, she said, since they aren’t used exclusively for business purposes (as helpful as they may be). But all is not lost. “I would familiarize myself with what is deductive instead,” she said. She listed potential examples that can save you a lot of money, such as retirement plans for the self-employed, charitable donations, portions of a home office and certain mileage. 5. They would not claim a loss without top-notch bookkeeping and receipts. For those who don’t know, Schedule C , aka Form 1040, is where you “report income or loss from a business you operated or a profession you practiced as a sole proprietor,” according to the IRS website. “The IRS loves auditing individual taxpayers who report large business losses on Schedule C, especially if the taxpayer is using this loss to offset other income, such as W-2 wage income, to lower their tax bill,” Allec said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); If your business did have actual loss for the year, he recommended keeping very good books and receipts throughout the year to substantiate the loss. That way, if you are audited, he said, it will hopefully end in “no-change” audit result. 6. They wouldn’t ignore the S Corporation tax election if they’re self-employed. For those in the creator economy , this one is especially important to note. “Running a solo business is becoming increasingly accessible, and people are realizing that they can profitably pursue their passions,” Rothbauer said. “But a lot of these business owners don’t understand what tax options are available to them, and one that is missed out on a lot is the S Corp election.” Basically, it can help with self-employment taxes. “When an LLC or C Corp owner elects ‘Subchapter S’ as their tax status, their business is considered a pass-through entity, so the owner can split their earnings between payroll and business profits, easing the burden of self-employment tax,” Rothbauer explained. “For many, it can potentially be a difference of thousands of dollars in taxes each year.” This tax status isn’t viable or the best option for everyone who’s self-employed, however. Rothbauer said it’s not available to sole proprietorships, and it only makes sense once someone is making a profit of $60,000 a year or more. Finally, don’t forget to double check your work before submitting. And remember that if this information (or just the idea of tax season) stresses you out, you’re not alone. A lot of people worry about filing taxes ― but there are a bunch of resources (and people!) out there to help you tackle the process successfully. Reach out to a tax pro or use online tools to help assist you in the process.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life MStudioImages via Getty Images Before you book a \"travel dupe,\" there are a few points to keep in mind. From “hush trips” to “slow travel,” there’s no shortage of new travel trends and terminology these days. But one that has taken particular hold on social media and IRL is the concept of “dupe travel” or “travel dupes.” Indeed, Instagram and TikTok are flooded with inspiration and information about this increasingly popular approach to choosing a destination. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); But what exactly is a dupe travel, and how does it work? Below, experts break down the benefits and downsides of this trend. What are travel dupes? “Travel dupes are a current trend where folks are seeking out cheaper, less-crowded alternatives to popular destinations, but where they can still enjoy many of the same attractions or cultural activities,” said Eric Rosen , the director of travel content at the website The Points Guy. Advertisement In recent years, we’ve seen airfare, hotel rates and other travel expenses increase significantly , so it’s only natural people would pursue more cost-effective options that allow them to get a taste of the wanderlust magic that’s all over Instagram and TikTok without breaking the bank. “I define [a travel dupe] as a location with a similar aesthetic look to a famous city or tourist attraction,” said Gabby Beckford , the founder of travel site Packs Light. “Like visiting the Philippines for stunning Southeast Asian beaches instead of Thailand or the beaches of Turkiye instead of Greece.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); The idea is to avoid overpriced hot spots and discover destinations that offer similar vibes without the massive crowds and high prices. Think Slovenia instead of Italy, Quebec City instead of Geneva or Liverpool instead of London. “Some examples are going to Portugal instead of Italy, Antwerp instead of Paris, or a slightly different variation is going to smaller, lesser-known islands in Greece instead of Santorini or Mykonos,” said Wendy Diep, the co-founder of group travel app Let’s Jetty . She noted that millennial and Gen Z travelers tend to be more flexible when it comes to travel, which helps them pursue their goal of exploring new places while saving money. “They’re not necessarily saying ‘Hey, I really have to go to X, Y, and Z,’ but rather looking to sightsee while experiencing local culture,” Diep said. “And they aim to visit places that are off the beaten path, so it’s also part of the appeal.” What are the benefits of this kind of travel? “There are multiple benefits to dupe travel,” Diep noted. “One of the biggest is obviously cost savings. You can save money on accommodations and airfare, particularly since prices at hot spots are usually set at premiums because of demand.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “And even more, when you visit destinations where the costs of living might be lower, or things aren’t marked up because of heavy tourism, you’re able to stretch your money further, which allows you to do more, or even have luxe experiences you wouldn’t necessarily be able to afford everywhere,” she added. Diep also touted the ability to have a more authentic travel experience and get a real feel for the place when you choose a less touristy destination. “Among the benefits of dupe travel are discovering exciting, under-the-radar destinations that you might not have considered otherwise ― Albania for its beaches, forest-covered mountains and fabulous wines instead of the French or Italian rivieras, or the sleepy beaches of 30A along Florida’s Gulf Coast instead of the crowded club touristy shores of Miami Beach ― all while saving money compared to more well-known hot spots,” Rosen said. In this day and age, social media is filled with travelers sharing new destination ideas and money-saving travel hacks, so you don’t even have to put in too much effort to get creative and savvy with your next vacation. Connor Smith, vice president of masterbrand strategy at IHG Hotels & Resorts noted that the #dupe hashtag on TikTok has more than 6.5 billion views, reflecting the wealth of information available to travelers and consumers looking to avoid the sticker shock of shopping and vacationing in recent years. He recommended checking out Krakow instead of Rome, Chattanooga instead of Asheville, Belfast instead of London and Memphis instead of Nashville. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “These alternative destinations tend to be more budget-friendly, so your travel budget can stretch further in terms of accommodation, dining and activities,” he explained. “Dupe travel also encourages travelers to push their boundaries and explore new destinations and cultures that they might not have considered otherwise. Going off the beaten path can offer a more immersive cultural experience, as these destinations may have more opportunities to connect with locals.” Pyrosky via Getty Images Overall, \"dupe travel\" can be a great way to see the world and stay within a budget. What are the downsides? “Because they might be less popular, dupe destinations might not offer as many transportation options, including flights, trains or easily available rental cars as bigger cities,” Rosen said. And although you can find great social media posts about pretty much any destination these days, you will likely have to do a bit more digging to find reliable, up-to-date information on places to stay and things to do. “Finally, once these destinations do start to permeate the consciousness of avid travelers, there’s always a danger that they can become as overrun as the places to which they were providing alternatives ― without the well-established tourism infrastructure to handle the swelling crowds,” Rosen added. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Keep in mind that no two destinations are exactly alike, either. “Tourists should be realistic that it won’t be a true replacement,” Beckford said. “There’s no way to replace a country’s culture, language, experiences, or even ambience.” Be honest about your vacation goals and whether you’re gravitating toward a popular destination for specific cultural elements or if you’re just looking for a pretty beach and nice sunset. Dupe travel should really be about travel alternatives, rather than replacements. “Before you book one of these trips, be sure to ask yourself: What is my priority?” said Adam Duckworth , the president and founder of the travel agency Travelmation. “If you want to see the Eiffel Tower, then you have to go to Paris. If you want to cruise the Venice canals, there truly is no alternative. These smaller cities may also have much less to do.” If you’re avoiding Paris due to costs, he recommended going during the off-season instead. Erick Prince , a travel blogger and founder of travel site Minority Nomad, believes the travel dupe movement implicitly casts a negative light on the “dupes” in question. “It’s relegating alternative gems to second-class status, as if they’re merely backup plans instead of destinations worthy of their own spotlights,” he said. “Instead of celebrating them for the wonders they are, they’re relegated to the role of understudies.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); He emphasized that popular destinations are popular for real reasons, whether it’s the amazing street food of Bangkok, breathtaking sunsets in Istanbul or incomparable energy of Carnival in Rio. “It’s downright unfair, and frankly, a bit disingenuous, to pit places like Chiang Mai, Izmir, or Salvador against these heavyweights as if they’re contestants in some sort of travel showdown,” Prince said. “Each of these destinations has its own unique allures, their own stories to tell, and their own merits for exploration.” Although the dupe destination trend doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, he challenged travelers to reframe the way they see these alternatives. “At the end of the day, travel should be about bringing people together, not drawing lines in the sand,” Prince said. “It’s about embracing the rich tapestry of cultures and experiences that this world has to offer, not picking winners and losers. So let’s ditch the exclusionary mindset and open our arms to the diversity of this beautiful planet we call home.” Related traveling Budget Travel travel trends Travel Experts Reveal The Airplane Seat They Always Try To Book 8 Mistakes Travelers Make On Short Flights Are You Daring Enough To Try A 'Hush Trip'?

We poor people would work our entire lives to own one. Property became a great investment and way to increase wealth, so rich people started buying them. Not to live in as intended, but to rent to the poor and keep them poor by renting so they will never be able to save enough to afford their own.\" Ffennema / Getty Images/iStockphoto — u/Etobocoke \"It blows my mind. My parents immigrated in the early '90s. They worked minimum-wage and, five years later, bought their first house. With MINIMUM-wage jobs! They had the true American Dream experience.

    "article_content": "Recently, Reddit user u/ues1bredev posed the question , “What’s a nonobvious sign someone is rich?” AzmanJaka via Getty Images And there were so many fascinating responses! Here are some of the top-voted answers: We also included responses from other Reddit threads here and here . 1. “They wear very nice clothing without any brand identification.” – u/BobbyB90220 “Exactly. Gucci and Prada and all that is for absolute SUCKERS. I have a friend who’s a trust fund baby in the nine-figure range – zero logos anywhere.” – u/JuanPancake “I used to do remodeling/carpentry in a very wealthy town here in New Jersey. I never caught any of these people wearing clothes covered in LV logos or Gucci signs. If they weren’t dressed in a suit for work, they wore solid-colored T-shirts with khakis or jeans and running shoes.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); – u/Jeterea pixdeluxe via Getty Images 2. “They are quiet when the discussion is about cost of living pressures, and will deflect the questions from themselves and/or nudge the conversation into a different direction.” Advertisement – u/hdhdhdhdzjursx “Most of the time, they will stay quiet about money, but never balk when presented with a bill.” – u/veleriphon 3. “Casually having expensive hobbies. Stuff like sailing, skiing, and golfing. Especially in areas where those activities aren’t as accessible, and if they’ve been doing it for a long time. You live in the Midwest, but you’ve been surfing since you were 10? Probably rich.” – u/belowthemask42 Daniel Balakov via Getty Images Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); 4. “They have a certain ease with which they move about the world that you have to see to understand.” – u/Loud-Feeling2410 5. “Minimalist homes. I don’t know why, but many rich people like the simple aesthetic, which honestly doesn’t feel homey. They’d rather live with very few things.” – u/Inevitable_snow_gal “Once you know you have money to replace things, it’s much easier to let go of them. Minimalist decor aesthetics are very rooted in this idea.” – u/kharmatika “Minimalism is for people who didn’t grow up saving all the plastic food tubs to use as Tupperware.” – u/stuck_behind_a_truck asbe via Getty Images 6. “They will be very selective in those they choose to be friends with, for various legal reasons.” – u/veleriphon “I went to high school with the offspring of millionaires and billionaires, and something that I always noticed was how close sibling groups are. It’s because they exist in the same space in life, they understand what that means, and they don’t have to worry about each other’s intentions. But then, if you manage to become friends with someone, then you kind of get absorbed by the whole sibling group. They’re all kinda like, ‘Well okay, clearly he’s okay.’” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); – u/throwawaysmetoo 7. “Teeth are a subtle sign. You can tell when someone’s gone to the dentist multiple times a year their entire lives, and that’s an expensive habit. Their parents had the money to establish that routine when they were young, they had the money to keep it up, and they’re not too busy or poor to sacrifice something so cosmetic as the pearliness of their whites.” – u/obscureferences PonyWang via Getty Images 8. “The value of their time. Simple fixes one could do on their own are paid for, and someone else will do them.” – u/loudaggerer 9. “Quality of the food they eat.” – u/itshardlyrelevant “They go out of their way to eat meals with fresh vegetables. And not just corn or tomatoes either. It’s an odd one, but I have noticed the wealthier friends I have eat differently than the middle class friends I have.” – u/RedditorChristopher ozgurcankaya via Getty Images Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 10. “Their couches don’t touch the wall.” – u/only_stupid_answers 11. “Alterations. Their clothes fit perfectly because they don’t expect things off the rack to fit perfectly, so they have someone alter them to fit.” – u/chefybpoodling VioletaStoimenova via Getty Images 12. “Real generational wealth keeps an extremely low profile. They have no digital footprint. They actually pay people to keep information about them off the internet and out of any publications.” – u/fifercurator 13. ”‘I summer in...’” – u/ues1bredev Anastasiia Shavshyna via Getty Images 14. “Went to a good university but isn’t the smartest.” – u/BjornBeetleBorg “I went to private prep schools all my life. First hand, this is so unbelievably accurate I can’t even tell you. I did a paper for my economics class in college about how wealth plays into elite university admissions. I’ve seen many friends go Ivy who wouldn’t even get into state schools based on test scores.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); – u/ues1bredev 15. “They don’t have luggage when taking a flight. So many wealthy people have multiple homes with separate wardrobes at each. To just jump on a plane with no carry on bags must be a dream.” – u/Just-My-Pinion Drazen_ via Getty Images 16. ”‘We’re comfortable.’” – u/rylie_smiley 17. And finally, “They will keep a low profile, driving cars that blend in. Nice, reliable vehicles, but nothing too flashy.” – u/fifercurator “A few people I know who are extremely wealthy live this way. Aside from a nice home, they drive average vehicles. When I moved to town, this woman was the one who advised me on a car. Suggestions were a Toyota RAV4 or a Honda CRV like hers. There was more to the conversation, but I knew they just sold one of their businesses for $100 million. They started with $100 bucks together and never stopped being smart and frugal. She advised me that blending in is your best bet as people get weird when they know you have money.” – u/LetsBeginwithFritos “This. I work for the ultra-wealthy.

    "article_content": "Guest Writer Search the term “tradwife” on TikTok and you’ll find thousands of carefully curated videos from creators like 26-year-old Estee Williams from Richmond, Virginia, and Hannah Neeleman, also known as Ballerina Farm , who has amassed 7 million followers sharing cooking and homemaking videos from her Utah farmhouse. The videos feature a soft life aesthetic: modern women clad in ’50s housewife aprons, baking bread and arranging flowers in full makeup and perfectly styled hair. The content is appealing. Williams’ TikTok has 1.3 million likes across her videos touting the benefits of relying on a partner to take care of you. In that regard, I was also a tradwife throughout my 12-year marriage. The Tradwife Life Is A Slippery Slope Throughout my first marriage — in our early 20s — my husband and I muddled through, three young children in tow, making the best life we could. We eventually divorced, I became a single mom, and a bit more muddling ensued. I was always one step behind, stressed out, overworked and underemployed. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Then I remarried. When I became pregnant with my youngest — with older kids in public school — my “advanced maternal age” and medical history made the pregnancy high risk. We agreed that I should quit my job. So I did, and immediately began nesting. I began creating the white picket fence life I thought I wanted. We even started homeschooling. If I was going to be home all day anyway, why not? I became a master of pinning craft ideas on Pinterest, meal planning and decorating my home. In 2019, I started working from home here and there, taking on ghostwriting and freelance work, but none of that money truly contributed to the household. I let my husband take care of everything related to running the home. He’s a CPA and financial adviser by trade, so why would I “worry my pretty little head” about any of that? Had I asked, he likely would have shared the details. Neither of us gave it much thought, though, and it worked well for a while. A Crash Course In Adulting After our divorce hearing, I walked out of the local courthouse a homeowner, having been awarded the family home, but blissfully unaware of the ramifications. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Marie Bentley The author on a trip to the Grand Canyon. I was suddenly solely responsible for the home maintenance, utilities, property tax and homeowners insurance. I received a crash course on adulting. I was even hit with an HOA violation letter because my home needed a good pressure washing. Of course it did; my husband hadn’t lived there for nearly a year. A patch of lichen had taken up permanent residence on my mailbox. HOA and amenities fees were immediately due. The sprinklers needed to be programmed; with that, of course, a water bill increase. I would need to schedule and pay the lawn guy (that mulch wasn’t going to spread itself). I also quickly realized I’d better start budgeting some sinking funds for the property tax due after the holidays. My ex-husband and I just fell into traditional gender roles; it was easier than putting in the work. When he moved out, he struggled with working his air fryer, ordering delivery on his phone and navigating the grocery store. I hadn’t necessarily dug my head in the sand over the years, but I sure hadn’t been as proactive as I could have. The Importance Of Taking An Active Role In Finances Shari Rash is the founder and financial advisor at GWA Wealth . “I speak with women all the time, when out socially or at moms groups, that once they hear what I do for a living I get the response, ‘Oh, my husband handles all of that,’” she told HuffPost. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Rash said that it’s often a significant event that prompts a person to act or become actively involved in managing their finances. Typically, this event tends to be something negative — perhaps the loss of a parent, unemployment, divorce, the death of a spouse, or even witnessing one of those events happen to someone close. According to a report by Bank of America , 94% of women believe that they will be personally responsible for their finances at some point during their lives, yet they are less involved in long-term financial decisions than their partners. Nearly half of the 3,500 women surveyed said they feel confident about their finances, but only 28% feel empowered to take action on them, the report says. Rash encourages women to take an active role in household finances, whether they work outside the home or not. “That doesn’t mean you’re tracking the stock market daily and day trading your accounts. It means you know what your household has and you’re included in the conversation,” she said. Money Mindset Begins In Childhood A parent’s hands-off approach to family finances has a larger effect within a family unit. “Kids are like little sponges, absorbing every detail of our behavior, especially when it comes to relationships and finances,” certified public accountant Maya Corbic said. ”They’re shaping their money mindset as they observe how we interact with money and each other. Everything they see, hear and feel becomes their perception of ‘normal.’” Corbic’s goal is to teach every child how to become a financially independent adult. “Many moms who attend my parent workshops share stories of how their upbringing influenced their views on finances,” she said. “For instance, some grew up in households where fathers solely made financial decisions, leading to the belief that only men handle investments. This perpetuates the notion that women shouldn’t be involved in financial matters and must rely on men for financial security.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Corbic advises parents to be aware of the messages they’re sending children and that they “consciously model healthy financial behaviors and empower them to develop a balanced and informed relationship with money.” One way to do this is by dedicating time each month to review the household budget, discuss spending habits and prioritize savings. “Regular ‘money dates’ serve as a cornerstone for financial harmony,” Corbic told HuffPost, adding that they promote transparency within the family and emphasize the importance of intentional discussions about family finances. Baby Steps To Household Finance Awareness Rash urges those who depend financially on their partner to immediately dig in and do the work. But this doesn’t just apply to those falling into traditional gender roles in their relationships; all adults who are sharing their lives with a partner can benefit from becoming more financially aware. Important topics to discuss with your partner include: Your individual or joint debt Money available in savings or investments Mortgage balance and equity in home Total monthly household expenses Availability of emergency funds For couples using the services of a financial adviser, Rash suggests you begin by asking yourself the following questions: If you became the sole financial decision-maker of your household overnight, do you know who your financial point of contact is? If you have a contact, do you feel comfortable talking to them? Do you know what accounts your spouse or partner has? What company issues your life insurance policies? “If you’re unable to answer those questions, that likely means you need to take some steps to get involved for your own protection,” Rash said. While I still have a long way to go, with each new experience, I gain the financial confidence and self-esteem that I lacked while living the tradwife lifestyle. I have an upcoming appointment with a CPA, opened an investment account, began paying more attention to my retirement accounts, and most importantly, I’m gaining skills, knowledge and wisdom that I can share with my children so that they can protect their financial futures.

    "article_content": "As an older Gen Z'er, I try not to compare myself to my peers. However, when I see people my age posting on social media about how they're traveling the world, starting families, or moving into their own place, I sometimes can't help but feel like I'm \"not where I'm supposed to be.\" I feel like it's common to think you're supposed to have life all figured out and settled by a certain age — but that's just not realistic for everyone. Maskot / Getty Images/Maskot So, to showcase that there's no real timeline to follow in life, I sought out Gen Z'ers from the BuzzFeed Community who were willing to share their lives with me — and the internet — by highlighting parts of their day-to-day existence. Welcome back to Gen Z Journals. Dannica Ramirez / Canva Check out the last Gen Z Journal here. And by the way: If you are interested in submitting your own Gen Z Journal or know anyone who might, fill out this short form with just the basics for a chance to be featured in a future edition. This week: Meet Haley (she/her), a 25-year-old from Upstate New York. The remainder of this post will be from her POV. Haley K. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Dannica Ramirez / Canva Dannica Ramirez / Canva I am a digital marketer for a workers' compensation insurance organization. I make $82,500 a year and have been in my position for a little over a year. Dannica Ramirez / Canva Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Dannica Ramirez / Canva I am pretty intense about budgeting. I use a software/program that allows me to allocate every dollar I have to a specific job. If I had to guess, my average weekly spending is probably around $600. We currently pay $1,050 in rent, but that will change in a week to $1,475. We set aside $500 per month for groceries, $100 a month in cat food and litter, $100 a week for my therapy sessions, $225 for gas, about $1,000 between both of our car payments, and about $1,900 a month for student loans. I am very fortunate to be able to pay an extra $600 a month on my loans to try to get rid of them faster. I typically budget the money I already have in my bank account for the current month, and then as paychecks come in, I budget them toward the next month. Also, my partner and I share the budget, so we don't really look at our bank accounts separately anymore. Dannica Ramirez / Canva My financial situation is a lot better than most people, and I'm still not comfortable. My parents made enough money that I received very little federal aid, with the assumption that they would help pay for college. They didn't help me pay for college. I was over $110K in debt when I left school, with the majority being private loans. I'm very privileged to live the way I do, but I still can't afford what older generations were able to at my age. Buying power has decreased significantly, so when someone asks me why I'm struggling financially when I make more money than they did at my age, I want to scream. Dannica Ramirez Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The money I make now is proportionately less than the money older adults made when they were my age, and the cost of everything has risen. It's not that Gen Z doesn't want to work — we're just not tolerating the work culture that older generations accepted. No one should feel like they need to work 80 hours a week for a job that only pays for 40. That's exploitation. Also, I think many of us don't feel like a job needs to be your life's purpose. I set boundaries with work because I want to be able to live my life outside of it. Dannica Ramirez / Canva Dannica Ramirez A typical to-do list for me looks like: • Wake up and get dressed • Make an iced coffee, tea, or some other drink and breakfast • Feed my cats breakfast • Sit down at my desk in the other room for work • Check my email and respond to any as-needed • Scroll on company socials to get caught up • Check our website for new inquiries • Decide on social content for that day • Design a graphic or video for each platform • Eat lunch (If I remember to) • Feed cats lunch (spoiled!!) • Design a marketing email or invitation to training • Respond to questions from members regarding our new learning management system • Work on quarterly, annual, or monthly reports as needed • Edit content for articles or newsletters • Post on all our social media pages • Finish the day by responding to more emails • Try to go to the gym for an hour (Monday, Wednesday, and either Friday or Saturday) • Make dinner for or with my partner • Feed the cats dinner • Run off to one of my hobbies (doing stage lighting or acting) or try to decompress by watching something, scrolling on my phone, or going to Target • Go to bed by 12:30 a.m. Haley K. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); I usually get eight hours of sleep unless I'm working on a show. I do theatrical lighting for my former high school's drama club and local community theaters in my spare time. Rehearsals can run late at night, so I get home much later. Haley K. Dannica Ramirez / Canva I am in a relationship with Conner, my wonderful boyfriend of two and a half years. We support each other in a million ways. We are very open, honest, and communicative with each other. We support our individual interests, and we both have ADHD, so we try to balance each other's weaknesses. I am very grateful I have Conner because the current dating scene is scary to me. I would NOT like to be on dating apps right now; people seem to avoid talking about difficult things and end up in situations where neither person is satisfied. Dannica Ramirez / Canva Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Dannica Ramirez / Canva I'm currently in the middle of moving out of the apartment I've lived in with Conner for one and a half years! We're not moving far, but I've never moved with another person before. Plus, this apartment is all our cats know. We've had to adjust our budget to afford this new place and figure out how to downsize from 1,100 sqft to 890 sqft. Dannica Ramirez / Canva My boyfriend and I want to start a life together, but we feel really held back by my student loans. The minimum payment (after refinancing!) is $1,000 a month. Even though we both make really good money for our age, nothing is affordable with the amount we have to set aside for bills. Buying a house is completely out of the question for at least another six years. We're thinking about how to afford a wedding eventually, and that feels impossible, too! That said, I'm really hoping my boyfriend will propose to me. Dannica Ramirez / Canva Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); I have amazing, wonderfully supportive friends, some of whom live far away and I don't see often. I know that when I need someone, I have people to turn to. I think the hard part is remembering to turn to them when things get tough; it's easy just to turn inward and get lost in your problems. Dannica Ramirez / Canva I am pretty close with my family. My parents split when I was very young, and my mom and I moved to live with my stepdad when I was nine. My dad and his family are three hours away, and the rest of my mom's family is about four hours away. I have four half-siblings — three on my dad's side — and one on my mom's. All of them are at least 10 years younger than me. My mom, stepdad, and sister only live 20 minutes away now, so my partner and I try to visit them once a week. Dannica Ramirez / Canva I constantly feel like I'm not where I'm supposed to be. I watch people on social media DIY their homes, get pregnant, travel to other countries, and buy luxury items, and I can't help but feel like I'm behind.

I just try to keep in mind that my priorities and situation are different from theirs — and that’s okay.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life HuffPost; Getty Images The \"grandparent scam\" is successful when you are too worried to think. Here's how to get back control and avoid being scammed. “Hi Grandma, it’s me. I need help. I’m in trouble, and I need money for bail. Please don’t tell Mom or Dad.” When your grandchild says they have an emergency, it’s normal to take their urgent request seriously, even if it seems out of character. But unfortunately, that’s just what scammers want you to do. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); The “grandparent scam” targeting senior victims is not new, but according to the FBI , it’s still working all too well. In late April, the FBI announced that 16 defendants had been charged in connection with a scheme to defraud older Americans. The scammers would call victims and impersonate grandchildren in a crisis. They typically claimed that they had been arrested after a car accident, and that they needed immediate funds from their grandparent for a lawyer or bail. Advertisement In total, the FBI said , hundreds of Americans across the Northeast lost millions of dollars as a result. “Grandma, I love you and I trust you more than anyone,” one of the alleged scammers cries on a call with a victim, according to video found in the investigation. “Just do whatever he tells you to do.“ Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Mike Lemberger, Visa’s regional risk officer for North America, noted that it’s common for grandparent scammers to look up the grandparent online, in order to learn the grandchild’s name and impersonate them. “They’ll run this thing against 100 people. Maybe they got the grandchild’s name wrong on 10 of them ... The fraudster doesn’t care,” Lemberger said. “But on the 10 or 12 it got right and the one or two that fall for it, they’re making their money.” How to avoid getting caught in a grandparent scam Scammers prey on heightened emotions, because when you are scared or worried, you’re less likely to listen to logic, and more likely to hand over thousands of dollars to a stranger. “That sense of urgency is what leads us to act. And that’s what you have to try to control,” said Kelly Richmond Pope, a professor of forensic accounting at DePaul University and the author of “ Fool Me Once: Scams, Stories, and Secrets from the Trillion-Dollar Fraud Industry .” “You can control your emotions and how you respond.” Here’s how: Listen to what the call is saying, not the familiar voice. Just because the caller sounds like your grandchild does not guarantee that they are. With just a short audio clip from social media, artificial intelligence can clone a loved one’s voice, and sophisticated grandparent scams are using AI to impersonate the voices of grandkids, according to a 2023 Federal Trade Commission alert on grandparent scams. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Amy Nofziger, the director of victim support for the AARP Fraud Watch Network, said the grandparent scam is effective because when a loved one is in trouble, we want to help. That’s why it’s more useful to pay attention to what the call is about than how it sounds. Nofziger said grandparents should ask themselves: “Even if it sounds like your grandson, what are they asking for?” “Don’t listen for the voice. Listen to the ask. If the ask is for money or personal information, it’s 100% a scam,” Nofziger said. Take the common bail-money demand. Nofziger said a real bail payment is unlikely to be done over the phone. In fact, bail is typically paid in court, in a jail facility or online. And be wary of anyone asking you to keep a secret from your family, because “that’s a huge red flag” of a scam, Nofziger said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); She said it can also help to speak out loud and ask yourself: “Does this make sense that my grandson is calling me when he’s supposed to be at school?” Voicing aloud what’s happening to you can help you listen to common sense. Don’t trust caller ID. Do not let your guard down even if caller ID says the call is a trusted source. Scammers can “spoof” a caller ID to make an incoming call appear like it’s coming from a familiar location. Nofziger gave the example of a caller ID saying the call is coming from your regional hospital. “So you pick up the phone and they’re like, ‘Hi, this is the ER, your grandchild’s been in an emergency, we need the insurance payment right away.’” In the scheme recently described by the FBI, the scammers used phone services to make the calls appear to be coming from the U.S., even though they originated from the Dominican Republic, according to court documents . Hang up the phone and verify the story with a family member. Experts said having a secret family code word for these situations is less effective, because in stressful situations, it’s unlikely you’re going to remember the password. Or, if the code word is too easy, a scammer may be able to guess what it is. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Besides, if the person sounds like your loved one, you may not realize you’re in any “kind of perceived danger,” Pope said. But what you can easily remember to do is to hang up and verify if the grandchild is OK. “Call the grandchild, call the parents of the grandchild at the phone number you have for them,” Nofziger recommended. Have a conversation upfront with your loved ones about grandparent scams. Scammers win by isolating family members from their loved ones. That’s why one of the best prevention tools is role-playing different scenarios of what a grandparent scam can sound like. That way, grandparents can talk through what they should do if they get an emergency phone call about a supposed arrest, and they can discuss who they should call to verify an alarming story. When you care for an older loved one, you care about their health and safety. And part of that “is their financial health and safety,” Lemberger said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); What you can do if you or your loved one is the victim of a grandparent scam Prevention is the best defense, but if you or your loved one has lost money to a grandparent scam, there are still steps you can take swiftly: Tell your bank or credit card company. “The tough part about this is, once the money is gone, it’s typically gone,” Pope said about the aftermath of these fraudulent schemes. But you should still contact your bank or credit card company right away. In some limited cases, “we can get into the middle of a transaction,” Lemberger said. “And if it doesn’t look right to us, we may contact some folks and stop those transactions.” Seek professional counseling. Losing thousands of dollars to fraud can wreak both emotional and financial damage on a family ― even if it didn’t happen directly to you. When a grandchild actually finds out that their grandparent lost $50,000 to help them, they often feel guilty, and “that’s a significant amount of trauma that they’re going to carry for some time,” Nofziger said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Nofziger noted that AARP has a free, facilitated peer discussion group that provides emotional support for victims of fraud and their families. Report what happened. In additional to reporting your situation to local law enforcement, you can call the National Elder Fraud Hotline, a Justice Department initiative, at 1-833-372-8311. From there, you will be connected to case managers who can provide resources and agency referrals on what you can do next.

Airline tickets continue to surge in cost, even outpacing inflation , so reaching the buzzy places where everyone somehow seems to be vacationing might not fit into even the most seasoned traveler’s budget. But before you give up on your dreams of visiting the beautiful international destinations that inundate TikTok and Instagram on a daily basis, just know that a golden opportunity could arise in the form of mistake fares. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); But what exactly are mistake fares and how do they work? Below, travel experts break down what you should know. What are mistake fares? “The term ‘mistake fare’ generally refers to an airline ticket price that is significantly different from historical norms and/or what an airline intended,” Nick Ewen , senior editorial director at The Points Guy, told HuffPost. Advertisement He pointed to a well-publicized mistake fare from Cathay Pacific in 2018 that allowed travelers to book round-trip tickets between Vietnam and the United States for less than $700 in business class and under $1,000 in first class. “There’s not a definitive line between what makes for a ‘deal’ vs. a ‘mistake’ in this context, but usually a mistake fare is orders of magnitude lower than normal,” Ewen said. “For example, a $1,000 round-trip flight from the U.S. to Europe in business class could be a deal if it’s on a Tuesday in mid-January to Poland.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); If the flight is on a peak summer travel date between the U.S. and Rome, however, that’s more likely to be a mistake. “Mistake fares happen when airlines incorrectly file the price of a given flight,” said Zach Griff , a senior reporter at The Points Guy. “One of the recent mistake fares I found was a $700 round-trip ticket in Air France first class from Algeria to New York. That ticket typically retails for over $10,000, so it’s pretty clear that something was wrong with how it was pricing. Just note that no airline website will market something as a mistake fare.” Why do they happen? “Mistake fares can happen for many reasons, but some of the common reasons are currency conversion errors with travel agencies that incorrectly convert the fare into the local currency or vice versa, as well as fat-finger errors from revenue management analysts who potentially miss a digit when inputting a fare or file a fare for business class at the price of economy,” Griff said. Basically, an airline employee might accidentally leave off a zero or use the wrong fare code during the ticket pricing process, thus giving travelers the opportunity to snag business-class tickets for economy prices. The reason could be related to an automated system as well. “A pricing algorithm may be incorrectly calibrated to drop prices precipitously when demand drops,” Ewen said. “Or a currency conversion error may display the right number but in the wrong currency ― e.g., a flight that should be 5,000 U.S. dollars could show as 5,000 Hong Kong dollars, which is less than 650 U.S. dollars.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Although these situations do occur, the odds that you will stumble upon one of these magically low fares are low. “Mistake fares are like four-leaf clovers ― rare but not unheard of and very lucky,” said Katy Nastro, a spokesperson for the flight alert service Going . “They have become less common over the years due to better technology that rectifies the pricing before it becomes widely known.” Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images Mistake fares have become significantly less common in recent years, but they still happen. Are there downsides to mistake fares? “The benefit of a mistake fare would be scoring a great deal on airfare, but the number of mistake fares that have been honored in recent years is getting smaller and smaller,” Griff said. “Most travelers would be better off just purchasing flights when they feel that they’ve found a good deal than spending time trying to find the cheapest fare out there.” Also, just because you found a golden ticket doesn’t mean you get to use it. “Airlines have no legal requirement to honor mistake fares, which can mean that your purchased ticket might not be worth a seat on that flight,” Nastro said. “Airlines have been known not to honor mistake fares in the past, and we estimate around 10% of mistake fares don’t get honored.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); This means there’s a risk that the airline might ultimately cancel your tickets before your trip. “That decision process can take days or even weeks, depending on how many people booked it,” Ewen said. “This can leave you in limbo, not knowing if the trip is happening. That’s why it is so important to hold off as long as possible on making other nonrefundable travel arrangements until you get some clarity on whether the airline will honor the ticket you booked. This may come via email or a social media post ― though we have seen examples of itineraries simply disappearing from travelers’ online accounts and a refund posting to the credit card they used.” Although the airline should theoretically reimburse you for your travel expenses, the process can be a headache, so it’s best to avoid committing to nonrefundable bookings like accommodations or tours when planning a trip with mistake fare tickets. How can you make good use of mistake fares? “Typically, a mistake fare is available for booking in a very short time frame — at most, 24 hours, but more realistically, a few hours,” Nastro said. “You need to act quickly when you see them because that price will not last. And, of course, there is no way of knowing when they will pop up. There is no formula for tracking them nor best practice to give yourself the highest likelihood of them appearing.” You can keep up with mistake fares and short-lived deals by signing up for notifications from flight services like Thrifty Traveler, Secret Flying, Going, Jack’s Flight Club and The Flight Deal. “Some examples of round-trip mistake fares we’ve found at Going in recent years are Los Angeles to London for $240, Seattle to Tokyo for $316, Miami to Copenhagen for $299 and Detroit to Iceland for $299,” Nastro said. “Going will manually validate the fare before sending it out and provide an estimated timeline of how long we anticipate it to last.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); There are also forums and online groups on Facebook , WhatsApp and other social media platforms where frequent flyers post their findings. The key to taking advantage of mistake fares and other deals is to book them immediately before they disappear. “Any ticket you purchase directly from an airline at least seven days in advance that starts or ends in the U.S. is eligible for either a 24-hour free price hold or a 24-hour risk-free cancellation,” Ewen said. “In other words, you can book as soon as you see the deal ― even if other travel plans, PTO requests or your partner’s availability aren’t confirmed.” If the airline decides to cancel your mistake fare booking, the company is obligated to refund your tickets and any nonrefundable expenses you made in conjunction with your plans (though, as previously noted, it often involves a lengthy process with customer service). Still, the upside of the opportunity can make the risks worth it. “If you find a mistake fare, you can get an absolute steal on a flight to a destination you’ve always wanted to go to,” Nastro said. “Or just a killer deal to an unexpected place that ends up being a memorable trip made extra sweet by how much you saved on flights.” Related traveling cheap flights How To Bring Luxury To Your Vacation When You're Traveling On A Budget 7 Tips For Finding Flight Deals Now That Everything Is So Expensive Should You Try 'Dupe Travel' For Your Next Trip?

    "article_content": "LONDON (AP) — The famous napkin that linked a young Lionel Messi to Barcelona sold for 762,400 pounds ($965,000) on Friday, British auction house Bonhams said. An agreement in principle to sign the-then 13-year-old Messi was written on the napkin almost 25 years ago at a Barcelona tennis club. A more formal and detailed contract with the club followed soon after. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); An undisclosed percentage of the sale price pays administrative fees for the online auction, in what’s called the buyer’s premium. Bonhams said the auction was on behalf of Horacio Gaggioli, an agent from Messi’s home country of Argentina who was part of the deal. The contract language, written in blue ink, was intended to reassure the teenager’s father, Jorge Messi, that the deal would go through. Jorge Messi had threatened to take his son back to Argentina because negotiations with Barcelona had stalled. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); The napkin, containing the date Dec. 14, 2000, bears the signatures of Gaggioli, another agent, Josep Maria Minguella and Barcelona’s then-sporting director, Carles Rexach, who met at a tennis club. Rexach had asked a waiter for paper and was given a blank napkin. The starting price was 300,000 pounds ($379,000). Messi spent nearly two decades with Barcelona after arriving from Argentina at 13 to play in its youth squads. He made his first-team debut in 2004 and played 17 seasons with the main squad. He helped the club win every major trophy including the Champions League four times and the Spanish league 10 times. Messi left Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2021. He has since joined Inter Miami. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer Soccer Messi Napkin Auction via Associated Press Related london barcelona lionel messi British messi Lionel Messi's Global Tour With Inter Miami Has Become...

With numbers totaling more than 33 million across America, small businesses are essential drivers of the U.S. economy. This May, Intuit celebrates the owners of those businesses and their place in their communities with its fourth annual Small Business Success Month . Key events during this month of celebration include the release of new data from a survey to shine a light on the challenges small businesses face and the vital role they play, and on May 28, the launch of the new QuickBooks Grant Program , which will offer 20 business owners a $10,000 cash award and three months of business coaching to help them thrive. CHAD KIRKLAND / INTUIT The Intuit QuickBooks Grant Program From May 28 to June 30, 2024, small businesses can apply for the Intuit QuickBooks Grant Program . (T o see if you are eligible, please visit our FAQ and review the Official Rules .) The 20 small businesses selected for the grant will be given $10,000 along with three months of virtual business coaching. That coaching will include six weeks of participation in Intuit’s Adopt a Small Business program and a series of webinars focused on helping small business owners set a strong foundation for continued success. Winners will also receive guidance on the importance of digital tools and the ways platforms like QuickBooks can optimize your business and help you manage accounting, pay your team, accelerate money movement and get paid, all in one place. CHAD KIRKLAND / INTUIT The Data In addition to the grant program, QuickBooks also unveiled results from its latest survey of 1,969 U.S. small business owners. Whether you currently own a small company or you’re in the process of starting one, the findings of this survey — along with additional data about small business ownership — are helpful for understanding your business better: 1. About 6 in 10 small business owners surveyed say they’re on track to meet their earnings goals this year. However, another 19% say they’re running behind. Failure to hit earnings goals can result in decreased satisfaction for business owners that negatively impacts other aspects of their lives. 2. Small business owners reported that their businesses need to earn an average of $351,000 to be successful in 2024. At the same time, 65% of small business owners would be satisfied with less than that. 3. Small businesses with fewer than 10 employees reported cutting 58,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2024 . This suggests that small businesses face challenges that larger businesses don’t. 4. Owning a business has helped a reported 86% of small business owners meet their personal financial goals. In the survey, these goals included starting a savings account, paying off debt and improving their credit scores. CHAD KIRKLAND / INTUIT 5. Just over half of the small business owners surveyed reported working with an accountant for their business. At the same time, small business owners who reported having an accountant say they have more and faster business growth than those who don’t use an accountant. 6. Of the small business owners surveyed, 92% use digital tools to manage their business. In 2024, it’s almost a requirement to use at least one digital tool. 7. Community is everything for small business owners, and 89% say they feel that consumers need to support small businesses by shopping locally. On a positive note, 73% of those surveyed feel supported by their local communities. 8. Millennial small business owners reported getting and giving the most community support. In the survey, 82% of millennial-aged business owners said they feel supported by their community. At the same time, 78% of millennial business owners agreed that it is important for consumers to support small, local businesses in their communities. 9. 84% of small business owners who have previously owned a business that closed say that their previous “failure” was motivation to try again. Of those surveyed, 62% of small business owners said they’ve previously started or owned a business. While the majority of those businesses failed, that hasn’t deterred business owners from trying again. 10. And 43% of small business owners say cash flow is a problem for their business, with 74% saying their cash flow challenges have stayed the same or worsened over the last 12 months. *All data provided by Intuit QuickBooks. The results of this survey demonstrate the small business community’s resilience during a time of economic headwinds. Small business owners continue to find ways to move beyond challenges by participating in, and receiving critical support from, their local communities and by leveraging digital tools and expert help from accountants. By shining a light on these challenges, and building products and solutions like the QuickBooks Grant Program, QuickBooks continues to do its part to help small business owners succeed!

In a post on the company’s website Wednesday, McDonald’s U.S. President Joe Erlinger said reports suggesting the price of the average Big Mac has doubled since 2019 were false. McDonald’s said the average U.S. Big Mac was $4.39 in 2019 and now costs $5.29, a 20.5% increase. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “For a brand that proudly serves nearly 90% of the U.S. population every year, we feel a responsibility to make sure the real facts are available,” Erlinger said. Erlinger acknowledged that he and many franchisees were frustrated by a post on X last summer about a Big Mac meal in Connecticut that cost $18, calling the price “an exception.” He noted that franchisees own and operate 95% of U.S. McDonald’s locations and set their own pricing but “work hard to minimize the impact of price increases.” Advertisement The average U.S. price of a Big Mac meal, which includes a sandwich, fries and a drink, currently is $9.29. Still, the Chicago burger giant said the cost of some items have seen bigger price jumps than the Big Mac. The average price of medium fries was $2.29 in 2019 and is $3.29 now, a 44% increase. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); McDonald’s said the average price of all menu items has risen 40% over the last five years, to account for a 40% average increase in the cost of labor, paper and food. That is higher than overall consumer prices, which have increased 21% since December 2019, according to government figures. McDonald’s saw a marked slowdown in store traffic in the first three months of this year as inflation-weary customers in the U.S. and other big markets ate out less often. As a result, the company promised more deals. Next month, McDonald’s is expected to introduce a $5 meal deal across the U.S. that will include a sandwich, a four-piece McNugget, small fries and a small drink. Erlinger said he hopes customers will find the company’s upcoming deals “meaningful.” “It’s clear that we — together with our franchisees — must remain laser-focused on value and affordability,” Erlinger said.

The phrase speaks to the idea that if you are passionate about your work, it won’t feel like a chore or a burden, but rather an enjoyable and fulfilling experience in which you want to take part. This is all a nice idea, but even in a job you love, is it really possible to feel like you’re never working? I spoke to career coaches, psychologists and people who genuinely love their jobs to find out what they think about the expression and how it relates to the reality of work. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); It makes sense why the phrase appeals to people. “When so many people are stressed and burnt out by work, the idea that you could have a job that doesn’t ‘feel like work’ is incredibly appealing,” said Lauren Appio , a psychologist, executive coach and organizational consultant who specializes in mental health at work. “It’s aspirational and soothing for people who live in a culture like ours in the U.S., where there is little social safety net and people typically have to work very hard to make ends meet.” Many people have very negative relationships with their work. Gallup’s latest State of the Global Workplace report showed job dissatisfaction to be at an all-time high, along with staggering rates of unhappiness and disengagement. Advertisement “You hear about the ‘Sunday Scaries’ or a ‘case of the Mondays,’” said career strategist Ana Goehner . “Some people also believe that everyone hates their job. This expression gives people hope that finding a job they love makes their negative feelings about work go away.” While people commonly attribute the quote to Confucius, there’s very little information regarding the origin of “find a job you love and you’ll never have to work a day.” Some citations of the expression date back to the 1980s , but it seems to be even more prominent in the Etsy era of embroidered quote pillows and inspirational memes. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “I think this mantra is almost as millennial as ‘live, laugh, love,’” said Kate Kennedy , author of the upcoming book “One in a Millennial” and host of the “Be There in Five” podcast. “I’m not sure when it became widespread, but I remember hearing it a lot in the early 2010s, whether it was a product of being post-recession, the start-up boom, or being in peak ‘Shark Tank’ America.” Having entered the workforce amid the economic downturn of the Great Recession, Kennedy believes many young people were made to feel lucky to have any job at all. “There comes the point of burnout where a lot of the joy is sapped from the hobby when it becomes your meal ticket.” - Kate Kennedy “That built-in sense of indebtedness to our employers normalized having a job you tolerated that paid the bills, so having a job you loved seemed like the most glamorous dream of all,” she said. Meanwhile, technological advancements expanded our career options, with full-time bloggers, Instagram influencers and entrepreneurs monetizing their hobbies through e-commerce and other new sources of income. Social media compounded the shift, as we saw people “just like us” showing off their flexible schedules, financial success and other aspects of these new aspirational work lifestyles. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “It’s hard not to find other people’s lives and careers more desirable based on how they portray them online,” Kennedy said. “It’s almost like the volume of options and the frequency of seeing successful examples of exercising those options created a sense of ‘elsewhere’ for careers, where during the moments you are feeling job dissatisfaction, it’s hard not to idealize doing something else.” But the reality is often detached from the ideal. “It’s important to acknowledge that not everyone has the luxury of choosing a job they love,” said Elizabeth Pearson , a women’s career coach and author of “Career Confinement.” “For many people, their work is simply a means to an end, and they may not find much enjoyment or fulfillment in it. Additionally, even if you do love your job, there will still be times when it feels like work ― deadlines, difficult projects and long hours can all take a toll on your energy and motivation.” We Are via Getty Images Having a job you love is no guarantee that you won't face challenges, difficult co-workers and other obstacles that make it feel like work, at least sometimes. Stressful situations, terrible bosses, difficult co-workers, economic downshifts and other obstacles can arise no matter how passionate you feel about your work. Thus, “find a job you love and you’ll never have to work a day in your life” is, for most people, more of a feel-good statement than a feasible reality. “I see this idea sold to service professionals: Work for yourself and do what you love,” Goehner said. “But few people discuss the challenges of building a business and performing tasks you dislike. Few people talk about the issues you face and all the learning involved. Doing what you enjoy should be the norm, but it’s still work. You are still trying to make a living.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Even if you have the freedom to take a leap and monetize your hobby, it probably will still feel like work at times. “There comes the point of burnout where a lot of the joy is sapped from the hobby when it becomes your meal ticket,” Kennedy said. “The biggest issue for me when I started a product-based business was not having access to capital to outsource or hire out many of the functions to get off the ground efficiently, so it all fell on me to figure out, which ended up with me working way more hours for a lot less money than I made in my corporate job.” The job doesn’t magically feel like it’s not work once you’ve found a sustainable way to make a comfortable living, either. “I absolutely love my job, and I’m still beat by the end of the day,” Appio said. “It requires deep, sustained focus and active emotional processing and regulation for hours at a time. Outside of my sessions, I also complete paperwork, manage all of my billing, marketing and communications with clients and colleagues, offer consults for prospective clients, develop and deliver trainings, and pursue continuing education.” Any job comes with difficult days, including one that overall brings fulfillment and joy. And it’s normal to not always want to devote the required time and effort to the job. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Even when you find work you love, jobs are temporary,” Goehner added. “In our current economy, you won’t likely spend your entire career with one company and do the same tasks. Even people who dedicate their lives to their careers may have tough days or perform tasks they dislike. You do what you enjoy, receive pay and hopefully get recognized for your efforts.” What you ‘love’ doesn’t always translate to success or happiness. “Telling others to ‘do what you love!’ is an oversimplification. Doing what you enjoy is not enough. Doing what you’re good at ― and being willing to stick with something, even when what was fun is no longer so fun ― can be just as important,” said Gorick Ng , a career adviser at Harvard University and author of “The Unspoken Rules: Secrets to Starting Your Career Off Right.” Consider whether you can leverage certain skills or expertise to succeed in your field. “Maintaining the belief that work you love isn’t actually 'work’ can create shame for people who feel burnt out or overwhelmed by work that they do truly love. This is especially common in work like health care, mental health and education.” - Lauren Appio “The expression doesn’t help people see possibilities based on where they are in their careers now,” Goehner said. “You can use your skills, gain new ones and find a workplace where you use 60-70% of the skills you enjoy. Sometimes, feeling a sense of expertise and having the freedom to share that at work can help you feel a sense of purpose or connection with your job.” If you’re feeling drawn to a completely different path, give it a lot of thought and do your research. Ng emphasized that the idea of something is often more interesting than the thing itself. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Would I like to be a musician? Sure! Can I sing to save my life? No!” he said. “And does singing the same song over and over again in a different city each week still sound fun when I haven’t been home for six months? I’m not so sure.” “Your number one passion may not be a realistic career,” Goehner added. “I’d love to take care of baby pandas, but the likelihood of this happening is minimal. Also, what you love may not provide a decent living for yourself or your loved ones. It could be a source of income, but you may need to supplement it with another job. Love doesn’t always pay the bills.” Morsa Images via Getty Images Even if you love a hobby like photography or baking, that doesn't mean you'll necessarily love the business of doing that hobby as a career. Additionally, consider how you feel about the business of the thing you love, not just the activity or hobby itself. “It’s great to have a dream job, but it’s also important to remember that you may not like the day-to-day tasks associated with monetizing that dream,” Kennedy said. “I started a handmade business selling home decor where I hand-painted things, and I loved the category, I love working with my hands and being creative and I loved the idea of self-employment. But I didn’t spend most of my days doing an artist’s work ― I was mostly buried in things I was less passionate about, like shipping, fulfillment, customer service, and inventory management before I could afford help in those areas.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Ng shared a time he met a talented photographer and asked if he wanted to pursue his art as a full-time career. “His response surprised me,” Ng recalled. “He said, ‘I love taking photos, but I hate the business of taking photos. The minute I start relying on photography to pay the bills is the minute I’ll stop loving it.’ Be honest with yourself if you’re thinking of turning an interest into a career. Do you love the business of doing something as much as you love doing the thing itself? Not everyone will say yes to this question and that’s OK.” The expression sets up workers for dissatisfaction and shame. One problem with this idea about work? “It can keep people preoccupied with finding their ‘dream job’ and experiencing a chronic sense of dissatisfaction,” Appio said. “Because if your work feels like work ― as work does ― does that mean you’re doing something wrong?” This fantasy of doing what you “love” and never feeling like you have to work can also lead to feelings of guilt or shame for those who don’t take a huge leap. This is especially true in the age of social media when we frequently see “creators” sharing all the highlights of their careers and few if any of the downsides. “When I was in a corporate job, I wondered if I had ‘sold out’ or forwent meeting my potential by working in the corporate world,” Kennedy said. “Sometimes, it creates a fear that you actively chose to do something you don’t love when you could have followed your passion.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); There’s a sense of guilt for those who do make the choice to pursue a passion-based career. “Maintaining the belief that work you love isn’t actually ‘work’ can create shame for people who feel burnt out or overwhelmed by work that they do truly love,” Appio said. “This is especially common in work like health care, mental health and education. Professionals in these areas may feel guilty or ‘ungrateful’ for experiencing compassion fatigue or needing a break.” She also believes the “find a job you love and you’ll never work” expression can be used to further devalue creative or mission-driven work. “If you love your job, people will often tell you that you ‘didn’t get into it for the money,’” Appio said. “But we all work to earn money, and even if we’d do our work for free in a different world, we all deserved to be paid well for the work we do.” But it’s not completely off base. “This is actually an expression that I believe in myself, and there have been moments where I lived it,” said career coach Jasmine Escalera . “The thing is, I do believe the expression needs to be tailored because it isn’t just about finding work you enjoy, but finding work that is connected to your purpose, to your passions and to your strengths.” She believes a job that integrates the skills or tasks you’re particularly good at can make you feel inspired and as though you’re not working at all. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “The company culture is such an integral part of enjoying the work, as well,” Escalera said. “So I would say not just find a job you love, but find an environment that will let you be the most successful version of you, and you’ll never feel like you have to work a day in your life.” Other experts offered their own rewrites of the expression. “To make the expression accurate, I’d say, ‘Find a job you enjoy and that recognizes your efforts, and build time for hobbies and activities that bring purpose outside of work,’” Goehner said. “You are more than your job.” “I’d tell people if they haven’t found a job they love, to find a job comprised of tasks they like and do what they love on the side,” Kennedy added. “Jobs are often more about the day-to-day than the broader industry or buzzwordy job description, and paying attention to the type of work you find engaging can be a good way to find job satisfaction within the confines of being employed by someone else.” Whether you’ve monetized a hobby or simply work to pay the bills and seek greater purpose elsewhere, Ng noted that there is no objective right or wrong in your approach to your career, just a difference in personal choices and values. If you do want to find meaning in work, however, he shared this rewrite: “Find something that brings you joy and purpose every day, and you’ll always have something to look forward to.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Ultimately, the idea that you should ‘find a job you love’ is a good one, but it’s not always realistic or feasible,” Pearson echoed. “Instead, it’s important to strive for a job that aligns with your values and provides some level of fulfillment, while also being realistic about the fact that work is still work, even if you love it.” This story was previously published on an earlier date.

    "article_content": "NEW YORK (AP) — James Kane has used a magnet to fish all manner of junk from New York City waterways, but stacks of $100 bills he pulled from a safe were something else entirely. Kane’s girlfriend, Barbi Agostini, 39, thought he was joking when he said their life was about to change, she told The Associated Press on Monday. She was filming as Kane, 40, pulled a slimy safe out of a lake in Flushing Meadows Corona Park and extracted bags of waterlogged Benjamins from inside it. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “Oh, that’s money,” Kane said Friday in video he posted online. “Oh, it is! Stacks of bills, dude!” “Oh, my God!” Agostini said in the video. The couple estimates that the safe contained $100,000 in damaged currency. The bills featured the 3D security ribbon that indicates recent vintage, but the safe bore no clues to a rightful owner. Kane and Agostini said they called the police to report their discovery and the police said there was no evidence of a crime. “They gave it to us, as, I guess you call it a finders keepers thing,” Kane said. The New York Police Department did not respond to requests for confirmation of Kane’s discovery. Kane said he and Agostini plan to take their soggy money to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington to redeem it. Some portion of the bills will likely be too damaged to recover, he said. The pair have ideas for spending whatever they end up with, including a new vehicle and upgrades to the equipment they use to produce content. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Kane is far from the only magnet fisher who has made a mark in recent years. All it takes is a powerful magnet, a body of water and a rope. A magnet fisher found a human skull padlocked to an exercise dumbbell in New Orleans last month, and someone fishing in a creek in Georgia in April pulled up a rifle and some belongings of a couple who were killed nine years ago. As magnet fishing videos rack up views on YouTube, skeptics grumble on Reddit that some of the finds must be fake. Kane may just be lucky. He’s hauled up bicycles, guns, grenades, and jewelry from New York City waterways, promoting his exploits on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. “I have seen and worked with other magnet fishers that can hit a spot for three months, and I’ll come along and throw the same magnet and get and find something that they’ve been trying to get the entire time,” he said. “I personally can’t explain that.” Related New York City Georgia new york police department Bureau Engraving Printing Kane 40 Before You Go LOADING ERROR LOADING var label_665f7bebe4b08e32183f2fe0 = \"ctx-wait-665f7bebe4b08e32183f2fe0\"; var defer_665f7bebe4b08e32183f2fe0 = document.currentScript; console.time(label_665f7bebe4b08e32183f2fe0); window.waitForGlobal( () => window.HP && window.HP.params && window.HP.params.clientUUID && window.localStorage && defer_665f7bebe4b08e32183f2fe0 && defer_665f7bebe4b08e32183f2fe0.parentElement.dataset.ready === \"true\", () => { console.timeEnd(label_665f7bebe4b08e32183f2fe0); let playerId = window?.HP?.params?.abStickyVideoTest?.variant === 'on' ?

    "article_content": "Fame, wealth, and privilege often go hand-in-hand. If a person has lived in that bubble for a long time (or even their entire life), then they can lose touch with what life is like for people outside of it. They sometimes seem to forget that not everyone has access to the same resources — from organic food to personal staff — as they do. As a result, they may offer advice or make remarks that come off as, well, super privileged and out of touch. Here are 17 times celebs made out-of-touch comments about money and privilege: During a 2009 interview special, the interviewer told Mariah Carey that his to-do list included \"pay bill.\" In reply, she asked, \"Pay who? Bill who?\" Channel 4 Here's the full video, with this part beginning at the 4:20 mark: In her parenting book \"The Kind Mama,\" Alicia Silverstone advised postpartum mothers to take as much time as possible to do nothing but \"lying-in\" with their newborns \"instead of hurrying on to the next thing.\" She wrote, \"I know what you're thinking: Who am I to tell you that you should consider taking time away from work? I assure you that it's not something that only the super-privileged and trust-fund endowed can afford.\" Karwai Tang / WireImage / Via Getty Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); While interviewing Danny Pudi in 2020, Larry King asked him about the luxuries he can't live without — then rejected his answers, telling him, \"Coffee and socks are not a luxury.\" Ora Here's the full interview, with this part starting at the 3:20 mark: In 2010, Dina Lohan reportedly called the police on a Carvel ice cream store that refused to give her the cake she ordered for free when she tried to pay with her daughter Lindsay's \"Carvel black card.\" She told Radar, \"It just shows how we [Lohans] get treated so much worse than regular people.\" Jamie Mccarthy / Getty Images for Christian Siriano The black card was a promotional gift that offered Lindsay free ice cream for 75 years, but the employees confiscated it from her mother. In a statement , Carvel said, \"Unfortunately, the Lohan family has been abusing the card. While the card was issued in Lindsay's name only, her extended family has repeatedly used the card without her present. At first, we graciously honored their requests while explaining that the Black Card was not a carte blanche for unlimited Carvel Ice Cream for the extended Lohan family and friends. After more than six months of numerous and large orders for ice cream, we finally had to cut off the card and take it back.\" Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); In 2018, Gwyneth Paltrow told the Wall Street Journal, \"I went to do a yoga class in LA recently, and the 22-year-old girl behind the counter was like, 'Have you ever done yoga before?' And literally I turned to my friend, and I was like, 'You have this job because I've done yoga before.'\" Axelle / FilmMagic / Via Getty In a 2022 \"Late Night\" monologue discussing record-high gas prices following American sanctions against Russia, Stephen Colbert said, \"A clean conscience is worth a buck or two. It's important. I'm willing to pay $4 a gallon. Hell, I'll pay $15 a gallon because I drive a Tesla.\" CBS / Via Twitter: @tomselliott In 2012, Simon Cowell told GQ, \"Money brings you security and choice. You can make decisions in a different way if you have a lot of money. But when you have nothing, you have a naivety, and a more fearless attitude because you have nothing to lose.\" Mike Marsland / Mike Marsland / WireImage / Via Getty Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Discussing the challenges of parenting with the Times magazine in 2014, Salma Hayek said, \"You have to work very hard to please them all. If you are making pizza, there is one who doesn't like cheese, and another who hates tomato. Our chef sometimes looks so downhearted. He's always saying, 'Madam, what are we going to do?'\" Jeff Kravitz / FilmMagic / Via Getty In 2009, Snoop Dogg told CNBC about how, in high school, he worked his way up from general math classes to calculus. He said, \"If you stop at general math, you're only going to make general math money.\" Araya Doheny / FilmMagic / Via Getty In 2021, Dixie D'Amelio told Vogue, \"I fully got into college [in] August of 2019 and I decided not to go just because traveling back and forth was going to be a lot...I was also really scared because I saw someone make a TikTok saying that they would play my songs at a frat party, and that's really what, like, turned me away from going to school because I don't think I could handle that level of embarrassment.\" Steven Simione / Getty Images Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); In 2013, Spencer Pratt told Ok! Magazine that he and his wife, Heidi Montag, \"made and spent at least $10 million\" in a single year because they fell for a conspiracy theory. He said, \"The thing is, we heard that the planet was going to end in 2012. We thought, we have got to spend this money before the asteroid hits.\" Amy Sussman / Getty Images for Prime Video Discussing her aspirational wellness lifestyle and mental health in 2020, Gisele Bündchen told the Guardian, \"[People] just have to make the decision of working at it. That's the problem with today's society, people want instant gratification where it's you know: 'I want to do something, and [when] I wake up I want to look like this.' I’m like, 'Er, well, you know for me to cure my panic attacks, it took months. I could have taken a pill, but I decided no. I'm going to wake up every morning, and I'm going to meditate and do breath work.' It took months...Everything starts with discipline.\" Sean Zanni / Patrick McMullan via Getty Images And in 2010, Gisele Bündchen told Harper's Bazaar UK, \"I think breastfeeding really helped me keep my figure...Some people here [in the US] think they don't have to breastfeed, and I think, 'Are you going to give chemical food to your child when they are so little?' I think there should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months.\" Jennifer Graylock - Pa Images / PA Images via Getty Images Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Responding to criticism that, unlike many of his peers, he didn't use his music to address police brutality in the US in 2015, A$AP Rocky told Time Out, \"I’m A$AP Rocky. I did not sign up to be no political activist. I wanna talk about my motherfuckin' lean, my best friend dying, girls, my jiggy fashion and my inspirations in drugs. I live in fucking Soho and Beverly Hills. I can't relate. I go back to Harlem, it's not the same. It's a sad story. I gotta tell you the truth. I'm in the studio, I'm in fashion houses, I'm in these bitches' drawers. I'm not doing anything outside of that. That's my life. These people need to leave me the fuck alone.\" Jeff Kravitz / FilmMagic / Via Getty A year later, the interview resurfaced, leading to renewed criticism. In response, Rocky told The Breakfast Club that the quotes had been taken out of context. He said, \"The racism is real. I don't go to middle America cities. We're in the major markets. We don't know what it's really like for the people who go to work and come home everyday. …. We don't know how they get along. What I see and try to promote is unity.\" He went on to compare the damage his previous comments did to his legacy to the way sexual assault allegations ended Bill Cosby's career. Discussing her runway career with Love magazine in 2018, Kendall Jenner said, \"Since the beginning, we've been super selective about what shows I would do. I was never one of those girls who would do like 30 shows a season or whatever the fuck those girls do.\" Cindy Ord / Getty Images After being called out by other models, she apologized on Twitter , writing, \"I was misrepresented in a recent interview over the weekend, and it's important to clarify the meaning. It was intended to be entirely complimentary but unfortunately, my words were twisted and taken out of context. I want to be clear. The respect that I have for my peers is immeasurable!\" Discussing red carpets in 2015, Natalie Portman told Harper's Bazaar, \"I get asked so many questions about the Middle East, and I'm like 'Can you please just ask me about my dress? Let's just talk about the dress!'...I like to look at what people are wearing, but I do see the sexism in it.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life blackCAT via Getty Images Money dysmorphia affects people across the wealth spectrum. Loud budgeting . Slow shopping . Girl math . These days, there are endless quippy terms to describe the trends and phenomena in the realm of personal finance. One of the more insidious realities impacting people’s financial health has a name as well: money dysmorphia. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); To help keep the negative impacts at bay, HuffPost asked experts to break down this phenomenon and share their advice for dealing with it. What is ‘money dysmorphia’? “Money dysmorphia is when you have a warped or distorted view of your finances,” said Danielle Desir Corbett , a personal finance expert and host of “The Thought Card” podcast. “You see your financial situation much differently from your reality. Money dysmorphia can be caused by a variety of reasons, including past money trauma, societal pressures, economic crisis, or could be deeply rooted in childhood upbringing.” Advertisement A recent Credit Karma survey found that 29% of Americans experience money dysmorphia. “Money dysmorphia is a play on keeping up with the Joneses, except the inability to ‘keep up’ is causing some people to experience feelings of inadequacy,” said Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma. The survey data reveals that the issue is particularly prevalent in younger generations, as 43% of Gen Zers and 41% of millennials reported experiencing money dysmorphia, compared to 25% of Gen Xers and 14% of those aged 59 or above. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “While the term is new, the feelings aren’t,” said Dasha Kennedy , the creator of The Broke Black Girl and a financial wellness board member at National Debt Relief. “Many people have felt financially insecure for a long time without having a specific name for it. Now, by giving it a name, it’s easier to understand and address these feelings.” People have long worried about money and felt that they don’t have enough ― even when they do. The problem seems to have worsened, however, in the online age. Elizabeth Ayoola , a personal finance expert and writer at NerdWallet, told HuffPost she believes people’s skewed view of their finances is “often shaped by comparisons to others they see on social media or by soaking up economic news that creates worry.” “When people have money dysmorphia, they’re likely looking at their finances more subjectively than objectively,” she added. What are the signs of money dysmorphia? “Money dysmorphia can often make people believe they’re doing financially worse or better than they actually are,” Ayoola said. “This can manifest as saving excessively because you feel you’re behind in comparison to your peers. Likewise, it can show up as overspending because you feel you’re financially secure when that’s not the case.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); If you have money dysmorphia, you might feel strong emotions about your finances when you see friends reach financial milestones, she added. Feelings like sadness, anxiety, stress, frustration, unworthiness or overconfidence may lead to behaviors that harm your financial health ― like overspending on a vacation. “People may find themselves living lifestyles they can’t afford,” Ayoola explained. “In the reverse, people who are financially secure may not be living full and abundant lives because they believe they don’t have enough, even though their financial reality may say otherwise. Ultimately, money dysmorphia can hinder people from achieving their financial goals or enjoying their achievements.” d3sign via Getty Images Feelings like sadness, anxiety, stress, frustration, unworthiness or overconfidence may lead to behaviors that harm your financial health. By excessively saving, people with money dysmorphia can miss out on opportunities to invest and actually grow their wealth. “Some people might be scared to spend money, even on the things they actually need,” Kennedy said. “Others might constantly worry about their finances, regardless of what their actual situation is. They may feel anxious or guilty when making purchases, including necessary ones.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); She noted that common signs of money dysmorphia include obsessively checking bank balances, avoiding financial discussions, comparison to others, having a distorted perception of wealth, fear of financial ruin, being overly critical of your financial decisions, and stressing over future finances. For younger generations in particular, there’s also a temptation to tie their feelings about their financial situation to what they see and present on social media, even if it’s not reality. Many avoid addressing or seeking help for their debt, which fosters a cycle of financial instability. “The impact goes beyond money,” Kennedy noted. “It can strain relationships and affect overall well-being. People can also end up depriving themselves of basic needs and joys, which can be detrimental to both mental and physical health.” How can you deal with money dysmorphia? “A few ways to overcome money dysmorphia are to take an honest look at your finances, set clear goals, make a plan, and, most importantly, keep your eyes on your own paper,” Alev said. “If your goal is to build up your savings, start by doing an audit of your finances to see where in your budget you can make room for savings. From there, you can schedule automatic payments from each paycheck to help hold you accountable and incrementally increase your savings.” Set realistic financial goals and find useful resources for personal finance education. Consider seeking professional guidance from a financial planner or therapist, or simply reaching out to your support system as you pursue your goals.

Identify and avoid triggers and distractions. Unfollow social media accounts which stir up financial insecurities. Devote time to listening to personal finance podcasts or reading books to close any knowledge gaps, especially around vulnerable areas.” Another helpful approach for those experiencing financial dysmorphia is to try to assess their personal finances with an objective lens before making judgements about how they’re doing. “That means looking at their income and expenses to see whether their cash flow is on the positive or negative side,” Ayoola said. “Another strategy is to focus on measuring their achievements based on their progress toward financial milestones and not that of their peers. While comparison can be healthy in some cases, everyone is on a different financial journey, so sometimes it can do more harm than good.” As you pursue a healthier relationship with money, Kennedy advised practicing self-compassion “Understand it’s OK to spend on necessities and things that bring joy,” she said. “Financial caution is good, but not when it harms your well-being. Financial caution should not put you in a constant state of inaction. You have to recognize when financial worries become excessive.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Art Wager via Getty Images San Diego was one of the metro regions where women younger than 30 were earning more than their male peers, according to a Pew Research Center study. On average, American men out-earn women. Across all ages, women’s median annual earnings were 82% of men’s for full-time year-round workers, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. This gender pay gap is smaller when women are younger. Those younger than 30 make 93 cents, on average, for every dollar made by a man in a comparable position. A new study from the Pew Research Center that analyzed Census Bureau data from 2015 to 2019 delves deep into where exactly these narrowing pay gaps are happening. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); In 22 major metropolitan areas, including New York City, Washington and Los Angeles, women under 30 years old were earning the same or significantly more than their male peers. “Women are at their greatest parity with men in their early years of entering the labor market, during the teens and 20s,” Richard Fry, the senior economist behind the Pew Research study, told HuffPost. “As you follow them over time, the pay gap widens.” Advertisement The metro areas in America where women under 30 start their careers on the same footing as men. Of the 250 major U.S. metropolitan areas examined in the study, there were 22 in which women under 30 working full time were at or above wage parity with men: Barnstable Town, Massachusetts (112%) Champaign-Urbana, Illinois (102%) Flagstaff, Arizona (100%) Gainesville, Florida (110%) Iowa City, Iowa (101%) Lebanon, Pennsylvania (102%) Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metro region (100%) Morgantown, West Virginia (114%) Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, Florida metro region (108%) New York City-Newark-Jersey City region (102%) Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, California (100%) Richmond, Virginia (100%) Sacramento-Roseville-Arden-Arcade, California (101%) San Angelo, Texas (102%) San Diego-Carlsbad, California (105%) San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles-Arroyo Grande, California (100%) Santa Maria-Santa Barbara, California (101%) Honolulu, Hawaii (100%) Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, D.C. metro region (102%) Wenatchee, Washington (120%) Winston-Salem, North Carolina (101%) Yuba City, California (105%) These city areas include about 16% of all young women working full-time jobs year-round in America, according to the Pew analysis. Midwestern metropolitan areas had the widest gender gaps among young workers, with women earning about 90% of their male counterparts’ wages. In Southern and Western metropolitan areas, they earned about 95%, and in the Northeast, they earned 94%. “Pay parity tends to be more elusive if you’re living out in the Midwest,” Fry said. University towns that attract young people, like Morgantown, West Virginia, San Diego, California, and Gainesville, Florida, were on the above-parity list for young women, as well as major urban regions like New York City. “We know that college towns tend to retain people that go to college there,” said Linda Babcock, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University who researches gender gaps in negotiations and promotions. “The education is going to create more opportunities for women in more white-collar, professional types of jobs, and those are going to be higher paying than the ones that men are going to have who are less likely to be college-educated.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); The college attainment levels of young workers could be one factor in why women earn more in these regions. Fry pointed to national research finding that more young women today are likely to complete a bachelor’s degree than would men. This tracks with a statistical pattern he found. “The amount of pay parity is positively associated with how much better educated young women are than young men living in that metro area,” Fry said. “Young women have really upped their game in the skills that they bring to the labor market,” he added. “They are substantially outpacing men in completing college, and that is contributing to the narrowing of the pay gap.” Unfortunately, the gap widens after 30. Pay advantages that women gain early in their careers are not likely to hold. The Pew Research study cites census data showing that in 2000, a woman age 16 to 29 working full time year-round earned 88% of that of a young man in a similar role, on average. But by 2019, when these workers are age 35 to 48, women were earning only 80% of that of their male peers. Fry said the “ motherhood penalty ” could be part of the reason women lose pay parity over time. While men are seen as more mature and committed to their jobs when they have children, women are seen as mothers first, workers second. Women tend to lose 4% of hourly earnings on average for each child they have, while men earn 6% more, the research group Third Way found, using decades of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Many women under 30, especially in major metropolitan areas, do not yet have children and have therefore not been hit with the ‘motherhood penalty’ in their careers,” said Sarah Small, a researcher in the Rutgers Center for Women and Work. “Once women have children, they often leave the labor force to provide child care, meaning they have gaps in their résumé during which their male counterparts are getting promotions and raises.” Women with children face lose-lose options: They get penalized for taking career breaks and penalized for staying in the workforce as mothers. Studies have found that hiring managers can see mothers as less competent and less committed to their jobs. Even when women don’t become mothers, they also are more likely to face the disadvantage of being saddled with work that won’t get them promoted over time, compared with men, Babcock said. When there is not equal pay for equal work, that contributes to the pay gap, she said. “Helping others to do their work, training new employees, hiring the summer interns, planning the office party, taking notes at meetings... these are the kind of tasks that need to get done, but they don’t actually show up in your performance evaluation, and our research shows that women do much more of these than men,” said Babcock, who is the co-author of the upcoming book “ The No Club: Putting a Stop to Women’s Dead-End Work. ” “It could be a really big factor in why women’s advancement lags behinds men, because women are tasked with doing this work.” Overall, the study shows that young women have a head start compared with young men in certain cities in America, but they may lose that edge during the prime earning years of a career. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “The study is certainly encouraging, but it represents just a select group of American women,” Small said. “We still have a long way to go to close the gender wage gap nationwide and across age groups.” Related equal pay pew research center Young Women Lilly Ledbetter's Shocking Story Is 1 Reason We Need #EqualPayForEqualWork How To Ask For A Raise During The Pandemic 5 Infuriating Ways Working Women Are Penalized For Having Kids Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Popular in the Community From Our Partner HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"sidebar-1\", \"right_rail_content_1\", false, false); }); From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds Newsletter Sign Up An essential daily guide to achieving the good life Subscribe to our lifestyle email.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Jitalia17 via Getty Images When was the last time you really reviewed the details on your paycheck? A pay stub shows you an itemized list of what your employer deducted from your pay and contains valuable information about where your money is going. It’s something you shouldn’t ignore. “An employee is well advised to keep a vigilant attitude towards his or her pay stub,” said Maryland-based employment attorney Bruce Godfrey. “Keep every pay stub, which most people don’t want to do, or enter the main data off of each stub onto a spreadsheet.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Godfrey personally uses a spreadsheet to keep track of each pay period’s gross income, 401K withholding and his bonuses, plus year-to-date totals for each. “I don’t want to depend on the employer’s computers for that,” he said. “I want to have it.” Most employers are required by the Fair Labor Standards Act to keep time and pay records for employees, including total wages paid each pay period, overtime earnings and hourly rates. Most states also require employers to provide this information in a pay stub to employees. Your pay stub may come attached to a paper check or be viewable in your company’s online payroll system. Sometimes, a pay stub may contain accounting or tax errors or other mistakes. In worst-case scenarios, they can reveal workers are being shorted wages. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “It’s not that common that employers just mess up the pay stub [like] a transcription error or data entry error,” Godfrey said. “The mistake happens behind the pay stub in the decision not to pay a worker who is entitled to overtime overtime, or not to pay the worker as agreed, or to dock somebody’s pay illegally.” Here are some key terms to understand so you know what your paycheck should look like and what you should regularly double-check. 1. Employer’s Name And Address Typically, a pay stub should list the employer and where it is located. That seems basic, but if it’s missing, it could be a sign something’s wrong. In Washington, D.C., for example, receiving a personal check would be a red flag, said Sarah Bessell, counsel for the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. An example of an incorrect pay stub “would be just a personal check with [a] dollar amount,” she said. “And it might have a short memo about the number of hours worked, but it’s lacking all those record requirements that D.C. law usually requires,” including some of the items and calculations below. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “The number one thing that people fail to do is keep track of what is actually owed them. If you are hourly, keep a record of the hours that you worked.” - Donna Ballman, employment attorney 2. Gross Income Or Gross Pay Gross income is the total amount of money you earned during the pay period indicated. “The most important line on a pay stub is the gross pay. If the gross pay is wrong, everything else is wrong,” Godfrey said. 3. Net Inco me Or Net Pay Your employer takes money out of your pay for taxes and benefits, and the money left in your paycheck after these deductions is what’s known as take-home pay or net income. 4. Hours And Rate This is blank if you are a salaried employee. But if you’re an hourly employee, keep a close eye on whether your employer is listing and paying you for all of the time that you work. If you’re eligible for overtime , your overtime hours and rate should be reflected as well. As Florida-based employment attorney Donna Ballman told HuffPost, “The number one thing that people fail to do is keep track of what is actually owed them. If you are hourly, keep a record of the hours that you worked,” she said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Know how many hours you are entitled to be paid for. If you worked over 40 hours in any week, make sure they are paying you time and a half. If you keep a daily record of your hours, it can be used as evidence.” 5. Back Pay If your employer owes you wages, that should be reflected in your pay stub in some form. “It really varies per employer how that will show up,” Sage said. For example, an employee who got a raise may see a retroactive payout listed as its own line item. 6. Pay Period This shows the beginning and end dates of the period for which you are being paid. “Most states require that an employer establish a regular pay period,” Godfrey said. This could be a schedule such as every Friday, on a biweekly basis or twice a month on set days. Small employers “will sometimes pay employees chaotically,” Godfrey said. “They’ll pay on the third and then on 14th and then not until the 17th of the next month. That is illegal under most state laws, and it is also a sign that the employer is recklessly disregarding the overtime laws, because the employer should be calculating by the week strictly.” Consumer Finance Protection Bureau A typical paycheck shows gross income, net income, deductions and more. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 7. Year-To-Date If you see “year-to-date” or “YTD” next to your net or gross pay, that’s the total amount of wages you’ve been paid from the beginning of the year to the end of the pay period on the check. “ Anything year to date would be from January 1 to this point right now,” s aid Minnie Sage, program director of Tax-Aid , a nonprofit that provides free tax services in the San Francisco Bay Area. “Year-to-date is how much you’ve made cumulatively.” 8. Federal Withholding This money is withheld to pay your federal income taxes. It’s deducted each pay period and sent to the IRS so that you don’t have to pay it all in a really big lump each year when you file your taxes. When you start a new job, you fill out a W-4 form so that your employer can withhold the correct amount of federal income tax according to factors including the filing status you indicate and the number of dependents you claim. Sage recommends using the IRS’s free tax withholding estimator so you can see the ideal withholding amount for your personal situation. Changes to your W-4 can be made at any time. “The one thing that a lot of people don’t know is that you can look at your contributions at any time of the year. It doesn’t just have to be when you are hired,” she said. If you experience a change such as having a child or getting married, you can contact your employer at any time to adjust the information on your W-4, which in turn adjusts the amount of your federal withholding. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 9. State And Local Taxes If your state has an income tax, this money is deducted each pay period so you don’t owe a large amount when you file. Some cities and counties may also levy taxes, too. 10. OASDI And Medicare Both you and your employer are required to contribute a percentage of your taxable wages to Social Security and Medicare. The current basic rate for Social Security is 6.2% each, according to the IRS , and 1.45% each for Medicare. If you see the term “OASDI” on your stub, that stands for the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance program ― aka, your Social Security taxes. If you see “FICA” on your pay stub, that stands for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, and it indicates the combined employee and employer portions of your mandatory OASDI and Medicare taxes. These numbers tend to be correct. “Because there are recipients of this money who have a fiduciary duty to get the number right... or a selfish interest, either one, they tend not to be messed up very often,” Godfrey said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 11. Other Deductions And Costs Other costs taken out of your paycheck may include health insurance, disability insurance, union dues and contributions to your 401(k) retirement account. Some of these deductions may be “pre-tax,” meaning they’re subtracted from your gross income before federal or state taxes rates are applied, putting more money in your pocket. If you face deductions from your pay for uniforms or cleaning, Bessell advised keeping a close eye on those deductions. “At least in D.C., your employer is allowed to make certain deductions like that as long as it doesn’t make your wages fall below the minimum wage,” she said. “A deduction like that might be OK, but you just want to double-check and make sure.” Related Personal Taxes Taxes personal finance salary income How To Decode 10 Of The Most Common Phrases In Job Listings This Is The Quickest Way To Get Your Tax Refund In 2022 Confused About Tax Deductions?

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life Malte Mueller via Getty Images Equity is a big part of a total rewards package nowadays. But to make the most informed job decisions, you have to know the lingo. Here are some key terms and questions to understand. If you, like millions of Americans, work for a startup or in the tech industry, you have likely been offered a grant of options or restricted stock units (RSUs) when you got your job offer. Kyle Holm is the vice president of total rewards advisory at Sequoia Consulting Group, which works with clients on designing their compensation programs. He said in technology and life sciences industries, offering a grant of options is a very common scenario. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “For a new hire, it’s probably a 90% practice,” he said. ” Equity is a huge component of the overall total rewards package at a company these days.“ But what exactly are those stock benefits even worth? For companies that are already public and selling shares of stock to the public, it’s easier to understand their value. But for a company that has not yet undertaken an initial public offering (IPO), figuring out the value of stock benefits is “more art than science,” said Gianna Driver , chief human resources officer at Exabeam. Advertisement “You do have to take a little bit of a leap of faith,” she said. “Public companies, you know what that value is, because that’s what it’s being bought and sold at right now on the open market. With a non-public company, it’s hypothetical. Technically on paper today, it’s worth nothing.” “When you receive equity instead of cash, there’s more risk but there’s also more upside.” - Daniel Lee, director of financial planning at BrightPlan Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); For early startups that cannot afford to pay new hires competitively high salaries, it’s common to offer new employees stock benefits in lieu of more cash. In a best-case scenario, the company does really well, its value goes up, and its share price skyrockets. You make a generous profit when you choose to sell your stake, because your strike price — or the set price at which you can purchase the stock — is lower than the market value of what your stock options are worth. In the long run, getting equity in a company can be higher risk, but it’s also higher reward, too. “W hen you receive equity instead of cash, there’s more risk, but there’s also more upside,” said Daniel Lee , director of financial planning at BrightPlan and a personal finance instructor at University of California, Berkeley Extension who teaches students about stock compensation. “When I’ve worked with some of the instant millionaires that have come out of IPOs, that’s 99.9% a result of their equity, not their cash compensation.” But how can you tell what’s a good deal or a red flag when a recruiter or hiring manager is pitching you about their company’s stock benefits? Here are some critical questions to ask yourself and hiring managers before accepting a compensation package with stock options. 1. Are these RSUs or stock options? First, it’s important to understand what kind of stock benefits you have. One big difference is whether you are being offered stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs). If you are joining a company after it’s gone public, you are likely getting RSUs, which are the most common type of equity award. One 2018 survey of 150 publicly traded technology companies found that 99% of the companies were giving time-based RSUs to employees. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); A stock option is the option to buy your company’s stock at a certain set price in the future. Conversely, you don’t have to spend any of your own money to get an RSU: Your company sets you up on a vesting schedule — predetermined intervals at which your RSUs become available to you —and assigns a fair market value once your RSUs vest. That’s why RSUs are seen as less risky than private company options; once your RSUs vest, they are yours to keep, whereas with a stock option, you have to buy the option, Lee said. “They [RSUs] are almost always going to be worth something,” Lee said. With RSUs, “it’s the same thing as getting a bonus at the end of a year, but instead of giving you cash, they are going to give you shares of the company. And they typically vest over four years, so you get a quarter after one year, and then you might get one portion of it every quarter,” he explained. 2. Is the raise or salary offer below your market value? You don’t want to sacrifice too much of your salary for stock benefits. Ask yourself: “Can I live without this money?” said Ramona Ortega, founder of My Money My Future who is working to bring financial education to underserved communities. “You don’t want to be taking stock options if you are not getting a base salary that’s going to cover your necessary expenses,” Ortega said. She said you should always try to get the market rate of your salary , unless you are independently wealthy or if you really believe in the company and are willing to take on the risk. “The worst-case scenario is you just take way too much risk,” Lee said. He outlined an example where a person takes on debt to cover their cost of living, because their cash salary is not enough to cover basic necessities like rent. In this situation, “you are just hoping and praying that all these stock options you’ve been getting will be worth billions of dollars, but most companies don’t IPO ... Statistically, your options are not going to be worth anything.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Holm said it’s important for employees to understand the long odds of getting liquidity with stock options. “It really is a long shot — it doesn’t matter which company it is — that you will actually see liquidity. Maybe 1% of companies actually go public, if that, especially in the current environment. We’re just not seeing a wide-open IPO window,” he said. “Most employees are probably going to be looking at the cash being more appealing, especially with the equity markets where they are at.” 3. How long do you plan to stay at this company? Reflecting on whether you see a future with this company is key to deciding if an employer’s stock benefits are worth it in the long-run. Both stock options and RSUs usually vest over several years. Often, there is what’s known as a one-year cliff waiting period, where you are required to stay at the company for at least a year before you receive the benefits. “Let’s say I was hiring you,” Ortega outlined as an example. “You’re going to get 200,000 options over four years. But you’re not going to get the first drop of those until a year later. You have to stay with the company for a year before you even get any of it. That’s the cliff.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); You typically have to exercise your options within 90 days of leaving the company. As you are weighing the timeframe, you also want to consider whether you could raise enough money in time to buy those options before they expire if you quit or get laid off, Ortega said. And even if the equity rewards are amazing, you won’t be staying around long enough to enjoy them if you’re driven out by a toxic work environment . “ There’s a saying in HR that people don’t leave jobs, they leave managers,” Driver said. “Yeah, you can throw money at people, you can throw equity at people, and that’s all great and wonderful. But at the end of the day the job does needs to be one that is fulfilling to the employee ... That matters a lot.” 4. What is the stock worth today and what do employees and investors think it will be worth in the future? Once you get a job offer with stock benefits, you have the right to ask more questions about it. If it’s a private company, you should ask to see its 409A evaluation , which is an independent appraisal of the organization’s stock that determines fair market value by analyzing financial statements, assets and cash flows. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “That’s the latest value of each share of their company,” Lee said, noting that every time the company raises money, they get a new evaluation. “If they’re saying they are going to give you 10,000 options, you don’t know what that is worth unless you know what the price of the shares are.” Lee estimates that more than half of employers would give you that 409A evaluation if you asked, and if they don’t want to disclose, you should consider that a red flag. “Where do you see the stock going before it IPOs?” is another good question to ask hiring managers, Lee recommended. “At least you’ll understand what the founder or the company’s mindset is as to where they would like to see the stock go,” he said. “They might say, ‘Shares are worth five dollars today, but we’re targeting the shares to be forty dollars by the time we IPO.’” Ask how many outstanding shares there are to find out the number of shares investors, employees and executives currently own. This can determine how big of a slice of the pie that you have, Holm said. “You can give me a number of shares but without the context of how many shares are outstanding, I don’t really know what it means,” he said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Of course, you can do your own online research to figure out the state of your company’s industry, too.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, Work/Life We Are via Getty Images There's a safe and easy way to check that your hotspot is secure while making banking transactions or online purchases. When we’re away from home, joining a public Wi-Fi network can be a convenient way to be online when we don’t have good service or want to cut down on data usage. But should you buy stuff while using these public networks? In many cases, you should be fine. As the Federal Trade Commission explains , “Today, most websites do use encryption to protect your information. Because of the widespread use of encryption, connecting through a public Wi-Fi network is usually safe.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); But sometimes these free Wi-Fi hotspots do get compromised by malware infection, fraudulent networks that have legitimate-sounding Wi-Fi names and man-in-the-middle cyberattacks. “Public Wi-Fi networks often lack robust security measures, which makes them attractive targets for hackers who can intercept sensitive data, such as credit card information,” said Michael Jabbara, the vice president and global head of fraud services for Visa. Amy Nofziger, the director of fraud victim support with AARP, said she’s experienced this kind of cyberattack firsthand. When she was on vacation in Las Vegas, she needed to pay a bag fee for her upcoming flight, and she entered her credit card information on the free Wi-Fi at the hotel. “Within 20 minutes, I started to get emails and calls from my credit card company alerting to charges being made on my card in others states. That’s how quickly it can happen,” she said. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Luckily, there’s a simple way you can double-check that your online behavior is encrypted ― and you should do it any time you use public Wi-Fi. Here’s what to know: Check the URL of the site you’re visiting to make sure it’s secure. Before you buy anything online, the most important step you can take to ensure that the website you are using is secure is to check that the URL begins with https://. The “s” stands for secure, and there is typically a padlock icon in the address bar. Under this encryption, people who are logged in with you on the public Wi-Fi cannot see the contents of your communication, explained Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “They can see that you are going to this website, but they don’t know what page you’re going to and they can’t see what you’re typing in,” Galperin said. The HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure) ensures that the data going from your device to the website you’re visiting is encrypted. As long as your website URL begins with “https,” Galperin said, you should be fine to make online purchases. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); If you want to make sure that you’re strictly only using these websites, Galperin recommended making it the default in your browser. On Safari, using an HTTPS URL is already the default . On Chrome, you can do this by going to Settings, selecting Privacy and Security, then Security, then toggling on the option for “Always use secure connections.” On Firefox, you can do this by going to Settings, then Privacy and Security and selecting Security. Then scroll to the “Always use secure connections” option. Using a VPN or mobile data instead of public Wi-Fi can also enhance security. In addition to checking for the HTTPS, you can always go one step further and use your mobile data over public Wi-Fi if you need to make a purchase, which is what Jabbara and Nofziger both advise over using public Wi-Fi for purchases. “Using your cell service is typically safer than using public Wi-Fi for transactions, as it’s more difficult for hackers to intercept data over cellular networks,” Jabbara said. “The best course of action is to wait to use a secure network, but using mobile data is a great second option.” If you want to enhance your security, one of the most effective measures is to use a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN “encrypts your data and makes it much more difficult for anyone to intercept and read your information,” Jabbara said. And be mindful of what seems too good to be true. If a network lets you log on without entering a password or the network has a generic-sounding name like “Free Public Wi-Fi,” Nofziger said those are warning signs that the hotspot could be compromised. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Ultimately, you don’t have to stop yourself from ever using public Wi-Fi ― just make sure that what you are visiting is encrypted and secure. “While it’s not necessary to completely avoid buying anything while on public Wi-Fi, it’s important to be aware of the risks and take appropriate precautions, like checking to see if the URL is safe or using a VPN,” Jabbara said.

    "article_content": "Parenting reporter Ask any American with young children what their No. 1 household expense is, and you’ll hear the same answer almost every time: child care. Each family finds its own way to manage. Some parents are pushed out of the workforce. Others work jobs they wouldn’t take otherwise or hold down multiple jobs in order to meet their families’ needs. To show how real families are navigating this child care challenge, HuffPost is profiling parents around the country. If you’d like to be featured in an installment, email us at parents@huffpost.com. Jon Hauge Rachael Gomez, her husband and their children live in the Dallas area. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); Name: Rachael Gomez Age: 34 Occupation: Texas sales manager for a group of small craft distilleries Location: Dallas area Children’s ages: 7 months, 2 years and 9 years (oldest child is Gomez’s stepson) Annual household income: $90,000 Weekly take-home pay: $1,500 Child care costs: $200 per month Work arrangements: Gomez and her husband, Jesus, met through work. “How we met was in the [restaurant] industry. Now, due to child care issues, he actually is a stay-at-home dad. He has been for about two years now. “When I was pregnant with Aly Rose, our 2-year-old, his son did not live with us full-time. We had him on the weekends. And at the time, he was working at a restaurant. The hours were crazy. We knew that we weren’t going to be able to swing caring for children. So he quit working in restaurants and started working for a wine distributor that offered a lot more flexibility. Advertisement “We tried to make it work with our schedules. But he ended up getting a new boss that just made his schedule a lot more demanding, and so our schedules really didn’t align. We put Aly Rose on six to eight different waiting lists for day cares before she was born, and then a couple after. I’ve only even gotten a call from two of those places.” Aly Rose is now 2 and a half. “She was born in July 2021. She ended up in the NICU for three weeks, unexpectedly, and so we brought her home the beginning of August. We tried to make it work schedule-wise until he ended up quitting his job December 1, 2021. My parents actually came down and watched the kids for three weeks prior, just because it really wasn’t working like we hoped. We had looked at other day cares, and any other option that we could at the time, before we made the decision for him to quit his job: Angie’s List, Care.com. People didn’t have availability for like seven to eight months. There were two [day cares] that said that they were going to have openings within six months. But they were 3.1-star, 2.3-star — and they were the best-rated in the area. We thought, do we really want our kids to have a 3.1-star life? That’s almost failing. He had been managing people for so long, and he was kind of tired of it. I’m very career-driven, as well as family-driven. He gave me the option for him to stay home. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); “To go from two pretty decent incomes to literally cutting our income in half was hard. We tried to mentally justify it with, ‘Oh, but look how much we’re saving on day care’ and all of this, but at the end of the day, you’re still at a loss. It’s a blessing now, because his son has some special needs, he has autism. Now he’s able to live with us full-time, and Jesus has more time that he can dedicate to taking him to appointments, managing his care from home as well as taking care of the kids. It’s been a little over two years. I have a higher-paying job, but it’s still not enough to offset him having no income. “My employer covers my health insurance, but the plan that they offer for my dependents and spouse is like $1,200 a month. So we chose to get a plan through the marketplace for his use and the kids. It’s not much cheaper. It saves us a couple hundred a month, which, at this point, anything helps. “The thing about my job is, it’s pretty flexible. I typically have some calls in the morning and some admin stuff that I do, starting at nine. I usually have a couple of free hours in the middle of the day. Then I leave my house to go out to visit accounts starting around four o’clock, and there’s nights I don’t get home till midnight. “Even when I get home early, he’s put three kids to bed. The only thing he has energy for is to sit on the couch. We open a bottle of wine. We just veg out for an hour until we both say, ‘OK, let’s pry our eyes away [from the TV] and go to sleep because we’re going to be up in two hours.’” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Gomez anticipates that Jesus will return to the workforce once all their children are in school, about five years from now. “He has his associate’s degree and he’s talked about getting his bachelor’s degree in an online program, but there’s just no time. Every time we try to prioritize something, even just as small as going to the gym — if I have a call in the morning, by the time that he wakes up to go to the gym, then both babies are up. So he’s probably going to put off going back to school at least for another two or three years.” Child care plan: “We did start Aly Rose in a ‘mother’s day out’ program in January of this year. It runs two days a week, five hours a day. Luckily, it’s right down the street from our house and gives Jesus a little bit of relief. It’s $200 a month, which is OK, in my mind. Pretty affordable compared to other day cares. But it is a very short window of time. He drops her off after he drops his son off at school and picks her up before he picks him up, but it gets him a good four and a half hours of ‘one-baby time.’ “We tried to [drive for] DoorDash or Uber Eats [to make] enough money to pay for her day care. If I get home and there’s a bonus program on DoorDash, I’ll go out and drive for DoorDash for three or four hours.” The family is looking at preschools for Aly Rose next year, but options are limited. Their income is too high for subsidized programs, and other programs are located far from home and offer only a few hours of care several days per week. They plan next year to send their younger daughter to the same “mother’s day out” program, which is housed in a church and runs on a school calendar. It’s for babies who are at least 1 year old and walking. “Both of us are happy that we’ve made it work. It’s a struggle financially, and I mean, I’m sure it will be forever, with the cost of everything going up. Yesterday he said, ‘I need adult time, I caught myself talking to your cousin in a baby voice.’ And I leave the city of Dallas and I work out of market throughout the rest of the state one to two weeks a month. So he’s here full-time. You couldn’t pay me money to stay home with with my kids. They’re great kids, but I just need that adult interaction. There weren’t really a whole lot of good choices.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); What would help their family: “There’s no one mandating day care pay, and those are the people that are caring the hardest for our children. Not just educating them, but literally cleaning up after them and carrying them around and helping to potty-train them and do all of the things that parents are trying to do, but for 12 bucks an hour. Day care pay regulations would be super helpful. “Also, there’s no mandated parental leave, which is insane. I had six weeks with both children, and with Aly Rose I only had two weeks of maternity leave. The rest of it was short-term disability, meaning I didn’t even get full pay. We’re not planning on having any more children because we can’t financially — that’s another two years before Jesus can go back to work and we can try to pay off some debt we’ve accrued over the last few years. “I went back to work both times before I had my six-week checkup. I hadn’t been medically cleared to lift things, and I had to go back to work. Having a little more time, parents have the ability to bond with their kids. In our case, we thought we could make child care work between the two of us. [Paid leave] would have given us a little more more leeway and breathing room to figure out a different plan. But I had already gone back to work, and there was no spare time to figure out a plan B or C. “I might not have it all, but I have it better than a lot of people. OK, yes, we’ve racked up a lot of debt. And yes, it sucks that my husband is stuck at home with the kids all day and we don’t have that income and we’re not able to save money. It’s always hard for me to to be like, ‘I want subsidized anything,’ because we have it pretty good. Do we need help? We do need child care. We both slept an hour and a half last night with a sick kid, [and] our 2-year-old doesn’t sleep ever. If we got a day care facility for the kids, we could have taken a nap this morning. Been refreshed enough to actually care for our children, instead of, to be really honest, they’re probably going to end up in front of Ms. Rachel this evening, because we’re gonna be too worn out to do anything, and I won’t be home till midnight.” Related Texas child care child care costs I’m A Single Mother With A Ph.D., And ‘I Literally Worked Seven Days A Week’ To Make Ends Meet What I Spend As A 31-Year-Old Real Estate Manager With A Baby On The Way I’m A Single Mom.

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Hinterhaus Productions via Getty Images It's tempting to go over your budget while on vacation. Vacations offer a much-needed break from the grind of working and everyday life. All good things must come at a cost, however, and sometimes that cost is much higher than expected. “Overspending on vacation is a common occurrence for many people,” Bola Sokunbi, the founder of Clever Girl Finance , told HuffPost. “Countless temptations on vacation can put us in a different state of mind. We want to treat ourselves and overindulge. Additionally, many of us follow the ‘work hard, play hard’ mentality. You put in the long hours to earn your money, and now it’s time to enjoy it by spending it on everything you want.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); If you accidentally stretched your budget a little too far during your last vacation, don’t panic. We asked experts to share their advice for getting back on track financially after a particularly overindulgent trip. Assess the damage. “The first thing you should do when you get home from vacation is know exactly how much you spent while you were away,” said Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma . “Look at your credit card statements and bank accounts to see a list of all your transactions, and think back to if you spent any cash.” Don’t forget to factor in any outstanding expenses, like repayment to the friend who put their card down for restaurant meals or a final charge from the hotel. “Although you may be fearful of looking at your bank account after vacation, the best thing you can do for your finances is to tackle it head-on,” Sokunbi said. “You may realize you’ve spent more or less than you thought.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Take note of when your next credit card bill is due and whether you’ll have the funds to cover it so that you can take action quickly. Resist the urge to ignore the problem. Create a realistic plan. “Creating goals around your finances is a great way to get back on track and recover from overspending,” Sokunbi said. “Once you know how much you’ve overspent, you can make that number your savings goal. For instance, if you’ve spent $1,000 more than you intended, your goal can be to save that amount over the next two months.” You can embark on a specific money-saving challenge to gamify the process and make it a bit more enjoyable. Tell your loved ones or find an online community for extra support and encouragement. “Savings challenges encourage you to save a set amount of money each week for a period of time,” Sokunbi said. “It’s a great way to stay motivated when saving money.” If you’re facing credit card debt due to your vacation overspending, you’ll want to prioritize paying that back as soon as possible. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Create a debt repayment plan, figuring out how much you can afford to put towards your credit card balances to pay down these travel expenses faster before high interest fees start accruing, and makes these travel expenses even more expensive to pay down,” said Andrea Woroch , a consumer finance and budgeting expert. “Considering the average credit card interest rate is over 24%, paying any interest on travel expenses means you will end up paying 24% more for it!” She recommended getting a balance transfer credit card to give yourself time to pay off your debt without interest piling up. Try to be realistic as you make a plan. “Establish achievable financial goals and timelines,” recommended Kara Stevens, the author of “Heal Your Relationship With Money” and founder of The Frugal Feminista . “Breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable steps can make the process more manageable.” Embrace a ‘little spend’ lifestyle, at least temporarily. “You may need to make some temporary tweaks to your budget to account for the recent increase in bills, and attempt to decrease your nonessential spending,” Alev said. “There are certain tactics you can try ― for example, you can embrace a ‘little spend’ lifestyle, which essentially means you primarily spend on essentials until you’re in a better place financially.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); After indulging on vacation, tighten your budget to pay back debt or rebuild depleted savings. Don’t make purchases outside necessities for a week, month, or however long you need. “If you usually allocate money to eat out each month, you can save that money and focus on preparing meals at home,” Sokunbi said. “Instead of spending money on entertainment, try having movie and game nights at home to save money.” She also recommended implementing a 24-hour waiting period before you make a purchase and disconnecting your cards from online stores. “Perhaps you don’t cut out every discretionary purchase either and only commit to cutting out those luxury services you really don’t need, like your once-monthly massage, bimonthly manicures, monthly house cleaning or weekly car wash,” Woroch suggested. “Some of these services you could forgo for a couple or a few months while stashing away the amount you would’ve spent in savings to help pay off your travel. This could easily and quickly amount to a few hundred dollars, if not to a thousand or more, without making a big impact on your daily living.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Budgeting tools and apps can also help with expense tracking and increase awareness of your spending habits. “The cash envelope method is a helpful budgeting strategy to help curb your spending,” Sokunbi added. “With this type of budgeting, you allocate different amounts of cash to varying expenses in your budget. Once the money is gone, you have reached your spending limit. By using cash more, you become more aware of your spending.” staticnak1983 via Getty Images Adjusting your mindset and making realistic goals can help you rebound financially after overspending on vacation. Be a savvy shopper. Adopt a savvier approach to shopping for any necessities that you can’t cut out of your budget. “Use cash-back sites for all those daily essentials you need to purchase, as the money you earn could be used to help pay off your travel debt,” Woroch said. “Meal-plan to save on groceries, and comparison shop.” Whether it’s pet care supplies or home goods, switch from brand-name to generic options when possible. Make good use of credit card points as well. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Stay consistent. “It’s also important to be consistent,” Alev said. “If your repayment plan and new budget aren’t feeling realistic once you put them in practice, and you see yourself falling behind, adjust them so that the goals you set are actually achievable.” Don’t get down if you fall behind. Take an honest look at your needs and routines, and tweak plans as needed. “You know your spending habits best, and you can avoid putting too much pressure on yourself by taking it step by step,” Alev added. Shift your mindset. “The idea of having to pay off the bills from your vacation may be overwhelming. But the longer you put it off, the more financial hardship you may face, especially if your credit card bill starts accruing interest charges,” Alev said. “Try a mindset shift: Viewing your temporary spending changes as a lifestyle choice to reduce your financial burden, versus viewing it as something you are forced to do, can alleviate some of that stress.” Adjusting your mindset will not only improve your mental well-being, but it will also help you commit to habits that can get you back on track. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Don’t shame yourself for overspending on vacation,” Sokunbi said. “After all, we only live once. Instead of dwelling on your mistakes, be proactive with your finances. Be more aware, focus on your goals and prioritize saving money. The more you focus on doing better, the easier you will manage your finances.” Consider a side hustle. “Another strategy you can try out is increasing your income,” Sokunbi said. “This can look like putting more hours in at work, or working a part-time job or on a side hustle.” Talk to friends and get creative as you brainstorm ways to make a little additional money. You might try selling your unwanted clothes and other items on Poshmark or Facebook Marketplace, for instance. “Look [for] a side hustle that you can do in your spare time to make some extra cash,” Woroch said. “It’s not something you have to stick to either; you could go back to it when you need extra cash, like when planning a big trip. I love flexible side hustles that don’t require much skill, like pet-sitting.” Learn from the experience. “Reflect on your overspending and identify specific reasons for it,” Stevens said, suggesting that you “learn from the experience.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Use these insights to adjust your financial habits and make better decisions in the future.” In addition to ensuring your next vacations are less financially problematic, you can also apply the lessons you learn to your general finances. “Use this experience as motivation to start or replenish an emergency fund,” Stevens said. “Having savings can provide a financial cushion for unexpected expenses and prevent future overspending.” Related personal finance vacation budget the good life Are You Guilty Of 'Spaving'?

TikTok has quickly become many people’s go-to source for recipe ideas, style inspiration, organizing tips and even personal finance advice. And lately, a new approach to money management has been making waves on the platform: “ loud budgeting .” Since the start of the new year, TikTok has been flooded with videos touting the benefits of this method and the best ways to make it work. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); “Loud budgeting is a financial strategy where you share your money aspirations directly and not so quietly with the people in your life,” Derek Ober , a financial advisor with Northwestern Mutual, told HuffPost. “It’s a public commitment. Loud budgeting centers around the idea of telling others why you’re choosing not to spend money on something and being transparent about the reason you are saving.” For example, you might say no to an expensive dinner or group trip and explain that it’s because you’re prioritizing paying off credit card debt or saving for a down payment on a house. The idea is to proudly own your money consciousness. Advertisement “Until now, we usually saw people flaunting their money on social media rather than flaunting their financial struggles,” said budgeting expert Andrea Woroch . “Loud budgeting suggests you should speak up about your financial situation and make spending decisions that support your goals and match your current budget and needs. It’s making it socially acceptable to use your financial struggles as a reason to opt out of certain gatherings, trips or group gifts.” But does this social media trend pass muster with experienced financial advisors? We asked some experts to break down loud budgeting and share their advice for implementing this approach into your everyday life. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Is loud budgeting a good idea? “As a financial advisor, I think this trend is a great approach to managing your finances,” Ober said. “Telling others why you’re choosing not to spend money on something can both hold you accountable and provide positive reinforcement from other loud budgeters who are doing the same.” He noted that loud budgeting offers a sense of camaraderie that makes it easier to say no to activities and expenses that don’t fit in your budget at the moment. “Ultimately, I think this trend transcends the notion of talking about your budget as a reason not to do something, but rather it’s helping move the money talk in the right direction so that we can feel comfortable addressing previously taboo topics like debt,” Woroch said. “Until now, there’s been a negative stigma around talking about money and a lot of shame around debt.” Hiding your financial struggles hinders your ability to make improvements for the future, he said. And if you’re worried about what other people think, you might be more likely to spend money on things you shouldn’t. By contrast, Woroch noted, loud budgeting is “the anti-YOLO.” Plus, speaking out about your money issues gives you the chance to gather helpful information from peers who’ve been in similar situations. It might also bring you closer to loved ones and to your personal values. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “It’s easy to get caught up in mindless, lifestyle inflation that allows increased spending on things like food and vacations just because your income has increased,” said Jacqueline Howard, the head of financial wellness at Ally Bank. “Loud budgeting can help you realign your spending values with the things that matter most to you and rethink the why behind each purchase. A person may realize they are overspending only because that’s what their friends are doing, or it’s because of something they saw on social media.” Are there any downsides? Removing the shame and stigma from debt and budgeting conversations could help you live a more financially healthy lifestyle. But the loud budgeting trend could come with a few downsides if applied incorrectly. “I hope we don’t see people leverage this budgeting concept in an effort to be cheap, such as skimping on tips to deserving service providers,” Woroch said. She also emphasized the need to back up your “loud” words with action. “It’s important that you don’t fall into the trap of being all talk,” Woroch said. “Taking action is key to improving your finances and this will require a detailed plan to make it happen.” MoMo Productions via Getty Images Setting specific goals -- and communicating them -- will help you implement loud budgeting. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); What’s the best way to implement loud budgeting into your life? Once you’ve resolved to try to out loud budgeting, taking a mindful approach will help you stick with it and see real results. Some general guidelines to keep in mind: 1. Set specific financial goals. “It’s best to identify specific goals you are trying to achieve for the year, so that you can articulate your intentions clearly to others,” Ober said. Setting clear goals can also help you budget more effectively. “Spending less and saving more are great goals, but they don’t give you much direction to follow,” Woroch said. “You need to know what you’re working towards, so be specific when setting a financial goals and then build a budget that includes realistic debt payments, savings, etc.” 2. Consider your values. As you establish your goals and budget, take stock of the things that truly bring you joy and meaning so that you can implement them into your monthly spending plan and cut down elsewhere. “A value-based spending plan considers your personal values, goals, and priorities, whereas a budget will track your monthly income and expenses,” Howard said. “When building out your spending plan, ask yourself, ‘What are your values? How do you define them?’ It’s easier to make decisions that align with your overall financial goals when you’re clear on what those values are.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); 3. Communicate your needs. “To practice ‘loud budgeting,’ talk with your loved ones and start discussing money matters with your kids and spouse,” said Michael Hershfield, founder and CEO of Accrue Savings . “This will ultimately help you learn and improve your spending habits.” Set aside time and space to talk to friends and family about your financial goals, values and needs. “Having an open and honest dialogue with friends and family might sound difficult, but you should never feel ashamed for sticking to your financial goals,” Ober said. If someone gets upset when you say no to something because it doesn’t fit with your budget, have a dialogue about it. “Make it clear this is not about them, but rather about you sticking to your goals,” Ober said. 4. Come up with alternative plans. “While loud budgeting may seem positive when you start, you may start missing out on the fun stuff,” Woroch said. “When you have to dip out of a dinner or weekend getaway, come up with an alternative plan to spend time with your friends that doesn’t cost as much. Invite them over for drinks at your place, request everyone to BYOB. Set up a hike and picnic. Find a free event to attend.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); The key is to emphasize that there are many ways to make memories together and to put in the effort to come up with workable alternatives. “You can suggest cooking at home with a friend instead of going out to eat,” Hershfield suggested. “Another idea is to walk together for 10 minutes rather than ordering an Uber .” 5. Be honest about gifts. “Just like you’re encouraged to be honest about why you chose not to spend, be honest about your needs when it comes to gifts for birthdays, holidays or a life event like a wedding,” Woroch said. “Rather than create a registry full of kitchen goods you really don’t need, ask family and friends to contribute to a home down payment or student debt repayment.” She suggested that new parents on a budget might open up a custodial account for their baby and ask that grandparents and loved ones consider making cash contributions, in lieu of expensive toys and birthday gifts, to support their child’s financial future. Many financial institutions and even brands like Gerber offer different custodial account options for families. 6. Try out new money-saving hacks. “While loud budgeting suggests you need to make drastic changes in your spending on social events, you can find big savings without sacrificing by reducing monthly bills,” Woroch said. “This may even give you a little room to spend more on a dinner with friends.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); She recommended negotiating rates with current credit card providers, comparing rates with competitors and canceling unused subscriptions. Consider opening a separate high-yield savings account to earn interest on your money. “Tap into free rewards and cash back tools,” Woroch added. “Refer family and friends to a business or store to earn cash back that you can use to spend on yourself.” She also recommended looking into cash-back apps like Fetch and coupon sites like CouponCabin . Once you start practicing loud budgeting, you’ll likely learn even more money-saving hacks from loved ones through your open conversations about finances. The potential for positive effects is seemingly endless. Ober added, “I hope that loud budgeting lives beyond just being a trend, and more people are comfortable enough to be transparent with their financial goals and continue to hold themselves accountable.” Related TikTok Wellness personal finance Financial Experts Reveal Their 1 Biggest Spending Regret Spent Too Much On Your Vacation?

    "article_content": "On Assignment For HuffPost d3sign via Getty Images There's more to money management than setting a budget. You’ve probably heard common financial advice like keeping a budget and trying not to spend more than you make. But other tips aren’t as well-known that can help you save a lot of money and create a financially healthy life. From daily hacks to long-term tips, we talked to financial experts about not-so-obvious money advice they follow. Here’s what to know: Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); 1. Sometimes you have to spend more to save more. “A low price on a lousy product is actually a terrible deal because you will end up spending more, in the long run, to replace cheaply made items that break easily,” Andrea Woroch , a consumer-finance and budgeting expert, told HuffPost. “Focus on quality and spend more if it means it will last.” Woroch tries to save on quality merchandise by shopping second-hand for name brands. For big-ticket items, she recommends taking advantage of retail sales events (like Amazon Prime Day) and buying seasonal items (like patio furniture and winter clothing) at the end of the season. Other tips: Participate in free loyalty programs and search for online coupons before making a purchase. Advertisement 2. Don’t be too restrictive with your budget , and don’t try to change it all at once. “Although a detailed budget keeps you on track to meet your financial goals, one that is too restrictive will actually backfire quickly due to burnout,” Woroch explained. “[And] if you try to change all your spending habits overnight, it will be difficult to stick to the plan.” Instead, she suggests making a few small changes to your spending and savings habits — and then building on these once they become routine. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); She said it’s also important to make room in your budget for expenses that matter to you. For example, if a dinner date with a friend or partner is a priority, keep this in your budget. Find other ways to cut down on spending, like canceling unused subscriptions and unplugging gadgets to decrease energy bills. 3. Beware of convenient methods of payment, like auto-renew. “It’s extraordinarily easy now in our society to spend money without thinking about it,” said Anne Lester , author of “ Your Best Financial Life.” “You can sign up for auto-renew … you see something cute on Instagram, you go tap and boom, you bought it.” But being able to buy things too easily can lead to unconscious spending. Instead, Lester advises slowing yourself down to make spending money more of a conscious decision. One way she does this is to always create a shopping list before she goes into a store or buys items online. For onli ne shopping, she suggests setting aside a specific time once a week to make purchases. When reviewing your list, ask yourself: Do I really need this? Is there a tangible moment when I know I’ll use this? Just making the list will give you time to reflect on whether the purchase is worthwhile. For subscriptions, it can be easy to forget ones set to “auto-renew.” Lester suggests doing a “subscription cleanse” periodically, reviewing all your subscriptions and canceling the ones you’re no longer using. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Milko via Getty Images Being too restrictive with your budget may actually backfire. 4. Automate saving money instead of letting it sit in your checking account. “You should automate everything you can about saving so that you don’t have to make a conscious decision to do it,” Lester said. “[If you don’t] you set up a conversation … with yourself about what you could be doing with that money, and often you lose because getting stuff is more fun than saving.” Michael Finke , professor of wealth management at The American College of Financial Services, suggests setting up an automatic transfer to a high-yield savings account. For example, if you get paid at the end of the month, you can set up a transfer on the first day of the next month. “Money in a checking account can be tempting to spend,” he said. “Making regular transfers to a high-yield savings account can help you build an emergency fund without feeling the pain of writing a check.” Lester also recommends automatically transferring money to a retirement account. If you work for a company that offers a 401(k) plan, it’s ideal to sign up for the full employer match. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Not taking advantage of a match is like leaving hundred-dollar bills on the ground,” Finke explained. “Even if you took it out after a year and paid a 10% penalty, you’d still come out way ahead.” If you don’t have access to a 401(k) plan through work, you can set up an individual retirement account (IRA) and still have money automatically transferred, Lester explained. 5. Pay close attention to even small purchases on your credit card statements. When reviewing your credit card statements, it’s easy to just focus on the bigger charges. But it’s actually key to also review the smaller line items. “Not every fraudulent charge is a four-figure shopping spree,” Sara Rathner , personal finance expert at NerdWallet, told HuffPost. “ Often, thieves test your card out with a few purchases of just a few dollars.” These purchases are easy to overlook, and if you miss them, bigger fraudulent charges could follow later on. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Rathner advises checking your credit card statements monthly, and if you see something you don’t recognize (even a few-dollar charge), report it to your credit card company immediately. 6. Have one main investment account and another for short- to mid-term projects. “[While] most of my clients have at least one long-term [investment] account, I encourage them to consider opening another investment account for mid-term goals,” s aid Elaine King , a certified financial planner and founder of Family and Money Matters . Mid-term goals could include buying a home, paying for education, purchasing an investment property or starting a business. “When separating investment accounts, we aim to match the portfolio allocation to the specific goals and time horizon and, in the end, save you time and money,” she explained. For example, if buying a home is on the short-term horizon, the “real estate fund” should be invested in short-term assets. 7. Most importantly, know there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach when it comes to personal finances. “Personal finances [are] personal and seasonal … [they should be] based on values [and] life circumstances,” said Kara Stevens , founder of The Frugal Feminista and author of “Heal Your Relationship With Money.” Once you understand that other people’s priorities are not the same as yours, “you’ll be able to better identify the tools … that make the most sense for you.” Before creating a financial plan, Patrick Yono , founder and CEO of Sure Life Financial, recommends mapping out what’s important to you: What type of home do you want? What type of work-life balance is best for you? What interests do you want to pursue? Once you have the end goal, then you can figure out how to earn the money you need, what type of investments to make, etc. Stevens added that we also need to be flexible and responsive to what’s happening in our day-to-day and in the larger world and not feel bound by our financial “rules.” “There are a lot of rules of thumb out there when it comes to money, but don’t feel pressure to follow them all,” Rathner said. “The best thing you can build into your personal financial plan is the flexibility to make changes as needed.” Related personal finance budget Financial Experts Reveal Their 1 Biggest Spending Regret 'Loud Budgeting' Is Going Viral On TikTok — And For Good Reason Are You Guilty Of 'Spaving'?

    "article_content": "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life CSA-Printstock via Getty Images The \"100 envelope challenge\" has captivated TikTok audiences, but is it worth trying out? From loud budgeting to girl math , TikTok is an endless source of trends and information about personal finance. A particularly quippy one that has taken hold is the “100 envelope challenge,” an approach to saving money that uses cash and envelopes to gamify the experience. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); So what exactly is the 100 envelope challenge and how does it work? We asked personal finance experts to break down the method, as well as the benefits, downsides and everything else you should know before trying it out. What is the 100 envelope challenge? “The 100 envelope challenge is a viral money-saving method where you number 100 envelopes from one to 100,” said Jack Howard , the head of money wellness at Ally Financial. “Each day, you select a random envelope and insert the corresponding dollar amount to be tucked away until the end of the challenge. So, if you pick envelope #32, you should put $32 dollars in the envelope.” Advertisement At the end of 100 days, you should have a total of $5,050 in cash set aside. The challenge can also progress linearly instead of randomly. The alternative approach would be to start with envelope #1 on the first day and put aside $1 then $2 into envelope #2 the next day, $3 into envelope #3 and so on. “Popularized by TikTok, the 100 envelope challenge is essentially a way to make saving money more approachable,” said Courtney Alev, consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma . Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-2\", \"entry_paragraph_3\", false, false); }); Having to essentially “pay” an envelope every day might encourage you to cut back elsewhere in a way that feels more natural and seamless. You can also adjust your totals to fit with your personal savings goals. “If putting away that much cash is not realistic, especially when you’re entering the double digits, you can customize the amount per envelope that fits your budget but still feels like a challenge,” said Andrea Woroch , a consumer finance and budgeting expert. “Ultimately, you’re still saving ― and saving more than if you didn’t participate in the challenge at all.” While the 100 envelope challenge is tied to the TikTok era, the concept of putting cash into envelopes to encourage saving is not new. “The envelope budgeting method has been around for a long time, but with a different focus,” Woroch explained, noting that earlier versions required budgeting out a certain amount of cash for each expense in your budget. “You can only use that amount, so if it runs out, you’re out ― which can keep you out of credit card debt and on a tight spending plan.” What are the benefits? “Like the other viral money-saving methods, there’s gamification and a sense of fun added to something you should already be doing,” Howard said. “When saving money becomes a ‘challenge,’ it can be a motivator, especially when it results in $5,050 of cash.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); She noted that this daily challenge also forces you to practice money mindfulness. Indeed, doing something positive for 100 days is a good way to develop healthier habits. “You have a daily goal that requires thoughtful planning to execute,” Howard said. “Knowing you need to meet the goal may stop you from spending on things you really don’t need and have historically purchased out of habit.” Changing your spending habits and saving money can feel like a big, intimidating endeavor in the abstract, but this approach helps you start small and take it one step at a time. “Methods like the 100 envelope challenge can help because it turns saving into a game, and you have a clear path and goal to follow, which reduces the mental load of planning and staying focused,” Woroch said. So not only are you saving a good chunk of money in a short time, but by fostering a budget-oriented mindset and new practices, you’re also setting yourself up to save more money in the long term. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “It can be a great method for those who are more visual, and want to physically see the money they are saving and spending instead of using a credit card and paying a bill,” Alev noted. Johner Images via Getty Images There are risks to doing the 100 envelope challenge. What are the downsides? “If you are someone who doesn’t tend to carry cash, you may be making multiple trips to the ATM,” Alev noted. “Toward the end of the challenge you’ll have a large amount of cash on hand, and you want to secure it in a safe, hidden spot that isn’t easy for others to access.” There are risks to keeping such large quantities of cash in your home, so you might want to reconsider the envelope approach if you’re prone to misplacing things or live in a place where theft is a concern. “You may want to do this digitally by transferring money into a dedicated savings account each day and keeping track of these transfers using a spreadsheet,” said Jannese Torres, host of the “Yo Quiero Dinero!” podcast and author of “Financially Lit!” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); To pursue the 100 envelope challenge, you’ll also need to be realistic about your financial situation. “Make sure you’re saving an amount that won’t derail your budget or drain your bank account, as this could mean overdrafting your account or carrying a balance on your credit card to pay for daily essentials in the event you withdrew the money you had to pay for those purchases in the first place,” Woroch cautioned. “Obviously, paying interest on a credit card is not a smart money move, so it’s important to figure out where you can cut back and how much you can save each day without messing up your cash flow,” she added. “I’m sure there are plenty of unnecessary purchases you could cut out to make this work, or memberships and subscriptions you could pause for the time being.” Unexpected expenses could also arise during the 100 envelope challenge process, so you might get discouraged if you aren’t able to stick to the rules of putting aside money every single day as a result. “At the end of the day, it’s another fad that doesn’t promote a sustainable saving practice ― and the $5,050 isn’t guaranteed,” Howard said. “Some might find it difficult to remember to complete the challenge each day and fall behind on the goal to save in 100 days.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); She recalled trying a similar challenge with a plastic wallet that encourages $40 contributions. “I thought it would be an easy way to save $1,000 quickly,” Howard said. “The problem is I often need cash and will pull from the envelope when I need to pay for pizza delivery, act like the tooth fairy when my daughter loses her tooth or need to pay for parking.” You could also miss out on extra earnings by saving your money in cash at home, she added. “If you choose to keep your cash in envelopes instead of a traditional bank, you’re missing out on compounding interest,” Howard explained. “A high-yield savings account will help your money grow over time, even after the 100-day challenge ends. We’re currently in a competitive rate environment which is great for saving.” What’s the best way to make it work? “Like any budgeting method, it works if you stick to it,” Alev said. “For best results, make a plan for the money you’ll save before you start. Whether you’re looking to start an emergency fund or want to pay down debt, having an end goal will help you stay motivated throughout the entire challenge.” Accountability buddies can provide great motivation in any savings endeavor, including the 100 envelope challenge. “I think it can work, but it does require discipline,” Torres said. “So I’d recommend inviting some friends to join in on the challenge to keep each other accountable.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Think about ways you could cut down on your spending or earn extra money to help complete the challenge as well. “I also like using savings tools that save for you,” Woroch said. “Qapital that has a round up feature in which it rounds up purchases to the whole dollar ― or whatever amount you select ― with linked debit cards, and then saves or invests that spare change. That spare change can add up fast!” She recommended digital tools like Fetch or CouponCabin that allow you to earn cash back on the daily purchases you have to make anyway. “If you’re on a tight budget, you don’t have to miss out on this savings challenge ― think about canceling or pausing subscriptions and memberships you really don’t need, haggle your monthly bills or consider taking on a side hustle just for the time being,” Woroch said. She added that you can earn extra cash by pet sitting through Rover or tutoring through Varsity Tutors as well. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “To make the most of your money while still challenging yourself, why not combine the Envelope Challenge with a high-yield savings account?” Howard said. “Each day you can pick a number between one and 100 and transfer the correlating dollar amount from your checking account to your savings. That way you’re taking advantage of earning interest and your money is protected.” Official banking can also remove the temptation that’s there when you have envelopes filled with cash and need to quickly grab money to pay for something. For many, it takes more effort and thoughtfulness to dig into their online savings. “It’s important for people to understand that these viral moments are typical of social media and don’t always show the low moments in life,” Howard noted. “While you might come across someone who easily completed the challenge, there are multiple people who found it difficult to keep up with or had an unexpected expense that derailed them.” These moments are rarely shared online, so try to keep that perspective when you consider a method like the 100 envelope challenge. And don’t be discouraged if you don’t find the success you saw on TikTok. “What works for one person doesn’t work for everyone else,” Howard said. “While it’s important we all have a plan of attack when it comes to our savings, you should only do what works best for you and your lifestyle.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Related TikTok personal finance Savings Spent Too Much On Your Vacation?

That’s when the regret starts seeping in, and it’s all too common.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-1\", \"entry_paragraph_1\", false, false); }); She noted that in a recent Ally survey, over 1 in 3 shoppers said they are likely to buy something impulsively to feel better about themselves, but only half said they felt happy after doing so. To combat this toxic temptation, many consumers are taking a completely different approach: slow shopping. Advertisement What is ‘slow shopping’? “Slow shopping is a financial trend that pushes people to be more intentional with their spending and purchases, focusing on being more mindful with what you’re buying, why you’re buying it and how much you’re spending on the purchase,” said consumer finance and budgeting expert Andrea Woroch . “Rather than jumping on impulse to buy something as soon as a want or desire arises, slow shopping encourages you to think through the purchase in order to make the best buying decision for your budget, giving you time to evaluate need, cost and value.” There’s an emphasis on quality over quantity as you shop with intentionality ― the opposite of impulse buying. Through this practice, you consider your budget and financial situation, and appraise your purchases as investments.

It makes you think about what you can afford, not just about what you want at the moment.” As people get older and their discretionary income rises, there’s a tendency to spend more money on things that they previously would’ve seen as unnecessary luxuries ― a phenomenon known as “lifestyle creep.” In the age of social media, that spending evolution can spiral out of control as consumers see the splurge items and experiences their peers are buying, and come to perceive these things as a right rather than a choice. Woroch pointed to a recent survey from Bread Financial , which found that 62% of Gen Z consumers admit to spending unnecessary money to keep up with trends they see online, and 79% say that social media influences their guilty-pleasure purchases. The result is more regretful purchases and waste. “Because social media and other social influences can often lead to overspending and impulsive purchases, slow shopping can help you break this bad money habit and help you avoid FOMO,” Woroch noted. Freeing yourself from this harmful social media cycle is just one of many potential mental health benefits from slow shopping. In contrast to “retail therapy,” being more mindful about how you use your hard-earned cash reduces financial anxiety and spending regrets.

This practice of asking ‘why’ before you spend money helps incorporate mindfulness into your daily routine and, with consistency, empowers you to own your money story.” According to a recent study from Intuit Credit Karma, 24% of Americans say their emotional spending ― that is, buying things to cope with emotional highs and lows ― is out of control, leading many to overspend and even go into debt. “By slow shopping, you’re less likely to let a passing feeling of happiness, boredom, or depression (the leading causes of emotional spending reported in the survey) motivate you to spend money you’d be better off saving,” Courtney Alev, consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma , told HuffPost. Dimensions via Getty Images There are mental health benefits to taking a more mindful approach to shopping. What are the downsides? Although personal finance experts point to many potential benefits from slow shopping, the concept is not without its drawbacks. Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); “Thinking through your purchases thoroughly can be time-consuming, especially if you are an overthinker,” Sokunbi said. “You might miss out on sales or specials tied to limited time frames, which in turn may cause you to pay more when you finally decide on your purchase. But minimizing regrets and thoughtful spending far outweigh the downsides.” There is indeed a risk that you might miss out on a limited-time deal, but those fleeting discounts should not be the main drivers of your spending choices. “Deals will come and go, so just wait for the next sale cycle if you decide you want the item!” Woroch urged. The same goes for concerns about inventory running out. You can always sign up for notifications when the item comes back in stock. “I’m the world’s slowest shopper and was eyeing a bed for my daughter for about a year when I finally decided to make the purchase, and after much comparison shopping and budget consideration, I realized the item was out of stock,” Woroch explained. “I signed up for the in-stock alert and got a message about a month later that it was available in the size and color I was looking for. Good news, too, because it was still on sale!” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); Restrictive practices like slow shopping can also reach their own extreme, so it’s important to focus on balance. “If you take slow shopping too slowly, you may find yourself obsessing about every purchase, even those you may need to make,” Alev said. Another potential downside of slow shopping is that it might distract you from exploring the fundamental causes of your financial habits. Resist the urge to let quippy personal finance trends get in the way of a more holistic approach. “As with anything, what works for one person’s finances doesn’t always work for the next person,” Howard said. “It’s important to have a game plan when it comes to spending and saving, but you should ultimately focus on implementing habits that work best for you. Slow shopping is a helpful mindset, and I’d encourage anyone who’s become a serial overspender to try to pinpoint when and why they picked up this behavior, digging for the root issue behind the spending.” She noted that overspending can be related to social pressure, FOMO, the temptation of status symbols like designer handbags, and even the rise of “little treat” culture . But there are deeper influences as well.

Or if your parents practiced ‘retail therapy,’ you might also use that as a coping mechanism or distraction. Uncovering how your money story began is the first step to start contextualizing spending habits to inform a personalized, effective strategy to avoid overspending.” What’s the best way to implement ‘slow shopping’? Once you’ve resolved to try slow shopping to improve your spending habits and cut down on frivolous purchases and waste, you might feel overwhelmed wondering where to begin. “If you are new to slow spending, pick an area of your finances to start with ― clothing, personal care items or groceries,” Sokunbi recommended. “Set up your shopping lists, assess and review them, compare prices and decide what purchase you’d like to make and for what reason.” You don’t have to immediately apply this approach to every aspect of your spending, and you might have to figure out what timing works best for you. “I often recommend the ‘48-hour rule,’ or waiting a full two days from that first impulse to purchase before following through with buying it,” Howard said. “And yes, this applies even if it’s on sale! This 48-hour window allows just enough time to calm your emotions and that perceived urgency, which adds clarity in determining if you really need or actually want the item.” Advertisement HPGam.cmd.push(function(){ return HPGam.render(\"inline-infinite\", \"repeating_dynamic_display\", false, false); }); She recommended practicing “values-based spending” ― buying only the things and experiences that align with your values. “The first step in this process is identifying what matters most to you above all else,” Howard explained. “For example, my values are creating generational wealth, nature and sustainability, experiences, and design that is really beautiful. Your values should really reflect what brings you joy and purpose. After you have identified your values, use it to guide your decisions the next time you are tempted to spend.” Ask yourself honestly whether a discretionary purchase supports your values. That way you will spend money on what is authentic to you and promotes your happiness. Howard also recommended putting together a practical budget with different categories that you can reference and prioritize. “Setting aside a percentage of your paycheck as ‘guilt-free spending money’ is another easy way to stick to a budget, while still giving some freedom for fun purchases,” she said.

How two people slow shop could be two different timelines. Be comfortable with however much time you need to make a smart decision.” Related Mindfulness personal finance online shopping spending slow shopping Financial Experts Reveal Their 1 Biggest Spending Regret Americans Ramped Up Holiday Spending Despite Financial Anxiety, Higher Costs I Did A No-Buy Month To Get My Budget Back On Track.

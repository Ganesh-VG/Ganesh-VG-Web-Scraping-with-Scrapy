File. | Photo Credit: Reuters India on June 21 was critical of the Canadian parliament observing \"one minute silence\" in the memory of Khalistan extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar , who was gunned down in Surrey, British Columbia, in June last year. \"We naturally oppose any moves giving political space to extremism and advocacy of violence,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said. In an unusual move, the Canadian parliament observed \"one minute silence\" two days ago in memory of Nijjar. The relations between the two countries came under severe strain following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a \"potential\" involvement of Indian agents in Nijjar's killing . New Delhi rejected Mr. Trudeau's charges as \"absurd\". India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity. Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra last week said India's main issue with Canada continues to be the political space that Ottawa provides to anti-India elements which advocate extremism and violence. India has repeatedly conveyed its \"deep concerns\" to Canada and New Delhi expects Ottawa to take strong action against those elements, he said. Nijjar, who was declared a terrorist by India, was shot dead outside a gurdwara in British Columbia on June 18 last year. The murder is being probed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).

Nvidia, whose market capitalization surpassed that of Microsoft on Tuesday, was set to add nearly $84 billion to its last close market value of $3.34 trillion at the current level of $138.99. Microsoft had a market value of $3.32 trillion, as of last close. Its shares were down 1% at $442 in early trade. Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer gained 4% and 4.5%, respectively. The companies make servers equipped with Nvidia chips, enabling them to capitalize on the surging demand for processors that power virtually all AI applications. (For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today’s Cache) Musk said on his X social media platform on Wednesday that Dell and Super Micro are supplying server racks for xAI's supercomputer, which will be used to expand the capabilities of its AI tool, Grok. He said earlier this year that training the Grok 2 model took about 20,000 Nvidia H100 graphic processing units and that the Grok 3 model and beyond would require 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips. \"While Microsoft both spends and makes money in AI, Nvidia only makes money and lots of money and profits in AI. That's why you cannot spell Nvidia without AI,\" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer, Longbow Asset Management.

More surprising was record eight-time Australian pole winner Lewis Hamilton not making it into the final round of qualifying on Saturday. Verstappen, who has won both races to start the season in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, with his Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez second both times, will start in the front row for Sunday's 58-lap race on the temporary Albert Park street circuit. It was the 35th pole of Verstappen's F1 career. Carlos Sainz, returning from appendix surgery ahead of the last race in Saudi Arabia, was second-fastest, followed by Perez in third. “It was a bit unexpected but I'm very happy,” Verstappen said. “It's been a bit of a tricky weekend so far. (Ferrari) seem very quick, so it's a bit of a question mark for tomorrow.” The biggest surprise of the day was Mercedes driver Hamilton. He failed to advance from the second qualifying session, finishing 11th. It was his worst qualifying position in Melbourne since 2010. Ferrari’s performance here could have been compromised after Sainz declared he was ready to return to the cockpit, but not feeling 100% after surgery for appendicitis ahead of the last race in Saudi Arabia. But the Spanish driver, who is out of contract at the end of the season, rebounded from a hospital bed a few weeks ago to the front row of the grid in Australia this weekend. “It's been a tough couple of weeks, so to make it to this weekend I'm very happy,” Sainz said. “I was a bit rusty at the beginning but I got up to speed and I'm feeling good in the car.” Sainz said he was still feeling the effects of the surgery. “I am not going to lie, I am not in my most comfortable state, but i can get it done,” he said. \"Obviously, a lot of discomfort and weird feelings, but no pain, so it allows me to push.” Australian Daniel Ricciardo was eliminated in the first qualifying session for the first time at Albert Park after his fastest lap was deleted by stewards. Ricciardo surged into the top-10 near the end of the session and seemed certain to continue his impressive record of never qualifying lower than 15th in Melbourne. But the 34-year-old Ricciardo was deemed to have exceeded track limits and was pushed back to start from 18th place in his first GP on home soil since 2022. Alex Albon qualified 12th, repaying some of the faith shown from Williams after the British-born Thai driver sat in teammate Logan Sargeant’s car. Albon’s vehicle sustained extensive damage after he crashed into a wall during practice on Friday, with American driver Sargeant stepping aside for the rest of the weekend. It was an eventful week ahead of Saturday's qualifying. FIA’s Ethics Committee had cleared its president, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, from “interference of any kind” at two F1 events last year was followed quickly by a social media post from Susie Wolff, who is director of the all-female series F1 Academy and also married to Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff, announcing that she had filed a criminal complaint in the French courts against the sport's governing body for statements made about her in December. It was all against the backdrop of ongoing furore surrounding Red Bull Racing and its team principal Christian Horner.

While coach Luis de la Fuente has the luxury of being able to rest players for the final group game, he will also want to maintain the momentum Spain have built up. \"We're still a long way off winning the European Championship. We haven't yet achieved anything. Okay, we've won some important matches. We have wonderful prospects,\" De la Fuente said after his side outclassed holders Italy. \"But football can also be very cruel. So we need to be cautious. We need to be humble. We need to show respect.\" Coaches are often reluctant, in public at least, to saddle their players with lofty expectations, but De la Fuente has not been slow in coming forward, describing his squad as the best in the tournament, if not the world. On the evidence so far he has a point. Spain have looked the slickest outfit on display so far and have shortened the odds on them winning a record fourth Euros title. The likes of teenager Lamine Yamal, winger Nico Williams and fellow 21-year-old Pedri all produced dazzling displays against Italy while striker Alvaro Morata, defender Dani Carvajal and midfielder Rodri provide invaluable tournament experience. With their last-16 game against a third-placed team from Group A, B, C or D not until July 2, De la Fuente may decide that resting key players against Albania could disrupt the rhythm of his side and effect their sharpness. He will be forced into at least one change, however, with Rodri suspended after picking up yellow cards in Spain's opening two games -- his caution against Italy coming after breaking new UEFA rules about approaching a referee. Albania will expect no favours from Spain as they seek the unlikely win they need to reach the knockout phase for the first time having exited in the group phase on their debut in 2016. A last-gasp goal secured a 2-2 draw with Croatia to keep their hopes alive and their Brazilian coach Sylvinho has instilled a sense of belief in his squad. \"What I promise to the Albanian people is that we will fight for every point,\" the former Arsenal midfielder said. \"Against Spain it will be difficult but we must enjoy these moments.\" soccer BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The Fed voted unanimously to keep its benchmark interest rate between 5.25 and 5.50%, and said that \"modest\" progress had been made toward its long-term inflation target of 2%. The announcement suggests that central bank officials remain wary about cutting rates too soon, despite consumer inflation data published earlier Wednesday, which pointed to a slowdown in the rate of price increases in May. The annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.3% last month, down 0.1 percentage point from April and unchanged on a monthly basis, the Labor Department said. This was slightly below expectations. Fed chair Jerome Powell welcomed the inflation data during a press conference on Wednesday, but added that the US central bank needs to see more \"good inflation readings\" before it gains sufficient confidence to consider cutting interest rates. He added that if the US economy remains strong and inflation persists, the Fed would be \"prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate.\" The surprise of the day came in the Fed's updated economic forecasts from the 19 members of its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Policymakers lowered their individual forecasts for the number of rate cuts they expect this year, reducing the median projection for the end of 2024 to the midpoint between 5.00 and 5.25%. This means that FOMC participants only expect one 0.25 percentage point cut before year-end, two fewer than in the last update in March. The announcement caught some analysts by surprise, while others suggested the Fed would have to backtrack in the months ahead. \"The dropping of two of the easings previously expected this year is unnecessarily aggressive,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson wrote in a note to clients. He added that the Fed would likely need to backtrack to a softening of the labor market of the summer and better progress on inflation. \"It will be a close call between one or two 25 bps (basis point) rate cuts this year,\" Wells Fargo economists wrote in an investor note, adding that their forecast remained for two cuts this year. FOMC participants penciled in a median of four quarter percentage-point cuts for next year, and an additional four in 2026. In their economic forecasts, Fed officials also raised the forecast for headline inflation this year to 2.6%, up 0.2 percentage points, and kept their growth outlook unchanged at 2.1%. Policymakers then expect both growth and inflation to moderate further in 2025. The better-than-expected inflation data earlier Wednesday led futures traders to raise their expectations of an interest rate cut by mid-September to more than 70%, up sharply from around 50% on Tuesday, according to CME Group data. But the Fed's rate decision tempered the optimism slightly, with traders dialing back their expectations to just over 60%. \"The Fed is not likely to have enough confidence that the economy is cooling to cut rates by September,\" KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk wrote in a blog post after the Fed's rate decision, adding that KPMG still expects one cut in December. \"Inflation just seems like it's really sticky, and it's putting up quite a fight,\" Allianz Trade Americas senior economist Dan North told AFP, adding that the Fed \"always waits too long\" before starting to cut rates. \"We expect a string of more favorable inflation releases — on the heels of Wednesday's softer-than-expected May CPI report — will clear the way for the Fed to lower rates in September,\" Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients. economy, business and finance / USA / inflation and deflation / interest rate BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The details were not specified by UEFA on Monday but followed a formal complaint by the football federation of Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 that its neighbor has never recognized. UEFA's disciplinary panel will consider a charge against Serbia of its fans “transmitting a provocative message unfit for a sports event” and throwing objects during England's 1-0 win on Sunday at Gelsenkirchen. Serbia fans displayed a national flag which included in its borders the territory of Kosovo, its former republic. Kosovan football officials alerted UEFA to flags, chants and banners which they said contained “political, chauvinistic and racist messages” against their country. The charges should be judged before Thursday, when Serbia plays its second Euro 2024 game against Slovenia in Munich. A fine would typically be imposed in such cases with stricter measures potentially imposed in a future competition. UEFA gave no timeline for the investigation into alleged discriminatory behavior. Serbia fans clashed with England fans in the city before the late evening game, but the strict liability federations have under UEFA rules for incidents at stadiums does not always include violent incidents elsewhere. UEFA has sanctioned Serbia several times in recent seasons for fan misconduct and discrimination, including limiting ticket sales or ordering the team to play in an empty stadium.

Mahesh Mittal, proprietor of Shree Ganpati Tubewell Company, was taken into custody on June 19. He was produced before a court that sent him to ED custody till June 24. The Central agency early this week had arrested Padamchand Jain, proprietor of Shree Shyam Tubewell Company. The Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) launched by the Union government aims to provide safe and adequate drinking water through household tap connections and it is being implemented in Rajasthan by the State's Public Health Engineering (PHE) Department. A man named Piyush Jain was the first to be arrested in this case by the federal agency in February. The agency's investigation found Padamchand Jain and others were involved in giving bribes to public servants in order to obtain illegal protection, obtaining tenders, getting bills sanctioned and covering up irregularities in works executed by them in respect of various tenders received by them from the PHED. The suspects were also involved in the purchase of stolen goods from Haryana for using the same in their tenders/contracts and had also submitted \"fake\" work completion letters from IRCON to get PHED contracts, the agency claimed. The money-laundering case of the ED stems from an FIR registered by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) where it was charged Padamchand Jain, Mahesh Mittal, Piyush Jain and others. Premises in Jaipur and Dausa, including the residential and official premises of senior PHE Department officials, former Rajasthan Minister Mahesh Joshi and IAS officer and the then additional Chief Secretary Subodh Agarwal, have been searched by the ED in connection with the probe.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 17, 2024 10:23 am IST Italian writer, translator, and screenwriter Veronica Raimo. | Photo Credit: Getty Images Veronica Raimo’s Lost on Me is a literary feast for lovers of Fleabag (protagonist of the eponymous comedy series) and Natalia Ginzburg’s novels. Like Ginzburg, Raimo writes about dysfunctional families and relationships. Like Fleabag, Raimo’s protagonist, Vero, is a young-ish woman who puts a comic spin on her failed relationships. There are events in Vero’s life that must have been traumatic but the reader encounters them through Raimo’s funny and sharp writing. Lost on Me was originally published in Italy as Niente di Vero ( Nothing True ). It has been translated into English by Leah Janeczko and garnered much praise before it was longlisted for the International Booker Prize 2024. Vero is born in Rome to a mother who has an excessive need to be in constant communication with her children, and a father who is a hypochondriac and germophobe who sanitises everything, even his children, with rubbing alcohol. Vero and her brother grow up to be writers and they often finish each other’s works. Translator Leah Janeczko | Photo Credit: thebookerprizes.com Raimo expertly portrays the inter-generational ties between women in an Italian family. Vero is a disappointment to her mother who wants her to have many babies and be 20 kg heavier. Vero is not her favourite child, she much prefers her son. Later in life, Vero blocks her mother on social media to prevent her from finding out that she has been single for two years. Her grandmother wishes that Vero had larger breasts and that she would eat more. Lost on Me is about mothers and daughters — the little delights and tensions in their relationship. It is about the sometimes strange intimacy daughters share with their mothers. The book also explores the societal expectations that women have to live up to — the size of their bodies, their weight, marital status, and so on. Through Vero, the writer shows how women of a certain age are expected to want children. Vero does not want children, she has no maternal instincts but gets choked up over videos of baby foxes and cubs. Raimo’s voice is original, her writing is sharp and funny. The narrator compares writer’s block to Vero’s internal block, her constipation which does not receive the same heroic reception as her personal despair of constipation. In another instance, Vero’s father calls her ‘ oca ’ which means goose or bimbo, he also lovingly calls her a cow. “Even as he (father) lay dying, to him I was always Oca. For this reason, whenever I hear a woman called a cow, a vixen, a cougar, a bitch, I am filled with an absurd feeling of tenderness, and the memory of my father prevails over my indignation.” The book also deals with women’s rights over their bodies. When the protagonist decides to get an abortion, she learns about “angel gardens” where Catholic churches bury foetuses, without the knowledge or consent of the women concerned. The gravestones bear the name of the women along with the dates of abortion. Lost on Me can make readers laugh out loud at the most ill-timed and unfortunate jokes, but it also makes them pause, to process love and grief. “I don’t remember exactly when it was that I stopped thinking about my father every day after his death. Sooner or later, it happened, like it does after a relationship ends. You think it’s not possible, but it is.” After her father’s death, suddenly one day, Vero stops feeling like a daughter. She has never forgotten his phone number and her brain mentally dials it. This reminded me of when I was a little girl and was made to memorise my father’s phone number in case I needed it in an emergency. Till date, I cannot remember my home phone number, but my father’s phone number is etched in my memory. A well-written book reflects your life back at you, and Raimo’s Lost on Me is filled with moments that do just that. The independent reviewer and editor is based in New Delhi.

File | Photo Credit: AP Softening his stance on immigration, former U.S. president Donald Trump has promised to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges to prevent them from returning to their home countries like India and China where they become multibillionaires. Mr. Trump's departure from the anti-immigrant rhetoric comes ahead of the November presidential election in which immigration and deportation of illegal immigrants are among the key issues for voters.

A Green Card, known officially as a permanent resident card, is an identity document showing a person has permanent residency in the United States.

Mr. Trump's remarks came as he was pressed by Calacanis to “promise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest around the world to America.” Mr. Trump, the presumptive candidate from the Republican Party, also lamented “stories where people graduated from a top college or from a college, and they desperately wanted to stay here, they had a plan for a company, a concept, and they can’t — they go back to India, they go back to China, they do the same basic company in those places. \"...and they become multi-billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people, and it could have been done here,\" he said. \"Let me just tell you that it's so sad when we lose people from Harvard, MIT, from the greatest schools. and lesser schools that are phenomenal schools also. And what I wanted to do, and I would have done this, but then we had to solve the COVID problem because that came in and, you know, sort of dominated for a little while, as you perhaps know,” Mr. Trump said in response. Mr. Trump reiterated his first-term policy, about foreign students getting a Green Card after receiving a degree from a higher education institution in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) field. “Anybody graduates from a college, you go in there for two years or four years, If you graduate or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in this country,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We force the brilliant people, the people that graduate from college, the people that are number one in their class from the best colleges, you have to be able to recruit these people and keep the people,” he asserted. Somebody graduates at the top of the class; they can't even make a deal with the company because they don't think they're going to be able to stay in the country. \"That is going to end on day one,” Mr. Trump announced. According to the latest annual Open Doors report of the Institute of International Education more than a million international students from more than 210 places of origin are studying at U.S. higher education institutions during the 2022-23 academic year. China remained the top-sending country in 2022/23, with 289,526 students studying in the U.S. But students from China saw a slight decline of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous year. India, the second largest sending country, reached an all-time high of 268,923 international students in 2022/23, an increase of 35 per cent as against the previous year. Overall 53 per cent of all international students in 2022/23 were from China and India, comparable to the prior year. However, the market share for each place of origin has shifted, with 27% of students from China and 25%t of students from India, in comparison to 33% from China and 18% from India in 2017-18. Mr. Trump’s latest comments stood in contrast to the immigration policy he adopted while in office and were a direct overture to wealthy business leaders whom he is courting as donors and supporters of his campaign, The New York Times said. Mr. Trump had at times sought to reform the nation’s immigration system to scale back family-based immigration and to prioritise wealthy immigrants, who had valuable work skills or who were highly educated. But during his term as president, Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda included restrictions on green cards, visa programmes, refugee resettlement and other forms of legal immigration, significantly reducing the number of lawful permanent residents entering the country. He began his presidency by signing an executive order that banned travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries and later embraced a proposal to cut legal immigration by half. Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump assailed the H-1B visa programme, favoured by tech companies as a way to hire foreign skilled workers, as a “theft of American prosperity.” The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. Mr. Trump expanded restrictions on legal immigration during the pandemic and his last year in office and had proposed suspending all immigration to the United States and deporting foreign students if they did not attend at least some classes in person. A month before the 2020 election, Mr. Trump again moved to restrict the H-1B visa programme.

It was not about buying a copy but shoplifting one! I took it as a challenge. Stealing did not seem bad; those were the days of Dhoom 2 !” says the assistant director in the Malayalam film industry, referring to heist film Dhoom 2 , a part of the Dhoom film franchise, directed by the late Sanjay Gadhvi. He got away with it in true filmy style too, when a bus headed towards his home came at the exact time he was stepping out of the shop, New College Bookstall, with the stolen copy. Cut to the present: Now, 17 years later, his first book in Malayalam, 90s Kid , is retailing at New College Bookstall. Reese confesses it feels like a full-circle moment. When he visited the shop recently, the person at the store remembered the incident after some prodding. “Honestly, even after all those years, I did not dare to go back. I did not know how they would react.” But all went well, and the owners were sporting about it. He was even asked to sign copies of the book. While there, Reese offered to pay for the Harry Potter book, but the owners refused to take the money. “Over the years, once I started earning, I wanted to pay for it, but I could not bring myself to because I was afraid to. This time, accompanied by a friend, I felt bold enough because my book on sale there.” Reese reminisces, “It seemed like a good idea back then. It cost way more than what my family could afford. This was one way to get it,” he says, laughing. Ironically, his familiarity with the Harry Potter universe was via the films “especially Emma Watson. I had not read any of the books. But the buzz around the book was so much that I just went with the flow.” Getting the book made him a hero of sorts in school. Besides the Dhoom films, inspiration also came from books such as Thaskaran Maniyanpillayude Atmakadha (the autobiography of Maniyan Pillai, a notorious thief). Reese’s book, in Malayalam, is a compilation of his writings he has posted on Facebook. Over the years, he has shared his experiences on his FB page, some of which were based on his travels. Be it a pilgrimage of sorts to the places where his favourite authors lived— like Vaikom Mohammed Basheer’s home or writer of detective fiction Kottayam Pushpanath’s home — or travelling to Mumbai to watch Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge at the iconic Maratha Mandir; visiting Kanchanamala (the inspiration behind the Malayalam film Ennu Ninte Moideen ) are among the episodes that feature in the book. The Harry Potter episode also features in it. A comment to the post, in 2020, about stealing the book was prescient. “It was by Basilettan’s (actor/director Basil Joseph) sister, Shincy chechi who said it would be actual ‘heroism’ when you sell a book written by you at that bookstall. That random comment… it was prophetic!” Another FB friend donated money so that he could buy books for kids who like reading but could not afford one. Reese at New College Bookstall | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement The book came about by serendipity. A couple of years ago, a publisher approached him, to bring out a compilation of his writings on Facebook. When that fizzled out, he approached Kozhikode-based publishing house Mankind Literature. “I did not want to pay and self-publish. I wanted it to be published for its content and worth. I am happy to report that the book is into its second reprint.” Reese , an assistant director, movie buff and avid reader, translated a book written in German, Bilder Deiner Großen Liebe (Pictures of Your True Love), by the late German author Wolfgang Herrndorf into English so that he could read it. The unfinished book was a sequel to Why We Took The Car (German: Tschick ), which was made into a film. Reese had watched that film and was curious about what happened to the characters. With the author dead, there was barely a chance of it being translated, so Reese tracked down a copy in Germany, got it sent to him and translated it in 2020, using translation apps. Why is his book called a 90s Kid ? He answers, “Because the 90s were amazing; it was a time before technology took over the world. I have wonderful memories of my childhood and of those times!” He often refers to himself as a ‘proud 90s kid’. Of returning to the scene of crime, Reese adds, “It was not so much remorse or regret. It was, as I said, a full-circle moment! Signed copies of my book there!” Has he regretted stealing the book? “No, because I wanted it so badly, I liked it so much which is why I still have it with me. I did not take it to sell it or for thrill’s sake. I wanted it for keeps!” 90s Kid, priced ₹269 is available on the Mankind Literature website booklove.co.in The Hindu MetroPlus / books-children / Kerala / books and literature BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

File | Photo Credit: The Hindu India’s first indigenously developed coronavirus vaccine, Covaxin, was a joint collaboration between the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) with intellectual property (IP) rights jointly shared between the two organisations. That is what the public record states. However, filings by the BBIL at patent offices in India, the United States and Europe suggest that only its scientists and personnel are credited as ‘inventors’ of the vaccine with no mention of ICMR scientists. The Hindu has viewed documents detailing these patent applications. If BBIL personnel, credited in applications as Deepak Kumar and Krishna Murthy Ella — Chairman and Founder, BBIL— are indeed the only inventors, it contradicts a statement by the Union Health Ministry, the nodal Ministry of the ICMR, in the Rajya Sabha, which claimed that the IP rights are “jointly owned” . ICMR got ₹171.74 crore in royalty from Covaxin sale, Rajya Sabha told WHO pauses Covaxin supply via UN bodies In response to a question in the Rajya Sabha on July 2021 by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, who demanded details of the agreement between the ICMR and the BBIL for the development of Covaxin, the then Minister of State (Health Ministry) Bharati Pravin Pawar laid out a detailed response. The Minister’s statement said the ICMR would provide a “well characterised” virus strain for vaccine development, the BBIL would develop the final vaccine formulation and, be given a “non-exclusive” licence granted to commercialise the product within two years. It was explicitly mentioned that the “..intellectual property over the product would be jointly owned by the ICMR and the BBIL.” The ICMR would also receive as royalty 5% of net sales to be remitted half-yearly. BHU’s Covaxin safety study riddled with major limitations Why COVID vaccine safety needs scrutiny | Explained ICMR distances itself from BHU’s Covaxin study The ICMR said that while it had not funded the BBIL for Covaxin development, one of its institutes — the ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune — had spent “funds for Covaxin development“. It also funded phase-3 clinical trials of Covaxin at 25 locations, involving 25,800 participants. All in all, the ICMR spent ₹35 crore for developing Covaxin. As of January 2022 — as per an update by the government to the Rajya Sabha — the ICMR received ₹171 crore as royalty for Covaxin. Ms. Pawar’s response to Parliament, however, did not elaborate on the sharing of patent rights. The BBIL, which has over the years had several research collaborations with public research bodies such as the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the ICMR itself, has listed scientists from all institutions as ‘inventors’ in patent applications. A BBIL spokesperson told The Hindu that the patent filed by Bharat Biotech was only for “process development” and specific to the making of the vaccine. It also covered the use of an adjuvant (an ingredient used in vaccines to elicit a stronger response) that was licensed from the Kansas-based ViroVax and added to Covaxin. India’s patent laws allow both product and process patents. Product patents grant an inventor a monopoly over, say, a drug. Process patents bar competitors from making a similar drug using the same sequence of steps. “Bharat Biotech is innovator of the process developed after procuring strain from the NIV through an agreed consideration between both the parties. Moreover, the NIV was also responsible for testing for other variants. It is to be noted that while ICMR/NIV owns the animal challenge (clinical trials on animals) studies, Bharat Biotech owns the process development and new adjuvant added to the vaccine.” In the case of the CSIR, product development involved funding from both the CSIR and the BBIL and hence merited co-inventorship during patent applications, the spokesperson’s email suggested. The BBIL did not clarify on who owned the rights to the human clinical trial data — information that is usually not disclosed by pharmaceutical companies. The ICMR’s close involvement in all aspects of Covaxin development is well known, particularly — as former chief Dr. Balram Bhargava has described in his book, G oing Viral: The Making of Covaxin , how ICMR scientists isolated the Sars-Cov2 strain from Italian tourists in March 2020, gave it to Bharat Biotech which developed a batch of vaccine candidates by April 30 that were then used to conduct pre-clinical animal studies on rats, hamsters, monkeys and following encouraging results, trials on humans. All of the resulting publications that describe the results of these trials — some published in leading journals such as The Lancet — list both ICMR scientists as well as scientists from the BBIL as co-authors in the study. An independent expert said collaborating entities usually clearly spell out how IPR and patenting rights from a resulting invention would be shared in a memorandum of understanding (MoU). “There could be multiple kinds of agreements and only a perusal of the MoU can clarify on such matters,” an IPR lawyer, who declined to be identified as he consulted both of these organisations, told The Hindu . The ICMR has previously declined Right to Information requests by activists and media on the terms of this MoU citing “third party confidentiality”. “This raises some important questions. If intellectual property is jointly owned, then patent applications require that all the inventors be mentioned. In the United States, for instance, not mentioning all inventors can be strong grounds for the rejection of patents,” Dr. Zakir Thomas, who was previously been involved in intellectual property development at the CSIR, told The Hindu. “While intellectual property is a broad term, only one of which is patents, the ICMR should clarify the statement made to Parliament on what it means by co-ownership and whether it collaborated in the development.” The Hindu emailed to Dr. Rajiv Bahl, Director-General, ICMR, but has received no response till going to press. Dr. Bhargava, who has now retired from the ICMR and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, declined comment. vaccines / Coronavirus / government organisations (health) / patent, copyright and trademark BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Swiatek survived a major scare in the previous round when she saved a match point against Naomi Osaka before sealing a hard-fought victory, but against Bouzkova she picked apart the Czech player's serve with some precision hitting. The defending champion showed no signs of a hangover from the three-setter with Osaka and consolidated an early break to go 3-1 up in the opening set but Bouzkova fought back from 5-2 down to give the Pole a workout. However, Swiatek switched gears and carefully constructed her points, using the angles well to make Bouzkova run from one corner of Court Philippe-Chatrier to the other, firing 18 winners in total in the opening set. The top seed continued to dominate in the second set as she effortlessly turned defence into offence on Bouzkova's serve, breaking twice to race into a 4-0 lead before the Czech managed to get on the board. Bouzkova saved a match point on her serve but she only delayed the inevitable as Swiatek sealed progress with a searing winner down the line. tennis BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 20, 2024 07:01 pm IST The Social Sciences involves the scientific study of human behaviour, social groups and communities and the relationships among various stakeholders. | Photo Credit: iStockphoto/Getty Images A s the IPL season wrapped up and the T20 World Cup is in progress, there is no doubt that cricket fever is here to stay. Beyond cricketing questions such as the secret of KKR’s success or who will win the trophy at the Kensington Oval in Barbados on June 29, these tournaments raise broader social and economic questions. What is the ripple effect of a country’s victory on local businesses and employment? How do sponsorship deals and media rights shape consumers’ consumption patterns? Do such events bring people together or do they drive them apart? While these are often informally discussed and debated, there is a systematic science that can be applied to answer many of these questions in virtually every other sector of our economy. But to understand how, we must first travel to 1850s London. In 1854, London was facing a grave problem: a deadly cholera outbreak was ravaging the city. The prevailing theory of that time blamed “miasmas” or foul air for the disease’s spread. However, it was unknown how exactly the disease spread and what could be done about it. Enter John Snow, a physician who challenged this notion and ultimately cracked the mystery. Snow meticulously collected data on the locations of cholera cases and mapped them. His analysis revealed a cluster of cholera outbreaks around a public water pump on Broad Street. Through his systematic observation approach, data analysis, and evidence-based reasoning, Snow identified contaminated water as the outbreak’s source and helped contain the disease. He understood that human health was intricately linked with human behaviour. He relied not on the Physical Sciences like Biology or Chemistry, but on the Social Sciences and showed how, by rigorously investigating social phenomena, one can discover practical solutions that improve lives. What are the “Social” Sciences? In essence, it involves the scientific study of human behaviour, social groups and communities and the relationships among various stakeholders (the government, individuals, businesses, and so on). The classical Social Sciences encompass Economics, Psychology, Political Science, Anthropology, and Sociology. Newer additions include fields such as Communication and Media Studies, Criminology, Gender Studies, and so on. Social Science is predicated on the notion that, by bringing data and theory about various social phenomena to bear, one can begin to see systematic patterns in human behaviour and relationships between various stakeholders in societies. Advancing the Social Sciences is vital because pursuing such knowledge enriches our understanding of human nature and society. Additionally, the insights gained are practical, enhancing daily decision-making and informing effective policies and regulations. Conventionally (from India’s independence to the early 2010s), fields such as Engineering and Medicine have been considered the main career paths in India. These STEM fields have provided the country with phenomenal human capital and development, making it the hub of outsourcing some of the best talent in the world. STEM fields develop academic rigour and ethic of evidence-based research and equip students to solve technical problems with limited resources. By rewarding precision and problem-solving, they build a strong foundation for expertise in a field. However, the gains offered by focusing on STEM fields have come at the cost of de-prioritising other related fields, particularly the Social Sciences. As our country rapidly develops, we are now facing the challenges due to this de-prioritisation. For example, in water resource management, most municipal departments in India are staffed with hydraulic engineers. While this skill is a necessity, water resource management involves catering to a wide range of priorities: maintenance of adequate water pressure, sustainable extraction of water resources, leakage and pilferage detection, sewerage design and mapping for universal access, efficient and equitable pricing, and the development of water markets. The cholera epidemic in London reminds us that solving these problems requires expertise not just in hydraulics but also in economics, demography, law and governance. Moreover, every technical field increasingly has philosophical questions to answer. For example, how do we address the challenge of bias while using algorithms for policing? How do we anonymise wearable data to understand public health? We need technical expertise to be integrated into society and out of their silos to address challenges that cut across educational disciplinary barriers. While there is no silver bullet, the Social Sciences provide useful moral, theoretical and empirical frameworks to address these challenges. Over the last decade, an increasing number of young Indians have chosen Arts over the usual Science and Commerce fields. The All India Survey on Higher Education (2021-22), conducted by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, found that the most popular stream of choice for postgraduate studies was the Social Sciences (21.1%) followed by Science (14.7%). While this is encouraging, unfortunately, this talent is not furthering its expertise in this area and contributing to the development of sorely needed new social scientific knowledge. The share of Ph.D. graduates in the Social Sciences has been reducing considerably over the last few years (from over 15% in 2013 to 7% in 2021). Expanding Social Science training and increasing the number of Ph.D.s in this field is essential for India’s progress. We have ample demonstrations of this. For instance, Karthik Muralidharan’s impactful research on the efficacy of using biometric smartcards for delivering payments in Andhra Pradesh significantly reduced leakage and delays, directly improving the livelihoods of millions. This demonstrates the profound influence well-trained social scientists can have on addressing crucial national issues. However, India faces numerous pressing challenges that lack solutions, and we simply do not have enough people with the right training to tackle these issues. Further, importing answers from the West is not viable due to our unique context. For example, India’s informal economy operates differently from Western models, necessitating tailored approaches. India’s current social system has many innovations that rival the West, such as biometric identification and digital payments. The impact and governance of these social phenomena must be undertaken locally. While we have been able to rely on Western advances in the Natural Sciences such as Engineering, Computer Science, and Medicine, in the realm of Social Science, the lack of a deep and robust social scientifically trained bench and a body of knowledge seriously hinders our ability to tackle systemic issues that are slowing India’s progress. On the bright side, thanks to rapid technological advancements, we live in an era of data abundance and rapid digitisation. This presents a perfect opportunity to study various societal aspects comprehensively. Data and technology must reshape education and skill-development initiatives. Imagine using satellite data to monitor agricultural productivity in real-time or employing big data analytics to predict and prevent public health crises. Imagine studying the derivative impacts of migration and environmental erosion in cities or algorithmic decision-making for rations and welfare schemes. In light of these opportunities, there is a growing demand for interdisciplinary programmes that combine data analytics and domain-specific knowledge to address multi-sectoral problems that, if solved in silos, will do more harm than good. Social Science research has enthusiastically embraced these developments, evident from the spike in programmes in Urban Studies, Data Policy, Data Science in Public Policy, and newer social research methods such as social network analysis. To fully harness this potential, we need more individuals trained and skilled in the Social Sciences. Undergraduate programmes must develop and hire skilled faculty in these areas to emphasise to students the importance of these topics. We need more graduate and Ph.D. programmes in Social Science fields from Economics, Political Science, to Psychology. Such expertise will yield specific knowledge and create a pool of professionals ready to serve in government and senior corporate roles, applying their insights to critical issues. By focusing on nuanced, impactful research rooted in our societal context we will have effective answers to a wide range of socially and economically important questions that India faces. And yes, that includes an estimate of the economic and social implications of a potential Indian victory on an island far away in the West Indies on June 29.

Photo: X/@ACTFibernet Home internet provider ACT Fibernet announced on June 12 that it was expanding service to more towns and neighbouring districts of existing markets. In Andhra Pradesh, the Class-A internet service provider (ISP) said it has launched services in Machilipatnam (expanding from existing market Guntur), Bhimavaram and Tadepalligudem (near Eluru and Rajamahendravaram). The ISP also expanded to Ghaziabad, its first market in the National Capital Region outside of Delhi. In Tamil Nadu, ACT expanded to Kanchipuram, adding to markets like Chennai, Coimbatore and Madurai. This brings the company’s overall presence to 30 cities and towns. While 5G coverage has expanded across nearly all districts, following an aggressive push by Bharti Airtel Ltd. and Reliance Jio, home broadband providers continue to expand only gradually. Data by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) show that as of March, there were 4 crore wired internet subscribers in India, compared to 88.3 crore mobile internet users. However, at 1.5% month-on-month growth, wireline subscriptions are outpacing a saturated wireless market. ACT has 2.2 million users, and is the largest residential ISP that is not owned by a big-3 telecom provider or the government. Rajesh Chharia, the president of the ISP Association of India, told The Hindu that private home broadband providers are cautious about capital expenditure (such as laying cables) in new markets, leading small as well as large ISPs to focus on population centres with high density. This allows them to earn more revenue from less physical infrastructure, Mr. Chharia said. internet / company information BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

CII President Sanjiv Puri said several policy interventions in the past put the economy on \"a much stronger wicket\". \"The growth rate is poised to touch 8% during the current year, marking the fourth consecutive year of above 7% growth. \"The growth estimate hinges critically on addressing unfinished reform agenda on priority, in addition to improvement in world trade prospects aiding our exports, twin engines of investment and consumption doing well and expectations of a normal monsoon among other factors,\" Mr. Puri added. Also Read | Who’s who in the new Council of Ministers Expressing optimism regarding the economy's performance, he said, \"Very clearly, we are expecting all three sectors of the economy - agriculture, services and industry - to fire and do well next year.\" Mr. Puri added that CII expects inflation to be between 4-4.5% in FY25. Addressing his first press conference after becoming CII President, Mr. Puri, Chairman & MD, ITC Ltd, said private sector investment, which has been an area of concern, was robust and broad-based across sectors. \"Private sector investment has been an area of concern sometime back, but the good news today is that it is in the right trajectory... it is robust. It had dropped to 20.7% of GDP and it is now at 23.8%, which is more than the pre-Covid levels,\" Mr. Puri said. About the outlook for rural consumption, Puri said, \"We certainly see green shoots of pick up in rural (demand)... the expectation for a good monsoon and better crop yields leading to improved realisations that augurs well for the rural economy.\" The industry body has also suggested rationalisation of rates with three slabs and inclusion of sectors like petroleum and real estate that are presently out of its ambit, besides infrastructure status for the hospitality sector. \"As far as GST is concerned, what we are saying there can be three slabs and there are areas like petroleum real estate that are outside the ambit... be included in the GST,\" Mr. Puri said. On reforms related to land, he said CII suggests a moderation in stamp duty to lower the cost of acquisition for economic activity and improvement in efficiency with measures like setting up of a state-level land authority and digitisation of the procedures. Mr. Puri outlined a 14-point agenda for the new government for driving the next phase of economic transformation. Many of the next generation reforms lie in the state and concurrent domains and require tough consensus building to take them forward, he said, adding that the inter-state institutional platforms on the lines of GST councils can be created. Employment-linked incentive (ELI) schemes with appropriate outcome indicators can be launched for labour-intensive sectors with high growth potential such as toys, textiles and apparels, woods-based industries, tourism, logistics, among others. The ELI scheme can also address the low female participation rate by giving a higher incentive for hiring of female labour. Besides, an international mobility authority should be set up to track employment opportunities in other countries and facilitate Indian youth to benefit from these opportunities, Mr. Puri said. \"Priority should be given to further easing the regulatory and compliance burden through simplification, rationalisation and decriminalisation of regulatory approvals and compliances, time-bound clearances using the National Single Window System, strengthening alternate dispute redressal system and adoption self-declaration/third party certification and deemed approvals, wherever feasible,\" it stated. It also recommended interventions in the areas of land, power and logistics to reduce the cost of doing business. CII also pitched for tax reforms to continue to help boost the investment climate. On direct taxes, the government may consider laying down a roadmap for rationalising and simplifying the capital gains tax and the TDS provisions, the CII chairman added. economy (general) / business (general) BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

File picture | Photo Credit: V.V. Krishnan Media bodies — such as print, radio and broadcast players — and their ad agencies, have urged the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to defer the implementation deadline for a “self-certification” for all advertising. The requirement was put in place by the I&B Ministry in response to a Supreme Court order on May 7 in the Indian Medical Association’s case against Patanjali, where the court found that the ayurvedic conglomerate was endangering people’s health by printing misleading claims on evidence-based medicine and its own products. In representations to the Ministry reviewed by The Hindu , three industry bodies pushed back on the rapid implementation of the Supreme Court’s order. The order requires advertisers to reaffirm their ads’ compliance with the Cable Television Network Rules, 1994. The rules are currently on track to kick in on June 20. An industry body representing print media asked the Ministry to keep the requirements in “abeyance” until ambiguities in terms of the scope of advertisements, applicability for digital ads, advertorials, government ads, and other issues are sorted out. The body also requested that the requirements be limited to medical advertising. A body representing TV broadcasters and some of their streaming services said that the SC only imposed requirements on advertising firms, and not channels, whereas the MIB has sent advisories to channels and other media requiring them to “verify the authenticity” of self-certification furnished by advertisers. “[We] urge that the compliance period be extended by 45 days since the transition would involve practical challenges and would require cooperation by various stakeholders,” the letter said. A grouping of ad agencies, for its part, said that firms they service “may lose revenue due to the inability to launch campaigns on time,” and that the Broadcast Seva portal set up for permissions and clearances may have technical glitches that could hobble ads from being released on time. The scope has also been confounding some media houses — for instance, one source at a broadcast channel wondered, would a channel and its show be considered a product or a service meriting a self-certification? Would viewership claims — based on constantly fluctuating data released by the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), be considered claims? While the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has lined up meetings on a variety of subjects, there is no clarity on when advertisers and ad agencies will have an opportunity to discuss their reservations with the requirements. While associations had chalked out a plan to approach the Supreme Court to clarify these issues, The Hindu has learnt, they have chosen to wait longer to decide whether or not to file intervention applications before a vacation bench. newspapers / advertising / news media BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

File Photo | Photo Credit: REUTERS Vodafone Group is looking to sell its entire $2.3 billion stake in Indus Towers through stock market block deals next week, two sources with direct knowledge said, as part of the British firm's effort to repay debt. Vodafone owns 21.5% of mobile-tower operator Indus via various group entities. As of Friday's closing stock price in Mumbai, the investment is worth $2.3 billion. The final size of the stake sale is yet to be decided and could be lower than 21.5% if demand, which is still being assessed, is insufficient, said the sources, who declined to be named as the discussions were private. Shares of Vodafone Idea extended gains, rising as much as 4.8% after the Reuters report, while Indus Towers pared gains and closed up 0.3%. Vodafone India and its British parent did not respond to requests for comment. Indus Towers declined to comment. Vodafone has hired Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas to manage the stake sale in stock markets, the sources said. Bank of America declined to comment while the others did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Vodafone in 2022 announced it would sell all of its then-28% stake, but has managed to sell only a small portion so far. The sources said the talks with rival telecom firms for a stake sale had not materialised. Vodafone plans to repay part of its $42.17 billion net debt using proceeds from the Indus stake sale, the sources said. Indus, which says it is one of the world's biggest tower companies, also counts second biggest telecom firm, Bharti Airtel, as a shareholder. It has nearly 220,000 towers, with services also including providing power, space and green technology for tower equipment. Private equity giant KKR and Canadian fund CPPIB were also investors in Indus, but sold their entire stakes in February. Block deals, where investors sell shares in stock markets, have become increasingly popular as the market has surged to record highs. In March, British American Tobacco sold its entire $2 billion stake in tobacco firm ITC. For the March 2024 quarter, Indus' net profit rose 20% to $221 million, while its revenue stayed flat at $860 million, according to regulatory filings.

It held that adherence would ensure easy identification of the calling entity (for customers) and prevent duping attempts from fraudsters. The regulator had met representatives from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), among others, to contemplate about the “effective utilisation of this series”. On May 30, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had allocated the 160 numbering series (160xxxxxx) for solely making service and transactional calls. More important than the identification aspect of it, the idea was to keep away from the use of the 140 numbering series (140xxxxxx) that was allocated to telemarketers for making promotional, service and transactional voice calls. The DoT had observed that since the 140-series was being used ‘extensively’ for promotional calling. Thus, customers would not take such calls even if they were intended for other important purposes. Furthermore, an alternate usage of 10-digit numbers by genuine entities was duplicated by fraudsters with an intent for deception. TRAI also discussed about the 140 series being migrated to the distributed ledger technology platform (the technology that facilitates means for verifying consent in telecommunications) and scrubbing of digital consent being operationalised. It expects the two measures combined would enable “substantial control on spam calls” from 10-digit numbers. Lastly, TRAI and the participants also agreed to whitelist URLs/APKs in the latters’ content templates, use of minimum numbers of headers and content templates and taking immediate action should the senders’ credentials be misused. telecommunication service / Reserve Bank of India BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Photo: Special Arrangement Abu Dhabi’s Zayed International Airport with an expanded capacity and a new terminal building will be a good “solution” for passengers at a time when footfalls at Dubai airport are expected to breach its capacity, according to its CEO Elena Sorlini. “Dubai airport has hit its capacity, they will grow a bit more but they will need expansion at Dubai World Centre. But we are here now to cater to the extra demand. I think we are going to provide good solutions until they are going to be ready,” Ms. Sorlini told The Hindu during an online interaction. India is the largest market for Abu Dhabi, enjoying 21% of the market share with 4.78 million passengers annually. In the month of May, 28% of the total flight movements (arrivals and departures) were to and from India. Zayed International Airport — one of five airports in Abu Dhabi, recorded 22.5 million passengers last year and expects this to grow to 27 million passengers by the end of 2024. It has a total capacity of 45 million passengers, which can be expanded to 65 million passengers. “India is the fastest growing market, and therefore the interest that it stays relevant for all of UAE,” Ms. Sorlini said. Passengers can experience a beautiful building which is a piece of art and a high level of service, Ms. Sorlini said about the new terminal that began operations in November 2023. Spread over 7,42,000 sq metre, the terminal can process up to 11,000 passengers per hour and operate 79 aircraft at any given time. It also has 160 retail, food and beverage outlets. “The level of attention to the customer we offer is peculiar. Passengers are at the centre of our focus, whether it is retail, food and beverages and biometric experience for faster and safer passenger processing. There are also a lot of people on the ground to provide passenger assistance. The airport is also intuitive such as enabling passengers to locate their boarding gates. There is no need to take a train and change terminals, as it is all under one roof. For departing passengers too there is one access point,” Ms. Sorlini said explaining the airport’s benefits. air transport BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

A woman in Noida has claimed she has found a centipede inside an ice cream tub she ordered through an instant delivery app, said food safety officials, who have launched a probe into the matter. In a post on X on June 15, the woman, who identified herself as Deepa Devi, shared a picture showing the insect inside the ice cream tub. Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which markets dairy products under Amul brand, regretted the inconvenience caused to the woman customer in Noida. Noida's food safety department has launched a probe into this matter. In a statement, Amul said it immediately responded to the complaint on social media. \"We deeply regret the inconvenience caused to her because of this incident,\" the statement said. Amul said its team was trying to contact the customer continuously and was allowed to meet after 9:30 p.m. on the same day (June 15). \"During our meeting with the customer, we had requested the customer to provide the said ice cream tub for investigation, unfortunately, the customer refused to hand over the same. \"Unless the complaint pack is retrieved from the customer it would be difficult for us to investigate the matter and hence comment specifically on the issue which involves pack and supply chain integrity as well,\" Amul said. During the interaction, the customer was informed and assured about Amul's state-of-the-art ISO-certified plants which are automated and pass through numerous stringent quality checks before offering any product for sale to the esteemed customers. Amul also invited the customer to visit its plant to assure her about the quality processes being followed. Amul assured customers about the superior quality of Amul Ice Cream. Amul highlighted that it is among India's most trusted brands, owned by 36 lakh farmers. It markets 22 billion packs of Amul products annually across 50+ countries with the highest quality and food safety standards from 100+ dairies across India. \"We would like to assure you that we take the utmost care to ensure our products are safe, healthy and nutritious to serve our customers daily,\" Amul said. The cooperative organisation requested the customer to return the ice cream tub for a thorough investigation. \"Once we receive the complaint pack from the customer, we shall investigate the matter from all angles and again get back to our customers with the findings,\" Amul said.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 17, 2024 02:38 pm IST Image for representational purposes only. | Photo Credit: iStockphoto The story so far: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) on June 12 introduced provisions that would guarantee a better exit payout for life insurance policy holders unwilling or unable to continue paying for their insurance. Providing higher ‘surrender value,’ or the exit payout, was also discussed in a consultation paper floated in December last year. At present, policyholders receive less or no payout if they discontinue paying premiums. The regulator has sought that, while determining the surrender value, insurers must also establish “reasonableness and value for money” for both exiting and continuing policyholders. In insurance, surrender value is the amount that a policyholder is liable to receive when s/he decides to terminate their policy before the maturity date. Insurers deduct a certain amount as ‘surrender charges’ based on the terms set out in the plan. Important to note, notwithstanding whether or not a policy is discontinued, the policyholder is still liable to receive the earnings, savings and other associated benefits accrued from the tenure of his association with the policy. However, the surrender charge levied by the insurer takes away a portion of the payout. These charges constitute a portion of the cash value, or the premiums paid. They are primarily used as potentially disincentivising tools to discourage policyholders from premature exits, as well as compensate (insurers) for the administrative expenses and potential losses because of no further premiums. Surrender value is of two kinds, that is, guaranteed surrender value (GSV) and special surrender value (SSV). As the name suggests, GSV is the minimum amount that the insurer would have to pay to the discontinuing policy holder. Its computation excludes bonuses that the holder would be eligible for at maturity. SSV, on the other hand, is the essential metric that takes into account the paid-up capital, eligible bonuses and other material benefits at the time of surrender to the terms set out in the policy document. Essential to note, if the holder stops paying premiums after a certain period, the policy continues to exist albeit with a lower sum assured. This is referred to as paid-up value. SSV is computed as the sum of the accrued bonuses and paid-up value multiplied by the surrender value factor. Let’s say a policyholder pays a premium of Rs 20,000 each year for a 25-year policy which assures a sum of Rs 5 lakh. It so happens that the holder stops paying premium after 5 years because of financial constraints. Currently, s/he has accumulated bonuses totalling Rs 75,000. Now, at the 5 th year, the surrender value factor is 30%. Thus, the special surrender value would be calculated as (30/100) *(5,00,000*5/25 + 75,000). Thus, the SSV comes to Rs 52,500. For clarity about the computation, the product of the sum assured (Rs 5 lakhs) and the premiums paid to the total (5/25) is the paid-up capital. The most important of the provisions is that insurers will now be liable to pay the special surrender value if the exit takes place after completing one year. No exit payouts were given until now in the first year. This provision can be utilised if the policyholder has already paid the premium for the first year. The same applies for policies with a payment tenure of less than 5 years and single premium policies. Additionally, IRDAI has specified that SSV must be at least equal to the expected present value of future benefits (accruing from the paid-up capital), paid-up sum assured on all contingencies and accrued or vested benefits provided in the policy (such as survival benefits). IRDAI has also mandated that insurers institute mechanisms to improve consistency across all durations of policy. The idea is to enhance long term benefits to policyholders and for insurers to improve persistency (percentage of business retained without lapsing or being surrendered). More importantly however, insurers have also been instructed to establish measures averting incidences of mis-selling as well as misleading sales – leading to surrender or lapses, which further paves the way for grievances and financial loss to the customer. It endeavours to tackle customers opting for unsuitable policies, in turn, potentially paying higher surrender charges to exit them. IRDAI’s Annual Report for the fiscal year 2022-23 (published in December 2023), had observed a 1.5% increase in unfair business practice grievances from customers on a year-over-year basis at 26,107. The major chunk of it belonged to private players at 23,129 – 4.15% increase over the previous year. Unfair business practices accounted for more than half of the grievances accruing from the private sector insurers. On the other hand, public sectors insurers recorded an approximately 14% fall in unfair business practice grievances at 2,978. To further safeguard the ecosystem, the insurance regulator has said that insurers may offer higher guaranteed surrender values than those specified in the existing regulations. These may vary as per premium size, payment terms, policy terms and duration elapsed at the time of surrender, among other factors. With the stated moves, IRDAI is instituting both a safeguard and a mechanism to avert mis-selling. The revision in surrender value further safeguards the customer if lapses still occur. The insurance regulator, in its annual report, had asked insurers to identify the major causes of such events. It suggested measures such as ascertaining the suitability of the product, placing control on various channels (based on their vulnerability) and having a strategy to deal with mis-selling complaints. However, the business aspect of it might not be particularly enthusing. Policy exits in itself is not an enthusing development for investors. An increased exit payout is further bad news. A Jefferies note (from December 2023, when the consultation paper was floated), had observed, pointing to the proposed notion about ‘threshold’ surrender charges, that it may raise surrender value, thus, inversely trimming fees for insurers. The note held that should surrender charges be reduced, insurers could be expected to pass the burden down to the ecosystem, cut down on operational expenditure and tweak products. “Surrender charges for non-unit linked insurance plans (non-Ulips) are higher than that for Ulips, which allows them to incur higher distribution costs and aids profitability,” it noted. It further added that on the flip side, this would impact the ability of insurers to penetrate Tier I and II cities where they are required to invest in new branches, staff and agency build-up. The life insurance market has recorded a “consistent premium growth” over the years, as per the IRDAI annual report. In 2022-23, the industry recorded a premium income of Rs 7.83 lakh crore – approximately 13% growth YoY. The private sector’s premium grew 16.3% while that of public sector insurers grew 10.9%. insurance / insurance / The Hindu Explains / health / healthcare policy BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The first half of the flight was uneventful. For lunch (main course), I was served quite a few items on a tray. I decided to begin with the fig chaat, which I was having while watching the film Priscilla (on board entertainment). After a few spoons of the chaat, I felt something hard, something metallic, inside my mouth. I spat it out into the bowl. It was a blade,” said Mr. Paul. “Obviously, I complained to the stewardess who spoke for four-five seconds. The conversation went something like: Sorry about this and we will inform the catering team . She returned with a bowl of chickpea salad,” he added. The meal served to the passenger in Air India who complained of finding a blade-like piece of metal in the food while travelling from Bengaluru to San Francisco on board AI 175 on June 9, 2024. | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement Upon landing in San Francisco, Mr Paul posted on X (formerly Twitter) about the incident. There was no response from Air India (except from the Air India bot on X). Two or three days later, somebody from the customer service/social media team of the airline called to say that the matter will be looked into. “On June 15 (8.30 p.m,), I received a mail from Air India Care. It read: “We value our relationship and would request you to accept our goodwill offer of a one-way business class ticket across any Al flight, redeemable within one year of issuance. We look forward to your response and would request you to look at this incident in isolation, giving us the opportunity to serve you to a better experience the next time you travel with us.” Mr. Paul replied: “This is a bribe, and it doesn’t address the issue. I don’t accept such freebies, and I will not accept the ticket.” Air India confirmed the experience of Mr. Paul. Rajesh Dogra, Chief Customer Experience Officer, Air India, said, “Air India confirms that a foreign object was found in the meal of a guest aboard one of our flights. After investigation, it has been identified as coming from the vegetable processing machine used at the facilities of our catering partner. We have worked with our catering partner to strengthen measures to prevent any recurrence, including more frequent checking of the processor, especially after chopping of any hard vegetable.

The actions were taken following an investigation which commenced in November 2023. A month before, the industry-representative body Europacable had complained about dumping from India causing injury to the European industry. Optical fibre cables are a pivotal commodity for facilitating telecommunications and broadband coverage. Representing the industry union of optical fibre cable (manufacturers), Europacable in October 2023 observed that imports of single-mode optical fibre (SMOF) cables from India had increased both in absolute terms and market share. These lower-priced imports, the complainant said, had a negative impact on the quantities sold, the level of prices charged and on the market-share held by European manufacturers. Europacable said that the situation resulted in “substantial adverse effects on the overall performance and the financial situation” of the industry. The allegations were based on a comparison of the domestic prices with the export prices (ex-factory pricing) of the products when sold for export to the Union. The complainant said that the dumping margins calculated on this basis are “significant for the country concerned (India).” Thereafter, in November the same year, the Commission found “sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a proceeding.” The investigation scrutinised the allegations about dumping and injury between October 1, 2022, to September 30 the next year. Anti-dumping duties have been provisionally levied in the range of 8.7% of 11.4% on Indian cable manufacturers. Birla Cable, Universal Cable and Vindhya Telelinks will face an anti-dumping duty of 8.7%. Polycab India, ZTT India, Aberdare Technologies, Apar Industries, UM Cables and Aksh Optifibre would be encountering an anti-dumping duty of 9.9%. Sterlite Technologies and Sterlite Tech Cables Solutions face a duty of 11.4%. However, these are provisional measures, and companies have access to legal recourse. HFCL emerged as the only Indian manufacturer to have been exempted from the provisional anti-dumping duty, a fact further corroborated by its communications with stock exchanges. “HFCL’s products have been preferred by European telecom operators, as they meet the quality, reliability and safety standards, are commercially viable, and guarantee a sustainable supply for the construction of Europe’s telecom infrastructure,” its statement read. It also mentioned having “long-term engagements” with some of the region’s leading telecom operators and ISPs. No. The European Commission had earlier imposed an anti-dumping duty on Chinese manufacturers, back in November 2021. Europacable was the complainant here as well. The action followed an investigation that observed Chinese producers were benefitting from multiple government subsidies including funds to spur innovation along with research and development. They were also granted preferential tax rates as a high-tech industry. The investigation also concluded that Chinese manufacturers benefit from the state-funded China Development Bank Fund, whose purpose is to support projects in key strategic sectors set out by the Chinese government. The Chinese manufacturers were deemed to be guilty of “unfair competition” that was “injurious to the EU industry.” Duties were imposed on these concerns in the range of 5.1% to 10.3%. However, this did not mark the end of the tale. The Commission further tightened the anti-dumping duty after it found Chinese companies deliberately decreasing the prices of their exports to ‘absorb’ the impact of their earlier actions. They were now slapped with new anti-dumping duties ranging from 39.4% to 88%, which the Commission deemed to be the maximum increase allowed. As per data from the World Bank’s World Trade Integrated Solution, China was the biggest import partner (to the EU) for optical fibre cables in 2023. This was followed by India, U.S., Morocco and U.K. Globally, the top exporters of the commodity were China, U.S., EU, Mexico and Hong Kong — in that order. Considering India’s placement in this ecosystem, the anti-dumping duties could potentially translate to cost implications for European consumers. Back in 2021 when the Commission acted against China, it said that with the demand for cables expected to increase, the measures would ensure distributors have a larger competing market. “This is an opportunity for them to keep and develop their business even if their prices increase due to the anti-dumping duties,” it noted. These dynamics, however, could not be realised because China undercut prices further. Back then, concerns also emanated about importers being able to switch suppliers in a relatively short time— it would be “costly” and “time consuming.” The Commission, however, derived confidence from the array of importing countries and earlier resilience to find new suppliers during the 2017-18 shortage. Also crucial to note in the ‘dumping’ context and the investigation period: as captured in the Ministry of Commerce’s Import-Export data bank, India’s exports (in terms of value) of optical fiber cables declined 11.21% to $47.8 million in FY 2023-24. In fact, in May last year, India’s Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) had also initiated an anti-dumping investigation scrutinising China, Indonesia and South Korea. The investigation observed that because of an increase in the volume of low-priced dumped goods, the domestic industry has not been able to sell the article in significant quantities in the domestic market. This has translated into an inventory pile-up. Separately, the investigation also observed that the dumped imports’ impact on the selling price of the domestic industry has led to a “significant loss, decline in cash profit and a significant reduction in the return on capital employed.” While it was found that there was an increase in the production as well as capacity (for domestic industry), the fruits could not be utilised fully because of the dumping. It was noted that the complainant was able to maintain their sales and market share by selling articles at a loss. The considerable growth in demand was subsumed by dumped imports – further translating also to a decline in the domestic industry’s market share. For perspective— Minister of State for Communication Devusinh Chauhan in a response to a question in the Lok Sabha (August 2023), informed that the existing capacity of the domestic industry was 100 million fiber km, relying on data from industry associations. He added that the market size was approximately Rs 7,000 crore (in 2019) with a CAGR of 6.8%. Mr Chauhan also told the Lower House that domestic investments in the optical fibre industry was approximately Rs 5,000 crores while foreign investments scaled about Rs 600 crore in the last 10 years.

The largest project with 900 tonnes per day (TPD) capacity would come up in Noida whereas Bhopal and Hubbali would have 500 and 400 TPD respectively, the company said in a statement. Recently, it had commissioned a Green Coal project in Varanasi. Including the Varanasi project, all the projects will have a combined installed capacity to handle 2400 tonnes of Municipal solid Waste (MSW) per day by August 2025, the company added. NTPC is expected to get over 800 tonnes of Green Coal per day collectively from the four projects, it further said. Gautam Gupta, Joint Managing Director, Macawber Beekay said, “In terms of technological enhancements, we are upgrading the existing technology with innovations derived from our experience in Varanasi by continuous research and development.” “These refinements will not only bolster efficiency but also ensure the seamless integration of these advancements into our operations in Varanasi and the upcoming projects,” he added. Green coal is charcoal made using MSW through thermal treatment of MSW, technically called torrefaction, which is carried out in an oxygen-deficient environment. The process uses biomass pellets (produced using agro-waste) to start the combustion process. It also results in the production of some volatile gases which, in turn, are used in heating of dryer & reactor during conversion of MSW into charcoal, thereby keeping emissions to a minimum and making the system self-sustainable, the company said. business (general) / renewable energy / Uttar Pradesh / Madhya Pradesh / Karnataka BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

File | Photo Credit: Sandeep Saxena A project by the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIIT-Delhi), has won the joint second prize in Trinity Challenge’s second competition, on tackling the escalating threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a press release said. The Trinity Challenge is a charity supporting the creation of data-driven solutions to help protect against global health threats. The project, ‘AMRSense: Empowering Communities with a Proactive One Health Ecosystem,’ was led by Tavpritesh Sethi of IIIT-Delhi in collaboration with CHRI-PATH, 1mg.com, and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). AMRSense addresses the challenges of engaging, motivating, and training community health workers (CHWs) in AMR surveillance and management, compounded by the lack of a comprehensive data ecosystem and analytics capabilities, the release said. In India, where over 9,00,000 ASHA workers face limited awareness, insufficient training, and low motivation, there is a significant gap in community-level AMR data collection and evidence-based management. AMRSense tackles these issues through four major components: community engagement by empowering CHWs with AI-assisted data recording tools for accurate and simplified data collection; data integration by creating a unified AMR data ecosystem through the integration of antibiotic sales, consumption, and WHONet-compliant surveillance data using open-source tools and APIs; predictive analytics by using federated analytics across the OneHealth ecosystem for integrative insights on AMR; and the AMRaura Scorecard for monitoring and evaluating AMR trends to guide targeted interventions and demonstrate the benefits of data collection. The IIIT-Delhi project shared the second prize with another project, also from India, titled ‘OASIS: OneHealth Antimicrobial Stewardship for Informal Health Systems.’ Each joint second prize winner will receive £6,00,000 in funding over the next three years. All winners will also benefit from ongoing post-award innovation and scaling support, the release said. computing and information technology / Delhi / New Delhi BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Students staged protests in front of the Ministry of Education (MoE) as well as the Minister’s residence on Thursday Mr. Pradhan, in a press briefing held on Thursday evening in New Delhi, said that on Wednesday, June 19, at 3 p.m., information was received by the MoE from the Home Ministry’s Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) that the dark net had leaked questions from the UGC-NET exam. Late on Wednesday evening, the MoE decided to scrap the examination and issued instructions that a re-test would be held for the approximately 11 lakh UGC-NET aspirants. Mr. Pradhan has said that a reform committee consisting of technocrats, bureaucrats and scientists would be formulated, which would suggest improvements to the NTA’s working. The Minister said that while Anti-Cheating Bill had been passed in both Houses earlier this year, the Law Ministry was on job for firming up the rules, and “very soon, we will come out with stringent rules”, he said. “We don’t have any weapon right now to face these kinds of challenges,” Mr. Pradhan said. “These days, software like Telegram are used to leak questions. When we are conducting exams of Ph.D. students, we have to maintain quality, and with full pain, we are taking responsibility to rectify the system. Very soon, we will come with new dates [for the re-test],” he said. On the NEET 2024 paper leak, Mr. Pradhan said the accused would be punished but before that, evidence and proof had to be gathered. “Patna police is working hard on cracking the case. Senior police officials of Bihar are in touch with central government officials,” he added. “I take responsibility for NEET paper leak and whoever is responsible will not be spared,” Mr. Pradhan also said. The Minister side-stepped questions on allegations that Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav’s personal assistant had been named in the NEET leak case for alleged connections with the accused. The back-to-back alleged paper leak cases have affected the lives of at least 35 lakh students. NEET paves the way for admissions to medical colleges, and the UGC-NET is administered to choose Ph.D. candidates. Students from across Delhi on Thursday afternoon gathered at the MoE to protest against the alleged discrepancies in the NEET-UG exam, and the cancellation of the UGC-NET. “We have seen massive discrepancies on the result of the NEET-UG declared on June 4. NEET aspirants have been demanding a re-exam. However, the NTA and the MoE has not responded to their demands,” All India Students’ Association (AISA) said. The student body also alleged that paper leaks had been seen in various shifts of the UGC-NET. Many student protestors were detained across locations by the Delhi Police on Thursday. “Protesting students demanded the NTA be scrapped and for the Minister of Education Mr. Dharmendra Pradhan to immediately resign,” the Students’ Federation of India said. The National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), which staged a protest in front of the Minister’s residence, claimed that the Minister was involved in various “scams”. “It is evident from Dharmendra Pradhan’s actions that he has taken money in this scandal. We are prepared to offer this money openly, but the Education Minister must immediately ban the National Testing Agency and take decisive action against the officials involved,” NSUI national president Varun Choudhary said. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) also joined the protests. “After the irregularities in the NEET-UG exam, the cancellation of the UGC-NET exam yesterday [Wednesday] raises a big question mark on a government institution like NTA, which is very unfortunate and a matter of playing with the future of the students,” the ABVP said in a statement.

The agency has invoked sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. On Wednesday, the UGC received inputs from the National Cyber Crime Threat Analytics Unit of the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) that the integrity of UGC-NET 2024, conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) in two shifts across different cities, may have been compromised. Late on Wednesday, the Education Ministry announced cancellation of the examination. The test is held twice a year to ascertain the eligibility of candidates for Assistant Professor, Junior Research Fellowship and Assistant Professor positions, and for PhD admissions. The development comes weeks after the NTA got embroiled in a controversy over the irregularities in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Under Graduate) for medical and allied courses, triggering protests by students and litigations. Bihar Police’s Economic Offences Unit has already registered a case of alleged paper leak in the NEET case and arrested 13 persons, including four students, so far. Statements of some other students are being recorded. The Education Ministry has sought details of the police findings to take further action. The Opposition parties have targeted the BJP-led government, seeking justice for lakhs of students who appeared by NEET earlier this year. On Thursday, Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan held a press conference and said that back-to-back paper leaks affecting 35 lakh students was an “institutional failure” of the NTA. Listing the measures being taken by the government to prevent such instances, he said the accused would be punished based on evidence. entrance examination / test/examination BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Amid multiple controversies that the National Testing Agency (NTA) is currently embroiled in, the agency on June 21 issued a notification postponed due to “unavoidable circumstances and logistical issues”. The notification stated: “The candidates are hereby informed that the Joint CSIR-UGC-NET Examination June-2024 which was scheduled to be held between 25.06.2024 to 27.06.2024 is being postponed due to unavoidable circumstances as well as logistic issues.

The allegations over NEET-UG 2024 | Explained Joint CSIR UGC-NET is conducted to determine the eligibility of Indian nationals for the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF), Assistant Professor positions and PhD admissions in accordance with the eligibility criteria laid down by UGC. This comes days after the Union Education Ministry cancelled UGC-NET following inputs from the Union Home Ministry suggesting that the integrity of the examination had been compromised. Over the past few days, students across the country have been questioning the testing agency over the irregularities in NEET-UG, and now about the cancellation of UGC-NET. CSIR-NET is just conducted for five science subjects — Life Science, Earth Science, Physical Science, Chemical Science, and Mathematics, while UGC-NET is conducted for the whole of humanities. Students in New Delhi said they will continue protesting against the “NTA’s inefficiencies”.

The repeated leaks and mishandling of exams have severely impacted the future of countless students, and decisive action is needed to restore faith in our education system,” NSUI further said. education / test/examination BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

SUJATHA T he buzz in the hall at La Nave in Madrid was impressive. For two-and-half days, lay observers were witness to animated discussions among entrepreneurs, young students and investors. While the beehive buzzed in the background, entrepreneurs shared their experiences in closed auditoria during the South Summit, co-organised by IE University, Madrid. During the inauguration of the 13th edition on June 4, Maria Benjumea, president and founder of South Summit, announced that the first Asian summit will be held in South Korea from September 25 to 27, 2024. “Our motto (for South Summit 24) is Human by Design. We are convinced that all technologies are key to the evolution of society and that the person is at the centre and is the creator of these technologies. In the new era, it is more crucial than ever to ensure that technology not only improves our lives but does so inclusively, ethically, and sustainably by putting people at the centre,” she told an audience comprising representatives from across Europe, Canada and South America. The summit showcased start-ups that helped the community they emerged from and beyond by working in healthcare (developing apps for visually challenged persons to helping diagnose children and adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)) or in the sphere of human resources (developing networks for aspirants to find employment that fitted their skillsets or helping students learn through their network of guides and lessons) and those that worked with civic bodies to improve community living. Of the 100 start-ups shortlisted, around 10 were selected across various categories for scaling up. One of the winners was Spanish start-up NaviLens, which helps persons with visual impairment. Difficulty in using traditional signage immobilises them in unfamiliar environments. The start-up has developed an app with which the user can scan a QR code and get the information contextualised. Joinrs, says Lodovico Graepel, project coordinator and founder, works in the Human Resources sphere and tries to match skillsets of job searchers with companies at home. The employees are primarily in the 20-35 age group and work from Brazil, Colombia, Albania and the UK, explained Francesca Capozzo, a junior marketing specialist. Graepel adds that the company has “a lot of users (including) students from India. But everyone wants to come to Europe and the U.S. to work. Another interesting start-up presented was Penseum, which has developed an AI-powered platform that turns study material into interactive guides. Launched in September 2023 in Canada, it has 20,000 users across the world. “In India and Brazil, we have 10 million views on our videos. Students get in touch through Instagram. It is free for students while institutions are charged,” explains Kamyar Hosseini, the co-founder. Nova Talent — a recruitment start-up, based in Italy, Spain and Sweden — aims to connect talented individuals with businesses. This professional network group has around 20,000 members and is meant for students and professionals, says Celia Rico Sanchez-Mateos, Marketing and Communications Associate. Asked about the low placement numbers (just 1000 have been placed), she says, “Since they are already in high paying jobs they don’t want to change professions.” Bitsphi Diagnosis aims to transform the standard of ADHD neuro-diagnosis. Children are given a cognitive task while an EEG collects data from the brain. This is processed in a cloud-based backend and a comprehensive report is offered to healthcare professionals for an accurate diagnosis. However, says Gerardo Galvez Garcia, scientific project manager, this is a prototype and clinical testing is yet to be done.

The summit also hosted sessions in which speakers explained the importance of staying local but garnering global attention. South Summit is a platform to promote development of business opportunities in the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. South Summit, Madrid, has hosted more than 36,000 start-ups in 12 editions and its start-up competition has produced seven unicorns. It has produced more than 1,000 finalist start-ups with a survival rate of 90% and more than $15,007 million in investment, a University statement said.

Within this ecosystem, interactions generate a plethora of data points, encompassing student demographics, academic performance metrics, browsing history, and engagement patterns. This collection of student data is fundamental to tailor educational experiences and enhance learning outcomes. Educational technology platforms leverage data analytics and machine learning algorithms to personalise instruction, identify areas of improvement, and provide targeted support for student progress. However, the indiscriminate gathering of sensitive information without informed consent or transparent disclosure raises significant concerns regarding individual privacy rights and autonomy. The commercialisation of student data poses risks related to ownership, security breaches, and potential exploitation by external entities. To address these issues, various legal frameworks and regulatory mechanisms including the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 and Information Technology Act, 2000 have been implemented to safeguard student data privacy. In the context of digital classrooms, where students interact with diverse educational technologies, understanding digital rights becomes imperative. The proliferation of digital communication channels exposes students to a range of cyber threats, such as identity theft, fraud, and online harassment. Sharing personal information online without due diligence can lead to severe consequences, compromising students’ privacy and security. It is essential for students to exercise caution and discretion when sharing sensitive information online and remain vigilant against potential cyber threats. Examining privacy policies acts as a frontline defence in defining the boundaries of student data collection, storage, and utilisation. Through meticulous review, students assert their authority in safeguarding personal information, thereby upholding their inherent rights to autonomy and dignity. Understanding the utilisation of their data by digital platforms and educational tools empowers students to make informed choices about their engagement levels. Therefore, it is important for students to acquaint themselves with the privacy policies and terms of service governing digital platforms and educational tools used in the classroom to make discerning decisions regarding online activities. Scrutinising terms of service enables students to grasp the scope and purpose of data collection, storage, and utilisation and facilitates assessment of implications for privacy and digital security. Delving into privacy policies embedded within terms of service elucidates students’ entitlements and safeguards concerning personal information handling. Attention to provisions regarding data access, consent mechanisms, and data-sharing practices empowers students to effectively assert their privacy rights. Moreover, terms of service delineate users’ responsibilities and obligations, fostering adherence to ethical standards and nurturing a safe digital environment. In the digital age, accessing and utilising educational resources often involves navigating complex copyright laws and regulations. Students must adhere to these laws while using digital resources for educational purposes, ensuring proper attribution and compliance with licensing agreements. When in doubt about the legality of using copyrighted materials, students must: Understanding digital rights empowers students to navigate the digital world responsibly. They have rights such as knowing how their data is used, reviewing and correcting it, deleting unnecessary data, and objecting to data processing. By understanding their privacy and data protection rights, students can advocate for themselves and ensure ethical treatment of their personal information. This knowledge is essential to promote digital literacy, protect privacy, and foster responsible digital citizenship in today’s technology-driven education landscape.

At its core, it unites core fields such as Mechanical, Electrical, Civil Engineering and applies intelligent automation layer through AI, computer, and Robotics Engineering. The rise of hybrid engineering can be illustrated by real-world examples that demonstrate the significant impact of interdisciplinary collaboration. Consider the aerospace industry, where companies like Ricardo, in collaboration with Pratt & Whitney Canada, are innovating advanced hybrid-electric propulsion technology for next generation aircraft. This effort integrates Mechanical Engineering’s knowledge of structural mechanics alongside the complex Electrical Engineering’s power systems, as well as the sophisticated control algorithms of AI and Computer Engineering. Another example is the creation of hybrid and electric vehicles in the automotive industry. Vehicles, like the Toyota Prius, underscore the necessity of bridging different engineering disciplines to tackle complex issues like energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances the vehicle design but also contributes to reducing carbon emissions. The emergence of hybrid engineering has fundamentally changed the way problems are viewed and solved. It helps break down the barriers that traditionally impeded the development of new ideas, and creates a space that allows for collaboration and the exchange of knowledge. Since the boundaries of disciplines have become blurred, the significance of encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial. Engineering education, today, is increasingly focused on projects that are team-based and resemble the real-world of interdisciplinary collaboration. Here are some ways through which institutions can foster this collaborative spirit: Mixed Plantation Approach: Imagine an engineering school where disciplines don’t sit apart but are interwoven, like a mixed plantation. Energy Systems Engineering courses combine ideas from Electrical, Mechanical and Environmental disciplines to address real-world problems such as designing sustainable energy solutions. Interdisciplinary labs: Establishing cross-disciplinary labs or a “Smart City Technology” lab will bring together Civil, Electrical, and Computer engineers to design intelligent transportation systems and energy-efficient buildings. Hybrid Engineering mindset: To fully harness its potential, academia and industry must foster an environment that prioritises flexibility, curiosity, and collaboration among engineers. Encouraging engineers from different backgrounds to collaborate across disciplinary lines, while remaining open-minded towards novel ideas and methodologies will foster innovative thought. Hybrid engineering is an indispensable way of solving today’s complex challenges and to innovate and shape our world too. It opens doors to future engineers and offers unlimited possibilities in creating a better future. The writer is Director, Symbiosis Institute of Technology Pune.

However, with multi-cloud strategy gaining, traction, staying updated on industry trends is crucial. According to a 2023 study commissioned by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, 98% plan to use multiple cloud infrastructure providers. What is multi-cloud strategy? How can students succeed in this dynamic environment? When an organisation integrates multiple cloud services, possibly from different vendors, we have a multi-cloud. The approach gives organisations better control over their application infrastructure, streamlining it efficiently. Multi-cloud environments offer redundancy, cost efficiency, and flexibility, ensuring uninterrupted operations within budgets, avoiding vendor lock-in, and meeting fluctuating market conditions. Aspirants can explore numerous opportunities, as they leverage multi-cloud development to build scalable, resilient applications that address specific customer and end-user concerns. The positive career outlook makes more sense when multi-cloud development is seen in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Technologies like Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are embedded into various multi-cloud environment components. This integration can help one consolidate advanced analytics, automate various tasks within the environment, and allow multi-cloud systems to help arrive at intelligent decisions. What are the essential skills and learning pathways that aspirants in this sector need? Here are a few: Cloud computing fundamentals: A solid grasp of cloud architecture principles, service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and virtualisation is a must. Platforms: Knowing your way around at least the leading cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, and GCP) is essential to designing and implementing effective multi-cloud solutions Automation tools: Expertise in automation tools such as Puppet, Ansible, Kubernetes, and so on is needed to build dynamic cloud solutions that can perform with minimal human involvement. Networking, cybersecurity, and containerisation: These are vital to navigating the complexities of multi-cloud environments, ensuring their security, scalability, and interoperability. There are diverse career paths available for a multi-cloud specialist. As a cloud architect, one can work on client-facing software and backend infrastructure. Alternatively, as a Cloud DevOps engineer, one can oversee operations of a cloud computing infrastructure. These positions typically require a Bachelor’s degree and relevant certifications. Those interested in AI can learn AI/ML technologies and deploy them on different clouds such as a cloud engineer with multi-service expertise learning AI solutions that can be worked into multiple clouds or a DevOps or full-stack developer who uses cloud-hosted backends for AI frontend solutions.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 22, 2024 11:39 am IST Presenting historical facts without distortion encourages students to think critically about the past, grasp the complexities of historical events and promotes cultural awareness and tolerance. | Photo Credit: Getty Images/iStockPhoto R ecently, I came across a cartoon titled “History for Peace” depicting a student studying a book called “History of India – Revised Edition.” The room is illuminated by a table lamp labelled “NCERT” (National Council of Educational Research and Training). Both the book and the lamp are saffron-coloured. The text below reads: “Bapu died peacefully on January 30, 1948, with God’s name on his lips. A truly blessed life.” This powerful cartoon is a classic example of historical distortion. It indirectly suggests that Mahatma Gandhi (Bapu), the Father of the Nation, died a natural death, omitting the crucial fact that he was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu fanatic. Distortion of history is not new in India. Over the past decade, it has been discussed and debated numerous times in mainstream and social media. Recently, the controversy surrounding the revised NCERT textbooks has been widely covered, following the threat by academics Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar of taking legal action against the NCERT for publishing new textbooks under their names without consent. “Both of us do not want the NCERT to hide behind our names to pass on to students such textbooks of political science that we find politically biased, academically indefensible and pedagogically dysfunctional,” the letter said. However, NCERT director Dinesh Prasad Saklani defended the revisions on the grounds that an “expert committee felt that mentioning a few (riots) selectively is not good. Why should we teach about riots in school textbooks? We want to create positive citizens, not violent and depressed individuals.” He also mentioned that the changes in the textbooks align with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. Saklani seems to have conveniently forgotten that these revisions go against the NEP 2020 objective of “enhancing critical thinking among students.” This is not the first time that the NCERT has faced controversy. It received criticism for reducing the focus on Mughal history while increasing coverage of ancient Hindu history and the Vedic periods. Additionally, there was backlash for diminishing the content related to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi and the role of his assassin, Nathuram Godse. In this context, it is crucial to analyse the importance of accurate historical representation. Historical negationism differs from historical revisionism: the former distorts history, while the latter corrects it through rationale, evidence, and reinterpretation. However, if distortion is permitted under the guise of revisionism, it risks glorifying the falsification of history while vilifying accurate historical accounts. There is no such thing as good or bad history; accurate history is simply history. Manufactured narratives and myths constitute anti-history or pseudo-history. While the ideal of history is to provide an accurate and objective account of past events, pseudo-history involves promoting alternative historical accounts that lack credible evidence or scholarly consensus. Anti-history can take forms like denialism, revisionism, propaganda, and myth-making. Accurate history serves as the foundation upon which societies build their identities, values, and future. Understanding the true events of the past allows societies to learn from both previous mistakes and successes. Presenting historical facts without distortion encourages students to think critically about the past, grasp the complexities of historical events and promotes cultural awareness and tolerance. Distorted history perpetuates stereotypes and justifies unjust practices and perpetuates errors and misconceptions about the world. Creating narratives based on myths and presenting them as historical facts can undermine historical integrity and impact society. If historians, academics, educators, and students do not actively oppose these distortions, falsehoods may become entrenched in public consciousness. The distortion of history in textbooks, driven by political agendas, is a critical issue with significant implications for education. Here are a few suggestions to improve the quality of history textbooks: The present is possible because of the past. An accurate account of the past paves the way for a wonderful present and a beautiful future.

However, I never imagined turning this interest into a career. I was introduced to the field of research during my Bachelor’s in Zoology. At Ruparel College, Mumbai, we had a butterfly garden that we monitored regularly for changes in biodiversity. This experience opened my eyes to the world of ecological research. The head of the department, Madhavi Indap, played a significant role in steering me towards natural history and ecological research. I later undertook a Master’s in Environmental Science at Pune University and a Ph.D. at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). My fieldwork took me to the Western Ghats, where I spent a lot of time in the evergreen forests of Goa, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. My research focused on butterfly populations, their behaviour, resource distribution, and how they respond to habitat fragmentation. I would spend hours in the field, collecting data on butterflies. An experience that made field surveys unusually exciting was being charged at by domestic buffaloes! The most interesting part of my research was identifying the species that are vulnerable to extinction due to habitat fragmentation. We found that butterflies with a smaller wingspan and specialist diet such as the plum judy and pygmy scrub hopper are more vulnerable, while generalist species like the common crow and blue tiger are less affected. When I look back, I realise that the skills of observation and patience have been the most crucial for my research. My Ph.D. guide, Dr. Kavita Isvaran, also played an important role in teaching me the principles of study design, data analysis, and scientific writing. Dr. Ravi Jambhekar is an urban biodiversity specialist, a natural history painter and a botanical artist. | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement Coming to illustrating, I always enjoyed drawing as a hobby, but never considered it professionally. It all started when a senior botanist asked me to create a diagram for his paper publication on a new plant species that he had discovered. I immersed myself in library books, which helped me create scientific illustrations. While out in the field, I would use the latter half of the day, when the butterflies are generally inactive, to sketch. I would practise regularly and make a sketch or small paintings of whatever I would come across: butterflies, birds, flowers, trees, and more. Watercolour on paper has generally been my go-to medium but I’ve recently started exploring digital illustrations as well. Thanks to these different experiences, combining science and art has now become a key part of my work. By integrating visual media and scientific principles, I can communicate science more effectively and reach a wider audience. This not only eases the way we create awareness about nature conservation but also helps us reach the public. My current role as an ecologist at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements is quite academic. In the Urban Fellows Programme, I teach youth from all over the country about the impact of urbanisation on birds and butterflies and how we can include nature-based solutions in cities. I would encourage you to pursue a career in Ecology as there are many opportunities in this field, with new and expanding organisations offering various roles. What we’ve got to do is put our skillset to the right use. Remember, small things can make a huge difference!

Asked about references to Gujarat riots or Babri masjid demolition being tweaked in NCERT textbooks, Mr. Saklani said, \"Why should we teach about riots in school textbooks? We want to create positive citizens not violent and depressed individuals\". \"Should we teach our students in a manner that they become offensive, create hatred in society or become victim of hatred? Is that education's purpose? Should we teach about riots to such young children...when they grow up, they can learn about it but why school textbooks. Let them understand what happened and why it happened when they grow up. The hue and cry about the changes is irrelevant,\" he said. The comments by Mr. Saklani come at a time when new textbooks have hit the market with several deletions and changes. The revised Class 12 political science textbook, does not mention the Babri masjid, but refers to it as a \"three-domed structure\". It has pruned the Ayodhya section from four to two pages and deleted details from the earlier version. It instead focuses on the Supreme Court judgement that paved the way for the construction of a Ram temple at the site where the disputed structure once stood before it was torn down by Hindu activists in December 1992. The Supreme Court verdict was widely accepted in the country. The consecration of the Ram idol in the temple was performed on January 22 this year by the prime minister. \"We want to create positive citizens and that's what is the purpose of our textbooks. We cannot have everything in them. The purpose of our education is not to create violent citizens...depressed citizens. Hatred and violence are not subjects of teaching, they should not be focus of our textbooks,\" Mr. Saklani said. He hinted that the same hue and cry is not made about 1984 riots not being in textbooks. The latest deletions in the textbooks include: BJP's 'rath yatra' from Somnath in Gujarat to Ayodhya; the role of kar sevaks; communal violence in the wake of the demolition of the Babri masjid; President's rule in BJP-ruled states; and the BJP's expression of \"regret over the happenings at Ayodhya\". \"If Supreme Court has given a verdict in favour of Ram temple, Babri masjid or Ram janmabhoomi, should it not be included in our textbooks, what is the problem in that? We have included the new updates. If we have constructed new Parliament, should our students not know about it. It is our duty to include the ancient developments and recent developments,\" he said. Asked about allegations of saffronisation of curriculum and ultimately textbooks, Mr. Saklani said, \"If something has become irrelevant ... it will have to be changed. Why shouldn't it be changed. I don't see any saffronisation here. We teach history so students know about facts, not for making it a battleground\". \"If we are telling about Indian Knowledge System, how can it be saffronisation? If we are telling about iron pillar in Mehrauli and saying Indians were way ahead of any metallurigical scientist, are we saying wrong? How can it be saffronisation?\" Mr. Saklani, 61, who was head of the ancient history department at the HNB Garhwal University before taking charge as NCERT director in 2022, has faced criticism over the changes in textbooks, especially pertaining to historical facts. \"What is wrong about changes in textbooks? Updating textbooks is a global practice, it is in interest of education. Revising textbooks is an annual exercise. Whatever is changed is decided by subject and pedagogy experts. I do not dictate or interfere in the process...there is no imposition from top. \"There are no attempts to saffronise curriculum, everything is based on facts and evidence,\" he said. The NCERT is revising the curriculum of the school textbooks in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. From the assertion that recent studies of ancient DNA obtained from archaeological sources at Rakhigarhi, an Indus Valley site in Haryana, rule out Aryan immigration to a call for more research into whether the Harappans and the Vedic people were the same, several topics have either been dropped or tweaked in textbooks. A two-page table detailing achievements of Mughal emperors such as Humayun, Shah Jahan, Akbar, Jahangir and Aurangzeb have also been removed. This is the fourth round of revision and updating of NCERT textbooks since 2014. education BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Blue-collar vacancies generally get filled quickly. And the positions are also deserted with equal speed. Smitha Nair, a human-resource professional turned entrepreneur, notes on the scale of difficulty levels in personnel management, retaining blue-collar workers tends towards “very difficult”. A report by The Udaiti Foundation and Quess Corp Limited found that initial three months of employment is critical to retention, as a substantial number of new associates “jump ship” in that period. The dropout rate among female associates is higher. The report is based on an analysis of monthly Quess payroll data of over 15 lakh employees from 2020 to 2023. Associates who stick to the job during the first three months tend to persist in the job for much longer — for a minimum of one year. The percentage of those dropping out in the first month is higher in the low-earning category as compared to high-earning associates, signalling salary to be a significant factor contributing to dropout rates. “Unlike white collar jobs, where attrition usually strikes after one year of employment, the ‘turnover rate’ for blue and grey collar staff is high during the first 90 days and we need to address it,” says M.P. Karthick, assistant vice president, Data and Applied Research, The Udaiti Foundation. Reasons for leaving The staffing industry struggles with high attrition rates, with factors such as temporary nature of work, lack of job security and limited avenues for professional development. For women, these challenges are exacerbated by care-giving responsibility and discrimination at work. Addressing attrition As reported by Quess, access to benefits significantly improved retention among female associates. This includes benefits such as provident fund, ESIC and performance incentives. The data revealed that married women with PF benefits are three times more likely to stay with the company than those without those privileges. Similarly, single women with ESIC benefits are 48% more likely to retain their jobs than their counterparts without such benefits. In addition, performance incentives make single women three times more likely to remain employed, and married women receiving quarterly incentives are seven times more likely to stay. Better career opportunities also emerge as a dominant driver to leave an organisation. A prominent MNC specialising in home appliances had a high attrition rate, partly due to low compensation packages within the industry. Realising this, the company restructured the salary framework by introducing a festive season driven retention bonus and customised training programmes to enhance employee engagement and skill development. These initiatives resulted in substantial cost savings, totalling ₹ 5 crore annually, and a significant reduction in attrition from 56% to 44%, says a case study presented by TeamLease Services, a HR consultancy for contract staffing services. Digital feedback Shahi Exports, in association with Good Business Lab, a labour research organisation, launched a digital tool that allows workers to share feedback anonymously and directly with HR or supervisors. ‘Inache’, as it is called, accommodates multiple regional languages, simplifying the feedback process and eliminating barriers to expression and fear of reprisal. Quess has a ‘SARA’ chatbot that picks up human behavioural moods encountered by the associates, especially in the first 90 days of their employment. employment / employer / employee BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

However, it is critical to underscore the distinct value that human counsellors bring to the table and why their function is still irreplaceable. Human counsellors and Artificial Intelligence differ in their abilities to understand and empathise with an individual’s emotional intricacies. While AI can analyse data and deliver logical answers, it lacks the emotional intelligence to comprehend the complexities of human emotions. There are two main reasons why human counsellors score over AI. The first is the emotional connection. The human contact allows building a rapport and trust between the counsellor and the client. This leads to the expression of empathy, warmth and support, all of which strengthen a therapeutic relationship. The second is touch, a non-verbal method of communication that allows counsellors to express empathy, reassurance and understanding. However, despite it being an effective technique, it must be used with caution. Before adding touch to their sessions, counsellors must set clear standards and acquire the patient’s informed agreement. This is because attitudes to touch differ among cultures and individuals. Therefore, counsellors need to be aware of and considerate of their client’s preferences to avoid making them uncomfortable. Of course the use of AI in counselling also offers certain benefits. One is the unparalleled accessibility and availability and removal of constraints such as geographical distance and limited resources. Second, AI can tailor the approach to each user’s specific needs by using personalised interventions and feedback, increasing treatment efficacy, and establishing stronger ties between clients and counsellors. The anonymity of AI offers a sense of privacy and users may not have to worry about being judged or the stigma that sometimes accompanies face-to-face sessions. However, AI algorithms lack the empathy and human intuition required for effective counselling, which might even exacerbate users’ feelings of isolation or inadequacy. From chatbots to provide instant services to VR simulations for exposure treatment, AI has the potential to improve accessibility and efficacy of mental healthcare services. However, it should complement, not replace human counsellors. While AI can effectively conduct everyday chores, provide basic knowledge, and assist in particular situations, it lacks the sensitivity, and intuition that human counsellors bring to the process. Career counsellors give personalised assistance based on your specific interests, skills, and aspirations. They assist you in exploring several career alternatives and identifying pathways that are compatible with your abilities and goals. The use of examinations and talks help you get a better knowledge of yourself, including your values, personality characteristics, and preferences. This self-discovery process allows you to make more informed job selections. Counsellors also assist you in acquiring the abilities required to succeed in your chosen area, such as strengthening your communication skills, polishing your technical competence, or developing leadership traits. Professional counsellors provide encouragement, direction, and practical answers to assist you in overcoming obstacles and remaining focused on your goals. Therefore, human counsellors will continue to play an essential role in career counselling even in the age of AI. Recognising and channelising both will help us offer comprehensive and effective help to those who require it.

As of now, about 2,000 students are enrolled in Government Arts College and Government Ramnarayan Chellaram College of Commerce and Management in under-graduate and post-graduate courses. They will become part of the university. In addition, the university will be able to utilise the services of 80 permanent faculty working in these two colleges. According to university officials, apart from this, students of both colleges can advance academically by using the opportunities for research and academic collaboration, well-equipped library, playground, laboratory and other facilities in the university. In addition, the move will be beneficial for the faculty members. The retirement age of teaching faculty or professors under the Collegiate Education Department is 60 years as compared to 62 years for university’s faculty members or professors. Lingaraja Gandhi, Vice-Chancellor of the university, told The Hindu , “Earlier, both these colleges were affiliated colleges of our university. However, the government has now declared both as constituent colleges of our university. Now, they come under the direct administration of our university. This will benefit both the university and the colleges. The shortage of faculty in the university can be overcome by effectively utilising the services of faculty of both these colleges. Students will benefit by using all the facilities of the university directly. And, additional service will be available for faculty members as well.” bengaluru / education / university / universities and colleges BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The 2021 runner-up said tennis plays a fundamental part in shaping his thinking. “I get the feeling that without tennis my life would have been so much different, with regards to challenging myself and setting personal goals for myself,” Tsitsipas said. “Tennis helps me fill out those dreams and fulfil my deepest desires as a human being.” ALSO READ | The last lap: On the French Open The ninth-seeded Tsitsipas, who won the Monte Carlo Masters in April, feels his game is in good shape. Next up for the big-serving Greek is unseeded Italian player Matteo Arnaldi. “I have been keeping an eye on him the last six months,” Tsitsipas said. “He's a very good fighter.” Arnaldi advanced by eliminating sixth-seeded Andrey Rublev 7-6 (6), 6-2, 6-4. Rublev came as a contender after winning the Madrid Open this month but he showed frustration against Arnaldi for his lack of precision, committing 37 unforced errors and four double faults. After netting a forehand in the third set, Rublev smashed his racket on his knee four times.

Personally, I don't pay too much attention,” Arnaldi said. “But it definitely does give me a little confidence, because it means I am giving him trouble, and what I was doing was working.” No. 2 Jannik Sinner of Italy progressed by downing Pavel Kotov 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. The Australian Open champion next faces Frenchman Corentin Moutet. Two-time major winner Carlos Alcaraz also advanced after beating 27th-seeded American Sebastian Korda 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-3. Alcaraz was a semifinalist last year at Roland Garros, losing to Novak Djokovic. On the women's side, top-ranked Iga Swiatek reached the fourth round by beating Marie Bouzkova 6-4, 6-2. The three-time French Open champion from Poland won on her fourth match point, celebrating another Roland Garros victory on the day she turned 23. Former French player Fabrice Santoro did the post-match interview and got the crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier to join in with him as he sang “Happy Birthday.” Swiatek put her head in her hands, shyly, then lifted it up and smiled broadly. The match was not the thrill-a-minute contest she had with Naomi Osaka in the second round, when Swiatek saved a match point and grabbed the last five games. Still, Bouzkova held on. She saved one match point with a forehand winner, and Swiatek hit a forehand wide on another. A crisp forehand down the line sealed Swiatek's win at the fourth attempt. Next for Swiatek was unseeded Anastasia Potapova. No. 3-seeded Coco Gauff beat Australian Open semifinalist Dayana Yastremska 6-2, 6-4 but fellow American Sofia Kenin was stopped. Kenin lost 6-2, 7-5 to unseeded Danish player Clara Touson, who has lined up two-time Wimbledon runner-up Ons Jabeur. The eighth-seeded Tunisian won against No. 31-seeded Canadian Leylah Fernandez 6-4, 7-6 (5). Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova defeated Frenchwoman Chloé Paquet 6-1, 6-3. The fifth-seeded Czech, a runner-up at Roland Garros in 2019, next faces qualifier Olga Danilovic, ranked 125th. Danilovic beat Donna Vekic 0-6, 7-5, 7-6 (8) to make her first fourth-round appearance at a Grand Slam tournament. Danilovic lay on her back and cried as she took in her victory. Italy's Elisabetta Cocciaretto upset No. 17 Liudmila Samsonova 7-6 (4), 6-2 on Court Suzanne Lenglen to also reach the last 16 at a Grand Slam for the first time. She has Gauff next. For the fourth consecutive day, rain interrupted play. There was a delay of about 1 1/2 hours on Friday followed by another delay in the evening. tennis BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The 2022 Wimbledon champion Rybakina, seeded fourth, beat Elise Mertens of Belgium 6-4, 6-2. Two-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka followed her on Court Philippe Chatrier and won 7-5, 6-1 against Paula Badosa. “It's tough to play your best friend,” Sabalenka said. It certainly was for a while. After trailing 5-3 in the first set, Sabalenka won eight straight games to take complete control. “I was just feeling myself and trusting my shots,” Sabalenka said. The former No. 1-ranked Sabalenka's best performance at Roland Garros is reaching the semifinals while Rybakina — the only player from Kazakhstan to win a major title — has one quarterfinal appearance here. Rybakina dropped her serve in the seventh game of the first set but broke straight back to tie her match at 4-4. Russian-born Varvara Gracheva of France advanced to the fourth round of a major for the first time after downing Romanian Irina-Camelia Begu 7-5, 6-3. Later Saturday, defending champion Novak Djokovic will be facing No. 30 seed Lorenzo Musetti in a rematch from 2021, when Musetti won the first two sets before retiring in the fifth. No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev, who won the Italian Open last month, plays 26th-seeded Tallon Griekspoor. In other men's third-round play, 21st-seeded Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime beat No.15-seeded American Ben Shelton 6-4, 6-2, 6-1. Their match resumed after being interrupted by rain on Friday evening. Auger-Aliassime has never reached the quarterfinals here, and must get past two-time major winner Carlos Alcaraz of Spain. For the fifth consecutive day, rain interrupted play. At around 1 p.m. rain fell again, with a chilly wind and an unappealing temperature of 14 degrees Celsius (57 Fahrenheit).

The 23-year-old Pole’s quickfire victory came on the same Court Philippe Chatrier where men’s number one Novak Djokovic had completed his third round win at 3:07 a.m., the latest finish to a French Open match after more than four hours and five sets. “I was really focused and in the zone. I wasn’t looking at the score so I continued working on my game,” said Swiatek who had to save a match point to defeat Naomi Osaka in the second round. “It doesn’t feel like summer in Europe.

File | Photo Credit: Getty Images Second seeds Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden overcame fighting Brazilians Orlnado Luz and Marcelo Zormann in a testing three-set opening round at the French Open in Paris on June 2. The Brazilians made life tough for the Australian Open champions who scraped through 7-5 4-6 6-4 in two hours and seven minutes. Entering as an eighth alternate pair, Zormann and Luz would not have hoped to feature in the tournament but a spate of withdrawals cleared their way. They threatened to upset the second seeds but Bopanna and Ebden had the experience to shift momentum at crucial stages of the match. The second seeds raced to a 4-1 lead, riding on a double break but the Brazilian put up a great fight to reel off four straight games to make it 5-5 in the opening set. From there on, the Indo-Australian combine found a way to break Luz with Bopanna firing his returns from the baseline and Ebden supporting him with well-timed volley winners. The Australian served out the set with ease. Zormann was broken in the opening game of the second set with Ebden and Zormann locking in a intense baseline rally in which the Brazilian erred on 30-40 to hand the advantage to the seeded team. More drama followed, as now Bopanna was down 0-40. He saved the first two break chances with some accurate serving but Zormann blasted a winner on the third to make it even steven. Ebden's serve came under tremendous pressure in game four that featured six deuce points in nine intense minutes. The Australian finally held the serve with an overhead smash. Ebden was put under pump again when he returned to serve in game eight. He began with a double fault and then hammered one forehand return on the net. Luz dispatched a volley winner at net on Ebden's return on the next point to earn plenty of break chances. The second seeds saved the first but Ebden double faulted again as the Brazilians led 5-3. Luz came out to serve for the set and parity and had four set points to finish it but Bopanna was splendid -- both at net and from baseline -- as the second seeds broke again to bounce back. However, the Indian dropped serve for the third time in the match and it was one-set all. A break of serve in the fifth game gave Bopanna and Ebden advantage and they did not squander the chance this time with the Indian closing out the match. tennis BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

De Minaur became the first man from his nation to reach the last eight at the claycourt Grand Slam since Lleyton Hewitt in 2004, with the victory on Suzanne Lenglen coming after a mid-match blip for Medvedev following a foot blister. \"It's great. It's amazing. It's a great position to be in,\" De Minaur told reporters. \"It's not just myself. The whole country is showing what we can do and the strength of the nation is extremely exciting for even everyone back at home, just to see all the numbers we got in the top 100, and we keep on pushing out there. \"Just to show what the Australian chemistry is, I've got Thanasi Kokkinakis watching me today, supporting me. It's great to see, honestly. \"Unbelievable feeling to know you've got the support of your team mates and ultimately your mates on tour.\" Former Paris quarter-finalist Medvedev had lost only twice in eight previous meetings with De Minaur and drew first blood with a break in the third game but the 28-year-old was pushed hard in the next before extending his lead. De Minaur drew loud cheers from the crowd as he retrieved shots relentlessly to mount a late comeback attempt from there but Medvedev wrapped up the opening set with little fuss to briefly dampen his opponent's spirits. Medvedev shrugged off a string of superb winners from De Minaur's racket at the start of the second set but surrendered it tamely with an unforced error after taking a medical timeout for blisters on his foot midway through. With the momentum shifting, the 25-year-old De Minaur blazed to a 5-1 lead en route to winning the third set before he traded breaks with Medvedev early in the fourth and pulled away shortly after for a famous win. \"I'm pretty happy, not going to lie,\" said De Minaur, who beat a top-five player at a Grand Slam for the first time in his seventh attempt. \"It was a great match. I fought till the end. I managed to beat a quality opponent in a Grand Slam fourth round, which is the goal I had been setting for myself, to go deeper at these events. I'm proud of myself.\" Aryna Sabalenka’s dominant run at the French Open continued with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Emma Navarro to reach the quarterfinals. And watch out, because now the sun is shining at Porte d’Auteuil in the southwest of Paris. “When the sun is out, I play with a lot more happiness,” said Sabalenka, who has yet drop at Roland Garros this year. She certainly showed some joy after her fourth-round win over the 22nd-seeded Navarro, displaying disco-inspired dance moves on her way off the court to the Bee Gees’ “Stayin’ Alive” played loudly on the phone of No. 8 Ons Jabeur, who stood near a staircase leading to the locker room. The Belarusian, ranked second in the world, is now one win away from her seventh straight Grand Slam semifinal appearance. She will face the winner of the match between Varvara Gracheva and Mirra Andreeva in the quarterfinals. Other results included No. 12 Jasmine Paolini defeating Elina Avanesyan 4-6, 6-0, 6-1, and No. 4 Elena Rybakina advancing past Elina Svitolina 6-4, 6-3. Paolini and Rybakina will meet in the quarterfinals. “She’s a tough opponent. She’s moving well and hitting the ball quite heavily. I’ll have to focus on my footwork,” Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, said of Paolini. With temperatures in Paris approaching 22 degrees Celsius (72 Fahrenheit), the absence of rain allowed the matches on Court Philippe Chatrier and Court Suzanne Lenglen to proceed with an open roof. tennis BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The World No. 1 shrugged off an injury to his right knee as he came from two sets to one down to outlast Cerundolo 6-1, 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 after four hours and 39 minutes. Victory gave him a record 370th Grand Slam win, eclipsing the mark he had shared with Roger Federer. Daniil Medvedev suffered a four-set loss to Australia’s Alex de Minaur as his disappointing record at Roland Garros continued. The Russian fifth seed started strongly but slipped to a 6-4, 2-6, 1-6, 3-6 defeat. Medvedev’s best performance in the French Open remains a quarterfinal run in 2021, while he has also lost in the first round in five of his eight appearances. “Alex played better,” admitted Medvedev, who doubled-faulted on match point. de Minaur had never got past the second round before this year, winning just three of 10 matches. But he has improved on clay this season, also reaching a first Masters quarterfinal on the surface in Monte Carlo. “It’s one of my best Slam results. Looks like I’ve converted myself into a clay specialist,” said de Minaur. He is the first Australian man to reach the French Open last eight since former World No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt in 2004. Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva became the youngest player to reach the women’s quarterfinals since 2005 by defeating home hope Varvara Gracheva. She downed the Moscow-born Gracheva 7-5, 6-2 to book a last-eight spot at a Grand Slam for the first time. Aged 17 and 27 days, she is the youngest woman to make the quarterfinal since Bulgaria’s Sesil Karatantcheva achieved the feat at the age of 15. Andreeva, who has only dropped one set so far, faces a daunting task as she is up against World No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka. The latter’s dominant run continued with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Emma Navarro. “When the sun is out, I play with a lot more happiness,” said Sabalenka, who has yet to drop a set this year. She certainly showed some joy after her fourth-round win over the 22nd-seeded Navarro, displaying disco-inspired dance moves on her way off the court.

No. 3 seed Gauff came back to defeat Ons Jabeur 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 to reach the semifinals at a third consecutive Grand Slam tournament. No. 1 Swiatek followed in Court Philippe Chatrier with a 6-0, 6-2 victory against Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova to stretch her Roland Garros winning streak to 19 matches as she seeks a third trophy in a row in Paris and fourth in five years. Gauff won her first major title at the U.S. Open in September, then made it to the final four at the Australian Open in January. The 20-year-old American was the runner-up to Swiatek at the French Open in 2022. Overall, Swiatek has won 10 of 11 meetings against Gauff, including a 6-4, 6-3 semifinal win on clay last month en route to the Italian Open title. Other than a tough, tight three-set triumph over four-time major champion Naomi Osaka in the second round last week, Swiatek has been at her dominant best in this French Open, showing why she has led the WTA rankings nearly every week since April 2022 and is a popular pick to leave with another title. Take away the 17 games Osaka managed, and Swiatek has dropped a total of only 11 games in her other four matches so far. Swiatek followed up her 6-0, 6-0 shutout of Anastasia Potapova in the fourth round by grabbing the initial seven games against Vondrousova. And make no mistake: Vondrousova is no slouch. In addition to being a Grand Slam champion, she was a finalist at Roland Garros in 2019, won a silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics and is currently ranked No. 6. But she never stood a chance against Swiatek, who compiled 25 winners to just 10 unforced errors. Swiatek, a 23-year-old from Poland, faced just one break point — and, naturally, she saved it. Jabeur's mix of speeds and spins gave Gauff fits at times. And as well-known as Gauff is for her ability to cover the court and play defense, Jabeur managed to keep coming up with winners, finishing with 30 in all. “She was playing really well the whole match. She was hitting a lot of winners on me, which is something I’m not used to against anybody,” Gauff said. “So today I was just trying to just be aggressive toward the end.” Gauff pulled away to a 5-2 lead in the last set, then needed a trio of match points to close things out, acknowledging afterward that maybe she grew a little tight down the stretch. The last game was key, with Gauff needing to save a break point, then Jabeur dismissing one match point with a disguised drop shot that earned a roar from the stands that the 29-year-old Tunisian responded to by putting her right index finger to her ear. But on Gauff's next opportunity to seal the victory, Jabeur badly flubbed an overhead. Gauff smiled, then raised her arms and yelled. With the crowd at the main stadium loudly supporting Jabeur at times, Gauff did not play badly in the opening set. But No. 8 seed Jabeur — a three-time major finalist — was superb, winning 17 of 18 first-serve points, never facing a single break point and accumulating a 12-5 edge in total winners. When she delivered an ace at 114 mph (184 kph) to end the set, Jabeur nodded repeatedly. “She’s a tough opponent and she’s well-loved on tour. I could tell by the crowd today — I know you guys wanted her to win. Honestly, whenever she’s not playing (me), I cheer for her, too,” Gauff said. “Even though you guys were for Ons, I really had a lot of fun, even when I lost the first set and they were chanting when I was in the bathroom,\" Gauff said about her trip off the court after the first set. \"I was like, ‘This is just really fun, win or lose.’ It is.” Gauff got going after that, raising her level and trying to gain the upper hand during lengthier exchanges. She put in 16 winners over the last two sets, while breaking serve four times. “I know I have a lot of love here in Paris. Trust me, I know,\" said Gauff, who won the French Open junior title at age 14. \"So I really appreciate it, and hopefully you guys can help me make it through the next round.” tennis BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

There was no drama on the women's side as holder Iga Swiatek continued her quest for a fourth Roland Garros trophy by hitting top gear during a 6-0 6-2 victory over 2019 runner-up Marketa Vondrousova to also reach the semifinals. American third seed Coco Gauff earlier fought back to beat fan-favourite Ons Jabeur 4-6 6-2 6-3 and will take on Swiatek in a tantalising rematch of their 2022 final, which the Pole won. Roland Garros was rocked towards the end of Sinner's routine win as organisers announced that Djokovic had withdrawn from his 2023 final rematch with seventh seed Casper Ruud in the last-eight on June 5. It meant that Sinner, who ended Djokovic's quest for an 11th Australian Open title en route to his first Grand Slam trophy in January, will also take his top ranking next Monday and become the first Italian to do so. Djokovic needed a superhuman effort and five sets to subdue Argentine Francisco Cerundolo on Monday after being dragged the distance for a second straight contest and the Serb aggravated the injury he had been carrying by slipping on court. The French Open said MRI results revealed that Djokovic, who played on with pain-killers, had suffered a torn medial meniscus that prompted him to take the decision. It was the latest in a series of unfortunate events for the 37-year-old, who won three out of the four majors last year but has looked off the pace this season, with defeats and an injury threatening his bid for Wimbledon and Paris Olympics glory. Even as Djokovic arrived at Roland Garros to clean out his locker, Sinner was easing to a 6-2 6-4 7-6(3) win over Dimitrov and the 22-year-old said he had achieved a lifelong dream, even if it was not the way he expected to. \"What can I say? First of all it's every player's dream to be number one. On the other hand, seeing Novak retiring here is, for everyone, disappointing. I wish him a quick recovery,\" Sinner said. The Australian Open champion could face a potentially tricky test against two-times Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz or former Roland Garros runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas who face off later. tennis BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Hampered by illness throughout her match, Sabalenka crashed to a 6-7(5) 6-4 6-4 defeat to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva as the Australian Open champion's 11-match Grand Slam winning streak ground to a halt on Court Philippe Chatrier. The 26-year-old barely looked like she could continue but soldiered on as fans on the main showcourt got behind her. Andreeva took full advantage and reached her maiden major semi-final, becoming the youngest in the last four at a Grand Slam since Martina Hingis in 1997 and setting up a clash with Rybakina's conqueror Jasmine Paolini. Andreeva's refreshingly fearless strokeplay has caught the eye at Roland Garros and she paid tribute to her coach Conchita Martinez, although she admitted that it was hard to keep track of all her instructions. \"I would say that I always play the way I want to play. We have a plan with my coach for the match, but afterwards I forget everything,\" Andreeva told reporters. \"When I play a match, I don't have any thoughts in my head. So maybe I would say that my strength could be that I just play how I want to play and I do whatever I want to do. Maybe this helps me when I play.\" She admitted to feeling some nerves but her confidence only grew as the match wore on. \"In the beginning I didn't really believe it, because she's very experienced. She has two Grand Slams in her pocket. She's a great player, very aggressive,\" Andreeva said. \"So, it was like, 'we'll see what will happen, but I'm not sure if I can do it, but I will just try to enjoy the atmosphere and try to play the best way I can'.\" Sabalenka said she had been struggling with a stomach bug for a few days, which ended her bid to become the first woman since Serena Williams in 2015 to win the Australian Open and Roland Garros in the same season. \"I had a difficult time out there physically. I did my best to try and manage it,\" Sabalenka said. \"I always do my best to fight to the end. I had to keep trying and hope I could find a way and feel a bit better.\" The precocious Andreeva's opponent in the next round could have been Rybakina but the Russian-born Kazakh failed to find a way past Italy's Paolini, who battled hard to secure a 6-2 4-6 6-4 win. \"I started to play better with more consistency last year and in the middle July,\" Dubai champion Paolini said. \"Match by match I felt more convinced that I can play at the higher level. But it was a process. It's not like I switch on something. \"Now, I step on court and I say to myself I have a chance to win the match. Before, when I was playing against top players, I was like 'okay, I need a miracle to win this match'. \"So I was already losing the match before even playing.\" Paolini said she expected a big challenge against Andreeva. \"I played against her in Madrid, and she's really great player, I think. She's so young but she's so, so good mentally, and she can defend very well. She can serve well,\" she added. \"It's going to be a tough match, but we're in the semi-final so there is no chance to get easy matches.\" Paolini's compatriot Jannik Sinner had ensured that he would become the world number one for the first time next Monday after defending champion Novak Djokovic pulled out of the tournament with a knee injury. Reports in the French and Serbian media said the 37-year-old Djokovic had surgery in Paris but there was no confirmation from the player, whose hopes of playing in Wimbledon and at the Paris Olympics could be affected by the injury. With Djokovic's withdrawal sending seventh seed Casper Ruud through to the semi-finals, fourth-seed Zverev joined him with a 6-4 7-6(5) 6-4 win over 11th seed Alex de Minaur. tennis BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Paolini is through to her first Grand Slam final at the age of 28. She had never gone beyond the second round of a major before the start of this year. The world number 15 had won a total of four matches in 16 Grand Slam appearances before advancing to the fourth round of the Australian Open in January. Now she is one win away from an improbable title at Roland Garros as she tries to emulate compatriot Francesca Schiavone, who won the 2010 French Open. Paolini is also guaranteed to break into the top 10 for the first time. “I learned I think a little bit later than other players, to dream is the most important thing in sport and in life,” said Paolini. “I’m happy I could dream this moment. I don’t know what to say, I’m so emotional.” Andreeva had become the youngest Grand Slam semifinalist in 27 years with a shock victory over second seed Aryna Sabalenka in the last eight. But her bid to be crowned the youngest major champion since Martina Hingis at the 1997 US Open was cut short as Andreeva was unable to reproduce the level that saw her put out an ailing Sabalenka. Paolini snatched the only break of a tight opening set in the fourth game, saving five break chances across her next two service games to keep Andreeva at arm’s length. The errors continued to pile up for Andreeva and Paolini seized her opportunity once more when it arose at 1-1 in the second set, before breaking for a second time to stride towards the finish line. With Andreeva looking increasingly disconsolate and fighting back tears, Paolini applied the coup de grace with one last break to complete a resounding victory. Earlier, Iga Swiatek continued her bid for a fourth French Open title with a dominant victory over Coco Gauff to reach another final at Roland Garros. The world number one is just one match away from becoming the first woman to win the tournament in three straight years since Justine Henin in 2007 after a 6-2, 6-4 victory. “It was intense, in the second set, it was kind of tight because we were breaking each other, but I’m glad I was consistent in my tactics and just went for it in the end,” she said. Swiatek saved a match point against Naomi Osaka in the second round last week but has barely broken sweat since, losing just 14 games across the next four rounds. “Something changed, I just adjusted better to the court and it’s not easy to play the first matches at a Grand Slam because the atmosphere is much different to other tournaments,” she added. “And against Noami it was difficult to get into it because she just went for it... I’ve improved my feel and gained confidence.” The Pole’s career win-loss record at Roland Garros now stands at a staggering 34-2, while she is on a 20-match winning streak at the event. The 23-year-old has won all four of her previous Grand Slam finals and will bid to extend that run against either 17-year-old sensation Mirra Andreeva or Jasmine Paolini on Saturday. Russian Andreeva and Italian 12th seed Paolini meet in the other semi-final later Thursday. Swiatek hit only 10 winners in an unspectacular display by her high standards, but US Open champion Gauff made 39 unforced errors and was left holding back tears following an argument with the chair umpire. Top seed Swiatek could become only the fourth woman to win four Roland Garros titles in the Open era -- after Henin, Chris Evert and Steffi Graf. She is also on track to join Serena Williams as the only women to complete the treble of French, Madrid and Rome Open titles in the same year. Gauff, who will rise to world number two next week, has now lost 11 of her 12 matches against Swiatek, all in straight sets. That includes three successive defeats at Roland Garros, after last year’s quarter-finals and the 2022 final. Swiatek, who had three bagel sets across her previous two matches, quickly struck first blood with a break in the opening game. Gauff had plenty of chances, but was erratic from the baseline, missing both break points she created and hitting 18 unforced errors to effectively hand Swiatek the first set. The youngster found some consistency early in the second set, moving 2-1 ahead on serve. Gauff then became embroiled in a heated exchange with the chair umpire over the timing of a line call, exclaiming “it’s a Grand Slam semi-final, know the rules of the game”, while almost moved to tears. That perceived injustice helped the American briefly raise her game, snatching her first break of the match after a long rally to lead 3-1, only to be pegged back immediately. There was only going to be one outcome from then on as Swiatek reeled off four games in a row to take complete control. Gauff dug deep, saving two match points to force Swiatek to serve it out. Swiatek sealed a place in her fourth French Open final in five years on her fourth match point as another wild Gauff forehand flew well off target. tennis BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Spain's Alcaraz owns two Grand Slam titles and spent time at No. 1 in the rankings. Italy's Sinner won the Australian Open in January and will ascend to No. 1 next week. This will be their ninth meeting; the series is tied at 4-all. “No one has ever played like Alcaraz. No chance. And Sinner? The same thing,\" said Mats Wilander, who was ranked No. 1 and won three of his seven Grand Slam titles at Roland Garros in the 1980s. \"They’re like, ‘Whoa! What and where did they come from?’” The other men's semifinal Friday is Norway's Casper Ruud, twice the runner-up in Paris — to Rafael Nadal in 2022 and to Novak Djokovic in 2023 — against Germany's Alexander Zverev, a finalist at the 2020 U.S. Open, an Olympic gold medalist and into the final four at Roland Garros for the fourth consecutive year. Zverev is involved in an ongoing court case in Berlin connected to his former partner’s accusation he caused her bodily harm. No. 4 Zverev vs. No. 7 Ruud is not a bad matchup as far as tennis goes. But it's No. 2 Sinner vs. No. 3 Alcaraz that is capturing all of the buzz. That's because they are widely considered the likely next two greats of the game and because of how exciting some of their past contests have been, most notably Alcaraz's victory in the U.S. Open quarterfinals two years ago that ended at 2:50 a.m. after five sets of thrill-a-minute, back-and-forth action. “I hope he and I keep playing each other for the next 10 years,” said Alcaraz, who went on to win the championship in New York that year and also triumphed at Wimbledon last year. “He makes me a better player. He makes me wake up in the morning and try to improve.” Alcaraz arrived in Paris with some concerns about his right forearm. Sinner came in nursing a hip injury. Those issues kept them out of the clay-court Italian Open last month, but they have looked just fine at the French Open: Each has dropped just one set through five matches. They seem to bring out the best in one another while forging a new path in their sport. Both can cover the court as well as anyone, the 6-foot-2 (1.88-meter) Sinner with his instincts and lanky limbs and the 6-foot (1.83-meter) Alcaraz with his “How did he possibly get to that?” fleetness and reflexes. Both are capable of hammering the ball, eliciting gasps from spectators. Both are all-court players with admirable variety (Alcaraz's drop shots, for example, might just be the best in men's tennis). Both elicit heaps of praise from opponents. Alcaraz was asked what it's like to face Sinner. “Well, you have to run like it is a marathon, side-to-side. I think he has nothing bad. Everything he does, he does it perfectly. The way that he hits the ball is unbelievable. The way he moves — really, really well. He pushes you to the limit on every ball, on every point. I think it is the hardest thing to face Jannik,” Alcaraz said. “At the same time, I love that,\" he continued. \"I love these kind of matches. I love this kind of challenge. ... I love to find solutions, to find a way to beat him.” Alcaraz won their most recent encounter, in a semifinal on a hard court at Indian Wells, California, in March on the way to the title there. That ended a 19-match winning streak for Sinner. “He showed already so many things that, for sure, you are always impressed when you play against him,” Sinner said. And like Alcaraz, Sinner relishes how even their on-court history has been so far. “This makes things really fun, no?\" Sinner said after that loss at Indian Wells. \"Maybe there (will be a) day where one of us wins three, four times in a row. Then (one) or the other ... has to try to adjust a little bit, trying completely new things.” tennis / sport / sports event BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Third seed Alcaraz was far from his usually brilliant self early in his contest but took full advantage of Australian Open champion Sinner's hand cramps to draw level, before sealing the see-sawing match in a decider after a little over four hours. Having already captured a Wimbledon and U.S. Open trophy at the age of 21, Spaniard Alcaraz became the youngest man to reach Grand Slam finals on all three of the sport's surfaces and will look to emulate several compatriots by winning Roland Garros. \"I have a special feeling for this tournament, because I remember when I finished school I'm running to my home just to put the TV on and watch the matches here in the French Open,\" Alcaraz told reporters. \"Of course, Rafa Nadal dominated this tournament for 14-15 years. It's unbelievable. I wanted to put my name on that list of the Spanish players who won this tournament... (Juan Carlos) Ferrero, (Carlos) Moya, (Albert) Costa, legends of our sport. \"If I want to be one of the best players in the world, I have to be a good player in every surface, like Roger (Federer) did, Novak (Djokovic), Rafa, (Andy) Murray. The best players have had success on every surface.\" Fourth seed Zverev, competing in his fourth straight semi-final in Paris, finally broke the barrier to become the second German man to reach the Roland Garros title clash in the Open Era and match Michael Stich's feat from 1996. He also banished painful memories of a serious ankle injury in the 2022 semi-final against Nadal, while coming through tough matches this year. \"To go deep and to win a Grand Slam, you have to go through difficulties and you have to go through a lot of ups and downs,\" said Zverev, who won the match after Ruud was hampered by a stomach issue. \"You're not going to win a Grand Slam by winning every match in straight three sets. Some players do, like Roger, Rafa a few times, but normally to win a Grand Slam you have to go through battles. You have to come back in tough five-set matches. \"You have to come back from difficult moments... I'm happy to be in a Grand Slam final and give myself the best chance to win on Sunday.\" Zverev's win came on a day he agreed a settlement after the mother of his child accused him of physical abuse and a German court closed the case. Ruud rued the fact that his stomach issue had derailed him in what promised to be thrilling clash. \"It's not something I think is very serious or going to last for a long time, but something that came up in the first set...,\" he said. \"Then the last three went quick because Zverev played well, but I wasn't able to play the kind of tennis I like to play with intensity, because I was limited with my stomach.\" Defeat by Alcaraz was a blow for Sinner, who will rise to number one in the world for the first time on Monday but the 22-year-old looked forward to continuing their rivalry although it is not yet at the level of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic. \"Well, you cannot compare us yet with the other players we had or still have,\" said Sinner, who trails Alcaraz 4-5 after their latest meeting. \"If we see the results... when we play against (each other), it's in the semis or final or quarters. Very important matches. \"I think that's exciting for the game, especially when the head-to-head is quite close. The winner is happy and the loser tries to find a way to beat him the next time. \"That's exciting. That's what I'll try to do.\" (Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Paris Editing by Christian Radnedge) tennis BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The 22-time Grand Slam champion said Thursday he wants to just remain on clay, rather than switching over to grass for the All England Club and then needing to go back to clay. “We believe that the best for my body is not to change surface,” Nadal said in a statement. The Summer Games will hold the tennis competition at Roland Garros starting on July 27. That is the site of the French Open, where Nadal has won a record 14 titles. Nadal will play doubles — with Carlos Alcaraz — and singles at the OIympics.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 14, 2024 11:30 pm IST Beginning to bloom: Jasmine Paolini is enjoying the best year of her career. She reached the fourth round at the Australian Open, won her biggest title to date in Dubai and made both the singles’ and doubles’ finals at Roland-Garros. | Photo credit: Getty Images Jasmine Paolini had 12 days to remember and a weekend to forget, as she savoured a bittersweet fantasy in Paris, often finding her best tennis on Roland Garros’ famous clay. The 28-year-old Italian was powerless against an imperious Iga Swiatek in the women’s final last Saturday. Paolini had few chances, as the World No. 1 needed just 68 minutes to capture her third successive French crown, her fourth in five years, with a 6-2, 6-1 victory. Paolini stepped onto the Parisian red dirt again on Sunday, this time partnering compatriot Sara Errani in the women’s doubles final. She was unable to find any comfort after Saturday’s crushing loss, as the Italian pair lost 7-6(5), 6-3 to doubles expert Katerina Siniakova and reigning US Open singles’ champion Coco Gauff. Although the fortnight ended in disappointment for Paolini, she knew she had entered uncharted waters. This time last year, she was playing a WTA 125 event, below the top tier, in Croatia, some distance away from the ranks of elite tennis. After her Roland-Garros showing, she has climbed seven spots to enter the top 10 for the first time in her career, peaking at World No. 7. “It’s been two very intense weeks for me, very nice but very emotional,” said Paolini. “It’s a strange feeling. I just lost the final, but I think I have to be happy with the two weeks and my new ranking. A Grand Slam final… it’s beautiful. I have a lot of memories. I can’t wait to be back.” Paolini is enjoying by far the best year of her career. She came into 2024 with a losing record as a pro of 78-87 and one career title. She had won a total of four matches in 16 Grand Slam appearances, never having gone beyond the second round at any Major. But she is 22-11 this year with one trophy — her biggest title to date in Dubai, one of the tournaments just below Grand Slam level. She reached the fourth round at the Australian Open in January, and proved that wasn’t a one-off with her surging run to the final in Paris. Paolini’s astonishing transformation this season into a player capable of challenging for the biggest prizes has stemmed in part from quashing the mindset that she needed “a miracle” to beat the best. She began to believe that her ability was enough, and the results came. “I think I started to play better with more consistency last year,” said Paolini. “I think match by match I felt more convinced that I can play at the higher level but it was a process. [It wasn’t] like I switch[ed] something. The problem, I think, let’s say ‘problem’, [was] that I wasn’t believing that I could reach the result that I’m reaching now when I was younger. Before, when I was playing against top players, I was like ‘okay, I need a miracle to win this match’.” Thanks to her strengthening belief, Paolini registered confidence-boosting wins over No. 4 Elena Rybakina, No. 10 Caroline Garcia and No. 11 Daria Kasatkina last year. This year, she beat No. 4 Ons Jabeur. At Roland Garros, she defeated Rybakina again and also recorded impressive wins over 2019 US Open winner Bianca Andreescu and 17-year-old sensation Mirra Andreeva, who is more than a decade younger than Paolini. No quit in her: Paolini’s ability to get to nearly every ball and come out ahead in baseline exchanges makes her a frustrating player to encounter. | Photo credit: Getty Images Paolini certainly has the game to trouble anybody — barring Swiatek at her best — because her style naturally asks questions of her opponents. Her ability to get to nearly every ball — she has terrific foot-speed — and come out ahead in baseline exchanges makes her a frustrating player to encounter. She hits a heavy forehand and can flatten her backhand with a compact stroke. The only real soft spot is the serve, which doesn’t win her points outright. “I wish I was taller, because I could serve better,” said the 5’4” Paolini. “But I think, you know, I accept that I have to do [it] with my own body. I mean, I’m short. Okay, we try to [not] make it a problem. We try to do something different to improve other aspects.” Given the quality of Paolini’s game and the advantages of her style, observers often wondered why she was not making more of a mark on the circuit. “Often, I heard, ‘You play well’ and ‘You could do more’. But I never really believed it deep down, which is something that has changed lately,” she said. “The on-court results are tangible, more concrete, to me than someone telling me, ‘You can do great things’. It helps to win more matches — or even lose ones that were hard-fought against strong opponents.” Paolini, who was born in Italy but also has roots in Poland and Ghana, is something of a late bloomer. It isn’t, however, her game that has taken time to bloom but her imagination. “I learned, I think a little bit later than other players, to dream is the most important thing in sport and in life,” she said. “When I started to play tennis, I was just enjoying. I was not dreaming too much. I was dreaming to become a professional, and I never dreamed to be, you know, number one, Grand Slam champion. Never dreamed so big. Top ground game: Paolini can flatten her backhand with a compact stroke, which complements her heavy forehand. | Photo credit: Getty Images “That, I think, is not so positive, because it’s important to dream, but I started to dream, I think, step by step. Not, you know, too far away.” Paolini was shocked to realise that other players did have those dreams and goals from a young age. “For me, it’s surprising to see interviews from Nole [Novak Djokovic] when he was a kid saying that he wanted to be world number one, and [win] Wimbledon. I watched this, and I said, it’s unbelievable that you can dream as a child. I didn’t dream it, you know, when I was a child. It’s unbelievable to see Jannik [Sinner] when he was 15 years old say that his dream was to be number one, and for me it’s something different. I never dreamed to be in a Grand Slam final.” So, what’s next for Paolini, now that her vision for herself has expanded? She doesn’t need to look too far for inspiration — the three games she won in the Roland-Garros final were the fewest since Justine Henin obliterated Ana Ivanovic 6-1, 6-2 in 2007, but Ivanovic returned to Paris the next year to win her only Major crown. Can Paolini dream of something like that? “I don’t know where this journey is going to take me. But I’m curious to discover,” she said. “I don’t know which one is my next dream. But I’m enjoying the moment.” BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences. They cannot be abusive or personal.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 15, 2024 07:07 pm IST - WIMBLEDON Wimbledon's total prize money fund will rise to a record 50 million pounds (about $64 million), with the singles champions each earning 2.7 million pounds ($3.45 million), All England Club officials announced at the annual spring briefing. The total amount is 5.3 million pounds ($6.8 million) more than last year, an increase of 11.9% — and exactly twice the 25 million pounds ($32 million at the current exchange rate) handed out to competitors at the grass-court Grand Slam tournament 10 years ago. Ticket demand “has never been greater” than it was this year, said Deborah Jevans, the new chair of the All England Club. The winners’ checks for 2024 represent a jump of 350,000 pounds each (nearly $450,000), a 14.9% jump. Players who lose in the first round of singles will get 60,000 pounds (about $76,000) each, up from 55,000 ($70,000) in 2023. The prizes for the qualifying event will go up 14.9% to 4.8 million pounds (about $6 million). Other topics addressed by Jevans and Sally Bolton, the club chief executive: — The club has been in contact with other Grand Slam hosts about the possibility of creating a domestic violence policy. “Clearly that’s something that the sport would want to do on a unified basis,” Bolton said about forming a policy. “It is something that is pertinent and therefore has been discussed.” At the just-concluded French Open, Alexander Zverev competed — and ended up reaching the final — while being involved in a trial in Berlin related to accusations by a former girlfriend of physical abuse during a 2020 argument; the case ended via an out-of-court settlement hours before Zverev played in the semifinals in Paris. — The club has plans in place to celebrate two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray's career if, as expected, he announces this will be his last appearance at the tournament. Murray's 2013 singles title was the first for a British man at the All England Club in 77 years, and he won the tournament again in 2016. “We've certainly got plans in place and we’re ready and prepared, but ultimately it's Andy’s decision,\" Bolton said. \"We’ll very much be led by him and we can amend our plans accordingly. We’re ready in any eventuality.” — Centre Court will continue to begin play at 1:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. EDT), despite concerns expressed by Novak Djokovic that such scheduling inevitably leads to late starts for a day's last match. “We’ve reviewed it, we’ve thought long and hard and looked at the data around length of matches and the trends that are occurring in that space,\" Bolton said, “and were very confident and happy with the decision that we’ve made this year.” Added Jevans: “We’re very comfortable with the situation.” Djokovic, who has won seven of his 24 Grand Slam titles at Wimbledon but is expected to miss this year's tournament after knee surgery, said a year ago that maybe the All England Club should consider opening its main stadium at noon (Court No. 1 starts play at 1 p.m.; smaller courts at 11 a.m.). Because the tournament site is in a residential area, there is an 11 p.m. curfew for competition. tennis BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The 21-year-old battled cramps to recover from 2-1 down in sets and win a gripping contest 6-3, 2-6, 5-7, 6-1, 6-2 after four hours and 19 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier. Alcaraz adds the Roland Garros crown to the Wimbledon title he won against Novak Djokovic last year and the 2022 U.S. Open. He will head to the Australian Open next year with the chance to become the youngest man to complete the career Grand Slam. Fourth seed Zverev, who settled a court case in Germany two days ago over domestic abuse allegations, is still waiting for a maiden major title. He had also lost his only previous Slam final in five sets, when he blew a two-set lead against Dominic Thiem at the 2020 US Open. Zverev had high hopes of finally getting over the line— he has also lost six Slam semi-finals— but Alcaraz was too strong in the key moments as he levelled their head-to-head record at 5-5. Alcaraz said before the final he wanted to join the list of men's players from his country, including his idol Rafael Nadal, to win the Roland Garros title, and he celebrated becoming the eighth Spanish champion by falling to the clay with his head in his hands in disbelief. Zverev endured a miserable start, double-faulting on the first two points of the match en route to being broken in the opening game. But Alcaraz was not immune to the nerves of a maiden French Open final, framing a regulation forehand into the stands and then also double-faulting as he gifted the break straight back. The Spaniard did not take too long to find his groove, though, breaking to love in the fifth game on his way to pocketing the opener. The youngster had to save three break points to hold in a 10-minute first game of the second set, but slipped 3-2 behind when he failed to stave off two more break points as another forehand sailed into the crowd. Suddenly Zverev had a spring in his step and Alcaraz was reduced to scrambling at the back of the court, falling a double-break down with a double-fault. Zverev wrapped up an ultimately one-sided second set with a hold to love. The German made it three successive love holds with two more early in the third set, before Alcaraz celebrated coming out of a tricky service game unscathed with a fist pump as he edged 3-2 ahead, despite having been largely on the back foot. Serving into an increasingly strong breeze, Zverev was caught out by an Alcaraz return that crept over the net and the Spaniard went on to grab a break to love. But he could not serve out the set as a rasping Zverev passing shot secured a break back. That failure to take control of the match seemed to temporarily break Alcaraz's spirit, as he ended up losing five games on the spin to concede the set. Alcaraz would not go down without a fight, though, breaking for a 2-0 advantage in the fourth with a magnificent curling winner on the run. Just seconds before, Zverev had been angrily disputing a line call which was clearly correct, drawing jeers from the crowd. The German was rattled and his serve started to desert him, with Alcaraz racing through the fourth set to force a decider despite having to take a medical time-out to have treatment for apparent cramp at 4-1. Zverev had won 10 of his previous 11 five-setters at Roland Garros but handed Alcaraz a break on a platter in the third game of the fifth. Alcaraz stuttered himself, falling 0-40 down in the next game. He appeared to have double-faulted on the second break point, but the chair umpire overruled the line judge's call of out, despite Zverev's angry protests, before Hawkeye replays showed it was out. Alcaraz went on to hold and it proved to be a pivotal moment in the match. Zverev fell a double-break down in game seven as Alcaraz delighted the fans with an outrageous flicked winner before crushing a forehand onto the line. He wrapped up a historic victory with a booming forehand that Zverev could not get back. tennis BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

After attaining 77th place in ATP rankings, Sumit Nagal set to represent the country in the Paris Olympics men’s singles draw. | Photo Credit: Reuters India's Sumit Nagal climbed 18 places to 77th in the latest ATP rankings issued on June 10, all but sealing a spot in the Paris Olympics men's singles draw. Nagal has 713 ATP points. The improvement in his rankings was due to Nagal bagging the men's singles crown at the Heilbronn Neckarcup 2024 Challenger event in Germany on Sunday, beating Switzerland's Alexander Ritschard in a three-set thriller. The Indian won 6-1 6(5)-7 6-3 in the final that lasted two hours and 22 minutes. Rankings, as on June 10, will be the basis for deciding entries for the Games. As per the established criteria, the top 56 players, both in men's and women's rankings, will attain automatic qualification for the Olympics but no more than four per country can make the cut for the Games, a rule which allows lower ranked players to sneak into the draw. Nagal looks good to secure the last available ranking-enabled spot in the draw. The last time India had a player in the Olympics main draw was the 2012 Games when Somdev Devvarman made it thanks to a wildcard. \"Elated to win the title in Heilbronn this week. It was an important week for me, and I'm proud to have produced my best tennis when it mattered the most,\" Nagal posted on X after his final win. \"If I win a match like this, I can be proud because the fight was insane. Ranking is secondary, first goal is to play good tennis,\" he said at the end of his match. The 26-year-old Nagal would be the sole Indian in the men's singles event in Paris. This was the sixth ATP Challenger title for Nagal and the second of the year after the Chennai Open crown on home soil earlier this year. Nagal, who is currently the best-ranked Indian singles player, has won four ATP Challenger titles since 2023 and the win in Heilbronn was his fourth title on clay tennis courts. tennis / Olympics BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The 22-year-old Sinner is the first player from Italy to reach No. 1 since the computerized rankings began in 1973. He will be the top-seeded man at Wimbledon, where play begins July 1. Sinner is 33-3 this season with three titles, including earning his first Grand Slam trophy at the Australian Open in January, part of a 19-0 run to begin 2024. Two of those three losses were against Carlos Alcaraz. One came Friday in five sets in the semifinals at the French Open, which Alcaraz went on to win by beating Alexander Zverev in the final on Sunday. Alcaraz's third major title allowed him to rise one place in the rankings to No. 2, with Djokovic at No. 3, and Zverev remaining at No. 4. Djokovic was the defending champion in Paris and needed to get back to the final in order to stay at No. 1 because of his lack of play this year and failure to reach the title match at any tournament so far. He tore the meniscus in his right knee during a fourth-round victory over Francisco Cerundolo at Roland Garros last week, withdrew before the quarterfinals and had surgery. Iga Swiatek’s third consecutive championship at Roland Garros — her fourth there in five years and fifth major title overall — allowed her to increase what already was a large lead at No. 1 in the WTA rankings. Swiatek already was so far ahead of everyone else heading into the French Open that she would have held onto the top spot even if she had lost in the first round. Coco Gauff climbed to a career-high No. 2 from No. 3. The 20-year-old American, last year's U.S. Open champion, reached the French Open singles semifinals before losing to Swiatek and won her first Grand Slam doubles title with Katerina Siniakova. Two-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka swapped places with Gauff and is No. 3 on Monday, followed by 2022 Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina. Jasmine Paolini, a 28-year-old Italian who lost to Swiatek on Saturday in her first major final, jumped to a career-best No. 7 ranking, marking her first time in the WTA's top 10. Paolini was No. 15 before the French Open. tennis BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences. They cannot be abusive or personal.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 22, 2024 01:53 am IST - Mumbai: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on June 21 chargesheeted five accused, including two foreign nationals, in an alleged international human trafficking and cyber fraud syndicates operating within and outside the country. The accused, Jerry Jacob and Godfrey Alvares, are under arrest, while three others, Sunny Gonsalves, as well as foreign nationals Niu Niu and Elvis Du, are still absconding, the officials said. The chargesheet filed before NIA Special Court, Mumbai, has exposed the involvement of several foreign nationals in the case, in which the agency is continuing with its investigation. As per the investigation, the accused were targeting Indian youth who were proficient in computer and English, and coercing them into working in fraudulent call centres on tourist visa for pecuniary gains. The victims were being recruited, transported and transferred from India to the Golden Triangle SEZ in Lao PDR via Thailand. Upon arrival, the victims were trained in the use of Facebook, Telegram, basics of Cryptocurrency, and handling of Apps created by the scam company, the agency officials said. “The powerful syndicates also used victim control tactics in case any of the trafficked youth refused to continue with the online fraud work. These tactics included isolation and restriction of movement, confiscation of personal travel documents and physical abuse, arbitrary fines, threat to kill, threat to rape in case of women, threat to arraign in false case of drugs in local police station,” the officials said. The racket was being operated with complete audacity, with the accused even deleting the data of the victims’ mobile phones to destroy evidence. The victims faced threats if they approached the concerned Embassy or local authority. “In some cases, the victims were held in scam compounds, confined without food for 3 to 7 days, and tortured if they refused to work. They were only released after extraction of extortion payments, ranging from ₹30,000 to ₹1,80,000, or intervention by the Embassy of India in Lao PDR on complaints made by the victims,” the official said, adding that further probe is on to unearth the complete racket and identify the other accused involved. human trafficking / fraud BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Siva Saravanan A day after banning the issuance of Travel Authority 912 (TA-912) authorising loco pilots to cross red signal during signal failures, the Eastern Railway withdrew the circular. “The above letter has been issued erroneously and hence it is withdrawn,” the notice by Senior Divisional Operations Manager (SDOM) said on June 20 (Thursday). The subject of the circular read, “Regarding Issuance of T/A 912”. Earlier, on June 19 an official of Eastern Railway had issued a circular stating that “issuance of TA-912 will remain suspended till further advice”. A senior official of Eastern Railway told The Hindu that the notification banning issuance of TA-912 was issued by a junior official in reaction to the Kanchenjunga Express accident on June 17. The same has been rectified by the circular by SDOM on June 20. Also read | After major accidents, confusion prevails over operation of trains during signal failures The accident involving a goods train and Kanchanjunga Express in West Bengal’s Darjeeling district left 10 persons including three Railway crew members dead and several others injured. Officials of the Northeast Frontier Railway had admitted that the automated signalling system on the route where the accident occurred at 8.55 a.m. was not functioning. The automated signalling system had failed between Rangapani and Chattar Hat railway stations since 5.50 a.m. on June 17 and travel memos to cross the signals in red were issued to both the trains - Kanchanjunga Express and the goods train. An inquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) Janak Kumar Garg into the accident began from June 19 and till late evening on June 20, about 16 persons including various railway personnel assigned in the area where the accident occurred had recorded their statement. It has also come to light during the CRS inquiry that one of the gatemen had informed Rangapani Railway Station about a goods train running on the same track on which Kanchanjunga Express had left a little while ago. While one of the loco pilots of the goods train that hit Kanchanjunga Express, Anil Kumar, died in the accident, assistant loco pilot Manu Kumar was admitted to a hospital in Siliguri with severe injuries. Mr. Manu Kumar told a private television news channel that by the time both the drivers spotted the express train, it was too late to apply brakes. He said that the loco pilot told him to apply brakes and also pulled the lever. According to the assistant loco pilot, the last words of loco pilot Anil Kumar were to “’apply brakes... even if the bogies derail”. The statement of Mr. Manu Kumar, who remains in hospital and can barely mumble a few words, remains crucial to the inquiry into the tragedy. So far the assistant loco pilot of the goods train has not been able to record his statement before the CRS inquiry. Questions have also been raised on why the goods train was travelling at a faster speed when the speed of the train should have been regulated after TA memos were issued to it. There is no certainty as to what the speed of the goods train had been when it met with the accident and it remains subject of the CRS inquiry. railway / indian railways BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

File photo: Special Arrangement The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on June 21 issued notice to authorities in Uttar Pradesh in a case of a village panchayat in Baghpat district that had asked the mother of a sexual assault victim to take a sum of ₹5,000 from her daughter’s tormentors and terminate her pregnancy. The family of the victim, who is a minor, was also threatened at the behest of the harassers. The NHRC said it is painful to note that the village panchayat connived in an unlawful act with the tormentors belonging to a dominant section of society, instead of protecting the girl. In light of the incident, notices have been issued to the Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police (DGP) calling for a detailed report within one week. “The report is expected to include the status of the FIR and action taken against the guilty along with the victim’s health condition and compensation if any, provided to her by the authorities concerned,” the NHRC said. According to reports, the family of the victim had complained to the police stating that a person from the same village had forcibly entered their house and subjected her to rape in December 2023. When the family tried to register the complaint, the mother, brother and sister of the victim were all threatened that they would be killed. Afterwards, the accused took turns to rape the victim five to six times resulting in her pregnancy. When the victim’s family attempted to lodge a police complaint, they were stopped and forced to attend the panchayat, where an offer of ₹5,000 was reportedly given to the family. human rights / Uttar Pradesh BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

It is the first incoming bilateral state visit by a foreign leader after the formation of the new government in India following the Lok Sabha elections. The Bangladesh Prime Minister was received at the airport by the Minister of State in the External Affairs Ministry Kirti Vardhan Singh. Mr. Modi and Ms. Hasina are scheduled to hold wide-ranging talks on Saturday during which both sides are likely to firm up a raft of agreements providing for cooperation in several sectors. Ms. Hasina was among seven top leaders from India's neighbourhood and the Indian Ocean region who attended the swearing-in ceremony of Mr. Modi and the Union Council of Ministers at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on June 9. Apart from holding bilateral consultations with Mr. Modi, the visiting leader is scheduled to call-on President Droupadi Murmu and Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar. The talks between the two Prime Ministers are expected to focus on taking the bilateral ties to new heights, said a source. The overall strategic ties between India and Bangladesh have been on an upswing in the last few years. Bangladesh is an important partner for India under its \"Neighbourhood First\" policy and the cooperation extends to areas of security, trade, commerce, energy, connectivity, science and technology, defence and maritime affairs among others. The achievements in the connectivity sector included the inauguration of the Maitri Setu bridge over river Feni in Tripura and the rollout of the Chilahati-Haldibari rail link. Bangladesh is India's largest development partner with nearly one-fourth of New Delhi's commitment under the Line of Credit has been made to that country. The neighbouring country is India's biggest trade partner in South Asia and India is the second biggest trade partner of Bangladesh in Asia. India is Bangladesh's largest export destination in Asia, with approximately $2 billion of Bangladeshi exports recorded to India in 2022-23. The two countries share 4096.7 km of border — the longest land boundary that India shares with any of its neighbours. There is active cooperation between various agencies of both countries to cooperate on police matters, anti-corruption activities and to combat illicit drug trafficking, fake currency, human trafficking, among others.

Sharing an alleged photo of the ‘mastermind’ with Mr. Choudhary, Mr. Yadav said that the BJP’s motive is to divert the INDIA alliance’s attention from this ‘nationwide mega-scam’. Tejashwi Yadav alleged that Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sinha “wants to bring out the truth about his colleague Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary. | Photo Credit: X/@TejashwiOffice Earlier on Friday, the RJD leader broke his silence on the alleged NEET paper leak case after Mr. Sinha sought to draw a link between Mr. Yadav’s personal secretary and an accused engineer. He said that the BJP wanted to “divert the attention” from the kingpin so they were dragging his name. Also Read | Supreme Court refuses to postpone or stay NEET-UG counselling The RJD leader said, “The INDIA alliance is united on this issue. We want the NEET exam to be immediately cancelled. The (BJP) have all the investigation agencies, they can call the PS or PA anyone for probe. They want to divert the issue from the kingpin. Those who want to drag my name or my PA’s name, this will not benefit anyone. The engineer who is talked about could be a beneficiary but Amit Anand and Nitish Kumar are the masterminds of the paper leak. The people of the country know that whenever BJP comes to power, then paper leaks happen.” Mr. Tejashwi further said that paper leaks have taken place in BJP-ruled States of Bihar, Gujarat and Haryana. “Only Vijay Sinha is making these claims. The Economic Offences Wing (EOU) has never raised any question. When the arrests happened in May since then we have been raising our voices to carry out a probe. The engineer (Sikandar Yadvendu) about whom they are talking was recruited in 2021 by them in the urban development from the water resources department. Why do they want to save Amit Anand and Nitish Kumar? The truth will prevail soon. When paper leaks happened in the third phase of teachers’ recruitment test (TRE) conducted by BPSC the accused got bail without going to prison,” Mr. Yadav said. Bihar Deputy CM Sinha claimed that Mr. Tejashwi’s personal secretary, Pritam Kumar had called a guest house worker of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to book a room for Sikander Kumar Yadavendu, one of the accused in the case. He said that the word “Mantri” was used for the former Deputy CM. “On May 1, Tejashwi Yadav’s personal secretary Pritam Kumar called guesthouse worker Pradip Kumar to book a room for Sikander Kumar Yadavendu who was jailed in Ranchi. On May 4, Pritam Kumar called Pradip Kumar again to book the room in the NHAI guest house. The word ‘Mantri’ was used for Tejashwi Yadav,” Mr. Sinha said at a press conference on Thursday. The Deputy CM also sought clarification from Tejashwi Yadav regarding whether Pritam Kumar is still his Personal Secretary and who is Sikander Yadavendu. “Tejashwi Yadav should clarify if Pritam Kumar is still his PS and he should also clarify who is Sikander Kumar Yadavendu. When Lalu Prasad Yadav was jailed in Ranchi, Sikander Kumar Yadavendu used to be at Lalu’s service. He was a Junior Engineer in the irrigation department. They play with the future of the people. They do scams when they are in power and they try to influence the appointment process,” Mr. Sinha alleged. Notably, Patna police has arrested several people including some candidates who had taken the NEET exam. Out of them, four have been identified as Anurag Yadav, a NEET candidate, his uncle Sikandar Yadavendu, and two others as Nitish Kumar and Anand.

File | Photo Credit: PTI “The Centre’s decision now to implement a law to prevent the use of unfair means in competitive examinations after several “scams” have taken place, including in the NEET-UG and the UGC-NET tests, is “damage control”,” Congress leader Jairam Ramesh claimed on June 22. “This law was needed but it deals with question paper leaks and other irregularities after they have occurred,” he claimed in a post on X. Several Opposition political parties and student associations, including the Congress, have held protests across the country over alleged irregularities in medical entrance exam NEET-UG and the UGC-NET. Amid the raging row over the issue, the Centre on June 21 operationalised the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, that aims to curb malpractices and irregularities in competitive examinations and entails provisions for a maximum jail term of 10 years and a fine of up to ₹1 crore for offenders. “The Bill received the President’s assent on February 13, but was enforced only on Friday, Mr. Ramesh,” the Congress’ general secretary communications, said. \"On February 13, 2024, the President of India gave her assent to the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means), Bill, 2024. Finally, just this morning the nation has been told that this Act has come into force from yesterday, that is June 21, 2024,\" he said. \"Clearly this is damage control to deal with the NEET, UGC-NET, CSIR-UGC-NET and other scams,\" the Congress leader said and added that \"This law was needed. But it deals with leaks after they have occurred.\" \"More important are laws, systems, processes, and procedures to ensure that leaks don't happen in the first place,\" he said. The National Testing Agency, which conducts the competitive exams, on June 21 announced the postponement of the June edition of the Joint Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and University Grants Commission National Eligibility Test, citing unavoidable circumstances and logistic issues. It came two days after the agency cancelled the UGC-NET examinatio n within 24 hours of its conduct saying the integrity of the exam had been compromised, and a massive row on NEET over alleged irregularities, with the issue now before the Supreme Court. education / medical education / test/examination BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

File | Photo Credit: Sushil Kumar Verma As the first session of the 18 th Lok Sabha gets underway on June 24, Congress strategist Jairam Ramesh , who is the party’s Chief Whip in the Rajya Sabha, talks about Opposition’s plans with The Hindu . Edited excerpts: The Congress is upset over Kodikunnil Suresh not being made the pro tem Speaker. How do you see this development. Do you see this as a sign of confrontation? I think it’s a continuation of the bulldozer mentality. I don’t think that the appointment of Kiren Rijiju , whom I know very well and is a good personal friend, inspire confidence that there will be a different way of dealing with Parliament. And the pro tem Speaker issue certainly has given further evidence. By all convention and tradition, Kodikunnil Suresh should have been the pro tem Speaker. There were only two legitimate claimants for this post: Kodikunnil Suresh and the other one is Virendra Kumar. And since Mr. Kumar is a Union Minister, therefore, it should have been Mr. Suresh. I think it is going to be the same bulldozing approach that they have had in the last ten years. But now the Opposition numbers are quite different in this Lok Sabha. One hundred percent. The Opposition is not going to take it lying down. I don’t think that the Congress and the INDIA parties are going to allow this time. It cannot be the standard Modi-Shah [Prime Minister Narendra Modi-Home Minister Amit Shah] way of dealing with Parliament and bulldozer tactics. The NDA and the INDIA group are almost evenly matched. We have the numbers and we know that the 2024 mandate has been a personal, political and moral defeat of a non-biological PM. That is the political reality. This almost sounds like a threat, as if saying “we will not allow the House to function if you don’t agree to our demands”. No, no. We have to be heard, Bills have to be debated and sent to the standing committees for further deliberations and so on. You cannot push through like the three criminal justice bills suspending 145 MPs from both Houses. Take the case of relocating the statues of [Mahatma] Gandhi ji and Dr. [Bhim Rao] Ambedkar. There Is a committee on statues and portraits, which was not even constituted in the 17th Lok Sabha. All the statues, without any consultation, have been relocated and given some grandiose name called Prerna Stala. These are all signals that the bulldozing tactics, my way or Mr. Modi’s highway approach and not Nitin Gadkari’s [laughs]. If they want to persist with it, well they are now going to be met with a counter bulldozer. What are your main issues for this special session of Parliament? This is a short session as the first two days will be oath taking, the third day will be Speaker’s election and the fourth day will be the President’s Address. But there are very urgent issues. The whole issue of NEET [National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test] is a very urgent issue . On July 1, the three laws that were enacted in the previous session of Parliament to replace the Indian Penal Code, the Indian Evidence Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure, come into effect. These were controversial and opposed tooth and nail, but they were passed when 145 MPs had been suspended from both Houses of Parliament . These three draconian laws were passed in a most undemocratic and brazen manner. Would the INDIA bloc consider putting up a candidate to contest the Speaker’s election if the government doesn’t offer the deputy Speaker’s position to the Opposition? These are issues on which ball-by-ball commentaries cannot be given. What happens will be subject to discussion, negotiations amongst the INDIA group leaders. Mr. [Congress President Mallikarjun] Kharge, who has generally been coordinating the meeting of leaders and floor leaders, will be meeting from the June 24 onwards. We had the last five years, the 17th Lok Sabha was the only Lok Sabha in history to function without a deputy Speaker. In the 15th Lok Sabha [under Congress-led UPA II], Karia Munda, who was from the BJP, held the post. Even in the 16th Lok Sabha, there was a deputy Speaker. All I will say is that the BJP and Mr. Modi seems to be in a mood to continue with his bulldozer tactics. This only strengthens our resolve and our determination to confront him far more forcibly in this time than we did in the 16th and 17th Lok Sabha. What about the Leader of the Opposition’s (LoP) post in the Lok Sabha? There is still no clarity if Rahul Gandhi will take up this role? There’s no constitutional requirement to announce the LOP immediately. The Congress Working Committee (CWC) met and requested Mr. Rahul Gandhi to take over the position of the Leader of the Opposition. He is mindful of the sentiments of the members of the CWC. So, I think a decision on this will be taken by him very soon. But usually the convention is that the LoP opens the debate on the Motion of Thanks to President’s Address. I think in the next couple of days, it should get decided. But the sentiment of the Congress MPs is very clear. The sentiment of the INDIA parties is also very clear, if you see the warmth and the way they greeted Mr. Gandhi on his 54th birthday on the 19th June. So, yeah the party MPs, the leaders have all expressed their views. And I am sure Mr. Gandhi is weighing all these factors and will take a decision soon.

As a separate discussion on the subject may not be possible in the short session of Parliament that will conclude on July 3, the party is likely to work out a joint strategy with INDIA partners to raise it during the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address to a joint sitting of Parliament. The party will also demand a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the alleged irregularities , including question paper leak, as well as a complete overhaul of the National Testing Agency (NTA) that conducts exams such as NEET. Many of these points emerged during Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s interaction with NEET aspirants on June 20. The senior leader cited above said that while the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu wants NEET to be completely scrapped, several State governments such as Karnataka are opposed to NEET as the only gateway to join undergraduate medical courses. “Thousands of students appearing for NEET are on the streets with their families in the scorching heat and [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi is silently watching the spectacle. I assure them that in this struggle, from the streets to the Parliament, India is with you,” Mr. Gandhi said in a post on X on June 21. NEET देने वाले हज़ारों स्टूडेंट्स अपने परिवारों के साथ भयंकर गर्मी में सड़क पर हैं और नरेंद्र मोदी चुप-चाप तमाशा देख रहे हैं। उन्हें भरोसा दिलाता हूं कि इस संघर्ष में सड़क से लेकर संसद तक INDIA आपके साथ है। परीक्षार्थियों से चर्चा का पूरा वीडियो देखें: pic.twitter.com/XLMjKXktYn He also released a seven-minute video of his interaction with the NEET aspirants, in which many of them demanded a re-examination and a probe into the alleged irregularities. They also commented on the NTA’s “incompetence” to hold exams. In the video, Mr. Gandhi, addressing the 24 lakh NEET aspirants, said, ”If government can’t protect you, the Opposition will. This issue I will take up personally in Parliament.” He added that two crore youth had suffered as papers of public exams got leaked 70 times in the past 10 years. On June 21, the Congress organised countrywide protests against the NEET and demanded that the 24 lakh students, who took the test, be given justice. In a post on X, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said question paper leaks had become a national problem under the BJP rule, which had “ruined the future” of crores of youth. “In the last five years, papers of 43 recruitment exams have been leaked in the country. Paper leak has become a national problem of our country under the BJP rule. India has the largest youth population. Instead of making these youth skilled and capable, the BJP government is making them weak,” Ms. Vadra wrote. She said that crores of talented students prepare day and night for different exams and parents bear the burden of studies by sacrificing everything. “Children wait for years for a vacancy to come. When a vacancy comes, there is the cost of filling up the form, the cost of going for the exam, and finally the whole effort is wasted due to corruption. The BJP’s corruption is weakening the country,” she added. Trinamool Congress MP Sagarika Ghose said the paper leaks exposed the “governance deficit” of the Modi government. “Why are heads not rolling? Who is responsible for these paper leaks? Who is the Modi government protecting? What are the permanent solutions that the Modi government is advancing in order to sort out this problem of regular paper leaks?” Ms. Ghose asked.

Jodhpur West DCP Rajesh Kumar Yadav said the clash began Friday night over the construction of a gate in the backside of an eidgah near Rajaram Circle in the Soor Sagar area here. Locals in the area had opposed the gate so that there was no movement of people at the backside of the eidgah. Last night, tension escalated and some people pelted stones, injuring two policemen, DCP Yadav said. \"A shop and a tractor were set on fire, and a jeep was vandalised,\" a senior police officer said. \"Police dispersed people to their homes by using batons and fired 4-5 rounds of tear gas shells,\" the officer added. By late Friday night, the situation was brought under control but the area remained tense. Heavy police and Rajasthan Armed Constabulary forces continue to be deployed on June 22 morning to maintain law and order. Police Commissioner Rajendra Singh said two FIRs were filed based on complaints from both sides. Police said people from both sides have been taken into custody. Police are still raiding houses in the locality to apprehend suspects. According to police, the construction of the wall on the back side of the eidgah began on Friday evening, which was resisted by locals. The subsequent confrontation turned violent later with stone-pelting, arson and vandalism. When police arrived at the scene and used batons to disperse the crowd, some people set fire to a tractor parked by the roadside and damaged a vehicle. While charging at the crowd, police had to face a barrage of stones hurled at them, which for a moment blocked their advancement. A brief peace was also worked out by the police with the help of senior members from both communities but sudden stone-pelting turned the situation tense again. religious conflict / Jaipur BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

It comes as a rare bid to shed linking of yoga meditation to a particular faith. Addressing the 10th International Day of Yoga (IYD) event in Srinagar’s Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC), with the Dal Lake in its backdrop, the PM said those who practice yoga could use any incantations “whether it’s Allah, Ishwar or Waheguru”. Also Read: International Yoga Day events across the globe The PM made an elaborate statement on how Muslims globally were adopting yoga and cited the adoption of yoga therapy in Turkmenistan medical universities, inclusion in Saudi Arabia’s education system and yoga-specific schools in Mongolia to bring home his point. He also highlighted the use of yoga photography in Egypt as a means to promote tourism of the country. It was a rare bid on part of Mr. Modi to position yoga for Muslims and appropriate it as a religion-neutral meditation technique. “Yoga’s utility is being recognised globally. There is barely any world leader who has not discussed yoga during his interactions. Yoga has become a part of daily life in every corner of the world. Yoga has become a topic of research today and multiple research papers have already been published,” the PM said. He suggested that yoga and tourism could “become a major source of employment in J&K too”. “Yoga is not only a discipline but also a science,” he added. The PM said 100 institutes in India and 10 major foreign institutes have been recognised by the Yoga Certification Board instituted by the Ministry of AYUSH. “A new yoga economy is taking birth. There is a growing attraction for yoga tourism and people’s desire to visit India to learn authentic yoga. Yoga retreats, resorts, dedicated facilities for yoga at airports and hotels, yoga apparel and equipment, personal yoga trainers, etc., were creating new avenues of employment for the youth,” Mr. Modi said, adding: “Yoga is scripting new pathways of positive change in the society.” An official estimate suggested that 50,000 to 60,000 locals of Jammu and Kashmir participated in yoga programmes across the UT on Friday. Scores of yoga sessions were held in several districts, along the Line of Control and at the tourist spots of Kashmir Valley on the occasion. The PM praised the spirit of the people to come out and show their support despite the rainy weather. Earlier in the day, the venue in Srinagar was changed from the lawns of the SKICC to the auditorium inside due to rains. However, the PM was seen clicking selfies and posing for pictures with scarf-wearing students enthusiastically encircling him. Scores of participants stood their ground at the SKICC and placed the yoga mats as umbrellas to attend the function. “Today’s spectacle of enthusiasm and commitment shown by the people of J&K towards yoga will be immortalised,” Mr. Modi said. Speaking to the students, PM Modi shed light on yoga techniques. “Concentration and focus in yoga can be cultivated with practice and techniques. This state of mind gives great results with least tiredness and helps to avoid distractions. Apart from the spiritual journey, which will eventually come, meditation is a tool for self-improvement and training,” he added. Yoga is at its nascent stage in the Kashmir Valley and the government is making extra efforts to popularise it among students and government employees over the past five years. “The atmosphere, energy and experience from yoga can be felt in J&K today,” the Prime Minister said, as he had a leisurely conversation and photo sessions with young boys and girls at the SKICC and the Dal Lake. health / traditional / welfare BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The two leaders decided to expand cooperation in several new areas and inked a raft of agreements, including to boost ties in the maritime sphere and blue economy. The key pacts signed by the two sides included one on forging strong ties in the digital domain and another on having a “green partnership”. The two sides also inked an agreement on railway connectivity. “Today we have prepared a futuristic vision for cooperation in new areas. The youth of both the countries will benefit from the consensus reached on cooperation in areas such as green partnership, digital partnership, blue economy and space,” Mr. Modi said in his statement to the media. In her remarks, Ms. Hasina described India as Bangladesh’s major neighbour and a trusted friend. “India is our major neighbour, trusted friend and regional partner. Bangladesh greatly values our relations with India, which were born out of the War of Liberation in 1971,” she said. “I recall with gratitude the contribution of the government and the people of India to Bangladesh’s independence,” she said. She also paid homage to the “brave fallen heroes of India” who sacrificed their lives in the 1971 war. “Today, we had very productive meetings where we discussed cooperation in areas of security, trade, connectivity, sharing of water from common rivers, power and energy, and regional and multilateral cooperation,” she said. “We agreed to collaborate with each other for the betterment of our people and countries,” she added. This visit by the Bangladeshi Prime Minister is the first incoming bilateral state visit by a foreign leader after the formation of the new government in India following the Lok Sabha elections .

Her letter comes after a meeting with senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram, who also served as the Home Minister in the UPA government. ALSO READ | Revised criminal law bills: Key changes explained Mr. Chidambaram, TMC leader Derek O’Brien and DMK’s N.R. Elango were part of the Parliamentary Standing Committee and had given dissent notes to the reports on the three Bills. This is the first sign of Opposition parties belonging to the INDIA bloc working together on crucial issues before the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha. A senior TMC leader said the presence of Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury as the Congress leader in the Lok Sabha was a stumbling block to cooperation between the TMC and the Congress. In her letter, Ms. Banerjee noted that the three Bills were passed in the Lok Sabha at a time when 146 MPs had been suspended. The TMC chief expressed “grave concern” over the impending implementation of the three laws — Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, Bharatiya Sakhsya Adhiniyam (BSA) 2023 and Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) 2023. “The outgoing government of yours had passed these three critical Bills unilaterally, and with absolutely no debate. That day, almost 100 members of the Lok Sabha had been suspended and a total of 146 MPs of both Houses were thrown out of Parliament,” she said. The TMC chief said the three Bills were passed in an “authoritarian manner” in that “dark hour of democracy”. “I urge your esteemed office now to consider at least a deferment of the implementation date. Reasons are two-fold — ethical and practical,” Ms. Banerjee said.

On June 20, Mr. Sinha said Pritam Kumar, Mr. Yadav’s aide, had booked the government guest house for Sikandar Prasad Yadavendu, an accused in the case. One of the arrested students, Anurag Yadav, has said in his statement to the police that Mr. Yadavendu dropped him at the place of Amit Anand and Nitish Kumar where he was given the NEET question paper and answer sheet. “If the government has any doubts, then call my private secretary and question him. Take action against whoever is guilty. I will ask the Chief Minister to arrest whoever is guilty. On the claim made by the Deputy CM, I am wondering why the Economic Offences Unit, which is investigating the case, has not issued any such statements,” Mr. Yadav said. “The engineer who has been arrested may be a beneficiary, but the mastermind is Amit Anand and Nitesh Kumar. This government is making an attempt to divert the issue. Why does it want to protect the kingpin,” he asked. The RJD also hit back at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by releasing an old photo of Mr. Anand along with Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary. “The main accused in the NEET exam paper leak scam is the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar. The so-called powerful minister who was felicitated by the accused has deleted all his photos with him from his social media handles but don’t worry we have them all. Send this to your worried counterpart the other deputy CM,” the RJD wrote on its X handle on June 21. Mr. Yadavendu, a junior engineer in the Danapur Municipal Corporation, has said in his statement that he procured the question papers and answer sheets for four candidates and took the aspirants to Mr. Anand and Mr. Nitish. He told police that he had asked ₹40 lakh from each candidate and had settled the deal at ₹32 lakh.

People of this country know it very well that whenever the BJP forms the government at the Centre, a paper leak happens,” Mr. Yadav said. The RJD leader blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the paper leak and said exam papers are leaked in BJP-ruled States. He demanded cancellation of NEET.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Updated - June 07, 2024 03:48 pm IST Published - June 07, 2024 03:44 pm IST H&M’s Summer 2024 collection comprises bold prints and shapes From stables to the power corridors of fashion, Ann-Sofie Johansson, H&M’s head of Womenswear Design, has had quite a journey. Growing up in Sweden, she says she was always in the stables, taking care of horses and going on rides. “I wanted to become a vet but I didn’t have the grades for that,” she laughs, adding, “At the same time, I was also interested in fashion. I drew a lot of sketches, did a lot of designs. My mom was a seamstress and stitched them for me.” There are kaftans, sun dresses and matching sets inspired by the warmth, energy and rich culture of Brazil In 1987, 25-year-old Ann began her career with H&M as a salesperson at a store in Stockholm. Sure there were other brands she could have joined but H&M for her was “this magical place” where she always found everything sartorial she was looking for. “They could read my mind. I thought, being a designer at H&M must be the most amazing thing,” she says. So, she joined evening classes in design and pattern making. Eventually, Ann put together a portfolio and bravely sent it to the then head of Design, Margareta van den Bosch. And soon, she started off as designer assistant. Ann-Sofie Johansson, head of Womenswear Design and creative advisor Ann’s association with H&M spans 37 years. She is also thecreative advisor. “I am growing with the company. Back then the brand was present in six countries — Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Germany, the UK, and Holland. But now, it is in 70-plus markets,” she adds over a video call from Delhi; she visited the capital as part of her global inspiration trip. In the last three decades she has seen a lot of change and been part of it as well. “Fashion is more fun today, also more challenging. When I started it was dictated by the fashion runways of Paris, for example, and there was just one trend. Today, there is so much fashion and so many trends. Nothing is right or wrong. It’s all about expressing and communicating through fashion and mixing styles and looks. As a result, it’s more liberating.” Ann believes that, in general, fashion reflects what is going on in the world. Which brings us to the question of sustainability, landfills, and how a fast fashion band like H&M is faring on that front. “H&M is not a fast fashion brand,” she insists, while pointing out that sustainability is an endeavour that H&M embarked on 25 years ago. “It’s a big subject. It’s incorporated in business ideas, fashion, quality, price, all through our value chain. We also look at how to cut garments in a better way, how to store, what sustainable fabrics (they use cotton, organic and recycled cotton, recycled fabrics, sustainable wool) can be used or are there recycled fabrics that we can use, how to produce them, how to transport them (a lot of the clothes are made in China, India, Turkey and Bangladesh), how can we inspire customers to care for the garments so they last long and can be reused,” she says adding that there are tough goals ahead and while they are working towards them, this is an issue that cannot be solved individually and requires collaboration with other fashion companies. Circularity in fashion is important. This means not just how a garment is created but also how it is broken down and recycled is crucial, she says. Brands need to invest time in the product so it is long lasting and can be reused, reused, and reused, the 61-year-old further adds. And given how trends keep coming back, this maybe a great idea. Over the years, Ann says she has seen styles come back but in a new context. The Y2K trend with its crop tops, low waist denims, the grunginess of the 90s — like the Kurt Cobain grunge look — are all back. While Ann has tried every single trend in the book, the Swedish fashion designer says she will never wear hot pants and leotards. “I am completely over that,” she laughs. She is more pragmatic in her choices now. Her style is a little tomboyish. “I buy a lot of menswear — slouchy trousers, shirts — and add jewellery and big rings for that extra touch,” she says. Like most people, she has also got used to comfort after the pandemic. Meanwhile Ann and her team of 300 designers are putting on their fashion forward caps for the upcoming season with collections that aim to make the wearer look and feel good. “We work far ahead and are already starting to look at Autumn ‘25. We have special collections for H&M Studio (clothes made of high-end fabric, higher price bracket, and limited collection) and will be doing something for Paris Fashion Week.” fashion / economy, business and finance BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Balasubramaniyan’s collection, in Tiruchi. | Photo Credit: M.MOORTHY Bookish folks of a certain age sighed remorsefully when they heard of the UK edition of Reader’s Digest ( RD ) permanently going off the stands from June after 86 years, owing to financial pressures. In India, the magazine holds a special place in the hearts of readers who grew up in the pre-internet era, as RD gave English-loving families a window to a world outside their own. “There was a time when Reader’s Digest was publishing books on health, general knowledge, nutrition and dictionaries that stood out not just for their content, but their layout, colour photography and paper quality. Even the binding on these books was superb, and stayed intact,” says K. Balasubramaniyan, an engineer-turned-author, environmentalist and book collector who maintains a library of 1,50,000 books, five lakh magazines and 10 lakh back issues of newspapers at his family home in Tiruchi’s Thillai Nagar neighbourhood. Balasubramaniyan recently received a gunnysack full of RD from a friend, and is busy sorting them out when we meet. “I was so sad to learn that the British edition is closing down. With the growth of electronic media, nobody seems to have the time to read physical books. I hope someone will re-publish popular issues of RD for a new generation of readers,” he says. Book collector K. Balasubramaniyan with some of the special publications brought out by Reader’s Digest , in Tiruchi. | Photo Credit: M. MOORTHY First published in 1922, by American couple DeWitt Wallace and Lila Bell Wallace, Reader’s Digest began as a US-based pocket-sized compendium of condensed articles taken from other periodicals. In many ways, RD could be called the original aggregator, breaking reading material of topical interest and entertainment value into capsules of information that appealed to a wide range of public tastes. For several decades, says a Wikipedia page, RD maintained a format of 30 articles per issue (one for each day of the month), including columns such as ‘It Pays to Increase your Word Power’ vocabulary quiz, a page of ‘Amusing Anecdotes’ and ‘Personal Glimpses’, funny stories entitled ‘Humour in Uniform’ and ‘Life’s Like That!’, among others. The Indian and Pakistani editions were launched in 1954, and some of its earliest fans credit RD for introducing them to Western literature. “ RD was part of my English reading, from the 1950s, and we had a whole library of ‘Condensed Books’ published by them at home,” says retired High Court judge Prabha Sridevan. “Circulating libraries were not common in Chennai at the time, so most of the magazines would be given away at the end of the month. My father wrote a joke for the Life’s Like That! column.” “I read books like Rebecca , 39 Steps and other lovely titles in the Condensed version series,” says the septuagenarian. My senior colleague Saraswathy Nagarajan from Thiruvananthapuram is an avid fan of RD , having inherited a vast collection of over 200 issues from her grandfather and father. “I remember reading a profile of Amitabh Bachchan in Reader’s Digest . The article on Nek Chand’s rock garden in Chandigarh was another memorable one, especially when I had an opportunity to visit the city much later. Sometimes I lose myself looking at the advertisements carried by RD in the Indian editions — it is like a time machine,” she says. As a professional journalist, Saraswathy says RD taught her the art of writing effectively. In retrospect, however, a more nuanced understanding of the stories featured in the magazine exposes hidden agendas, she says. “When you read them today, there seems to have been a bias towards the capitalist and Westernised viewpoints in many articles. Whether in the survivor stories or political suspense unfolding during the Cold War, readers were being told about the prevalent American stand.” Yercaud-based hotelier Vishu Kaliappan started reading RD at the age of 12, prompted by his mother, a bookworm herself. “The best thing about Reader’s Digest was its size. It would fit in the palm easily, with a snack, which was really cool when I was growing up. I also enjoyed its humour and vocabulary columns. Of course, as we began to get more exposure through television and later the internet, RD began to feel dated. Parents would often subscribe to the magazine mainly to improve their children’s English skills outside the school syllabus.” Vishu is now hoping to build a collection of vintage Reader’s Digest magazines for the guests who visit his resort in Yercaud. “The magazine’s design stood out from others in the market at the time. The articles were presented in a light style that would energise the reader. I found it quite addictive, and could not stop until I had read all the articles in each issue.” BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

A closer look from a nearby passenger boat confirms that the ‘butterflies’ in hues of red and pink are in cahoots with the wind to cross a finish line between an orange buoy and a flagged boat on the choppy waters of the Bay of Bengal. These are sailboards carrying windsurfers; all vying for the top spot at the All India Windsurfing Championship that wrapped last weekend at the Chennai harbour. While a half-metre swell in the ocean is enough to throw the distant observers (safe in a boat) off-balance, windsurfers deftly combine the techniques of surfing and sailing to find their sweet spot on the waters; with the wind as their guide. They don’t always follow, they fight it too. The sailboard carries the weight of the windsurfer who uses their body weight to determine the movement and direction. A windsurfer in action along the East coast | Photo Credit: SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT In a city celebrated for its dynamic surfing community, windsurfing is slowly but steadily seeing an uptick in interest. “You are looking at more than 20 windsurfing training institutes across the country, so the accessibility has definitely improved,” says kite surfer Jehan Driver of Quest Adventure Sports Academy in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu which is widely regarded as one of the ideal locations to windsurf owing to steady winds, and relatively flat waters. While cities like Mumbai and Goa have for long been touted as strongholds, this is the second time Chennai is hosting an all-India competition. All India Windsurfing Championships 2024 | Photo Credit: Thamodharan B Last year, the event was held between the curvy shoreline of Kovalam beach and the fishing hamlet nearby, with an eager crowd of spectators. This year, windsurfers from 14 states and nine different clubs were in attendance at the Championships organised by the Tamil Nadu Sailing Association, Chennai Sailing Academy and the Indian Coast Guard, of which many young Chennai athletes clinched silver and gold medals in different race classes, like the Raceboard, Techno-293, RS-X and IQFoil. While the movement is slowly picking up in competition circles, the adventure sport will also be a preferred leisure activity along the East coast for the next five months, thanks to ideal wind and water conditions. “Along the coast, we have a completely open ocean, with no land formations till the Andamans, which means we have steady winds, and good, clean waters. We also have swells ranging from half-metre to three and four-metres, and that’s the challenge. I would say this is one of the best conditions for windsurfers and sailors,” says Ajit Diaz, founding member of the Tamil Nadu Sailing Association and International Race Official appointed by World Sailing. Windsurfer Arun Vasu | Photo Credit: SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT Arun Vasu, president of the Surfing Federation of India, has been windsurfing along the East coast since 1983. He started when he was all of 13 years. “Back then, apart from a few locals who were already sailing, there were expats who stayed in the city for two to three years, windsurfing.” The scene did burgeon for a brief period then, but was followed by a lull. Today, Arun is able to track a steady interest in the last five years. As someone who swears by the sport, Arun offers courses at their property, The Alampara in Marakkanam and Quest Academy run along with Jehan. “Every week, we get four to five people who come to learn windsurfing, which is a good number.” In addition to this, windsurfing bootcamps that span three to four-days are extremely popular, says Jehan. While the Kovalam beachfront is not ideal for launching, the deep waters see windsurfers trying to pick up the skill. Arun continues, “In the last 10 years, every outdoor sport has grown. In the next three to five years, we may be able to see more windsurf competitors from here as well.” While the sport has always had an audience long the East coast, the reasons for its popularity is multi-fold in the city. Increased visibility via social media is one. Dedicated competitors and their aspirations to take the country to international competitions, is another. The fact that it is a green sport, and uses no fuel is yet another huge draw, not to mention the gear’s evolution to becoming more beginner-friendly. Twenty-one year old Ishwarya Ganesh’s journey to being the first Indian female RS:X category windsurfer to qualify for the Asian Games 2023 started with a sailboat that traversed the waters of Chennai. “I used to sail a Class called Optimist. After I turned 15, I chose windsurfing. Initially, people used to say that I can’t make it as a windsurfer in Chennai, but now look at all of us. I am so happy to see so many windsurfers in these waters,” says Ishwarya who also clinched a gold medal in IQFoil, Womens U-23 category at the recently-concluded All-India championships. Sumant Arunachalam, on the other hand, took up windsurfing only a month back. He has already clinched a silver medal at the T-293 class, and is touted to be a noted Chennai name in the years to come. Ishwarya believes that she can go far with the sport: “Now that I have seen the Asian Games platform, the ultimate goal would be the Olympic games.” Ishwarya Ganesh, Gold Medalist in IQFoil, Womens U-23 category and Asian Games 2023 participant | Photo Credit: Thamodharan B Competitive circuits aside, windsurfing’s demeanor as a lifestyle sport for health and fitness, seem to have found the spotlight now. “The overall demographic change in those who take up sport has also changed, with more parents understanding what the sport is all about,” says Jehan, adding that he gets students between the ages of 20 and 40, and sometimes even over 50. The interest is not tourism-oriented as seen with surfing. “It has to do more with fitness, sport development, and skill-building,” he adds. The affordability (with imported equipment) is perhaps its major deterrent to mainstream. For example, an IQFoil board can cost anywhere between ₹4 to ₹6 lakhs. “It’s still an imported gear, not made in India as yet,” reminds Jehan. Windsurfers return after a race | Photo Credit: Shiva Raj S Ajit is steadfast in his aspirations to promote the sport in the city. “We want more youngsters to try out this sport, and want it to grow. People who love adventure, and have a certain level of fitness can definitely try windsurfing. Most don’t know where to start, and that’s what we are trying to change through such competitions.” Back at the port, after an afternoon of racing which sometimes involves the unpredictable wait for steady sea breeze, the swarm returns in leisure to the timber pond area of the harbour, wielding their large butterfly wings. What follows is careful upkeep of their most prized possession, the sailboard, followed by a warm meal of vadas and dosas. Ten-year old Naavya Nirav Kaku from Mumbai says as she catches a break, “I feel alive whenever I am on the board. It is freeing. If you windsurf here, you can do it anywhere.” The Hindu MetroPlus / lifestyle and leisure / sport / Chennai BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Having met through common friends, and their shared love for all things handmade, they went on to host their first pop-up, and are now gearing up for its second edition this weekend. The entrepreneurs include Lesley Scen of Mels Jewellery, Namitha Charles who crafts soft toys, Madhu Mehra of She Who Knits, Ravinder Kaur of Rangmalang Studio, Ramona Patel of Little Stitches, and mother-daughter duo Purobi and Shivani Kagti of Pickle Project. Chilli pickle by Pickle Project | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement “We had friends in common, and some of us have known each for quite a few years as we are in the same field,” says Shivani. “While we already have an existing customer base, we decided to host another event given the good turnout last year.” Shivani says, they have all been working on the pop-up for the last few months. As for the pickles, she explains how when they first started out in 2016, Pickle Project had six types of pickles. “Now we have 10 variants including tomato, brinjal, cabbage, lemon, chicken and pork. We are bringing a few bottles of both our sour mango pickle and the murabba- style sweet mango pickle, and a small batch of mixed vegetable pickle that is being introduced on a trial basis.” Namitha Charles’ soft toys designed with upcycled fabric | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement All set to showcase new designs in her sterling silver jewellery collection, Lesley says each piece is one-of-a-kind as they are all handcrafted. “I started with handmade chains, and after doing a course in wax carving, I branched into creating sterling silver jewellery. I have two jewellers who work with me who were carefully chosen keeping handmade designs in mind,” says the designer who will bring assymetric hammered bangles, mother of pearl on hand-carved leaves earrings, finger rings with semi-precious stones, among others. Lesley, who also retails hand-embroidered apparel and home linen under the label, Sew Much Love, will bring linen tops, table runners, and more. “I owe the brand to my mother who taught me hand embroidery from the age of 11, and I have always been doing little pieces of home linen with embroidery. During the pandemic, I pursued my passion full time alongside my jewellery. I reuse all the small pieces of material for patchwork,” she explains.

But Anusha Ashyanth has a walk-in crockery closet that is brimming with exquisite pieces bought from her travels around the world. And now it also has collections created by her. “My wardrobe is smaller than my crockery closet,” laughs Anusha who stated Aura Design in December 2019. The company specialises in dining ware and stationery, something that Anusha wanted to do after she finished her Visual Communication course at MOP Vaishnav College for Women. “Art is a crucial part of my life,” she says. But she had to wait for 18 years before she could start her brand. “Life had other plans. I got married, had children. The kids have grown up, so now is the time to do what I love,” she says, adding, “Crockery needs lot of R&D. We had to understand it, the way its fired, etc. That took 18 months.” Verandah captures the essence of the charming, old world balconies of Kolkata And finally in 2020 Aura unveiled its line of crockery. “We launched four collections in one go. They were based on history of art and inspired by Baroque, Renaissance, Art Noveau and Medieval art,” she says. Aura’s new drop this year includes four collections with names that sound poetic. Nizam-e-Gul, Ashrafi, Kanika Vriksha and Verandah. The foundation for this is traditional design and art that prevails in India with an aesthetic modern touch added to it. Ashrafi, has Bidri patterns in gold and platinum The inspiration for each is diverse. Verandah captures the essence of the charming, old world balconies of Kolkata. These are depicted on the crockery in the form of green balusters entwined with pink bougainvillea. Kanika Vriksha has elements drawn from Tamil Nadu. You can see banana trees, goddess Andal’s parrot, and kolam designs in 22 carat gold. Inspired by the chintz motif, Nizam-e-Gul, with its bright pink flowers and green leaf motifs, is like a garden in full bloom. While Ashrafi, with Bidri patterns crafted in gold and platinum, sees a departure from the usual white, pink, green colour scheme that the former three ranges showcase. There are charger plates, dinner and side plates, tapas plates, big and small serving bowls, drink ware, tea pots and cups, all made of bone china. “It takes a month or two to come up with an idea. Designing takes two months and production takes another five months. We consciously stay away from Pinterest and Shutterstock,” she says. After the designs are finalised, they are sent to vendors who create the final product. Anusha Ashyanth, founder - Aura Design “The process sounds simple but is not.” Usually, the initial colour on paper looks different from the one on the computer screen and on wares. By the time it matches, it takes six to eight months, she explains. “For example, it took eight tries to get the green right in Kanika Vriksha,” says Anusha. For the next collection the team at Aura Design wants to explore geometric patterns and stoneware. “It’s going to be more minimalist and casual,” she says. Aura Design’s collections are on display at The Folly at Amethyst from June 14 to 16, 10.30am to 7.30pm.

They are inspiring examples of how such individuals can make an impact on society. One such story is of Phani Raja Kumar, an NRI, and his JNTU, Hyderabad alumni, who initiated a movement through an NGO called Haritha Foundation that addresses critical issues like education and health among the children in rural Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The motivation to establish this NGO, Phani says, has been influenced by his personal experiences and observations of society, particularly in Puttaparthi. “In May 2002, I witnessed the initiatives at the Satya Sai Baba ashram and closely examined their educational programmes and healthcare systems offered at no cost. I also saw water projects effectively tailored to the local community. The impact of these experiences on me was undeniable,” says Phani, who organised educational and health camps in Yeddumailaram village and an eye camp in Kandi Village, near Sangareddy, in 2002 as his first charity venture. “Hundreds of students and villagers were positively affected by these camps. The joy and satisfaction among the people and the dedication of the volunteers and local youth were truly inspiring,” says Phani, who involves friends and volunteers in his charity work. The significant support was from his JNTUH alumni. He has successfully mobilised his alum network, collaborating with his fellow graduates to reach out to less-privileged children. The coming together of the alums has been the biggest accomplishment, and Phani attributes this to their alma mater. He completed his MTech and PhD and is grateful for the invaluable knowledge their entire batch gained in engineering and research and from the professors, colleagues, and friends. The JNTUH alums have played a significant role in these efforts, enthusiastically joining Phani in serving their alma mater and the broader community. “Some time ago, we conducted a tree plantation programme at schools near Patancheru, which was a meaningful experience. Several professors from JNTUH have been supportive well-wishers and volunteers for our programmes,” he says. Demonstrating their commitment, the alums have also sponsored a 3D printing lab at JNTU Hyderabad, benefiting research students across the affiliated colleges. This initiative underscores the collective dedication of JNTUH alums to give back and support future generations of students. Phani Raja Kumar Phani’s commitment to rural development is personal. Growing up in Vijayawada and nearby villages; as the son of a school teacher, he experienced firsthand the educational barriers and difficulties that children in these areas face. This intimate knowledge has instilled in him a strong sense of duty to contribute positively to these communities. Additionally, Phani’s commitment is fuelled by the belief in social justice and equity. “ I am driven by the principle that every child, no matter their geographic or economic background, is entitled to a quality education and the opportunity to succeed. This belief is at the core of why I focused on improving education for rural children, aiming to provide them with the tools and opportunities necessary to rise above their circumstances and achieve their full potential.” Haritha Foundation provides essential supplies such as stationery to all children and sports equipment to schools. They also offer clothing where it is most needed. Health screening camps are regularly organised to maintain student wellness. With a focus on personal growth, personality development classes are organised, bringing distinguished individuals from urban areas. “Additionally, we facilitate educational excursions like science knowledge tours, transporting students from their villages to major cities. For example, we arrange students’ visits to Hyderabad’s Birla Science Museum and Planetarium, or Tirupathi’s Science Museum, in state RTC buses,” shares Phani. The Foundation hosts ‘MyVoice’ elocution competitions for students to encourage expressive skills at the class, school, and Mandal levels, with cash prizes and motivational talks and books to inspire participants further. Environmental awareness is promoted through special sessions, cleaning initiatives, safety classes, and tree-planting programmes in all schools. Funding for such activities can be a challenge. Phani has been spending his earnings towards charity activities and receives financial support from friends who share his vision. “I encourage my friends to invest their time and resources in village development to express gratitude towards their roots and country. This approach has proven effective for initiating various developmental activities. We believe that collective efforts can drive positive change and sustainable progress.” The Hindu MetroPlus BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 14, 2024 04:33 pm IST Anatina’s Heart of Gold necklace is a collection of 14 hearts held together by French rope and ovular links Amama is know for its big statement jewellery Loud, edgy, dramatic — jewellery today resembles art in a gallery. Driven by a demand for bolder pieces, a crop of young designers are creating jewellery that deliberately moves away from traditional patterns. From funky reinterpretations of heirlooms to intricate hair buns, rhinestone gloves, metal nail claws and over-the-top necklaces, these creations defy trends and encourage wearers to make a personal statement. We look at options for your wardrobe. For Roma Narsinghani, venturing into jewellery design seemed like a fortunate twist of fate. In 2016, when in the midst of her wedding preparations, she stumbled upon a stone-adorned hair bun cage that was a family heirloom. “Intrigued, I decided to put my own creative spin on it for one of the ceremonies. This sparked a chain of experiments, eventually leading to the birth of the first few pieces,” says Roma, who launched her eponymous brand in 2017. Though offbeat, the hair buns have remained a constant in her collections; manifesting in different shapes and designs, from hexagon to spiral and encrusted with Swarovski crystals and rubies. These are her bestsellers, followed by chokers and rings. A hair bun “My jewellery embodies a unique fusion of motifs and structural elements, drawing inspiration from a juxtaposition of raw textures, culture, travel, architecture and the self,” says the Mumbai-based designer. Her first collection, titled ArchGeo, was inspired by Mumbai’s Art Deco heritage and architectural plans. The entire collection was hand-made and featured big, bold designs. Roma Narsighani’s jewellery embodies a unique fusion of motifs and structural elements “While I admire the beauty of delicate designs, I have always felt compelled to explore the same concept in a more unconventional manner. My designs are a reflection of my evolving journey as a designer, constantly influenced by my surroundings, experiences, and personal growth,” she says. Roma Narsinghani In that vein, her latest collection, Lola & Koki, is a heartfelt tribute to her Sindhi heritage and also has pieces named after food, like rabri studs and aloo took brooch, adding a touch of whimsy. “It’s inspired by the essence of Sindhi rotis — lola represents the sweet roti, while koki is the salty one. Crafted with eco-brass and adorned with bio-material algae beads created in collaboration with Aradhita Parasampuria, each piece reflects my journey of rediscovering my roots.” Roma’s unconventional design aesthetics resonate with today’s clientele, which is seeking pieces that reflect their individuality. Some of the pieces have been crafted for special collaborations, such as the striking face gear designed for Amit Aggarwal’s fashion week finale and the avant-garde head gear created for Chola the Label’s Lakme Fashion Week showcase. Roma adds, “Currently, I am exploring pixel patterns using Swarovski crystals. One of my ongoing projects involves creating a metal mesh top adorned with skin-coloured crystals, forming a mesmerising pattern that resembles a woman’s torso.” Prices start at ₹3,000 and go up to ₹20,000. Available on romanarsinghani.com Amama’s nail claws look menacing but sexy. It is something you would expect to see on a stylish Disney villain like Maleficent or Cruella de Vil. But the idea behind this bijouterie is quite simple. “A lot of women do not have the time to get their nails done, they can just pop these on,” says Nikita Gupta, founder of Amama. Lumina by Amama Made of metal with pearl and stone embellishments, these are her bestsellers along with earrings that have “gone viral”. “For example, we sold around a thousand of the Infinity danglers worn by Jacqueline Fernandez, even our hand-embroidered Krisha earrings are popular,” says Nikita, who started her band in 2017. The brand is an ode to Nikita’s grandmother who pampered her with silver jewellery. But before getting into the jewellery business, Nikita says she spent a lot of time scouring the markets of Paharganj and Chandni Chowk looking for interesting pieces. Eventually, she put her discoveries up on her blog posts. “People started asking why I wasn’t selling these. So I started curating jewellery and that is how Amama started,” says Nikita, adding, “Our first lot had Afghan jewellery but I added my tweaks to them and it did well. I had some ideas of my own too and started working with karigars. I came up with our next line Rangrez for which I created embroidered jewellery and jewellery on fabric; and the success of that is what got us here.” From two a day, Nikita found her orders increasing to almost 100. Last year, Amama started in-house manufacturing in their unit in Noida. “We are a team of 100, of which 60 are karigars,” she informs. In 2023, they launched their stores in DLF Promenade and DLF Avenue in Delhi . They also have a new store coming up in DLF Mall of India, Noida. Amama is also doing bags and wants to get into the accessory space. “From weddings to vacations, we want to cater to all occasions,” says Nikita who studied Retail and worked with brands such as Louis Vuitton and Forever 21. Her new launch, Lumina, has blingy holiday favourites like statement resort bags, hair accessories, studs enhanced with coloured crystals and pearls in 22 carat gold. “We are known for big statement jewellery. When you wear something, people should notice it,” she adds. She is also aware that copies of her designs often end up in local markets. But as Oscar Wilde said, “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery...” Prices start at ₹1,500 and go upto ₹15,000 on amama.in Aakanksha Kotawala is from a family of jewellers. “But what my family does is completely different from what I do,” says Aakanksha, a brand developer who started Anatina, her own jewellery label in 2021. “It’s global in nature, contemporary but rooted in our culture, and speaks of our craftsmanship,” she says. To begin with, Aakanksha was not sure if she wanted to be part of this trade. But, she was inspired by the 250-year-old legacy of her family business. “In India we make everybody’s jewellery, Jaipur is a hub, but not many brands from here are really known well internationally. Our country is so rich in craftsmanship; using that I wanted to give jewellery a new twist,” she says. There are hairpins, stackable rings, chokers, chunky necklaces, pendants, earrings, bracelets... The brand is an extension of herself. I like pieces that have a story. “In terms of design sensibility, every collection has an emotional or personal meaning. No two pieces look alike. One could find pieces that are minimal or statement or Roman in nature or full of texture,” she says. Aakanksha’s creations are made of brass, or 18 and 22 carat gold plated. She adds that they work with stones like amethyst, malachite, aquamarine, pearls. When Aakanksha started Anatina, the demand for offbeat jewellery was in its nascent stage. The market acceptance has grown over the years. “People weren’t keen on wearing fashion jewellery. The mindset was that if you can’t afford real jewellery you go for this. But that has changed. The barrier between fine and fashion has narrowed. Peoples acceptance of design has been a game changer,” says Aakanksha. Anatina | Photo Credit: PRIYADARSHINI PAITANDY Her clientele is of all ages. “A 70-year-old recently wore our Heart of Gold necklace (a collection of 14 hearts held together by French rope and ovular links). It’s our statement jewellery and she wore it with so much finesse and paired it with a dress. It looked great,” she smiles. Eyes on the Prize, another statement necklace was sported by models at the last edition of the Paris Fashion Week, she says. Aakanksha Kotawala Prices start at ₹4,000 and go up to ₹16,000. Available on shopanatina.com Have you seen a scarf that is actually jewellery? Or a glove that doubles up as a rather blingy bijoux? Made of rhinestone, these accessories are some of MNSH’s bestselling pieces. The brand wants its designs to be conversation starters. “Earlier people were conservative but after COVID, YOLO has become the mantra and people are open to trying different things,” says Mansha Mittal whose brand MNSH is a pandemic baby. “We just completed three and a half years and it has been a fun journey,” she says over a call from Mumbai. MNSH wants its designs to be conversation starters A student of Apparel Design, Mansha admits to not having any background in fashion jewellery. But it is her love for ornaments that made her take to this field. “I’ve always been a fashion jewellery buff. I poured myself into it,” she says, adding, “I used to buy from a lot of brands. After buying three or four products from the same brand, the pieces would all start looking the same. I was looking for different designs for different occasions. There weren’t too many contemporary designs that you could wear both with a sari and jeans,” says the designer who grew up in Los Angeles and Singapore. Mansha Mittal When exploring the market, Mansha also noticed that the pricing for quality jewellery was on the higher side. She decided to create something trendy, chic, and priced affordably. “My clients want something distinct. I look at what is happening internationally. Every individual is different and so is their personality; therefore brands have to cater to that,” she says. Which is why at MNSH, to keep up exclusivity, they believe in phasing out their collection. Twenty-odd pieces are made for each design. Only the classics remain. “We don’t do mass production,” she says. The range here is so varied that it has designs for 18-60 year olds. “Recently Zeenat Aman was styled in our Baroque pearl necklace,” she adds. MNSH has just launched its Boheme collection, which embodies summer. There are chains and bracelets in fun colours with stones like malachite and lapis. “There’s a lot of colour play, stacking and layering involved,” says Mansha, who normally does brass and gold plated jewellery but is venturing into stones like cubic zirconia and glass stones. She is also launching a stack of bangles with the words nidar (fearless) and shakti on them as a tribute to the women of today. Price starts at ₹2,500 and goes up to ₹15,000.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 14, 2024 04:43 pm IST It’s time to confess. You guys don’t have to confess. I mean, if you’d like to, then please do, but kindly do so in your own column, and not here. No point in being ‘that’ democratic. Now without further interruption, back to my confession. There are few things people don’t really know about me. For instance, did you know that I’m a mere 85 kilos, have both eyebrows, and mostly identify as a male, except on weekends? See, you had no idea. But there’s more, much more. Did you also know, I’m a trained and award-winning sociologist and psychologist? I bet you didn’t. And I can’t blame you, upto 2 weeks ago, I did not know, either. To summarize, I identify as a mostly male award-winning, certified psychologist, and sociologist. Now, to prove the creditability of this claim, I have jotted down my observations, in a manual I’ve called “Vegetarian Chicken Soup for the Soul”. These observations have been made because this writer, (who happens to be a certified and award-winning psychologist and sociologist), is sick and tired of all the usual issues. Internecine wars, lack of availability of resources, fluctuating GDPs, scarcity of jobs, and a never-ending wedding. People seem distracted by the above, and have turned off some more pressing local issues which trouble our society at large, and by “our” society, I mean people of Walkeshwar, Malabar Hill, Mumbai. Observation #1: Slow walkers. There is a new illness which is growing at a massive scale, of purposeless walkers. Increasingly our roads, (again Walkeshwar, Malabar Hill, Mumbai), are being filled with walkers with no agenda. They walk like they are in a perpetual coma causing traffic jams, and people jams. Since they are rarely on the pavement, they seem to target vehicles with their meandering aimless gait. Ambulances on emergency duty are defeated in this war of attrition. Even India’s greatest tradition the “V.I.P. red beacon cavalcade”, has suffered at these merciless sloths. Oh, and mind you, not all of them are on their mobiles, and even less of them seem to be actually on their feet. Observation #3 (To keep you on your toes and to make sure you are not one of those purposeless walkers, this writer , has put observation #3 ahead of observation #2 ). Too many citizens are guilty of starting a conversation with a greeting, and then moving on, sans conversation. Why do that? How audacious and spiteful have we become? After interrupting a person with an unnecessary greeting, you just leave them hanging? Also, there is no conclusion after the greeting. No ‘bye’ to follow the intensive ‘hi’. It’s just ‘Hi’, and off you go. Have we lost all shreds of human decency? Is there no empathy for a fellow human? (Generally, human refers to a few, but not all residents of Walkeshwar, Malabar Hill). Observation #2 This is the worst one of all. Some soulless monsters, have their chauffeurs bring the car to the building lobby or gate, in readiness for the great one on to arrive. The average time spent in this wait is 37 minutes. Due to this malicious act, other cars are forced to form queues to get in or out, leaving the driver angry, frustrated and suicidal. In a recent case, a blocked car operator suffered a heart attack, as after the 37 minutes wait, the ‘memsahib’ about to enter her vehicle realised she had forgotten her glasses, and so went back to her abode to retrieve them. The extra 27 minutes was too much for this sensitive soul. Not to take our GDP, melting glaciers, and so on lightly, but we must as a society look at all our ailments holistically, and by ‘we’, I mean the residents of Walkeshwar, Malabar Hill and the Southern tip of Mumbai. The writer has dedicated his life to communism. Though only on weekends.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 14, 2024 08:22 pm IST On a humid May evening on bustling Church Street in Central Bengaluru, three men and women geared up next to the immaculately laid tenpin bowling alleys at Amoeba to play the finals of the Karnataka State Ranking Tenpin Bowling League. That day, R Kishan went on to win the men’s title while Hitasha Sisodiya took home her maiden trophy. But apart from those onlookers at the venue, a few friends and family, and a handful of discerning newspaper readers, not many knew that such a tournament was being held and that there were medals and prizes in the offing. Not many know that bowling, long considered a recreational activity is also a sport in its own right. This holds true not only in India, but also internationally. “It is a competitive sport and not a lot of people are aware that there are 12 gold medals on offer at the Asian Games for bowling,” says Akaash Ashok Kumar, a former national champion. It is this apathy that the Tenpin Bowling Federation of India has been trying to break through. The initial efforts began in 2009 when 15 men’s and six women’s bowlers from across India were selected and put under a foreign coach. Even though India had competed in international tournaments before, the available skill, ability and knowledge were inadequate to compete with participants from other countries. At the state-level, the Karnataka State Tenpin Bowling Association (KSTBA) devised its own plans and has been moderately successful in developing players such as Akaash, a bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Tenpin Bowling Championships in 2011 and 2016, as well as R Kishan, the current National champion, among others. However, for the game to spread, the pool at the base has to be widened and it is here that the socio-economic aspects of the sport plays a major role. Even for recreational purposes, a large number of bowling arenas for the general public are not monetarily feasible to maintain. Unlike sports such as cricket, football, basketball and others, where the government has provided the public access to playgrounds, bowling suffers because it is an expensive sport. For a professional bowler, it is important to have proper equipment, such as balls which are customised to each individual’s bowling technique. The price for a reactive ball ranges from ₹8,000 to ₹23,000. It is also a highly technical sport. There is straight bowling, spin bowling, hook bowling and the latest two-handed bowling. The game also consists of diverse oiling patterns on the playing lanes. Oil helps to control the ball and strike the pins consistently. A player’s efficiency can change from pattern to pattern or from lane to lane. One might perform really well in the lane they start from but could fall short of pins on a different lane. This usually happens due to the friction and taxing of the balls. To master such a resource-intensive sport, there is need for tremendous amounts of practice as well as a commitment from the athletes to remain dedicated for a long duration. For all this to fall into place, firm backing from authorities is required. However, the KSTBA does help by sponsoring individuals who have a bright future. The association has come in for praise for taking initiatives to send players overseas for professional training. Yet, more needs to be done to ensure that the likes of Kishan and Hitasha are more widely known.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Updated - June 20, 2024 09:27 am IST Published - June 19, 2024 03:55 pm IST A vehicle crossing a challenging terrain at Mahindra Adventure | Photo Credit: Mahindra Adventure | Photo Credit: Mahindra Adventure At the Madras Offroad Academy in Pudupakkam, a winch rope pulls out a vehicle stuck in mud, while Dr Rinku George, the instructor gives instructions over a walkie talkie. It’s a sweltering Sunday afternoon, but off-roading enthusiasts are out braving the rising mercury. A group of novices and advanced off-roaders manoeuvre their 4x4s across the 25-acre property, which belongs to Rinku and has been painstakingly created as an obstacle course for off-roaders. It also has three small artificial water bodies used by intermediate and advanced drivers. “There are 23 obstacles here. These include small and large table top, double hump, positive incline, steep ascent, steep descent...,” says Rinku who started the Madras Offroad Academy last year. At Madras Offroad Academy | Photo Credit: Thamodharan B A maxillofacial surgeon and professor at a dental college, Rinku started off-roading more than a decade ago. “We used to drive on the roads and beaches. There was no structured way to teach us theory. It was all practicals. We learnt on our own and made some very costly mistakes. My vehicle was damaged. I felt that if someone had taught me correctly, this would not have happened,” says Rinku, adding that this pushed him to organise classes for newcomers. Starting with around six students, his batches have now grown to include 20 students each. Rinku holds classes once a month and also ropes in other experts to co-host. These usually begin with a two-hour theory session at 8am, followed by practicals on the driving course. The course ends by 1.30 pm with a multiple choice questionnaire. “It is a certified programme. We are perhaps the only ones in India to give written tests at the end of a session to see how much the students have learnt and if I have been effective as a teacher,” smiles Rinku who is currently writing a book on off-roading. A theory class in progress at Madras Offroad Academy | Photo Credit: Thamodharan B The courses also cover topics such as how to pull other vehicles, how to winch properly, how the engine works, difference between suspensions, if you roll over how to get the vehicle back up, what upgrades and modifications can be done to a vehicle... There is a four-month gap between basic and intermediate classes. “After basic classes, I take students on trail drives and through forests, beaches, river beds and other off-road terrain. Ninety percent of the students stay and want to move to the next level, the other 10% leave,” he says. A training session with Terra Tigers | Photo Credit: Terra Tigers His students — men and women — are in the age group of 18 to 65. Those who don’t have their own vehicles can start by driving one of the school’s vehicles. He says that there have been cases where people who went off-roading, found it difficult and then joined classes. “Even those with experience on the tarmac will struggle when it comes to off-roading. It is a different concept and philosophy.” From being used for relief work to recreation and driving holidays, off-roading is being recognised as a future skill; it is very relevant, says Arkaprava Dutta of Terra Tigers, one of the first groups to provide recreational off-roading in Chennai since 2006. “There is a huge interest in off-roading. Learning has increased by 60%. People who are interested in off-roading with us also enquire if we are training,” says Arkaprava, who has also been training groups for driving expeditions to the mountains since 2014. | Photo Credit: Terra Tigers One of his students, Chittra Koman, recently completed an expedition to the North East. In February this year, Chittra and her group of friends set off on a road trip from Chennai to Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh and then drove back. But preparations for this expedition started six months earlier. Chittra enrolled for offroading courses and trained with Madras Offroad Academy, Terra Tigers and Mahindra Adventure. While the drive to the North East was not as hardcore as an off-roading adventure, the classes helped, she says. “A decent amount of training proves useful in understanding the capabilities of your vehicle, getting a fair idea of the techniques to manoeuvre through different terrain, being able to use a 4X4 vehicle effectively, navigating obstacles, recovery techniques and so forth. Moreover, off-roading training makes the drives enjoyable as opposed to sitting on pins,” says Chittra. | Photo Credit: Mahindra Adventure All seasoned off-roaders will tell you preparation is key. A typical off-roading drive, Chittra says, requires a good number of sessions on different terrain. Some automobile companies and independent players offer day long practice on their proving tracks too. This is easier as getting variations on one single location is difficult. “These experiences equip one with necessary techniques, skills, and confidence,” says Chittra. | Photo Credit: Terra Tigers Apart from hobbyists, a lot of volunteers and rescue workers also have learnt this skill over the years, says Arkaprava. During the Chennai flash floods in November 2021, Terra Tigers were part of the rescue efforts. “A 45-day-old child was stuck in his house at the end of a closed street (near SAF Games Village) and we had to get him out in our vehicle. In a built up area when you are pushing water it’ll hit the wall and come back. It’s called a bow wave. So when the wave comes under the vehicle, it’ll slightly lift the vehicle. You have to understand the terrain, the limitation of the vehicle and what it can do. The child was successfully rescued but people who are not trained will end up getting stuck in such situations and also damage their cars,” says Arkaprava. His off-roading team also helped carry heavy loads to the beach during the Kite Festival in Mamallapuram 2023, a terrain not easily manoeuvred by all drivers. For rescue duties and other such efforts, the team usually deploys three to five vehicles, so they can help out in case one of the rescue cars gets stuck. | Photo Credit: Terra Tigers The Terra Tigers team essentially believes in a driver-spotter combination. The spotter stands outside the car from where he can see the wheels and where they are being placed to prevent the vehicle from getting damaged. Our training is largely focussed to function as a team, says Arkaprava. Training activities happen at the Palar river bed and at The Farm (OMR) every two months. “The Farm has one of the largest off-road tracks in the country. It’s spread over 20 acres and has 20 obstacles like positive side incline, negative side incline, double mound, water fording obstacle, steep decline... At Mahindra Adventure, they take terrainand the weather very seriously. Which is why, in addition to the all-year-round offroading courses, they also organise two season specific ones — Snow Survivor and Sand Survivor. The former takes place in Leh between January to March, when the bone chilling temperature is mostly below 0 degrees Celsius, on trails specially curated by experts. The latter takes place between November and January, in the golden dunes of Jaisalmer, and includes an overnight drive. In 1996, Mahindra Adventure started out by organising off-roading events across the country. The first official off-roading school came up in 2011 in Igatpuri, Maharashtra. They now have schools near Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, within a 100-acre coffee plantation in Coorg, and the newest one is in Gurgaon, in the foothills of the Aravallis, Leh, and Jaisalmer. Interestingly, the 28-acre facility in Igatpuri is also where Mahindra makes its engines for the Thar. | Photo Credit: Mahindra Adventure Ever since its inception in 2011, the academy has trained around 50,000 enthusiasts. “We have three aims: Engagement and advocacy; community building; and introduction to the sport of offroading,” says Nalinikanth Gollagunta, CEO - Automotive Sector, Mahindra & Mahindra. Mahindra’s vehicles are capable of going through various terrain but many customers are not very well trained so they wanted help to get maximum benefit out of the vehicles, this was another reason for starting these sessions, he adds. “But you don’t necessarily have to own a Mahindra vehicle to join these classes,” Nalinikanth clarifies. Mahindra Adventure’s Sand Survivor course in Jaisalmer | Photo Credit: Mahindra Adventure There are different courses to choose from. Getting Dirty is for beginners; Trail Survivor is a weekend course, and the advanced one is called Global Survivor, explains Nalinikanth. “We also have extreme expeditions, the duration for which is around 10-15 days. We organise four to five every year. We do Ladakh, Nepal, Bhutan and just finished one in Namibia. They train people across demographics. We also have institutional training programmes for the Army and Border Security Force. People who wish to start their own off-road trails train with us. A lot more off-roading facilities are coming up,” he observes. The reason for this he believes is, “More awareness about vehicles and their capabilities have grown. The road infrastructure has developed, giving access to locations and far-flung places. People see these places on social media, they want to experience them safely and therefore enrol for off-roading classes before setting out on the great escape.” The Hindu MetroPlus / hybrid vehicles / Chennai / Maharashtra / hobby BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

It would seem that X (formerly Twitter), does not have dibs on character restriction. According to Khushi Bansal who curated Hello & Goodbye along with Meghana Kuppa and a team from MAP, “The messages on these postcards tell us a lot about life in those times. What is interesting is how abbreviations were used to convey news within a limited space; short forms are not a contemporary concept.” Khushi says Hello & Goodbye was conceptualised “after we realised we have such an expansive post card collection at MAP”. A chunk of the collection comprises around 1,300 postcards that were donated by Kenneth X and Joyce Robbins to MAP.

The team realised these postcards provided a wealth of information on life in those times, especially in areas of cultural identity and lived history. “While some carry messages to loved ones, others talk about their visit to a small town or monument. We get a sense of what people abroad were talking about India, because a lot of these postcards were exchanged either within the Indian elite circle or between foreigners,” says Meghana. “We learn about the cost of living, societal norms and more by browsing through them. We find a micro history of sorts within these postcards, shaped by colonial activity in India during this period,” she adds. For over six months, the team pored over thousands of postcards from their collection, sorting them by different categories such as architecture, landscape and more. During this time, they referenced books such as Omar Khan’s Paper Jewels: Postcards from the Raj and Picturesque India: A Journey in Early Picture Postcards by Sangeeta Mathur and Ratnesh Mathur. According to Khushi, the team focused on three aspects to structure Hello & Goodbye. “First, we looked at the overall history of the early 20th century. Though postcards were introduced in the late 19th century, we looked at the period during which they were most highly circulated,” says Khushi. Interesting facets of human nature emerged during the team’s work with these postcards. “Over the course of our research, we found out that a lot of people wrote postcards in letter format, resulting in a series of notes from which the receiver would piece together information,” she says, adding that postcards were very much like social media of our day, with an image and limited space for text. These postcards also give viewers a concept of time in today’s context. “Postcards were for quick and speedy communication, but would still take at least two weeks to be delivered, at least within India,” says Meghana. According to Meghana, postcards of the 1800s only had a small space under the image for the sender to add a note with the reverse used only for addresses. It was only in the early 1900s, a design change saw more space alloted at the back, she says. An embellished postcard from the Hello & Goodbye exhibition by MAP | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement Second, the team began to look into how people’s use of postcards reflected the notion of their own identities and beliefs. “We looked at printing presses, the print culture that existed at the time and how it came about. This lead us to look at colonial identity and culture as well as the impact it had on our economy and politics.” Khushi says there was a natural segue to memory and nostalgia as the final aspect of the exhibition. “At the end of it all, a postcard is a message from one person to another, and while most of them were little love notes between family, friends and lovers, they were also used by companies to communicate matters relating to business.” For instance, the team came across a postcard addressed to the Ravi Varma press in Lonavala regarding supplies, she says. Though there are about 80 postcards on display, the team wanted vistors to enjoy the curation process as much as they did. “We’ve set up a little desk within the exhibition itself for people to experience is the act of browsing for themselves as well as reflect on the messages — it would also help them understand the process of curation,” says Meghana. “Linking to the idea of how postcards revolutionised communication, we wanted to revisit the idea of sending postcards — whether to a loved one or even to yourself. So we set up a little table with yellow postcards from the post office with a stamp already affixed. Visitors who are so inclined can write a message and if they put in the correct address, we will mail it for them,” says Khushi. MAP’s digital stamp | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement The team at MAP also put together a digital postcard greeting. “This essentially means you can play around with different backgrounds and elements to design your own postcard. Once done, you can scan a QR code as well as a specially designed stamp by MAP and email this digital version to any recipient,” she adds. The digital stamp was designed by Mahesh KS, a member of the team. “This unique stamp not only commemorates MAP, but also the year to mark this event,” says Meghana, adding, “Those who create personalised digital postcards cards can also give MAP a copy for their archives, if they so choose.” Hello & Goodbye at the Museum of Art and Photography will be on display till August 18, 2024 The Hindu MetroPlus BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

This study, considered the world’s largest review, suggests that consuming UPFs can link to a staggering 32 harmful health effects including increased risk of developing serious conditions like heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and even mental health issues. This comes at a time when global consumption of UPFs, including convenient options like cereals, protein bars, sugary drinks, and fast food, is on the rise. Unlike minimally processed foods like canned vegetables or frozen fruits, UPFs undergo multiple industrial processes and are loaded with additives. These foods are factory-made products loaded with added sugars, unhealthy fats, and artificial ingredients. By Idil Keysan for the Wikimedia Foundation - Wikimedia Foundation, CC BY-SA 4.0 , Link The study has unveiled the concerning impact of UPFs on both our physical and mental well-being. These convenient, often shelf-stable items come at a significant cost, potentially increasing the risk of a variety of health problems. By making informed choices and opting for fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, we can take a significant step towards safeguarding both our physical and mental health. Dr Sangeetha, a registered dietitian with over 12 years of experience in the food and fitness industry, sheds light on the implications of this research and offers practical advice for navigating a healthier dietary path. “The artificial flavours and taste enhancers in UPFs can be very addictive. People often underestimate how much they’re consuming, thinking ‘just one or two servings’ won’t hurt. But psychologically, it’s hard to stop, leading to a minimum of five servings a day. This not only increases calorie intake but also creates a feeling of constant hunger due to the lack of satiety from UPFs.” “Since UPFs often lack fibre, essential for gut bacteria, processing further depletes it. Unlike whole fruits, where even unsweetened juice loses some fibre content, UPFs have virtually no fibre to feed your gut bacteria, ultimately impacting gut health.” “Certain additives in UPFs can activate the dopamine system in the brain, mimicking pleasurable sensations. Sugary foods create a dopamine spike, leading to a ‘pleasure trap’ that keeps us craving more. This, combined with the lack of fibre in UPFs, contributes to overeating and obesity.” “While avoiding all processed foods might seem unrealistic, there are solutions. Cook more meals at home with healthy ingredients, even for dishes like pasta. Opt for healthier options when buying packaged foods. By making informed choices, we can significantly reduce our UPF intake and improve our overall health.” So, next time you reach for that convenient frozen meal or sugary snack, remember the hidden costs to your health, and opt for whole, unprocessed alternatives to nourish your body and mind. children / healthy lifestyle / lifestyle diseases / food / nutrition and diet / In School BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - May 07, 2024 05:13 pm IST Freepik | Photo Credit: Freepik Heatstroke is an important condition to know about that can happen when your body overheats and can’t cool down. Heatstroke occurs when the body overheats to an extreme level, leading to a malfunction in its cooling system. Unlike heat exhaustion, which is less severe and typically involves heavy sweating and feeling faint, heatstroke is a critical condition where the body’s temperature regulation fails entirely. In essence, it’s like your body’s internal thermostat going haywire, potentially causing damage to vital organs and even proving fatal if not treated promptly. Symptoms To recognise heat stroke before it escalates, keep an eye out for key warning signs. Kids should be aware of symptoms such as hot, dry skin, confusion, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and nausea. These symptoms occur when the body’s internal temperature regulation system becomes overwhelmed by the heat. When the body can’t cool down efficiently through sweating, it leads to dehydration and a rise in core body temperature. This, in turn, triggers a cascade of physiological responses, including confusion and an elevated heart rate, as the body struggles to cope with the heat stress. Keeping yourself hydrated, wearing lighter clothes and using sunscreen is the most common action to beat the heat. The sun is strongest between 10 am and 4 pm, so plan outdoor activities for the cooler parts of the day, like early mornings or evenings. CC BY-SA 3.0, Link Expert advice We spoke to Prof. Dr. P. Saravanakumar, MD, DNB Pediatrics, PhD, who has been an expert in the field for 17 years. Dr. Saravanakumar’s insights into heatstroke prevention and management are invaluable, particularly during the hot summer months when children are most vulnerable. While children love playing outside during vacations, they can easily forget to stay hydrated in the heat. This can lead to dehydration, which is the loss of water in the body. Dr. Saravanakumar warns that dehydration can cause: “The first step always when about to get a heatstroke is to take the child to a cool place and drink cold water, lower the body temperature.” Dr. Saravanakumar MD, DNB Pediatrics, PhD Cold treats and summer changes can worsen dehydration Dr. Saravanakumar highlights that while children may crave cold drinks and ice cream to quench their thirst, these sugary treats don’t effectively rehydrate them. He emphasises that these choices, along with changes in summer eating habits (like consuming more outside food), can lead to: Upper respiratory infections: Cold drinks can irritate the throat, potentially increasing susceptibility to coughs, colds, and even tonsillitis. Stomach problems: Unfamiliar outside food or excessive watermelon consumption in some children can cause stomach aches and diarrhoea, further contributing to dehydration. Why children are more susceptible to heatstroke “Body wise, children have more surface area to their body mass than adults. So because the surface area is very high and their skin texture is also softer and thinner, these make the children have a higher risk of exhaustion, sweating, excess evaporation, when compared to adults.” Higher surface area to body mass ratio Compared to adults, children have more skin exposed relative to their body size. This larger surface area allows them to heat up faster and lose heat slower. Research indicates that children sweat less overall than adults, limiting their ability to cool down through sweating, which puts them at a greater risk of overheating. Additionally, their developing bodies have a less efficient system for dissipating heat compared to adults. These factors combine to make children more susceptible to heat-related illnesses, underscoring the importance of proactive measures to prevent heatstroke and ensure their well-being during hot weather. Taking action Dr. Saravanakumar outlines the crucial steps to take if you suspect heatstroke in a child: Stay alert: Monitor the child’s alertness and continue offering fluids orally if they are awake and responsive. By Videoplasty.com, CC BY-SA 4.0 , Link Hydration is key While there’s no one-size-fits-all water intake recommendation, here’s a general guideline: Children under 5 years : Aim for 820 ml to 1 litre of fluids per day. Children up to 13 years : Around 3 litres of fluids per day. It’s important to offer fluids throughout the day, not just when a child feels thirsty. Water is ideal, but juices and milk can also contribute to hydration. Remember, electrolyte balance is important, so consider incorporating options with some sodium content. “One interesting pattern observed for the past few years is that earlier heat stroke cases would come only during summer seasons but now it may come any time of the year. This might be an effect of climate change as well. There have been more recent cases of heat exhaustion,” said Dr Saravanakumar children / parent and child / health / healthy lifestyle / weather science / weather BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Little hands contort into a 2,000-year-old mudra. Fingertips touch, neurons fire, and that little brain processes neuroplasticity at a magnitude that is still misunderstood. Classical dance has been scientifically documented by several prestigious research organisations such as Sarah Lawrence University and the National Institues of Health, Maryland. Not only does classical dance have documented mental health benefits, classical music has also been well-researched as both a complementary treatment for several major disorders, and a healthy practice for general well being. Albert Einstein Medical College executed a study comparing the brain scans of subjects prescribed treadmill walking for six months versus those prescribed ballroom dancing. Dance was found to prevent cognitive decline and reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s. Indian classical dance has been lauded for its neurobiological complexity. The nuance of hand-eye coordination specifically operates through neuroplasticity — our brain’s ability to change through growth and reorganisation, utilising its neural networks. There is an overwhelming amount of research in favour of the mudra, both in a yogic and dance context. If we examine the practice of mudras in dance, it is apparent that there is an underlying significance to the choice of fingers touching as well as the movement of the actual hand itself. Laura Wimberger, a neurological meditation practitioner, has developed a modality of training the brain called neurosculpting. In her practice, the left and right hands often move in different directions and hold different gestures. She explains how these practices increase memory, protect neural function and utilise different parts of the brain. One cannot help but correlate her practices to the gestural depiction of performing aarthi in classical dance. The shikara mudra remains firmly planted in the left hand, shaking like a bell, while the pataka mudra assumed by the right hand maintains a clean horizontal line while drawing a circle in the air. This simple gesture has within it over seven different mechanisms to nourish, tone and protect the brain! Yet with so many overwhelming benefits, it feels as though practicing dancers seem to be constantly under stress. Indian classical dance has become so competitive that young dancers often feel an overwhelming pressure to keep up with their peers and produce new repertoire on command. Social media presence is almost mandated in the current scenario, placing even more pressure on young dancers and musicians to give a glimpse of their yoga routine, studio work, practice sessions and even the occasional recreation of a film song. Are they reaping the true benefits of the art? When one examines the history of Indian classical dance practices, it becomes apparent that the dance cannot be divorced from the temples and the courts. While hereditary dancers might have had healthy competition amongst themselves, one wonders if it can compare to fighting for a slot at a sabha during the December Season or for an award. When the purpose of a form was to immerse oneself in devotion, or even to entertain the audience, innovation becomes an extension of creativity and not a race for survival. It is on the proscenium that dance has found its most cut-throat form — from televised competitions to festivals that award innovative choreography. To take a form that was designed for self-expression and standardise it into a ruthless, athletic race is perhaps one of the reasons why so many dancers struggle to find joy in the profession. While the dance itself always remains a source of solace, the networks around it tend to deplete dancers of their mental peace. In Australia, artistes are 20 times more likely to have mental health issues, and in the U.K. more than 46 per cent report below average mental health. Such studies haven’t been done at scale in India, but it would be not be surprising if the numbers were an extension of the global trend. Artistes are often isolated, and it appears that those with better social skills tend to secure better opportunities. What kind of ecosystem do we want to build for our future? What direction should Indian classical dance and music move in? While it is impossible to find all the answers, perhaps changing contexts will help young artistes. Several senior practitioners still maintain the habit of performing in temples for example, which is a deeply personal and grounding experience that help them define their art. Improvisational dance is another way of connecting to one’s own creative mind to transcend the external noise. Whatever the means may be, we need our dancers to stay content for, the joy that they bring us is nothing short of therapy. Indian classical dance has been lauded for its neurobiological complexity.

City-based Queer Women Collective (QWC) has been instrumental in setting the stage for queer artistes to share stories and talk about various topics, with a touch of humour. Meherin at an event | Photo Credit: Special arrangement QWC took off in May 2020 with an online event. “Queer women and non-binary folks went through a lot of pressure as people moved back to their hometowns during COVID. Going back to the family was not a great experience for everybody,” recalls QWC founder Apoorva Gupta, who found very few spaces for queer women to sit and talk. Audience during a session | Photo Credit: special arrangement The virtual meet-ups led to physical stand-up events and open mics. A little fun and jokes around their experiences lightened their hearts and made them feel a little safe. Stand-up sessions held at cafes and the two editions of Queer Indie Film & Lit Fest picked up pace over the year. “Stand-up comedy is also storytelling; making one feel connected, related, and still laugh about it,” says Apoorva, who narrates her coming-out, dating experiences, and more on stage. It has been a year since Meherin, a therapist with Pause for Perspective, a mental health organisation performed as a comedian at their centre during Pride month. In a room of queer folks and allies, Meherin’s set also included their experiences as a therapist. “I’m a queer Muslim and a non-binary person; this perspective is effective in looking at oppression with a touch of humour,” they says. K Vaishali | Photo Credit: special arrangement K Vaishali, a technical writer , transforms into a stand-up artiste in the evenings, “I enjoy performing for the queer community,” says Vaishali who identifies as cis and lesbian. Being a writer — her book Homeless: Growing up Lesbian and Dyslexic in India won the recent Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar — helps her look at life with a different lens; this perspective as well as her experience as a gamer inform her stand-up material. She might not be a serious comedian, but she goes outside her comfort zone to have fun and experiment. Apoorva Gupta | Photo Credit: special arrangement Vaishali doesn’t need any filters when performing for the queer community; she can speak on whatever she thinks. “I don’t have to explain because the audience includes mostly queer or allies who understand the queer subculture. I can be as unhinged and unfiltered as everyone understands .” An example was the way she imagined the Sherlock Holmes series as a lesbian love story and made jokes about how everyone knows a lesbian who looks like the Sherlock Holmes character from the series and how most people even have an ex who behaves like the Sherlock character. “Many people, I think, related to that because I got a lot of laughs, but I could never translate this joke to a straight audience.” During a session | Photo Credit: special arrangement With over ten performances to date, Meherin marks the shaping of queer comedy scene in the city also as a creative response to homophobia within the stand-up community. “It’s sad, but it’s twice as hard for me or any queer artiste to go out and deal with homophobia from within the stand-up comedy circuit and from the audience. It’s not like I can’t make a whole crowd laugh.” However, the artiste underlines the importance of not performing only about queer identity. “I’m a queer person who has opinions about the world, like everybody else. These curated spaces for queer artists are also affirming that our lives in the world are as equals.” Meherin | Photo Credit: special arrangement From checking videos of other standup comics to reading, these artistes review their acts periodically to improve. “Even if I am queer and crack queer jokes, people would not find it funny unless it was written and delivered perfectly,” says Apoorva, who takes feedback from friends and siblings. Do the artistes face challenges? “My biggest challenge is personal, as I am a neuro-diverse person with dyslexia and dysgraphia,” says Vaishali, who has to drown out the noise around her to focus. (Her trick is to start with a question, “How many of them are friends with their ex?’ to make the audience pay attention.) Her neuro-diverse condition adds another layer of challenge to deliver jokes with the same kind of energy. While queer stand-up shows are held at Trailing Ivy cafe, WeWork in Kondapur and Cafe Rasasvada (shut now), the team can put up an act depending on the budget. “ Before we decide a venue we speak to staff to ensure they are aware of LGBTQIA+ terms, don’t misgender and have an affirming stance. This ensures that our audience also can come the way they are,” says Apoorva as she is about to finalise an LGBTQ+ friendly venue in the city to hold monthly open-mic and stand-up events, from July. Meherin hopes, “People have to be as affirming as they are with everybody else.” The Hindu MetroPlus / Hyderabad / lifestyle and leisure BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

This might go unnoticed, but we actually are surrounded by plants that make a difference in the way the city changes through the seasons. The Goethe-Institut Chennai, in collaboration with the Alliance Française of Madras and the Institut Français de Pondichéry (IFP) is hosting the Travelling Plants exhibition which helps us remember and think about plants, and how they have changed over the course of the country’s history. Rooted Perspectives: A Collective Response to Plant Blindness | Photo Credit: Sangita Rajan As you enter the Alliance Française of Madras through a canopy, you are first welcomed by the sight of a community project commissioned to Chennai-based artist Parvathy Nair — Rooted Perspectives: A Collective Response to Plant Blindness. Plant blindness is the tendency to overlook or undervalue plants in our environment. “If we don’t notice the plants around us when they are there, how will we notice them when they start to disappear?” asks Parvathi who invited submissions of photos and stories of plants around neighbourhoods, which were also on display. Waylon D’souza’s exhibit | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement Travelling Plants exhibition is a trans-disciplinary project curated by independent art historian Lina Vincent. The exhibition showcases art created by five artists who were part of a residency centred around the herbarium at IFP Puducherry, in March this year. Karolina Grzywnowicz (Germany), Wendy Therméa (Reunion Island, France), Danushka Marasinghe (Sri Lanka), Waylon D’souza (India), and Rashmimala (India) — were picked to be part of the residency, and by extension this exhibition for their creative practices that coincide with the Nature. The artists were presented with guidance in the form of hands-on workshops, lectures, presentations, and Nature walks. “They were given a free hand to decide what they were interested in, and each artist has taken a different direction. Their medium is different and so are their languages,” says Lina. The exhibit by Waylon D’souza explores the geological, climatological and anthropological timeline of plant histories, while Rashmimala forges connections between the legacies of colonialism, pressing environmental issues, and the enduring presence of plants. Wendy Therméa explores the unintended consequences of human intervention on ecosystems. Her work focusses on the water hyacinth, a plant whose introduction to both India and her native Reunion Island has disrupted the delicate balance of those environments. “I have been working with plants for quite some time, and for this project, I collected ground plants from the herbarium at IFP and took a print on the cyanotype paper, which produces a silhouette of the plant. Later, I filled in the details,” says Rashmimala. Berlin-based Karolina Grzywnowicz’s artwork was a deep dive into the understanding of socio-political conditioning of plants and plant matter. Her study and art focusses on how colonisation as well as the activities by the Forest Department then have changed the landscape of the Nilgiris and interacted with the Toda community to understand the landscape and changes better. Travelling Plants exhibition, as the name suggests, will travel to four other Indian cities — Pune, Delhi, Bengaluru, and Kolkata, and then set sail to Colombo. In each city, the exhibition is going to add its own local elements apart from the main exhibits. Rashmimala’s exhibit | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement “People were waiting for this project to start, and we happened to be the first to bring up the idea. This enthusiasm is not just a Chennai thing, because this exhibition is going to travel to Kolkata after this, and it is going to be showcased together with Botanical drawings from the East India archive, giving it a completely different context again,” says Katharina Görgen, director, Goethe-Institut Chennai at the inauguration of the show which presented guests with floral drinks, plant-based food, Nature themed make-up kiosks and a mehendi artist who drew the audience’s palms with minimalist Arabic-style designs. The exhibition in Chennai will also be accompanied by panel discussions, Nature walks, botanical sketching for art enthusiasts and multiple workshops including ones on terrariums, cyanotypes and how to make your own flower tiaras, among others, which require separate registration. The Travelling Plants exhibition will be on display at the Alliance Française of Madras until June 29. For more information log on to @afmadras on Instagram.

Today, countries like Singapore, France, the UAE and Sri Lanka are using the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) to simplify trade. In centuries past and under the colonial apparatus, the rupee was used for much the same reason. Even until the 1960s, you could take your rupees and spend them in the Gulf countries, just like you would at home. The history of how the national denomination of India originated, circulated and was consolidated to emerge as a ‘global’ currency is fascinating. The rupee is widely believed to be an ‘invention’ of Sher Shah Suri (ruled 1540-1545), the Afghan sultan of Delhi and founder of the short-lived Suri kingdom, although the etymology of the word ‘ rupiah ’ itself can be derived from the Sanskrit rupa or rupya , which meant either ‘fashioned/wrought silver’ or ‘a form or impression’. Suri organised coinage into two denominations: the silver rupiya weighing one tola or 11.66 grams and the copper dam , weighing 20 grams. Forty copper dams made a silver rupiya . The sultan then established mints across his kingdom, which ensured sufficient flow of coins for use, and mandated that the states under him would make and receive payments in coins, rather than commodities.

Akbar continued with Suri’s reforms and monetary policies. When he expanded the empire of Hindustan from Kabul to Chittagong and from Kashmir to the Deccan, he set up mints across this vast expanse. Traders could trust that coins from Mughal mints would be of consistent weight and purity, so this form of currency became popular across the subcontinent. Incidentally, it was during Akbar’s reign that the word ‘ rupiya ’ first appeared on Indian currency. Akbar’s silver rupiya from the Agra Mint — double die struck, AH 1011, 1603 CE. | Photo Credit: Sarmaya Arts Foundation The bulwark of Mughal currency was a steady supply of silver brought to India by trade-hungry Europeans in the 16th century. In order to buy spices, gems and textiles, the British, Dutch, Danish and French ‘East India Companies’ had to turn their silver into a currency that was trusted and accepted everywhere. Enter the rupee. By the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Companies made the Mughal rupee a ‘trade coin’ — it was exported to territories under their control, such as Sri Lanka and Indonesia, and used in local circulation. The design of the rupee became so familiar in these countries that when they started minting their own coins, they kept the distinct Mughal imprint, complete with Farsi inscriptions.

Since the rupee had already been a familiar trade currency on the East African coast, the newly established colonies of German and British East Africa, Italian Somaliland and Portuguese Mozambique all started to issue their own ‘rupees’. The British enforced treaties to make the rupee legal tender in the Arab sheikhdoms of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the ‘Trucial States’ (the forerunners of modern UAE) and the Sultanate of Oman. A one rupee note issued for use in the Gulf | Photo Credit: Sarmaya Arts Foundation In fact, in 1956, the Reserve Bank of India launched a series of special notes to circulate exclusively in the Gulf. It was only in the 1960s, when the rupee was severely devalued, that the Arab kingdoms abandoned it and launched their own currencies. The last to abandon the Indian rupee was Oman in 1972. But five decades on, in 2022, things came full circle when the Sultanate embraced another Indian money innovation: a tech-enabled echo of the historic original called Rupay.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 20, 2024 03:15 pm IST The siris captured in late evening light | Photo Credit: Sunil Rajagopal I live near a siris ( Albizia lebbeck ). It stands shoulder-to-shoulder with a copper pod, flanked by two smooth-skinned gulmohurs . The siris , however, is not gregarious even with its own kind. It bends away from them, draping its rounded, umbrella-shaped shade gently over our yard. Trees do not like their canopies to touch. Every year, I know summer is coming from the sudden abundance of tiny, wandering red ants and colourful picturewings framed against the sky. They arrive in time for the siris blooming in a burst of fluffy white pom-poms, which slowly turn a pale yellow, emanating a mellow fragrance that lingers on at night. Ants, flies and stingless bees swarm; butterflies like the restless Green-tailed Jay and the slower, iridescent Great Egg Fly pause to settle on the flowers. The picturewings hover over the trees in small groups on stained glass wings, filtering black and yellow light from the blue sky. They look aimless and slow but are actively hunting the flower feeders. In turn, the picturewings and bees are picked off mid-air by agile Blue-tailed Bee-eaters. Other birds also join the melee on the siris — flamebacks, white-throated kingfishers, drongos and tailorbirds all making use of this feast. A Tailed Jay on a siris blossom | Photo Credit: Sunil Rajagopal A Blue tailed Bee-eater hunting near the copper pod blossoms | Photo Credit: Sunil Rajagopal The siris is an Indian native and was once fairly widespread. Kalidasa personified Parvati with its delicate flowers in his Kumarasambhava . In Tamil, it is the vaagai , legendary in Sangam literature for its connotation to victory. Legends speak of Durga gathering her strength under a vaagai , before proceeding on her war with Mahisha. For this reason, garlands of its flowers were apparently worn by warriors. Almost every part of the tree is considered useful as per Ayurvedic texts. Later, many trees with mimosa-like leaves came to be called vaagai or variations of it. In Kerala, the Madagascar-born gulmohar is often referred to as a vaaka . How many of us can recognise or name a vaagai now? How many from Kerala would know the picturewings by their Malayali name, O nathumbi — literally the dragonfly of Onam. They would typically emerge during the harvest season, during August-September, to feast on the burgeoning insect population. Built over wetlands and paddies have made them uncommon in cities, so much so that most of us have forgotten their names. The siris , too, is not as conspicuous now, ignored in places as an avenue tree due to its deciduous and reclusive nature. Under the siris canopy | Photo Credit: Sunil Rajagopal Naming something has an unseen power. Especially in nature, which many of us deem indistinguishably homogenous. Names, especially those in the local tongue, lead to stories, and stories tap into our collective memories. Learning the name of a tree or a bird or an insect often means learning something about it: its uses, its ties with local culture and geography, or its connections to other forms of life. Naming a living being is also an awareness of its position in a seasonal cycle or its place in time. Above all, we understand something best when it can be quantified, especially in terms of its usefulness. Picturewings, for example, serve as biological pest control. As creatures of all three realms — earth, water and sky — dragonflies are excellent indicators of wetland health. Terrestrial insects are declining globally at 9% per decade. This is a critical number when you consider insects pollinate 75% of global crops and 80% of wild plants. As the base of most food chains, fewer insects mean less food going around and yields dropping everywhere. An ecosystem ‘service’ that a value in billions of dollars would not do justice to. Common picturewings | Photo Credit: Sunil Rajagopal Trees like the siris also combat heat island effects (which occur when natural land cover is replaced with pavements, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat) and lower temperatures locally by several degrees. Not just by its shade but by allowing cities to perspire through leaf transpiration. They decelerate raindrops, and their roots control surface run-off to allow better percolation. Dense foliage lowers particulate and noise pollution. All this while boosting insect and bird diversity. The extent of these effects varies with species, their structural features and geographic suitability. It may be interesting to study the impact of Cyclone Michaung on Chennai last December, juxtaposed with the presence of tree cover. At a glance, it would appear that localities with more tree cover and consequentially some amount of exposed soil for drainage fared better with flooding. They are also more likely to be the places with usable ground water availability. Unfortunately, public parks and privately owned gardens take up a lion’s share of our urban green spaces. Making trees an indicator also of discrepancies in socio-economic well-being, sustainability and liveability of a city. The author is a birder and writer based in Chennai.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 21, 2024 10:23 am IST Student volunteers at Seedscape at Durbar Hall Art Gallery, Kochi | Photo Credit: NITHIN RK The Durbar Hall Art Gallery has temporarily transformed into an architectural studio. Some parts of the walls have been covered in mirrors and drawings. White-painted metallic columns erected here and there appear to give a new spin to the cavernous gallery space. The fifth edition of Seedscape, an annual exhibition of works done by the students of Seed — APJ Abdul Kalam School of Environmental Design, Muvattupuzha, is an intersection of architecture and art. The models, like art installations, engage with the viewer and inspire thought. It also brings the essence of a modern-day architecture classroom to the mainstream. The walls are full of drawings and sketches, photographs and notes about basic architectural concepts and their relevance in today’s climate-conscious building ethos. Over 550 models and material experiments of 120 students from across batches have been displayed. Curated by Cochin Creative Collective, the expo sheds light on how architects interpret space in a functional and aesthetic sense. The exhibits on display at Seedscape | Photo Credit: NITHIN RK It may seem a little challenging for a lay person to make sense of an architectural exhibition, but the student volunteers take the viewers along the exhibits, ready to help with information. “It is a great experience for us students as we get to meet people and there is an exchange of ideas,” say Gopika PJ and Niranjana KP, first semester students. One part of the gallery wall is covered in textures, tiny cardboard models of buildings stuck to the wall and paintings of three different kinds. Akhilesh Chandran and Fathima Fidha, semester four, explain how the work is a representation of a building’s relationship with its surroundings. “The way buildings have to be constructed on low, moderate and high lands would be very different taking into consideration how land influences and shapes the design,” says Akhilesh. “Low land chosen for this study is Kumbalangi in Kochi, moderate land is Muvattupuzha and high land is Vagamon,” adds Fathima. Divided into six groups, the students spent some time at their designated areas, studying the region, the existing conditions and interacted with the local population for the study. “I was in the group assigned to Kumbalangi and we learnt so much about its unique mangrove ecosystem. We had to think about building materials and their longevity that don’t disturb the delicate ecosystem. Our exhibit proposes stilts for the buildings in the region,” says Azar Anvar, also a semester four student. The architectural models on display at Seedscape | Photo Credit: NITHIN RK The idea of the expo is to get the students’ work out of the campus and into the community, says Rajasekharan Menon, academic chair, Seed. “Architecture is an interactive discipline; it can easily connect with people. Over the five editions, Seed has been able to reach out to people,” he says. “The exhibits deal with a variety of topics such as basics of architectural language, relationship between building and landscape, climate responsive design, materiality and detailing, housing and urbanism. We plan to conduct the exhibition on a large scale every year,” he adds. While the first two editions of Seedscape were held on the campus, the third edition was held at Mattancherry alongside the Kochi Muziris Biennale. Seedscape includes talks by graphic designers, filmmakers, social entrepreneurs and environmentalists at the venue every day at 5.30pm. A film screening on architecture and related fields will also be held at 5pm every day. The show is on till June 23.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 20, 2024 06:10 pm IST Clockwise from top left: Rudy Mukta, Govind Thampi, Haniya Nafisa, Arjuna Harjai, and Anoushka Maskey Anoushka Maskey’s 2020 song ‘September Embers’ has all the makings of an international hit. The folk pop tones have global appeal, and at over 1,28,000 streams on Spotify, it’s fair to say it has its own audience. Her song was not made in some state-of-the-art studio, but with producer Pranay Bakshi aka Cosmic Grooves at his home studio. The Sikkim-origin, Mumbai-based singer-songwriter, who started out by recording guitars and ukulele through a USB microphone on her Macbook, has since steadily upgraded to a “humble set-up” consisting of monitor speakers, electric guitar, MIDI keyboard, and a condenser microphone. “For me, there is no longing for a time in the future when I’ll have more equipment or resources. All the resources are already there,” says Maskey. Anoushka Maskey Down South, Kerala indie artist Haniya Nafisa has over 1,86,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, attracting a chunk of her over 3 lakh Instagram followers with homemade covers of popular songs. With a few film songs in her catalogue, she can evoke the intimacy of a lo-fi electronic pop sound on songs like ‘U good?’. “The quality of music or an artist is not dependent on the resources,” says Nafisa, who recorded ‘U good?’ in her bedroom — a collaboration with Gujarat-origin artist Krameri and Kerala producer 6091. Indie artist Haniya Nafisa A genre-wise look at bedroom studio artists reveal pop, lo-fi, indie-folk and even hip-hop. These styles are popular perhaps because the songs don’t call for live recorded drums (like in rock or metal) or string sections (for more ambitious pop). Here, everything can be added through beat packs, sound libraries, plug-ins and digital audio workstations. Bedroom-produced music has been around for a while — from the Beach Boys in the 1960s (who recorded what are now considered the first two ‘lo-fi’ albums in 1967) to punk bands and the No Wave genre, and later, hip-hop producers. And like all movements in art, there’s a certain cyclical nature involved. Over the last decade, the rapid digitalisation of music making and distribution has fuelled this trend, and the pandemic helped the DIY music movement gain traction faster, especially among Indian musicians. They followed in the footsteps of performers such as slacker rock artist Mac DeMarco, singer-songwriter Billie Eilish — whose Grammy winning album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? , was recorded in her brother’s bedroom — and British singer Kenya Grace. The electronic-pop artist’s song ‘Strangers’, from her 2023 album The After Taste , was recorded entirely in her Hampshire bedroom, and it not only went viral but also topped the Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart last October. Closer home, Indian artists have become aware of the ease and economic logic behind knowing how to produce one’s own music. Where before it was solely compelled by a lack of resources, now it’s a creative decision as it gives artists control over every aspect of the production. “How I use what I have and how I collaborate with my community makes all the difference,” states Maskey. Arjuna Harjai, based in the U.K., is known as the One Minute Composer. Through the YouTube series — in which he thinks up song ideas, seated at his home setup with his wife Divya Harjai — he says he is “rediscovering the joy of music-making”. The series, which launched this January, was spurred on by his subscribers pushing him to innovate “and present music in a more raw manner”, akin to a vlog. This has led to songs like ‘Winter ayun waliye’ and ‘Mangoge na?’, which have blown up on social media, with over 8,57,000 views and 67,000 views on YouTube, respectively. Arjuna Harjai The power of the internet and the democratisation of technology mean artists have access to a lot of music-making gizmos. Think digital audio workstations such as Steinberg Cubase, and compact, affordable recording equipment. Grace has talked about relying on her intuition and YouTube tutorials to master recording software Logic for The After Taste album. And for those who want to scale up, there are a plethora of music distributors today who offer better reach through editorial playlist placements, AI-assisted marketing tools, and opportunities to pitch to music festivals. “After talking to a few artist friends, I found that DistroKid [an independent digital music distribution service] is affordable,” shares Nafisa, whose song ‘U good?’ is part of Spotify’s Malayalam Indie playlist. “It was easy to understand and navigate as a platform, and the artist gets a lot of freedom.” It runs on a yearly fee and lets artists release their content when they want. In Bengaluru, Rudy Mukta is also considering a bigger set-up. “I like the idea of slowly building up and learning about home studio equipment,” says the Toto Music Award-winning singer-songwriter, who started out with her friend’s iPad. “But I want to incorporate more live instrumentation in my songs.” And this will require professional intervention. Rudy Mukta | Photo Credit: Lendrick Kumar Artists, however, are wary about music distribution companies because they charge more for add-on services, and some take a cut of the revenue generated from streams. Still, companies such as Gurgaon-headquartered MADverse are justifying their prices. Founder and CEO Rohan Nesho Jain says they provide tools to bolster the DIY ethos of bedroom musicians, including an AI art cover generation tool. “We also offer data-driven insights that assist artists in understanding their audience and honing their strategies.” Over 51,000 artists from 60 countries have signed up to release music or use other MADverse services, with a significant chunk of them making pop and indie music. “Hip-hop and rap also have a significant presence, showing the versatility and storytelling skills of independent musicians in a variety of regional tongues,” he adds. Rohan Nesho Jain of MADverse Compared to the year-old MADverse, Ritnika Nayan, the founder of music company MGMH, offers a different kind of interaction. Early last month, they launched their distribution service MGMH Groove, and they hope to be a conduit for artists to put their music on Spotify editorial playlists, take it on the road with a tour, and have it placed in TV shows or movies. “In a sense, the artist gets the support they require without signing exclusively to a label. We want artists to be empowered,” says Nayan, adding that they’ve got 15 releases scheduled and over 25 accounts in their first week. Ritnika Nayan of MGMH Singer-songwriter Govind Thampi Artists have their wishlists, too. Doha-raised Indian singer-songwriter Govind Thampi aka Thumpii, for instance, wants “more reliable ways of sending your music to playlist editors and other promotion partners”. Considering the rising number of bedroom artists today, they will soon be dictating more terms to distributors. The writer is a Bengaluru-based independent music journalist.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Updated - June 20, 2024 11:10 am IST Published - June 20, 2024 09:24 am IST Humour makes a comeback in advertising It’s like when Gretchen in Mean Girls , the iconic teen-flick parody, said, “That is so fetch!” and Regina, the film’s queen bee, bursts her bubble, “Gretchen, stop trying to make fetch happen! It’s not going to happen!” In advertising, humour is ‘fetch,’ and global award juries seem to be Regina. Why else would Cannes Lions announce a humour category across disciplines starting this year? It’s because advertising is having a hard time laughing. Remember how hilarious ads were a couple of decades ago? Fevicol’s fishing rod was particularly a favourite in my household, followed closely by Asian Paints’ ‘ Naya ghar... badhiya hai ’. It was powerful when ads made you laugh. Those of you familiar with the advertising award landscape have seen trends come and go, and would know why I refer to humour as a thing of the past. Part of that is genuinely funny work not getting the biggest nods on global stages; causevertising has taken its place. It’s understandable; the global zeitgeist is not in a great place. We’re currently in the middle of two global conflicts, polarised political opinions, confusing social codes, and to top it all off, a pandemic that shaved off three-ish years of laughs. Don’t get me wrong, the world undeniably needs powerful and impactful work such as Bodyform’s ‘Womb Stories’ in 2023, which dealt with the emotion, grief, and excitement that often comes with being a woman; Nike’s ‘Dream Crazy’ in 2020, that focused on brands being agents of change; or Calm’s ‘The Last Photo’ from last year, a campaign for suicide prevention. Even the ‘Unfiltered History Tour’, a guerrilla tour of the British Museum’s stolen artefacts — which landed India its first ‘Agency of the year’ title at Cannes Lions last year — was as purpose-led as it gets. Nike’s ‘Dream Crazy’ Calm’s ‘The Last Photo’ But not all such campaigns are executed with the same sincerity. Wokewashing is as deadly as being tone-deaf. As more brands embraced purpose and action, few remained committed to their causes. This has unfortunately led to a ‘syllabus-ification’ of creativity where purpose and humour aren’t mutually exclusive. I agree with what Andrew Robertson, CEO of BBDO Worldwide, said last year at Cannes Lions: “There’s a sort of misguided belief that brand purpose needs to be presented in a very serious way. And I don’t think it does... If brands are truly looking to make the world a better place, we could do a lot worse than make people laugh.” “Humour cuts through the noise. We live in a state of constant assault on our senses, but if something is funny, you’ll seek it out. It doesn’t mean we shy away from tough stuff, humour is one of the best ways to deal with rough things going on in the world” Kenan Thompson of ‘Saturday Night Live’, speaking at Cannes Lions 2024 Laughter is not the opposite of sadness. Happiness is the opposite of sadness. Laughter is a reaction, and it can exist in both situations — a neglected truth pointed out by Daniel Sloss, a Scottish comedian. When the world goes up in flames, it still needs a jester for hope. Every laugh then becomes a tiny revolution. So, why not award more funny ads? Why do we need a separate award category for it? Picture two scenarios in a jury room: one, where some jurors feel they’re unable to award humour-led work because of purpose-led work dominating, and two, where jurors feel humour-led work is getting ‘over-awarded’ despite the lack of a precise category fit. Whichever side you’re on, a separate category for humour feels like a win-win. Brands and creatives have been given their holy trifecta — love, laughs, and roars. It’s the fiercest opportunity to stop underutilising the inventiveness of humour. And contrary to the worry that it is harder to make humour work across multi-platforms, I’d say humour is like a Swiss army knife that cuts through platforms. It can turn puns into PR, like CeraVe’s campaign with Michael Cera, rewrite the rules of hospitality as seen with Artotel Group’s ‘Rockstar Status’, and even make hyaluronic acid funny, as demonstrated by The Ordinary’s ‘Science over Celebrity’. So what can we expect from this new category in the years ahead? I’m thrilled at the prospect that the next decade of advertising could be a multinational collaboration, where we borrow and learn from Thailand’s exaggerated, slapstick humour, such as Thai Life Insurance’s ‘Unsung Hero’, or South Africa’s political satire with campaigns like Nando’s ‘Last Dictator Standing’. Imagine defying the dichotomous nature of humour in South Asia too — the kind where we crack jokes in ‘safe places’, not public spaces because we think it is ‘anti-culture’. For instance, ours isn’t a region that’s used to being sold anything via sarcasm. But as the region rapidly changes, our appetite for new genres of humour could proportionally rise. The last few years have shown us the kind of brilliant, funny work we can make. Will those make us proud on the world’s biggest stages? It’s exciting times ahead, and that is so fetch.

Filmmaker Payal Kapadia garnered significant attention and accolades for her film, All We Imagine As Light . Also, at the Bharat Parv event, playback singer Shaan took pride in introducing three emerging pop stars, including his 18-year-old son, Maahi, to the audience. The talented teenager who debuted with his video single ‘Sorry’ early this year, has come out with his second single, ‘Jaadugari’ produced by his older brother, Soham. Unperturbed by the scale of the forum, the teenager impressed the audience with his performance, and the family cherished every moment. After returning to Mumbai, Shaan, Maahi, and Soham joined a video call to share their Cannes experience, bond over music, and reflect on their journeys. Their conversation was filled with laughter, memories, and a deep appreciation for the time spent together as a family. Shaan, sandwiched between his sons to fit into the frame, says, “Soham graduated from the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, which was a proud moment for us as parents. We first had the joy of witnessing his graduation ceremony and were thrilled to see Maahi’s first international performance. It has been a wonderful and memorable year for our family.” Maahi describes his experience at Cannes as “incredible”. “The opportunity was mind-blowing. I have to admit that I was a bit nervous at first. But having the support of my family helped calm those nerves. Cannes is such a special place, filled with people who appreciate art in all its forms. It was an amazing experience to be there.” For Soham, producing ‘Jadugari’ was special mainly because it involved his brother, Mahi. He says, “Typically, my production work is quite solitary, following artiste briefs and creating music accordingly. However, this project was different. Having Mahi involved added a personal touch that elevated the entire process. His input and our shared creativity made the production feel incredibly organic and effortless, alongside composer Sudan Bhosle,” adding, “It’s a project that holds a special place for both of us, not just as artistes, but as brothers creating something meaningful together.” Shaan’s album Tanha Dil, released in the late 1990s, was a significant milestone in his career, marking his rise as a prominent pop star in the Indian music scene. Could the song ‘Sorry’ be considered the breakthrough track for Maahi? He is hesitant to make such a comparison. While acknowledging that ‘Sorry’ might be a step towards achieving such success, Maahi does not see ‘Sorry’ as equal to ‘Tanha Dil’ at this point. “My priority is to consistently release more music and connect with my audience through quality”. Mahi acknowledges the resemblance in voice to his father’s but emphasises his effort to maintain his individual musical identity. “I value dad’s advice about drawing inspiration from diverse artistes. I want to integrate all the influences and discover my unique style and expression. Soham’s approach to his education and a prospective career in the music industry later, is strategic and forward-thinking. Opting for a Bachelor of Science in Music Industry at USC, he prioritised law, business, and technology over traditional music training, leveraging his existing musical foundation. “I intend to navigate contracts, production deals, and copyright issues. This will blend artistic expression with business acumen,” says Soham. Shaan says there’s no pressure on his sons to follow in his footsteps | Photo Credit: Special arrangement Shaan has been supportive but has a hands-off approach to nurturing his sons’ musical talents since their childhood. He says he gradually noticed their inclination towards music despite initially focussing on academics and sports. “Both of them were doing very well in academics, sports and other activities in school. Soham finished his graduation, but there’s no pressure on Maahi to do it. I did not impose formal training on them but allowed them to explore music alongside their other interests. Over time, as their passion for music grew stronger, I accepted their choice and encouraged them to pursue it wholeheartedly.” Soham shares that while there is no pressure from their parents to pursue music, there is an inherent external pressure due to their family background. “This pressure isn’t direct but exists in the environment and privilege we grew up in. We are proud of our family’s achievements and want to live up to our parents’ legacy.” Mahi agrees with Soham, seeing pressure as a positive force that keeps them motivated and striving to improve. With both his songs, ‘Sorry’ and ’Jadugari’, being pop love songs, Maahi is ready to accept that image and says he does not want to take himself too seriously yet; his focus is on continuing to make music in this genre. Regarding all three working together on a project, Shaan sees it as a good idea and suggests it might happen eventually. He says, “There are some legalities and contractual obligations to clear, but Ï am optimistic that we can work around those challenges to create music together in the future.” The Hindu MetroPlus BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

A representative of the Banjara tribe in Telangana, Ramesh Karthik Nayak, 26, is one such voice. He comes from the tribal thanda of Vivek Nagar in the Jakranpally mandal of the Nizamabad district. Nayak is the youngest and the first Telugu author to be honoured with the prestigious Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar 2024 for his collection of short stories Dhavlo (Song of Lament, 2021). His literary journey spans four books – three short story collections and one collection of poetry – all written in the Banjari language in Telugu and English scripts. Besides garnering several awards and features in international and national publications, his writing has been included in university curricula across institutions in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Reflecting on his own lived experiences, he depicts the reality of the indigenous nomadic community of the Banjaras, also known as Lambadas, who are originally from Rajasthan but are now scattered across the country. “I used to scribble poems in the back of my school notebooks since I was a child, and scorned by my teachers who often tried to stop me from writing. But I knew my calling; I wanted my Banjara community to have a voice,” recalls Nayak. After passing Class X at SVSHS Bodhan, he undertook several odd jobs such as catering, distributing leaflets, selling books at events, and even repairing ACs, before his foray into writing. “Once my first collection of poems Balder Bandi was published in 2018, there was no looking back,” he says. Nayak is the first writer to open a window into the Banjaras’ way of life, their culture, and heritage for contemporary readers. His work explores the politics of identity and belonging, the innate beauty of the nomadic landscape, and the myriad challenges faced by the tribal community. “The Banjara identity is extremely fragmented, our festivals are hybridised, the colourful and flamboyant attires are now slowly fading, and the oral history is increasingly lost in translation. I want to capture the essence of our community, as we have remained hidden from mainstream literary spaces for a long time,” he emphasises. While his award-winning Dhavlo (2021), in Banjari , delves into the nitty-gritty of Banjara life, his collection of Banjari poems Chakmak (2023), written in English digs deeper into the displacement and crises that nomadic tribes experience. Here, Nayak questions the concept of an ‘origin’ and evokes the loneliness that comes with being uprooted. Through his work, he aims to throw light on the talent that lies in the shadows. “This award [Sahitya Akademi] and media coverage are attracting more attention toward my tribe and other tribal communities in the Telugu states; it is also a rare instance of tribal talent being recognised. Now the nation can see the talent that lies in the margins and in self-taught artists who come from little to no privilege,” he says.

File | Photo Credit: AFP China included the death penalty for \"particularly serious\" cases among judicial guidelines on criminal punishments for \"diehard\" supporters of Taiwanese independence published on June 21, state media reported. Beijing views democratic Taiwan as part of its own territory and has refused to renounce using force to unify with the self-ruled island one day. It has stepped up pressure on Taipei in recent years and held war games around the island last month following the inauguration of its new leader Lai Ching-te. State news agency Xinhua said on Friday Beijing had released a notice about punishing \"Taiwan independence' diehards for splitting the country and inciting secession\". It said the notice specified the death penalty for \"ringleaders\" of independence efforts who \"cause particularly serious harm to the state and the people\". Other leading advocates could face jail terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment, the notice said, according to Xinhua. Taipei hit back swiftly, saying Beijing \"has no legal jurisdiction at all over Taiwan\" and that the rules \"had no binding force on our people\". \"The actions of the Beijing authorities will only provoke confrontation between the peoples across the Taiwan Strait... and are not conducive to positive developments in cross-Strait ties,\" the island's Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement. According to Xinhua, Beijing's notice targets those who form \"secessionist organisations\" or direct people to \"carry out activities that split the state\". It also takes aim at attempts to \"change Taiwan's legal status as a part of China\", promote exchanges between Taiwan and sovereign nations, or \"distort or falsify the fact that Taiwan is part of China in the fields of education, culture, history (or) news media\". Also Read | China Embassy says no such thing as ‘president’ of Taiwan region The rules take effect in China from Friday, Xinhua said. Top security official Sun Ping told a news briefing in Beijing on Friday that the guidelines meant \"the sharp sword of legal action will always hang high\" over alleged secessionists, the state-run People's Daily reported. Mr. Sun said the rules \"do not target most Taiwanese compatriots, only an extremely small minority\" of independence advocates, according to the newspaper. Mr. Lai, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party who took office on May 20, has hewn closely to the position of his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen that Taiwan is effectively already independent and so has no need to declare it formally. Beijing has branded Mr. Lai a \"dangerous separatist\" and has not conducted top-level communications with Taipei since 2016. It continues to maintain a near-daily presence of naval vessels and warplanes around Taiwan and held three-day drills last month dubbed Joint Sword-2024A that it said were a test of its ability to seize control of the island.

    "article_content": "To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US Published - June 22, 2024 08:06 am IST - Lobos In the booming agricultural area of Buenos Aires, silos overflow at the end of the harvest. Farmers are delaying sales while waiting for the ultra-liberal President, Javier Milei, to whom they gave their vote, to eliminate taxes and exchange barriers. | Photo Credit: AFP In the pampas, Argentina's vast and fertile grasslands outside Buenos Aires, grain silos overflow with this year's harvest — but nobody is selling just yet. Though the country's farmers largely gave their votes to President Javier Milei in the November election, they now want him to deliver on promises to slash taxes and ease exchange rate controls. Until then, their bumper harvest will sit. \"The silos are full. One sells just enough to cover expenses,\" Ricardo Semino, a farmer from Lobos, 110 kilometres (68 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires, told AFP as he finished harvesting his corn and wheat fields. \"Those who can wait, do so.\" After the country's worst drought in a century saw agricultural exports plummet, leading to a shortfall of $20 billion in revenue, the industry is expecting an excellent harvest in 2024. The latest estimate from the Rosario Board of Trade indicates that the grain harvest could yield 131.1 million tons, a sharp rise from the 82.2 million tons gathered in the previous year. But farmers say that low global prices and the delay in freeing up the exchange rate at which producers can sell their goods abroad have complicated the seemingly good news. Agriculture is a major part of Argentina's economy, accounting for 55% of the country's exports. It is among the world's largest food producers, ranking third in soybeans behind only Brazil and the United States. Argentina usually sells about 70% of its agro-industrial production, while the rest goes into storage. Agricultural exports are estimated at $29.3 billion this year, falling short of the average $32 billion a year over the past five years. The combination of increased production and unfavourable economic conditions has left Argentina's fields dotted with \"silo bags\" — basically, tons of harvested soybeans and grains wrapped in plastic. Mr. Semino says sending grain to actual silos is a bit of a crapshoot. \"Usually you speculate when you send (the grain) to the silo plant,\" he explained. \"Nowadays the silo plants, which belong to big companies, give you the possibility to deliver the grain and you can sell it within five, six, seven months or a year.\" The Rosario Board of Trade estimates that there are some 35.6 million tons of unsold grains in the country, valued at almost $10.6 billion. Despite Mr. Milei's campaign promises, he raised taxes on exports of soybean meal and oil from 31 to 33% upon taking office. Taxes also increased on fuel. Argentina’s farmers want President Javier Milei to deliver on promises to slash taxes and ease exchange rate controls. | Photo Credit: Reuters Reforms to exchange rate controls have not been forthcoming, and no timeline has been set. Inflation, though trending down, was still at 276.4% in May year-on-year. Argentina has half a dozen dollar exchange rates. Exporters get a preferential rate, but still far less than the value of the peso on the parallel informal market (1,300 pesos to the dollar) — which is the rate producers use to pay for farming supplies. Six months into Mr. Milei's tenure, all of that translates into uncertain costs for farmers. In the past year, \"the price of a tractor went from $170,000 to $250,000,\" Mr. Semino said. Nevertheless, support for Mr. Milei persists in the countryside, with Mr. Semino explaining that a devaluation of the peso in December did help farmers. And despite all the uncertainty, the future still seems brighter. Cristian Russo, head of estimates at the Rosario Board of Trade, said strong rains had boosted projections for the wheat harvest, with a 40% higher yield expected next season. The agricultural sector does not stop production, no matter what happens in government, Mr. Semino explained. \"You get used to always moving forward,\" he said. \"Nobody is going to leave a field fallow because they are waiting for another government. You have to plant it and get the most out of it.\" World / Argentina BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

File | Photo Credit: AFP With just a week remaining before a Presidential election , Iranians are divided over whether voting will address pressing economic issues and mandatory hijab laws. Iranians head to the polls on June 28 to choose from six candidates — five conservatives and a relative reformist — to succeed Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash last month . The election comes as Iran grapples with economic pressures, international sanctions and enforcement of the compulsory headscarves for women. \"They promise change, but won't do much,\" said Hamid Habibi, a 54-year-old shop owner at Tehran's bustling Grand Bazar. \"I've watched the debates and campaigns; they speak beautifully but need to back their words with action,\" he said. Despite his scepticism, Habibi plans to vote next week. The candidates have held two debates, each pledging to tackle the financial challenges impacting the country's 85 million people. \"The economic situation is deteriorating daily, and I don't foresee any improvements,\" said Fariba, a 30-year-old who runs an online store. \"Regardless of who wins, our lives won't change,\" she said. Others, like 57-year-old baker Taghi Dodangeh, remain hopeful. \"Change is certain,\" he said, viewing voting as a religious duty and national obligation. But Jowzi, a 61-year-old housewife, expressed doubts, especially about the candidate line-up. \"There's hardly any differences between the six,\" she said. \"One cannot say any of them belongs to a different group.\" Also Read | How will Iran President’s death impact the region? Iran's Guardian Council approved six candidates after disqualifying most moderates and reformists. Leading contenders include conservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili and the sole reformist candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian. Keshvar, a 53-year-old mother, intends to vote for the candidate with the most robust economic plan. \"Young people are grappling with economic hardships,\" she said. \"Raisi made efforts, but on the ground, things didn't change much for the general public, and they were unhappy.\" In the 2021 election that brought Raisi to power, many voters stayed away, resulting in a participation rate of just under 49% — the lowest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has urged a high voter turnout. Yet, 26-year-old shopkeeper Mahdi Zeinali said he would only vote if a candidate proves to be \"the right person\". This election comes at a turbulent time, with the Gaza war raging between Iran's adversary Israel and Tehran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas, along with ongoing diplomatic tensions over Iran's nuclear programme. Compulsory hijab laws remain contentious, particularly since mass protests triggered by the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini . Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, was detained for an alleged breach of Iran's dress code for women, who are required to cover their heads and necks and wear modest clothing in public. Despite increased enforcement, many women, especially in Tehran, defy the dress code. Fariba expressed concern that after the election, \"things would go back to where they were\", and young women wouldn't be able to remove their headscarves. Jowzi, an undecided voter who wears a veil, regards it as a \"personal\" choice and opposes state interference. \"It makes no difference who becomes president,\" she said. \"What's important is what they actually do. It's not important to me whether or not they have a turban. They need to act humanely.\" World / Iran / election BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The convictions on the additional charges in the state trial come weeks after a federal judge sentenced DePape, 44, for the 2022 attack against Paul Pelosi. “Speaker Pelosi and her family remain in awe of their Pop’s bravery, which shone through again on the witness stand in this trial just as it did when he saved his own life on the night of the attack,\" Pelosi's office wrote in an emailed statement Friday. “For nearly 20 grueling months, Mr. Pelosi has demonstrated extraordinary courage and fortitude every day of his recovery.” DePape’s public defender Adam Lipson said he was disappointed with the verdict and plans to appeal it. He called the prosecutors’ decision to file a kidnapping for ransom charge “vindictive.” “It’s really unfortunate that it was charged this way. It was sort of a textbook vindictive prosecution,” Lipson said. “As soon as they found that the attempted murder charge was going to be dismissed, they added this charge.” San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said at a news conference Friday that all charges her office filed against DePape were based on the same evidence. The jury was “able to find that he was guilty and so there’s no need for any accusations of vindictive prosecution,” she said. “We’re simply trying to do our jobs to make sure that he was held accountable for every act that occurred that night that was criminal.\" Lipson earlier argued that the state trial represents double jeopardy following the federal conviction. Even though the criminal counts are not the same, the two cases stem from the same act, he told the judge. San Francisco Superior Court Judge Harry Dorfman agreed and dismissed the state charges of attempted murder, elder abuse and assault with a deadly weapon. Another judge upheld the decision on appeal. Lipson said that the verdict means that after DePape serves 30 years in federal prison, he will be transferred to California “to spend the rest of his life in a California prison.” Previously, a federal jury convicted DePape of assaulting a federal official’s family member and attempting to kidnap a federal official. On May 28, he was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison during an unusual resentencing hearing that resulted from judicial error. Lipson focused his closing arguments on explaining to the jury that prosecutors did not prove DePape kidnapped Paul Pelosi, who was 82 at the time, with the intent “to exact from another person money or something valuable,” which is integral to the charge. Assistant District Attorney Phoebe Maffei told the jury in her closing arguments that DePape had planned to record a video of his interrogation of Nancy Pelosi. Lipson argued the video didn’t exist and if it did, it wouldn’t have had any value. “When he broke into the Pelosis’ home his intent was to confront and potentially hurt and assault Nancy Pelosi. That was his intent at that time, that has nothing to do with Mr. Pelosi,” he said. In her rebuttal, Maffei pointed out DePape told a detective and testified in federal court that he planned to get a video of Nancy Pelosi confessing to what he believed to be crimes and post it on the internet. “There is inherent value in a video of the Speaker of the House confessing to crimes in her own home,” Maffei said. The Oct. 28, 2022, attack on Paul Pelosi was captured on police body camera video just days before the midterm elections and shocked the political world. He suffered two head wounds including a skull fracture that was mended with plates and screws he will have for the rest of his life. His right arm and hand were also injured. DePape admitted during his federal trial testimony that he planned to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage, record his interrogation of her, and “break her kneecaps” if she did not admit to the lies he said she told about “Russiagate,” a reference to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. Lipson told the jury during closing arguments that before the attack, DePape was living an isolated, lonely life and “went down the rabbit hole of propaganda and conspiracy theories.” This week the judge expelled DePape’s former partner from the public gallery and the second floor of the San Francisco courthouse because the judge said she was trying to tamper with the jury. On Monday and Tuesday, Gypsy Taub, a well-known activist in the Bay Area, handed out pieces of paper outside the courtroom with the address of a website she runs that promotes conspiracy theories. The cards were also found in a women’s bathroom near the courtroom, where the website’s address was scrawled in marker on a wall. DePape’s federal public defender Angela Chaung said during his federal sentencing that DePape was first exposed to extreme beliefs by Taub, who has two sons with DePape. Taub met DePape in Hawaii when he was 20 years old and she was in her 30s and pregnant, DePape’s twin sister, Joanne Robinson, said in a letter to the federal judge seeking leniency. Robinson wrote that Taub isolated DePape from his family and inflicted “extreme psychological damage” on her brother. crime, law and justice / USA BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

INDUS-X , which stands for enhanced strategic and defence partnership between India and the U.S., was launched on June 21 last year by the U.S. Department of Defence and the Indian Ministry of Defence during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to Washington, DC. \"In its first year, INDUS-X has advanced both countries' commitment to build a defence innovation bridge under the initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET),\" the Department of Defence said in a press release on June 21. The iCET was launched by Prime Minister Modi and U.S. President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the QUAD summit in Tokyo on May 24, 2022. \"INDUS-X has strengthened private sector cooperation between the United States and India by facilitating partnerships among defence technology companies, investors, and researchers,\" the press release said. “The third INDUS-X Summit will take place in Silicon Valley in September 2024 with a focus on harnessing private capital for defence innovation,” it said, citing a recent announcement by the White House. The summit will be co-hosted by the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) and Stanford University. The India-U.S. defence and strategic ties have been on an upswing in the last few years. The two countries have inked key defence and security pacts over the past few years, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries to use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies. The two sides also signed COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) in 2018 which provides for interoperability between the two militaries and also provides for the sale of high-end technology from the U.S. to India. In October 2020, India and the U.S. sealed the BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) pact to further boost bilateral defence ties. The pact provides for the sharing of high-end military technology, logistics and geospatial maps between the two countries.

Yet the power-sharing agreement sealed a week ago between President Cyril Ramaphosa's African National Congress party and the Democratic Alliance, one of South Africa's few white-led parties, has unwittingly renewed some racial rifts. Also read: ​A new era: on the South Africa general election Many Black South Africans have expressed discomfort with a white-led party being back in power, even in a coalition. The country is haunted by the apartheid system of white minority rule that ended 30 years ago but is still felt by millions among the Black majority who were ruthlessly oppressed by a white government and remained affected by unresolved issues of poverty and inequality. South Africa is now faced with the likelihood of seeing more white people in senior government positions than ever since apartheid ended. White people make up around 7% of the country’s population of 62 million. The ANC liberated South Africa from apartheid in 1994 under Nelson Mandela , the country's first Black president. Its three-decade political dominance ended in the landmark May 29 election, forcing it to form a coalition. The DA, with its roots in liberal white parties that stood against apartheid, won the second largest share of votes. Both have promoted their coming together in a multi-party coalition as a new unity desperately needed in a country with vast socioeconomic problems. But history lingers. The DA suspended one of its white lawmakers on Thursday, days after being sworn into Parliament, over racist slurs he made in a social media video more than a decade ago. Renaldo Gouws — reportedly a student in his 20s at the time — used an especially offensive term for Black people that was infamous during apartheid and is now considered hate speech. Mr. Gouws faces disciplinary action from his party, and the South African Human Rights Commission said it will take him to court. The DA, which previously fended off allegations of favouring whites, is again under scrutiny. The Congress of South African Trade Unions, an important political ally of the ANC, asserted that Mr. Gouws’ outburst was symptomatic of a DA that is “soft on racists.” The DA “needs to reflect on and address this if it wants to be accepted as a partner in the government of national unity by ordinary South Africans,” it said. DA leader John Steenhuisen denied in a television interview that his party is dedicated only to white interests, saying it wouldn’t have won the second largest share of votes in a Black majority country if it was. The DA has Black and white lawmakers and supporters, but its only Black leader left the party in 2019, questioning its commitment to Black South Africans. Political analyst Angelo Fick said the DA does have a “sense of whiteness” in the eyes of many South Africans and has created that by being “utterly disinterested in speaking to the concerns about race from Black South Africans.” Shortly before Mr. Gouws’ case, racially charged language came from another direction when the MK Party of former President Jacob Zuma — once an ANC leader — called Mr. Ramaphosa a “house negro” for entering into the agreement with the DA. Mr. Zuma’s party also referred to white DA chairperson Helen Zille as Mr. Ramaphosa’s “slave master.” The MK Party and the Economic Freedom Fighters — the third and fourth biggest parties in Parliament — have refused to join what the ANC calls a government of national unity open to all. They said the fundamental reason is the DA, which they say is committed only to the well-being of South Africa's white minority. “We do not agree to this marriage of convenience to consolidate the white monopoly power over the economy,” EFF leader Julius Malema said. Mr. Malema has sometimes provoked racial tensions demanding change, once saying, “We are not calling for the slaughtering of white people, at least for now,” and that South Africa’s “white man has been too comfortable for too long.” He now says his party is not against white people but against a perceived “white privilege” that leaves 64% of Black people in poverty compared with 1% of white people, according to a 2021 report by the South African Human Rights Commission. He represents a new opposition to the ANC by many Black South Africans frustrated over the race-based inequality that's evident after 30 years of freedom. White people generally live in posh neighbourhoods, while millions of Black people live in impoverished townships on the outskirts. That frustration led many voters to give up on the ANC. The concerns about teaming up with the DA could weaken the party even further. In his inauguration speech Wednesday, Mr. Ramaphosa recognised the “toxic” divisions that remain decades after Mandela preached racial reconciliation. “Our society remains deeply unequal and highly polarized,” Ramaphosa said. The ANC is trying to use the coalition as a kind of reboot of Mandela's ideals. “To us, it doesn’t matter whether the cat is black or white,\" ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said of the agreement with the DA. Mandela had used the phrase to signal he was open to all races serving in South Africa's government. “Fundamentally,\" Mbalula said, “the question is how do we move the country forward.” South Africa / national politics BACK TO TOP Terms & conditions | Institutional Subscriber Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

China claims self-ruled democratic Taiwan as part of its territory and has said it would never renounce the use of force to bring it under Beijing's control. It has stepped up pressure on Taipei in recent years and held war games around the island following last month's inauguration of new Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te. On June 22, Taipei's Defence Ministry said it had detected 41 Chinese military aircraft and seven naval vessels operating around Taiwan during the 24-hour period leading up to 6:00 a.m. (2200 GMT). \"32 of the aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait,\" the Ministry said in a statement, referring to a line bisecting the 180-kilometre (110-mile) waterway that separates Taiwan from China. The Ministry added that it had \"monitored the situation and responded accordingly\". The latest incursion came after China published judicial guidelines Friday that included the death penalty for \"particularly serious\" cases of \"diehard\" supporters of Taiwanese independence, state media reported. On May 25, Taiwan detected 62 Chinese military aircraft around the island in a 24-hour window, the highest single-day total this year, as China staged military drills following the inauguration of Lai, who Beijing regards as a \"dangerous separatist\".

In a statement issued on behalf of the family on Friday, lawyers from Switzerland stressed their clients – Prakash and Kamal Hinduja, both in their 70s and their son Ajay and his wife Namrata – had been acquitted of all human trafficking charges. They also dismissed media reports that any members of the family faced detention after court reports from Geneva said the four were sentenced to between four and four-and-a-half years in prison. “Our clients have been acquitted of all human trafficking charges. We are appalled and disappointed by the rest of the decision made in this court of first instance, and we have, of course, filed an appeal to the higher court, thereby making this part of the judgement not effective,” reads the statement signed by lawyers Yael Hayat and Robert Assael and Roman Jordan. “Under Swiss law, the presumption of innocence is paramount till a final judgement by the highest adjudicating authority is enforced. Contrary to some media reports, there is no effective detention for any members of the family,” they said. The lawyers also pointed out that “it should also be recalled that the plaintiffs in this case had withdrawn their respective complaints after declaring to the court that they had never intended to be involved in such proceedings”. “The family has full faith in the judicial process and remains confident that the truth will prevail,” they conclude. The statement followed a hearing in the Swiss city of Geneva after prosecutors opened the case for alleged illegal activity, including exploitation, human trafficking and violation of Switzerland’s labour laws. The family members were accused of seizing the workers' passports, barring them from leaving the villa and forcing them to work very long hours for a pittance in Switzerland, among other things. Some workers allegedly spoke only Hindi and were paid their wages in rupees in banks back in India that they could not access. During the trial, prosecutors alleged the family spent more on their dog than on their servants. The family's legal team had countered the allegations and told the court the staff were treated respectfully and provided with accommodation. According to ‘The Sunday Times Rich List’ released last month, the U.K.-based Hinduja family once again emerged as the country's richest, with wealth estimated at around GBP 37.196 billion. They saw this tally increase over the previous year in the wake of the opening of the brand-new luxury OWO Raffles Hotel in the heart of London. The U.K.-based family’s group of companies, headed by chairman G.P. Hinduja, operates in 48 countries and across several sectors – automotive, oil and specialty chemicals, banking and finance, IT, cyber security, healthcare, trading, infrastructure project development, media and entertainment, power, and real estate.

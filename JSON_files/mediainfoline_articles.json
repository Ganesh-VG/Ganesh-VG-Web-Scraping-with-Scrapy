    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Apr 15, 2024, 13:17 pm Godrej Vikhroli Cucina- a curated, brand-agnostic, owned media platform- hosted a star-studded launch for the highly anticipated Godrej Food Trends Report 2024 at the glamorous Godrej L’Affaire 2024. The report, under the theme ‘Provenance’, explores the rich tapestry of India’s food culture, delving into the diverse origins of ingredients and India’s culinary practices. Tanya Dubash – Executive Director & Chief Brand Officer, Godrej Industries Limited , unveiled the seventh edition of the report, sparking curiosity among food enthusiasts like Malaika Arora who were present to discover the fascinating trends shaping the future of food. The Godrej Food Trends Report 2024 convened over 190 thought leaders from diverse culinary backgrounds, including celebrity chefs, bloggers, and nutritionists who shared their insights on the comprehensive trends cited in the report. In an ever-evolving culinary landscape, the theme of Provenance signifies the exploration and amplification of the depth and diversity of Indian cuisine, it not only connects us to the origins of our food but also highlights the need for sustainable practices that preserve our culinary heritage. The report also throws light on conscientious eaters who seek transparency and authenticity and gravitate towards products that champion the values embedded in their journey from farm to plate. Commenting on the 2024 edition of the report, Tanya Dubash – Executive Director & Chief Brand Officer, Godrej Industries Limited and Associate Companies , said, “The Godrej Food Trends Report 2024 marks another milestone in our quest to spark conversations and identify trends in the food industry. Consumers are getting savvier about their diets, focusing on mindful nutrition. With a focus on Provenance, this edition celebrates India’s rich culinary heritage and invites readers to explore the myriad flavours and cultures that define our nation. I am confident that readers will be captivated by the depth and diversity of insights offered within this edition, further solidifying India’s position as a global leader in the realm of food and gastronomy.” Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal, Managing Director of Perfect Bite Consulting and Curating Editor of the Godrej Food Trends Report , sets the stage for the 2024 edition: “As we launch the 2024 edition, we continue to witness India’s emergence as a global culinary powerhouse, rooted in the theme of Provenance. In India, provenance is guiding our most relevant conversations around food. This interest in provenance is also translating into real growth for the F&B industry. The traditional plate, once dictated primarily by seasonality and local bounty, is now being driven by a quest for flavour. I am optimistic that the Indian food industry will prove to be a benchmark for empowerment and innovation in the years to come. Just as each dish in a multi-course meal tells a story, each section of the Godrej Food Trends Report 2024 invites readers to savour the insights and flavours of our diverse food culture.” Some key insights from the Godrej Foods Trends Report 2024 are : “India’s soft power is our cuisine and its sheer diversity, and the power of our history, plurality, and continuity. So, I am happy to see it finally valued for being authentic and unapologetically true to itself. For the longest time, we have been carpet-bombed with a generalized idea of Indian food defined by political boundaries. But whatever prism you use to break it down by, the context for regional cuisines will always be the geography, agriculture, climate, and culture of a place.” shares Celebrity Chef Ajay Chopra . Since its inception in 2018, the Godrej Food Trends Report has emerged as one of the most credible platforms on themes that significantly impact the food industry each year. Over its existence, the report has drawn on insights from over 1500 experts and thought leaders from food, beverage, and allied industries spanning across industry verticals and geographies. Through a celebration of Provenance, the 2024 report sets the stage for a renaissance in Indian cuisine, where tradition meets innovation to create a tapestry of flavours that captivates the senses.

Poila Boishak also known as the Bengali New Year amongst the most significant cultural festivals of the region. On that occasion, Red FM introduced a first-ever three-day-long celebration on air. The diverse sounds of Bengal’s music took the center stage. From the soulful tunes of Baul to the mesmerising tunes of Rabindra Sangeet, from narratives of Bengali theatre and popular audio plays; each hour slot was dedicated to a specific theme within Folk Music, Theatre, Independent Bengali Music, Rabindra Sangeet and Bangla Band music. The festival featured up-close performances by key artists such as Debshankar Haldar, Usha Uthup, Srikanta Acharya, Iman Chakraborty, Sourendra Soumyajit, Dohar, Fakira, Kartik Das Baul, and Bikram Ghosh, among others. Additionally, listeners engaged with renowned personalities like Poushali, Aditi Munshi, Teertha, and many more. Speaking on the wins, “Nisha Narayanan, COO and Director, of Red FM & Magic FM, said , “Red FM’s narratives of breathing life into the unsung forms of music and cultures has once again led us to celebrate the spirit of Bengal. Festivities mark the dawn of a new year in Bengal, and Poila Boithak brought just that. Considering the election season, we decided to take the festival on air. Reverberated 36 hours of on-air melody of Bengali music, in it’s purest form. From Baul music to Bengali independent music, from urban folk to Rabindra Sangeet, this year’s Poila Boithak left no stone unturned. Each theatrical performance unfolded stories that are seeped in tradition and emotion, giving us all a glimpse into Bengal’s artistic heritage.” Your email address will not be published.

This remarkable growth strengthens realme’s position in the Indian smartphone market, securing the No. 3 position among the top 10 smartphone brands as per IDC’s rankings for Q2 2023. Despite the overall smartphone market in India witnessing a 3% YoY decline in Q2, realme’s strategic positioning and leap-forward innovations, coupled with the industry’s focus on 5G devices in the INR 10,000-INR 15,000 (~$122-$244) segment, propelled the brand back to its coveted 3rd position in the Indian smartphone market. realme’s exceptional growth can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the brand’s strategic approach in improving inventory and demand, aggressive sales promotions, and the launch of 5G devices at accessible price points. This year, realme has achieved numerous milestones across a range of devices, with several emerging as bestsellers in their respective categories. Notably, the realme C55 sold over 100,000 units in just 5 hours on its first sale day, while the 11 Pro Series set a new record by selling over 200,000 devices across all channels during its initial launch, and achieved 390% of the previous generation during the first sale period offline. Also, the narzo N53 , a best-selling smartphone under the Rs 10,000 segment on Amazon, broke records by selling 100,000 units in an impressive 90 minutes . For the IOT category, realme pad 2 achieved 122% more than the previous generation during first sale. These achievements showcase realme’s continued commitment to delivering innovative and high-performing products that resonate with consumers. Furthermore, realme’s strong offline presence and expansion into the offline channel have played a significant role in enhancing customer engagement and ecosystem development. The brand’s strategic focus on both online and offline channels has allowed it to cater to diverse consumer preferences and ensure seamless access to its products. By continuously pushing boundaries and delivering exceptional devices, realme has solidified its position as a prominent player in the Indian smartphone market. With a compelling product lineup and customer-centric approach, realme is well-poised to continue its upward trajectory and achieve even greater success in the future. As the company continues to innovate and expand its product portfolio, realme aims to maintain its growth momentum and further strengthen its position as one of the top smartphone brands in India. With the rapid growth of the Indian smartphone market and the increasing demand for 5G devices, realme is well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and deliver unparalleled value to its customers.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Nov 02, 2017, 07:18 am Weber Shandwick was named 2017 Global Agency of the Year by The Holmes Report at the annual Global SABRE Awards ceremony. Weber Shandwick is the first agency ever to sweep The Holmes Report’s Regional Agency of the Year honors in one year, already winning top recognition in Asia Pacific, North America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa earlier in 2017. This is the fourth time in five years the firm has received the global top agency honor. Weber Shandwick also was presented with two Global SABRE awards for outstanding client work with partners ActionAid UK and Alba Chunkuk, which were recognized among the top 40 global campaigns of the year. “Being recognized by The Holmes Report as the leading agency in every major region of the world this year reflects the strength of our global network – the teams across our offices who passionately and consistently deliver value to our clients, who leverage strategic communications to help solve problems and who generate results,” said Andy Polansky, Chief Executive Officer, Weber Shandwick. “Congratulations to our people around the world, and to our client partners who inspire us to create some of the world’s most engaging and impactful campaigns year after year.” Earlier this year, Weber Shandwick was honored with the top ranking on The Holmes Report’s 2017 Global Creative Index, marking the second time in three years that the agency has been recognized as the industry’s leading creative firm. Standout Client Campaigns The firm’s work with ActionAid UK’s “#BrutalCut” campaign, which raised awareness of female genital mutilation in Kenya, was recognized by The Holmes Report among the top 10 campaigns of the year. The campaign, which has reached over 152 million people and sparked thousands of conversations online, is Weber Shandwick’s most awarded campaign of all time in EMEA, including earning two Silver Cannes Lions in 2017. Weber Shandwick was also honored in partnership with Alba Chunkuk, Korea’s biggest portal for parttime work, for giving a voice to marginalized and mistreated part-time workers in the country. The campaign has earned international recognition and praise, including being named Campaign of the Year at the Asia Pacific Excellence Awards and winning Silver and Bronze awards at the PR Awards Asia 2017. The Culture Conundrum At the The Holmes Report’s Global Public Relations Summit, which took place earlier in the day, Weber Shandwick President Gail Heimann led a discussion about the relationship between brands in culture with senior marketers Judy Berei, Excedrin Global Brand Lead, GSK Consumer Healthcare and Tracy Quan, Associate Vice President, Global Brand Communications, Royal Caribbean. The session, “The Culture Conundrum – Culture-in-Brands or Brands-in-Culture. Or both. A Meditation. And Conversation” examined the opportunities, realities and risks for brands engaging in real-time culture, and provided insight on how to navigate culture to deliver effective work and long-term value for brands and companies. Commenting on Excedrin’s “Migraine Experience,” which used augmented reality to tackle the misconception that having a migraine is “just a bad headache,” Berei said the work was a great example of anchoring on a central point and using technology to tell the story. The campaign earned three Cannes Lions at the 2016 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Royal Caribbean has also had success integrating itself into culture, recently leveraging the summer’s solar eclipse to host Bonnie Tyler for a once-in-a lifetime “Total Eclipse of the Heart” concert live on the high seas. Quan added that when it comes to culture, it’s important for brands to think proactively and react swiftly. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 19, 2024, 15:11 pm PVR INOX , India’s largest and the most premium cinema exhibitor, proudly announces the launch of its latest brand campaign, “Fresh Dekho. Bada Dekho.” starring Kartik Aaryan. This campaign underscores the unparalleled joy and vibrant freshness that comes with experiencing movies in a cinema hall, an experience that cannot be replicated elsewhere or after its past its prime. Following the success of the previous campaign, this new initiative continues to celebrate the essence of Cinema, this time focusing on the immediacy and freshness of watching a movie on the big screen. “Fresh Dekho. Bada Dekho” captures the thrill and excitement that come with viewing a new release in a theatre, surrounded by fellow movie enthusiasts. The campaign brings Kartik Aaryan’s charismatic and relatable presence to the forefront. In the campaign video, Kartik eloquently narrates the magic of cinema in his signature style, emphasizing the unique energy and collective experience that only a cinema hall can offer. Kartik Aaryan highlights the unique and exhilarating experience of watching movies in a cinema hall. He compares the thrill of fresh, in-the-moment viewing to the excitement of a champion’s perfect moment. He emphasizes the collective energy and emotional rollercoaster shared with the audience, contrasting it with the lacklustre experience of watching eight weeks old movies at home or alone on small screen. Kartik urges viewers to leave their couches, gather their friends, and enjoy the vibrant, immersive experience that only a cinema can offer. The campaign tagline is “Fresh Dekho. Bada Dekho.” which translates to “Watch it fresh. Watch it big. ” Commenting on the campaign, Gautam Dutta, CEO – Revenue & Operations, PVR INOX Ltd, said, “We are delighted to unveil our new campaign, ‘Fresh Dekho. Bada Dekho,’ which reflects our commitment to bringing the freshest and most exhilarating cinematic experiences to our audience. The film celebrates cinema as a communal experience, the thrill of witnessing a story unfold on the big screen with a live audience. It argues that this shared experience, like the electric atmosphere of a cricket match, transcends the act of simply watching a movie – it becomes a vibrant, in-the-moment event, unlike the passive consumption of something past its prime. Kartik Aaryan beautifully captures this essence in the campaign, emphasizing how every twist, laugh, and tear is best experienced in the dark cinema environment. We invite everyone to enjoy the unparalleled joy of watching movies on the big screen.” Kartik Aaryan added, “On joining hands with PVR INOX for the campaign, Bollywood heartthrob Kartik Aaryan said, “The magic of cinema is truly experienced when shared with live audience. The collective gasps, laughter, and emotions create a unique atmosphere that simply cannot be replicated on a smaller screen. Just like watching a live match, a film’s power is best felt in the moment, on the big screen. So all I would say to our audiences out there is, don’t wait for the magic to disappear! Watch it fresh, experience it the way it’s meant to be, on the big screen.” The film will run in cinemas, on digital platforms as well as on TV. Kartik Aaryan’s association with the campaign will further amplify its reach and impact.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 20, 2024, 13:36 pm Poonam Wahi Films is proud to have collaborated with Lowe Lintas and Dollar Industries Limited on their latest campaign, “Welcoming Monsoon Without Hesitation”. The film, directed by renowned director Arko Provo Bose, is a visually stunning recreation of a 16th century Mughal era setting, with a modern twist. The campaign takes viewers on a journey through time, transporting them to the majestic courtyard of Emperor Akbar’s court, where the famous musician Miyan Tansen sings his timeless raga, “Miyan Ki Malhar”, to invoke the monsoon rains. As the rains pour down, the Emperor’s family and their guests slip on their raincoats, courtesy of Dollar Industries Limited’s latest rainwear collection. The campaign aims to promote Dollar Industries Limited’s new range of rainwear as a fashion statement, rather than just a functional product. The film’s blend of historical accuracy and modern flair is a testament to the brand’s commitment to innovation and style. Ad film link: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=FajzpN1Z9NM According to Poonam Wahi, Producer, “Dollar Rain guard ad centers’ around a humorous yet relatable concept. The ad is a perfect example of how a cohesive team, a well-crafted script, and a supportive client can come together to produce a successful and impactful commercial. The project involved seamlessly integrating various elements — script, casting, location, direction, and post-production — to create an ad that is both entertaining and informative.” Arko Provo Bose, Director, adds, “Handing a period piece is always a challenge. The idea was to not blatantly shoot it like a spoof. In a country which swivels between Mughal-e-azam and Jodha Akbar, finding the middle path was a task that the team was ready to take on. Overcast skies did spoil the party for a bit on shoot day but overall it came off great, thanks to some proper post production. A truly humorous script from the agency, freedom to execute it my way and some able production helming the project led to this hilarious piece.” Mohit Pasricha, Creative Director at Lowe Lintas, praises Poonam Wahi Films’ professionalism, “As a creative, all you need from a production house is for them to stand by you and provide the best possible support in terms of product quality, logistics, and timelines – that’s everything PWF brought to the table. Though they’re new on the block as a unit, they are hardcore advertising and production professionals. It turned out to be a smooth run in the rain with them. My thanks and best wishes to them for their future projects.” With Poonam Wahi Films’ captivating storytelling and Dollar Industries Limited’s latest rainwear collection, get ready to welcome the monsoon without hesitation!

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 20, 2024, 12:55 pm Rajit Gupta has been hired as a VP and Creative Head for Cheil X, Mumbai , which is an independent full-service agency under the Cheil SWA group to manage the fast-growing new client mandates in India . With a proven track record of crafting compelling campaigns and pushing creative boundaries, Rajit will play a pivotal role in shaping Cheil X’s creative oeuvre and driving client success. In his current role, Rajit will report to Vikash Chemjong, CCO, Cheil India. His appointment comes at the heels of the agency beefing up its Mumbai operations to increase its focus on exploring new expansion opportunities in the region. Rajit joins the team from McCann Worldgroup, where he held the position of Executive Creative Director and helmed the creative execution of G20 summit in India last year. He has more than 17 years of experience in the dynamic world of advertising, collaborating with top-tier brands and agencies globally. His repertoire of work includes stints with agencies like J. Walter Thompson, Publicis, DDB Mudra, and Contract Advertising. He has extensive experience across a wide breadth of industries, having worked on brands like Air India, Incredible India, Coke, Pepsi, Volkswagen, Dominoes, Nestle Maggi, and Nescafe. His work has been consistently recognized and celebrated at national & international award shows, including a grand prix. Vikash Chemjong, CCO Cheil India , said, “There is a lot that Rajit brings to the table. His understanding of brands. His sense of design. His typography. His experience at some of the best agencies in the country. His tally of metals. Not to mention his eloquence and effortless good looks! But these aren’t the only reason we at the agency were impressed about him. He has this vibe. An edge. A mojo so to say. Or simply put, an X factor! Which probably is what makes him such an excellent fit for Cheil X! We are lucky to have him. And I’m sure our clients will feel the same very soon.” Commenting on his appointment, Rajit said , “Why Cheil?” That’s what everyone asked me when they heard the news, even Poppins, my dog. He wasn’t thrilled about his walk being moved from 10:00am to 7:00am. I tried to tell him that discipline is good for us, but he sensed there was more to it. He knew that the only reason I’d walk out of a nine year old stint is because I was ready for my second innings. I embraced the idea of transformation. A change in perspective, format, culture and city. I feel a renewed energy to accept this challenge because, as creatives, that’s what we do! We evolve and create something better. Joining Cheil X in Mumbai is like joining a start-up with the backing of a powerful company. It offers the flexibility of a start-up with the stability and resources of an established firm. It’s an opportunity to create impactful work with a confidence that comes from solid backing”. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Feb 09, 2024, 15:41 pm Pocket Aces’ long-form studio Dice Media is releasing the 4th season of its school romance show Crushed. Crushed is Dice Media’s 4th show to have 4 successful seasons, a rare feat in today’s web series environment. Starting with the release of S4 of its innovative series Firsts in 2021, S4 of the most awaited show Little Things also released in 2021, S4 of What The Folks released in 2022, and S4 of Crushed now released in 2024. Along the way, they have created characters such as Dhruv-Kavya from Little Things, Anita-Nikhil from What The Folks, and Aadhya-Sam from Crushed that remain audience favorites long after each season is aired. With ratings of over 8.2 on IMDB across these shows, Dice Media has established itself as a leader in the relationship and family show space, especially when it comes to metro and Tier 2 Indian youth. Speaking about the success of our four most heart-warming shows, Aditi Shrivastava, Co-Founder and CEO, Pocket Aces says, “ Creating multi-season franchises is extremely exciting for us. We use deep insights from our short-form content to pick concepts that will have enough arms and legs to remain extremely engaging and relatable to audiences season after season. Our creative directors and writers design the characters with an endeavor to create likeable, albeit flawed, protagonists that feel like real people you know in your real lives. That’s how audiences get so attached to them and can’t get enough. It is this audience demand, anticipation,, and engagement that encourages us to keep bringing our shows back for subsequent seasons.” Vidyuth Bhandary, Studio Head, Dice Media adds, “We are excited to work with partners such as Amazon miniTV from Crushed and Netflix for Little Things that see the mutual benefit of creating long-running shows. We have also expanded some of these very successful IPs to other derivative content – such as regional shows or audio shows. We released the Telugu adaptations Alludu Garu and #BFF of our shows What The Folks and Adulting respectively on Aha, and the audio derivatives of Little Things and Adulting on Amazon Audible. Proven IPs in one language or format work extremely well in others too, so you will see us doing a long more derivative content in the future.” Crushed S4 is streaming on Amazon miniTV and Amazon Prime starting February 9, 2024.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Mar 13, 2024, 10:10 am Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Shri Anurag Singh Thakur launched the first season of “Swaraj” on OTT platform Amazon Prime, in Mumbai. Speaking on the occasion, Shri Thakur said, “Today is a moment of pride for us and a true tribute to all those unsung great heroes of our independence who sacrificed everything for the country”. He informed that this serial was commissioned by taking inspiration from the “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav” national campaign of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. He said that this serial which was launched in the month of August, 2022, are those stories of bravery in India’s freedom struggle about which very few people know. “These are the wars which got lost somewhere in the pages of history”, said the Union I & B Minister. “Swaraj” is the story of these countless unsung heroes and their indomitable courage, he added. Elaborating on the series, Shri Thakur said, this serial of 75 episodes covers unsung heroes of freedom struggle offrom all corners of our country. It helps us understand the meaning, origins and consequences of colonialism, said the Minister. He further said, In the past, the history of India was written by foreign invaders and rulers according to their political, ideological and economic interests. In this landmark serial, historical events are presented in a broader context to illustrate the concept of ‘Swaraj’, he stated. He added that this will help the national and international audience to understand the spirit of the country and our 500-year long relentless struggle to gain independence from colonial rulers. Speaking further on the importance of being proud of one’s own rich history, Shri Thakur said, those who do not take pride in their rich historical legacy can never create a great future. If we want to create a great future for the country, then we will have to instil pride in the young generation about our great history, he added. The Union I & B Minister reiterated that over the next 25 years of Amrit Kaal, under the able leadership of PM Narendra Modi, we will move forward at a greater pace in the direction of ‘Viksit Bharat’. Reflecting on the role of Prasar Bharati in making this series, the Minister appreciated the role being played by Doordarshan and Akashvani in mobilizing and channelizing the emotions and spirit of the citizens in the right direction from time to time through various memorable programs. The Minister informed the gathering about a new 52 episode serial “Sardar: The Game Changer” which has been launched by Doordarshan on 10th March, 2024, to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Union I & B Minister stated that the Government is focussed on being an enabler to help the Media & Entertainment sector thrive and achieve greater heights on an international scale. He highlighted initiatives like Ease of Doing Business for film industry, schemes like “Single window clearance” for film-shooting In India and various other incentives. He urged all to create good content in Indian languages and stated that language is not a barrier for a global audience in today’s hyperconnected world. He added that regional Indian cinema has transcended geographies and reached out to a global audience based on good content. He urged the M&E sector stakeholders to make India the ‘Content Hub of the World’. Also addressing the audience on the occasion, Shri Sushant Sreeram, Country Director, Prime Video, India stated, “This endeavor echoes the essence of our commitment to showcasing and celebrating India’s unique culture and history, and strengthening India’s creative ecosystem, as envisioned in the Letter of Engagement signed between Amazon India and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting last year”. The Producer of “Swaraj”, Abhimanyu Singh stated that the serial shows the journey of India from the arrival of Vasco Da Gama in 1498 to the attainment of independence in 1947. “When Vasco Da Gama entered in India, our country was the richest country at that time. India’s contribution in world GDP was around 24%. But, after beginning of the rule of East India Company, India’s struggle started. However, the sacrifice of our freedom fighters brought us independence”, he said. A colourful programme organized on the occasion showcased India’s rich art and culture and varied dance forms. A scintillating performance on a musical narrative depicted the indomitable spirit of millions of ordinary Indians who fought for the freedom of the motherland over the last five centuries. The telecast of the serial ‘Swaraj’ began on 14th August 2022 in Hindi on DD National and subsequently in nine regional languages (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Odia, and Assamese) on the regional networks of Doordarshan. “Swaraj” program was entrusted to Contiloe Pictures production house, famous for professionally researched and high quality content, which is also suitable for OTT platforms.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Apr 15, 2024, 09:40 am ‘Two Great Masters,’ the highly anticipated spiritual web series produced by Juni Films in collaboration with Approach Entertainment and Go Spiritual India, has made its much-awaited debut on the MX Player OTT platform.

The series weaves a captivating narrative inspired by the profound philosophies of Vivekananda and Yogananda, offering audiences a unique perspective on spirituality in the modern era. Two Great Masters is directed by Anurag Sharma & Created by Sonu Tyagi. It features veteran actor Rakesh Bedi as narrator along with Anurag Sharma, Deep Sharma, Pavli Kashyap & Durga Kamboj in pivotal roles. Bedi’s portrayal adds depth and authenticity to the story, guiding viewers on a journey of self-discovery and inner transformation The web series is supported by a leading Spiritual organization, Go Spiritual India. Go Spiritual India is a Charitable Spiritual Organization Working for Philanthropy, Spiritual Awareness, Spiritual Tourism, Spiritual Media, Spiritual Events, Organic, Mental Health, Wellness, and Holistic Health. Sonu Tyagi, Co-Producer of ‘Two Great Masters’ and Director of Approach Entertainment, expressed his excitement about the series’ premiere, emphasizing its relevance in today’s fast-paced world. He stated, “We are thrilled to bring ‘Two Great Masters’ to audiences worldwide through the MX Player platform. This series not only entertains but also enlightens, bridging the gap between spirituality and contemporary life.” Anurag Sharma, Director of Juni Films, shared insights into the creative vision behind ‘Two Great Masters,’ affirming that the series goes beyond mere biography to explore the timeless wisdom of Vivekananda and Yogananda. “Our aim with this series is to inspire and uplift audiences, fostering a deeper understanding of spirituality amidst the complexities of modern living,” remarked Sharma. Amrit Gupta, author of the renowned book ‘Two Great Masters,’ on which the web series is based, expressed his delight at seeing his work adapted for the screen. “It is truly gratifying to witness ‘Two Great Masters’ come to life on screen, bringing the timeless teachings of Vivekananda and Yogananda to a new generation of viewers,” Gupta commented. With its captivating storyline, stellar cast, and picturesque cinematography, ‘Two Great Masters’ promises to captivate audiences of all ages. Now available for streaming exclusively on MX Player, viewers can embark on a journey of self-discovery and spiritual awakening from the comfort of their homes. Juni Films is a Film Production company headed by Anurag Sharma. It has already produced a Bollywood Film Juni – The Last Prayer in 2022 and is working on a few projects soon. Approach Entertainment stands as an acclaimed hub for Celebrity Management, Film Productions, Advertising & Corporate Film solutions, Films Marketing, Events & Entertainment Marketing Company. Approach Communications operates as a prominent PR & Integrated Communications agency catering to diverse sectors like Corporate, Healthcare, Entertainment, Finance, Education, and Social domains.

Approach Entertainment Group is also having a Charitable Spiritual Organization, Go Spiritual India working for Philanthropy, Spiritual Awareness, Charity, Mental Health, Wellness, Organic, Spiritual Tourism, Events, Media, and Social Causes. This unique web series is probably the first such venture that highlights the spiritual philosophy as experienced and described by Vivekananda and Paramhansa Yogananda. It remains a big question, how no one has thought of bringing the lives of these two masters on the celluloid or on the web before. In fact, the web series “Two Great Masters” is also not a straightforward biographical account of the lives of the two great masters. It rather showcases their philosophical and spiritual perspectives of life through present time characters. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Team MI Jun 13, 2023, 12:18 pm Excitel, India’s leading home internet startup, has launched an Out-of-Home (OOH) campaign, ‘Drive Safely’ that seeks to combat distracted driving. The awareness-led campaign juxtaposes activities more suitable for home rather than the car, emphasizing the importance of focused and attentive driving. By tapping into the subconscious mind of commuters, Excitel hopes to foster a behavioral change and a responsible driving culture. Prompted by rising cases and alarming statistics released by the Save Life Foundation, Excitel has taken proactive steps to address a significant issue on the city’s roads. Data indicates that around 47% of drivers engage in phone conversations while driving, while 94% of truck/bus drivers and 67% of four-wheeler drivers keep sending texts/WhatsApp messages while behind the wheel. These behaviors contribute to an alarming toll, with 1.3 million lives lost in road crashes and an additional 5.3 million individuals suffering serious injuries. Sharing his vision on the campaign, Varun Pasricha, Chief Operating Officer, Excitel said , “As a home internet start-up, set to disrupt home broadband for Indians, we have always innovated and highlighted the advantages of high-speed internet access. However, our country faces concerning trends due to distracted driving and internet usage while one is on the road. Through our ‘Drive Safely‘ campaign, we aim to educate and raise awareness among commuters on the road on the perils of distracted driving. The campaign emphasizes the importance of prioritizing activities like chats, games, calls, or email in the safe and comforting environment of our homes rather than engaging in them while navigating on busy roads of the city.” The campaign ‘Drive Safely’ features multiple creatives tailored to different situations, while effectively addressing the messaging like, “Calls, games, and chats, etc. are Exciting at home ”. The campaign has been launched digitally and on out-of-home (OOH) platforms in strategic locations across Delhi NCR. The campaign is a long-term initiative aiming to raise awareness and engage a wider community in building advocacy about road safety. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Feb 16, 2024, 17:30 pm In today’s fast-paced world, navigating the complexities of Valentine’s Day gifting can often feel like a matter of urgency. Recognising this challenge, Swiggy Instamart ingeniously reimagined the concept of eleventh-hour gifting with its latest OOH campaign conceptualized and executed by Havas Media Tribes. Swiggy Instamart launched its innovative approach to Valentine’s Day marketing with interactive installations tactically positioned in high-traffic areas in Gurugram and Mumbai. This campaign introduced a fresh perspective on handling emergencies especially during the season of love, offering a unique fusion of convenience and romance designed to captivate audiences. To gain maximum visibility and engage consumers in a memorable way, these installations were strategically placed at Worldmark 2, Gurugram and the Bandstand at Bandra, Mumbai. The installations prompted passersby to consider the notion of a ‘love emergency’ and encouraged them to interact with the display. The communication on the installation ‘Do Not – Break the Glass’ prompted them to scan the QR code instead. On scanning the code, the consumers were shown a vast array of Valentine-themed items to choose from and their selection could be delivered to them in 10 minutes on the spot. Talking about the innovation, Aparna Giridhar, VP – Marketing, Swiggy , said, “During such occasions, the challenge is to consistently distinguish ourselves with a disruptive concept and push the boundaries. With this Valentine’s Day campaign, we marked a paradigm shift in how we approach festive marketing. Swiggy and Havas Media Tribes team worked in close collaboration in identifying and precisely tapping into customer sentiments, making this campaign a success.” “As we strategically placed these interactive installations in high-traffic areas, Swiggy Instamart’s Valentine’s Day campaign redefined moment marketing,” said Uday Mohan, Managing Director, Havas Media India . “We seized this opportunity to captivate audiences by offering a distinctive fusion of convenience and romance, thereby reaffirming the brand’s dedication to customer satisfaction.” Through a clever combination of messaging and visuals, the campaign highlighted Swiggy Instamart’s commitment to customer satisfaction while underscoring the importance of strategic and topical marketing in today’s competitive landscape.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 18, 2024, 11:02 am Neowise unveils a new debt collection platform with features aimed at lenders to streamline their operations & optimize their processes. Currently operating with around ₹300 crore of AUM in debt recovery, the company’s customer base has increased by 250% in the past 1 year alone. Lenders and collection agencies face numerous challenges today, especially with the increased focus on consumer rights and ethical practices. These include incomplete customer data, unstructured processes, disconnected systems, lack of advanced tools, imbalanced call frequency, insufficient agent training, and targeting individuals who have already paid. These issues significantly complicate debt collection efforts. With total digital lending disbursement expected to surpass INR47.4 lakh crore by 2026, the shift towards digital debt collection is crucial. Through Decentro’s compliant Payment Aggregator stack, Neowise gains real-time access to payment data, enabling smoother transactions and a more transparent collections experience. These combined strengths are reflected in Neowise’s impressive YoY revenue and customer growth of 436% and 250%, respectively. “Neowise’s innovative technology and advanced analytics platform are revolutionising the debt collection landscape,” says Rohit Ramachandran, Co-Founder and CEO of Neowise . “By providing lenders with cutting-edge tools and real-time insights, we empower them to streamline their collections processes by 10X. This approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also promotes broader financial inclusion while enabling lenders to remain compliant as per an ever-evolving regulatory landscape.” “Neowise’s data-driven approach and feature-rich platform are a powerful addition to the Decentro suite of financial technology infrastructure,” says Rohit Taneja, Co-Founder and CEO of Decentro . “With Neowise’s comprehensive debt collection system integrated with our payment aggregator & API banking platform, we are providing lenders with unparalleled tools and insights to manage their collections efficiently. This synergy will drive greater financial inclusion and operational excellence across the BFSI industry.” Beyond improved efficiency, enhanced visibility, and cost reduction, Neowise offers a multitude of benefits for lenders and collection agencies, such as a data-driven feet-on-street app with geo-tracking and performance-related analytics that enable more effective targeting and higher recovery rates. “I am happy to express our appreciation for Neowise. Their innovative debt recovery solutions have been invaluable to our operations. Neowise’s tech-enabled approach and actionable insights have helped us navigate deeply delinquent loan portfolios and ensured our practices align with industry standards and regulations. They always ensure our collection targets are met, and their ability to provide timely support has been commendable. They are a truly trusted partner in our debt recovery journey.” – Vaishnavi Sharma – Senior Manager – Digital Collections & Strategy, Protium Finance. Your email address will not be published.

Each of the newly launched beverages has unique features and benefits. TeaFit stands out in the beverage market with its unique Ayurvedic iced teas and zero-sugar instant tea premixes. Prioritizing natural ingredients and Ayurvedic formulations, TeaFit ensures each sip contributes to overall well-being, steering clear of artificial flavours and excess sugar. Each of the newly launched beverages boasts unique features and benefits, available in convenient sachet. The Saffron instant tea is made using authentic saffron sourced from Pulwama(J&K), providing a rich, balanced flavour and vibrant colour that sets it apart from other saffron teas on the market. The Lemongrass instant tea beverage offers a refreshing, citrusy taste, perfect for revitalising the senses. The Matcha Latte sourced from Japan made with high-quality matcha, delivers a smooth and earthy flavour, packed with antioxidants and health benefits. TeaFit’s latest offerings compliment a lineup of sugar free products. The brand’s Peach Green Tea is a top seller, known for its mild and refreshing taste without added sugar.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Oct 05, 2023, 10:35 am UNICEF Executive Director, Catherine Russell joined UNICEF India National Ambassador Ayushmann Khurrana, government officials, the private sector and young people at the launch of an innovative, digital YouthHub app to connect young people in India to future job opportunities, especially girls and marginalised youth. The platform, which functions as a digital ecosystem , was jointly launched by them along with Mr. Shombi Sharp (United Nations Resident Coordinator in India), Smt. Meeta Rajivlochan (Hon’ble Secretary, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports), Ms. Cynthia McCaffrey (Representative, UNICEF India), Mr. Ashwin Yardi (CEO, Capgemini India), Mr. Ranen Banerjee (Government Sector Leader, PwC India), Ms. Vandana Bahri (Head, Skills and Livelihood, Children’s Investment Fund Foundation – CIFF India), Ms. Dhuwarakha Sriram (Chief of YuWaah, Youth Development, and Partnerships at UNICEF), Mr. Abhishek Gupta (COO, YuWaah at UNICEF) and two young leaders – Ms. Zakira Ganji and Ms. Jagriti Pandey. The YouthHub – co-created by YuWaah at UNICEF, PwC India, Capgemini, and CIFF – aims to connect young people to curated jobs, skills, and volunteering opportunities, and enable access especially for girls and youth from marginalised backgrounds. In its first phase, which was launched on Tuesday, the YouthHub app has become accessible to young individuals via the Google Playstore. Serving as a unified platform, it offers free access to aggregated job opportunities in nine Indian languages, simplifying the job search process for young people: http://bit.ly/youthhubapp Intersecting technology and innovation, the hub is a ‘one-stop’ application that integrates diverse platforms, tools, and resources, which aggregates curated economic opportunities for young people. The launch of the YouthHub marks a significant step in convening public, private, and youth partners to foster a generation of informed and skilled young people who can transition well from learning to earning. Ms. Russell is visiting India this week to meet with government officials, members of the private sector as well as young people, children and some of India’s frontline community workers. UNICEF Executive Director, Catherine Russell, said: “Investing in children and youth is the best way to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals and create a brighter future for generations to come. Collaborative initiatives such as this YouthHub are a good way to reduce inequalities and ensure that girls are included and have access to future job opportunities. We can create a lasting impact when young people are involved in decision-making and when their voices are heard.” Ayushmann Khurrana, Bollywood star and UNICEF India National Ambassador said, “Being a UNICEF India National Ambassador has allowed me to peek into the lives, dreams, and hurdles faced by the children and young people of our country. They are our future, and ensuring they have a fair shot at success is not just a choice, it’s our duty. YouthHub app by YuWaah at UNICEF and partners is like a script for success for every young person in India. It’s not just a platform; it’s a dream factory that opens up doors to economic, skilling, and volunteering opportunities. But it’s much more than that. It’s a symbol of hope and the belief that every youngster, no matter their gender or background, deserves a shot at greatness. And we begin with equal opportunities for all. That’s what the YouthHub app will extend to young people.” Smt. Meeta Rajivlochan (Hon’ble Secretary, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports) said, “ In India, today’s youth require physical platforms to access more economic opportunities and fully realize their potential and passion. UNICEF and private sector agencies have been collaborating with us in the past and collaboration with multiple agencies, is important to increasing outreach and to fostering youth empowerment .” Ms. Cynthia McCaffrey, Representative, UNICEF India : “India has the largest population of young people in the world. Our mission is to give them the tools to drive change themselves and reach 300 million people by 2030 through all our initiatives spanning across access to economic and skilling opportunities, innovation, entrepreneurship, civic engagement, and volunteering. We have already fostered meaningful connections with over 65.5 million young people and these numbers represent lives transformed, dreams ignited, and communities strengthened and a better world in the making. YouthHub converges our efforts through YuWaah into a ‘hub’ for young people across the country which would help open doors to economic opportunities for the underserved communities.” Mr. Sanjeev Krishan, Chairperson, PwC in India said, “It is an honour to be a part of this transformative single-window platform to address young people’s socio-economic needs. This platform was envisioned because of co-creation between PwC and YuWaah (Generation Unlimited in India at UNICEF) back in 2019, where we had three key motivations: youth centrality, scale, and innovation. PwC takes pride in the fact that we have helped develop the blue book for the platform and have supported the creation of this platform. ” Ashwin Yardi, CEO – India, Capgemini said, “Capgemini is delighted to have co-created the YouthHub platform in partnership with YuWaah at UNICEF and PwC India. Serving as the co-chair of the YuWaah board in India, I have personally witnessed the inspiring passion, unwavering resilience, and boundless potential of young individuals. Their invaluable insights have been pivotal in shaping the development of this platform, a true collaboration designed to meet their unique needs. I am confident that our partnership will thrive as we remain steadfast in our dedication to innovation, ensuring that meaningful solutions touch the lives of every young individual. “ Ms. Manjula Singh, Executive Director, India Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) said, “ We, at CIFF, believe that when girls and young women are connected with the right force multipliers education, right skills and opportunities for income generation, they are able to navigate multiple barriers they face in their journey to adulthood and gain agency for their life choices among many others. Therefore, for us, investing in girls and young women is not just a moral imperative but also a strategic imperative to contribute to the Government’s vision for women-led development. Through YouthHub, we are working towards bringing a digital transformation in the lives of over a million young women by empowering them with access to a platform that aggregates job opportunities, fostering connections to 21st-century skills and socio-economic prospects.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Oct 12, 2023, 12:45 pm The stories of normal lives were never meant to be threatened by theft. Moreover, our stories are so different yet dear to each of us. Yes, they are unique in the manner they are told and because they are a part of our lives. In the past few weeks, we learned how photo blogging sites, Humans of Bombay and People of India, crawl upon other’s content to gain momentum in their business, which eventually led to copyright infringement cases. The story started with an Indian photoblog, Humans of Bombay (HOB), finding some of their content being used by the People of India (POI). It led to a copyright infringement lawsuit against the People of India. The latter was accused of copying the former’s content, including images and videos, without their consent. On the contrary, the People of India accused their rival of copying content from the US-based photo blogging site Humans of New York (HONY). The matter took a reverse turn when Humans of New York’s founder, Brandon Stanton, confirmed this using Twitter (now X), claiming Humans of Bombay to have copied content and business models from them. I’ve stayed quiet on the appropriation of my work because I think @HumansOfBombay shares important stories, even if they’ve monetized far past anything I’d feel comfortable doing on HONY. But you can’t be suing people for what I’ve forgiven you for. https://t.co/0jZM05YyTt — Brandon Stanton (@humansofny) September 23, 2023 The platform, POI, also claimed that HOB publishes similar content as other storytelling sites in India. They also claimed that the platform is not unique in terms of content. They further clarified that it’s not copyright because people share similar stories on various platforms. Earlier in September, The Delhi High Court summoned both the parties for the presence of identical content. In a verdict, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday said that there is no copyright infringement for ideas. The single bench of Justice Pratibha M Singh has stated that both the storytelling platforms are prohibited from sharing each other’s original images, articles and ways to present the picture; it should be unique on each platform. However, the bench also stated that if the same pictures are shared by users voluntarily, it would not count as a copyright infringement. On 11 th October, Karishma Mehta, Founder and CEO of storytelling platform Humans of Bombay, penned an open letter stating, “I would like to offer my story, as a duty towards our community to present the truth, now that the Hon’ble Court has passed its order.” I would like to start by saying something that I’ve said on numerous occasions in the past, over the last decade: that we have been inspired by HONY, and will always be grateful to them for showing us what storytelling can do for a community. Our legal case, however, was not about inspiration, but in fact, about – as the Delhi High Court termed it – “substantial imitation”. She writes. Our story pic.twitter.com/vg04Re16rp — Humans Of Bombay (@HumansOfBombay) October 11, 2023 “When the plagiarism first came to our notice, we reported it to Meta. This led to 16 of their posts, which were plagiarized from us, being taken down by Meta. However, it didn’t stop the plagiarism, even after we tried to resolve the matter amicably. We were left with no option but to lean on legal counsel. To that end, we’re extremely grateful to the Delhi High Court, as they have upheld our contentions and passed a permanent injunction, restraining the defendant from plagiarizing our literary works and creative expressions. It has also upheld our view that we have never sought to monopolize the story writing format, but only sought protection in relation to our expression which is created by and/or on behalf of us.” “The outcome of this case will set a precedent for the creator community, and will hopefully go a long way in safeguarding the original content that creators work so hard to build. And finally, yes, Humans of Bombay is a business; that’s something we have never hidden. While some may choose to monetize stories through mediums like books and subscription platforms, we have chosen to do it primarily through meaningful campaigns with partner brands. To this date, what motivates me and my team to work extremely hard is our love for storytelling – because we’ve witnessed how the stories we’ve told over the last 10 years have had a lasting cultural impact.” Keeping her facts right, she continues to tell the story of her side in the letter. “The last few weeks have taught me a lot, and for those learnings, I am eternally grateful. These lessons, undoubtedly, will shape the person I will become, of that I am certain. Like any young entrepreneur – I may have made mistakes, but I will continue to learn, to grow, and to evolve. Your collective feedback is not lost on me.” Humans of Bombay was founded by Karishma Mehta in 2014 with the aim of showcasing extraordinary, inspirational, and relatable stories of individuals from diverse backgrounds and walks of life. The platform has a community of over 5+ million people and has shared more than 6,000 stories to date. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Priti Singh Oct 17, 2023, 13:17 pm Come August brings the gleeful time of the year as we indulge in all our festivals. India, being a land of diversity, celebrates individual culture and tradition. Foods, clothes, jewelleries, and everything adds to that festive enthusiasm, making the perfect timing for the brands to create an imprint among consumers and expand their reach. Usually, brands this time of the year plan many sales and offers to allure customers and enhance sales. What makes this year a distinguished one? Let’s hop on. According to a report by Axis My India , 23% of people expect to shop more during the festive season this year. Companies try to tap that need to earn more revenue and eventually a faithful customer. Companies exercise their brand advertisements in a way that resonates with the emotions and minds of the consumers. They release particular promotional messages to expand their reach. Across the nation, this is a time for joy. Various regions will experience surges during festivities, from Durga Puja to Christmas. While Navratri, Karva Chauth, and Diwali are peak shopping periods for North & West, East experiences a similar uptick during the months leading up to Pujo. And North-East, a big market for us, sees it post November and up to Christmas. Says Romita Mazumdar, Founder of Foxtale. Some of the popular methods to expand reach during the festive seasons are: Khushboo Sethi, Jisora says that high inflation can affect the festive season from a retail landscape perspective. Inflation can typically increase the price of goods and services, ultimately affecting customers’ purchasing power. A shift can also be seen in the purchasing behavior of the consumers. They may focus on essential items rather than discretionary or luxury items. Retailers may also have to adjust their pricing strategies to attract customers. And all these are ultimately effecting the sales and performance of the brand. Indeed, inflation has affected the market. It has led consumers to seek more value for their money and prioritize affordability. Sleepyhead benefits from this trend as we offer quality products at affordable prices. Our brand positioning targets consumers looking for value-for-money home and living solutions. We have observed an increase in such consumers and have effectively tapped into this segment. Says Deepti Karthik, Fractional Chief Marketing Officer of Sleepyhead. Speaking of festive brand campaigns, Foxtale’s collaboration with actress Jennifer Winget for our first Festive campaign can further forecast rapid growth and increase brand equity and recall in the festive season. The Indian direct-to-consumer market is unquestionably rising, with skincare significantly influencing. Adds Romita Mazumdar, Foxtale. Jisora’s latest festival collection boasts a range of stylish fabrics like muslin and cotton, known for their comfort and breathability. At Jisora, we’ve focused on curating comfortable silhouettes that offer a modern twist to traditional ethnic wear. Our designs can be styled creatively, allowing you to express your unique fashion sense. The unique prints from Jisora are chosen to exude festive vibes, adding an extra touch of celebration to your ensemble. Above all, our collection seamlessly blends comfort and style, ensuring you feel relaxed and chic during the festivities. Says Khushboo Sethi, Jisora. In conclusion, Festivals bring bonding, love, cross-cultural exchange, and happiness among people. They represent unity and encourage social bonding. Festivals in India have certain religious connotations attached to them; Indians celebrate these with all their heart to please their deities and bring positivity and happiness to their lives. Festivals are an integral part of Indian culture that brings people together despite religious divisions. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Jan 10, 2024, 12:49 pm In a blooming world of technology, the thriving contestant is GAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence), followed by VR (Virtual Reality) and neuromarketing. These ever-evolving technologies have already disrupted businesses across industries to the core of their nature of business and working modules. As one of the key factors of businesses, marketing is always considered dynamic in nature and adapts to new technologies and consumer preferences. But are we really new to AI? Businesses leverage a spectrum of tech adaptations in a highly competitive digital landscape for sustained relevance. AI is not a new phenomenon in the field of marketing. In fact, AI has been used for various marketing purposes for decades, such as data analysis, customer segmentation, content generation, and advertising. However, with the rapid advancement of AI technology and the availability of large amounts of data, AI has emerged as a pivotal enabler for marketers, revolutionizing how businesses understand and engage with their target audience. Venugopal Ganganna, CEO, Langoor “From analysing customer behaviour and preferences to provide product recommendations to improve the customer experience, to using predictive analytics to understand and anticipate consumer behaviour, to delivering tailored content to individuals based on their interests and engagement history, to estimating the lifetime value of a customer – brands can effectively leverage predictive AI to enhance their strategies, improve decision making, and optimize their campaigns.” Says Venugopal Ganganna, CEO, Langoor. Speaking about the use cases of the technologies being used by a business, Saurabh Srivastava, VP Marketing, foundit elaborates: At the awareness stage, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) create immersive brand experiences, capturing consumer attention in unprecedented ways. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have become integral in optimizing targeting, personalization, and predictive analytics, enhancing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. In the consideration stage, Chatbots and conversational AI redefine customer interactions, providing real-time engagement and personalized assistance. Interactive content, leveraging technologies like interactive videos and quizzes, fosters deeper connections with audiences, leading to more informed purchasing decisions. Moving to the decision and action stages, Blockchain is gaining traction for enhancing transparency and security in transactions, particularly in e-commerce. Augmented analytics empowers marketers with actionable insights, enabling data-driven decision-making for campaign optimization and ROI maximization. Every business should embrace data for personalized customer experiences, regardless of the sector. Implement advanced personalization tools to create tailored consumer experiences, enhancing engagement and building brand loyalty. Businesses can also adapt technologies such as social commerce and e-commerce integrations. As per Siddhartha Vanvani, Founder & CEO of Digidarts, the biggest challenges of emerging tech and AI interface are: “Considering the current scenario, ethical challenges and regulatory issues about data privacy and transparency pose major setbacks. Additionally, the lack of proper infrastructure and high implementation costs are significant obstacles preventing businesses from embracing emerging technologies. Inaccurate and inadequate data are also a matter of concern as they challenge the business data as unsuitable for AI applications.” Says Ranjan Kumar, Co-founder & CEO, Entropik while adding on to the topic. While talking about the opportunities with tech/ AI interface, Sandeep Saini, VP-Growth, Team Pumpkin said, “Instead of being seen as a human replacement it could be considered as a supporting tool. One of the significant opportunities that AI brings ahead is enhanced customer experience. AI powered features such as chat bots or virtual assistants are making the interactions personalised yet optimised. Furthermore, the integration of AI could foster innovation and uniqueness, providing businesses with a competitive edge. Statistics indicate that more than 77% of businesses are exploring the use of AI. A figure that is expected to rise further.” The future of marketing lies in a holistic integration of technologies, creating a seamless and personalized customer journey. Russhabh R Thakkar, Founder and CEO, Frodoh World The evolving tech landscape will introduce new platforms and mediums for marketing, requiring businesses to stay agile and adapt to emerging trends. Says Russhabh R Thakkar, Founder and CEO, Frodoh World. “With the use of AI across several key industries, including tech, automotives, healthcare, edtech, etc., the future of AI has already started to take form. Prominent companies such as Tesla, Amazon, and Google are integrating artificial intelligence capabilities into their offerings to enhance consumer interaction. With technological advancements in AI, Google’s Gemini directly handles a range of input types (audio, images, video and text) and can directly output them too.” Explores Sandeep Saini, VP-Growth, Team Pumpkin. In the realm of marketing, AI could be leveraged not only while crafting innovative strategies or campaigns but to resonate with audiences, obtain insightful data, and establish a smooth customer journey. Successful businesses are those agile enough to adapt and leverage these tech innovations, positioning themselves as pioneers in a rapidly evolving landscape.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jan 29, 2024, 18:00 pm According to the viewership data from Comscore, which measures digital readership, Moneycontrol recently outperformed its primary competitor, The Economic Times, across all significant metrics. To mark this success, the Managing Editor of Moneycontrol, Nalin Mehta on Monday addressed the entire Moneycontrol team in an email, congratulating them for beating a major competitor. “We are now 4x more than ET in time spent, more than double its size in page views and well ahead of it in unique viewers. This success is a testament to the sheer depth, breadth and value inherent in our broader coverage of markets, finance and business and the work you put in,” said Mehta in the email to staff. Explaining the editorial strategy, he added, “We are strengthening our foundations for where we want to be as an essential must-have tool for anyone interested in Indian markets and business. This means a lot more exclusives, big interviews, more depth in our coverage, a wider news lens, and really upping our game in news writing for a fast-expanding digital audience.” Mehta expressed confidence about the opportunities in the new year, as he termed it a ‘big news year’. “We have a big news year coming up, with the general elections and tailwinds in the economy. We have started 2024 with a bang. But this is just the beginning! We have a tremendous opportunity here to redefine business news in India and the wider news media market.” he concluded. Moneycontrol recently launched a 360 degree ‘Indian Business ka King Kaun’ campaign to announce its leadership in the digital business news space. As part of this, Moneycontrol issued a front page ad in the Indian Express on January 29. The campaign will also go live on trade media, social and TV. *The mail has been accessed by Media Infoline.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Mar 09, 2024, 10:58 am International Women’s Day (IWD) is a global celebration that transcends mere dates on the calendar. On this luminous canvas of March 8, we brush strokes of reverence, resilience, and revolution. It’s a day when the world tilts its axis toward the remarkable tapestry of womankind. IWD isn’t just about bouquets and platitudes – it’s a symphony of voices echoing across continents. This day unfurls like a vintage map, tracing the contours of progress. It’s a call to arms—a reminder that our battles are shared. We stand shoulder to shoulder, weaving a tapestried bridge across generations. We honor the unsung heroines , the ones who whispered courage into the night, who cradled dreams in calloused palms. So, let’s raise our voices. Let’s clink glasses. Let’s honor the pioneers and the trailblazers , the ones who dared to dream beyond the confines of convention. This year, we thought of celebrating the occasion with some of the leading women voices, who marked their way through hardships; Women who adorn their tiara in the ‘man’s world’; Women who celebrate their roots and unwavering courage; Women who pick themselves up even in the murkiest time. Our first spokesperson is – Piali Dasgupta , Senior Vice President – Marketing, Columbia Pacific Communities And the second one is – Sujala Martis Director, Consumer Marketing – Platinum Guild International (PGI), India Piali: To work really hard because there is no short cut to success, unfortunately. The other advice was to “cut your coat according to your cloth.” To live within our means, and maintain a lifestyle that we could sustain, as opposed to overspending to keep up with the Jones’. Piali: In my 17+ years of corporate life, I have often noticed that many people in positions of power don’t really deserve to be there both from a competency, skillsets as well as an impact point of view. Some people are just plain lucky, and others indulge in filthy politics and manipulation to get to the top and often remain there. This is hugely detrimental to businesses in the long run and to teams that don’t go very far despite utmost dedication and hard work. Sujala: We have made great strides socially and I want to believe that we’re on this path to progress, but the news is a constant reminder that there is indeed a long way to go. I don’t think it’s possible to name just one challenge, it’s an extremely potent combination of issues from women’s safety to systemic violence to unequal access of opportunity all forming a web of interconnected obstacles. Sexual harassment and violence persist, fuelled by societal tolerance, the lack of legal recourse, and the difficulty of reporting. Girls face educational barriers, and women struggle for financial independence. At a base level bodily autonomy remains threatened even today. The challenges women face stem from the power imbalances society poses injecting vulnerability and fragility into the lives of many women. Piali: Hard, exhausting and demanding. Women work a lot harder, get paid a lot lesser, in most cases and are constantly trying to over deliver just to keep their jobs. Assertive, competent and outspoken women at work are mostly looked at as a threat, and they do have it the hardest. Sujala: It’s heartening to witness the shift – more women are stepping into roles of influence and authority. On a personal note, I realise I have been lucky, I have been able to succeed in my journey because I had strong allies and a great support system that helped me overcome challenges that came my way. But the stark facts hit home sometimes, the 2022-23 Periodic Labour Force Survey revealed that just 37% of the country’s women above 15 years of age are either working or seeking or are available for work, compared with 78.5% for males. There are many explicit and implicit challenges a woman faces in the workplace. At the root of it, is perhaps a lack of confidence, self-doubt that results in an imposter syndrome at the workplace. Even gender bias that can manifest in many ways from restricting access at the outset, to the glass ceiling, to typecasting and even labelling. It’s a long journey of perseverance and resilience, where every small victory can bring us closer to breaking down barriers and redefining the professional landscape for women. Piali: Look out for yourself first; stand up for yourself (because no one else will) and never compromise on self-respect.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Mar 12, 2024, 17:54 pm Let’s picture this: A young woman, armed with nothing but an idea and a heart full of courage, as she steps into the entrepreneurial arena. She defies societal norms, sidesteps skepticism, and carries a bag brimming with hope and possibility. This is the genesis of women’s entrepreneurship – a tale of audacious beginnings. Entrepreneurship knows no gender, yet women face unique challenges. Their striding path is rather based on biases, stereotypes, and glass ceilings. Women know their entrepreneurial canvas is textured with challenges, yet they brushstroke it with colours that are worth the narrative. The common challenges include Juggling with different roles, Gender barriers and jobs, Financial challenges, and much more. But are we ready yet as a society and country at large to assume a women leader? The organizations talk about gender neutrality and diminishing gender biases in the premises. It’s promising to see more women excelling in their fields and pursuing their passions, however, I believe we’re just a fraction of the population. Says Garima Arora, Founder & Executive Producer of Entourage Films & Co-Founder of Nammyoho Daan . While there’s progress with more girls receiving education, there’s still so much ground to cover. Inching more towards the subject, Udita Bansal, Founder, of trueBrowns , says “I acknowledge the strides made in breaking gender barriers and fostering a more inclusive environment for women-led ventures.” However, I’ve recognized the persistent challenges that women entrepreneurs face, including access to funding, gender bias, and balancing work-life responsibilities. I feel that while there has been significant advancement, there is still much work to be done to level the playing field and ensure equal opportunities for all. While building trueBrowns, I believe that starting a business with a woman’s perspective requires a nuanced understanding of female consumers’ desires, challenges, and aspirations. Key elements include designing products that cater to women’s needs while embracing diversity and inclusivity in sizing, styles, and messaging. Creating a supportive workplace culture that values women’s voices, promotes work-life balance, and offers opportunities for leadership and growth is crucial. I emphasise the importance of building a brand identity rooted in authenticity, storytelling, and community engagement, fostering strong connections with women consumers. Underlines Udita. Additionally, prioritising growth and ethical practices in sourcing, production, and business operations align with the values of many women entrepreneurs and customers. By integrating these elements into the business strategy, I have faith that entrepreneurs can establish a brand that resonates with women, drives positive social impact, and achieves long-term success in the market. The government’s support for women, through funding and networking opportunities, is invaluable. However, individual efforts remain equally crucial. Nammyoho Daan, co-founded by myself and Ness Wadia, holds a significant place in my life. It drives our passion to empower and provide a holistic development for girls and women. Says Garima. Ensuring equal access to education and supporting women to flourish and make an impact, personally and professionally. The progress that women have achieved is a testament to our collective potential. The journey might be long but one of great importance. Nevertheless, the number of female workers has fairly grown over the past decade. As per the Periodic Labour Force Survey Report 2022-23, women’s labour force participation rate has increased by 4.2% pointing to 37% in 2023. Somehow, this signifies overall progress in society at large. Let’s hope this burgeoning statistic continues to grow observing women entrepreneurs. Having said that, there are plenty of jobs yet to be concluded on the government’s part that enhance the participation of women in the entrepreneurial journey.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Apr 20, 2024, 19:10 pm When it comes to nurturing our little humans, we tend to roll around entrusting brands like Nestlé. But what happens when the brand itself is under a ‘sweet’ veil depriving a whole generation? Let’s delve deeper into the story of the top baby food and cereal brand, Nestlé, and its fondness for a not-so-innocent ingredient – sugar. A recent update took Nestlé and its baby food products to the spotlight across Asia , Africa, and Latin America. A report by Swiss NGO, Public Eye, and the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) has unearthed disconcerting findings about the brand. Nestlé baby products in less developed countries, including India, Africa, and Latin America, contain higher sugar content compared to other parts of the world including Europe and the UK. Sugar – As we all are aware can cause several diseases if consumed on a regular basis. But it can wreak havoc on infant health if introduced early. From diabetes risk to tooth decay, the consequences are far-reaching. The most reliable product, Cerelac is Nestlé’s wheat-based offering for six-month-old babies. As per the report, each serving of Cerelac contains approximately 2.7 grams of added sugar. This is the case for our country, while Nestlé in the UK and Germany serves a sugar-free product. The Food and Safety Authority of India (FSSAI) is probing the allegations. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) also raises its vigilant brow. Let’s hope for compliance, transparency and accountability. Nestlé India spokesperson said, “We would like to assure you that our Infant Cereal products, are manufactured to ensure the appropriate delivery of nutritional requirements such as Protein, Carbohydrates, Vitamins, Minerals, Iron etc. for early childhood. We never compromise and will never compromise on the nutritional quality of our products. We constantly leverage our extensive Global Research and Development network to enhance the nutritional profile of our products. Compliance is an essential characteristic of Nestlé India and we will never compromise on that. We also ensure that our products manufactured in India are in full and strict compliance with CODEX standards (a commission established by WHO and FAO) and local specifications (as required) pertaining to the requirements all nutrients including added sugars. Reduction of added sugars is a priority for Nestlé India. Over the past 5 years, we have already reduced added sugars by up to 30%, depending on the variant. We regularly review our portfolio and continue to innovate and reformulate our products to further reduce the level of added sugars, without compromising on nutrition, quality, safety, and taste. Nestlé India is committed to delivering the best nutrition to our consumers, which we have been doing for over 100 years and would always maintain highest standards of Nutrition, Quality and Safety in our products .” The question persists: Why the variance across borders? Is it a matter of taste preferences or something more insidious? As parents and conscious consumers, we must demand clarity. Transparency labels should transcend borders.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari May 07, 2024, 11:17 am Within the pages of books lie the universes waiting to be explored, a passport to wisdom, empathy and boundless horizons. Centuries ago, leaning back on the history of education when the earliest records were found from ancient civilizations, education was a natural response to the struggle for survival and prosperity. Adults imparted knowledge and skills to the young, shaping their abilities while preparing them to carry forward the legacy. As civilizations evolved, so did the education. It now facilitates awareness, uplifts moral conscience, and empowers individuals to become productive members of society, fostering critical thinking and lifelong learning. Quoting a great leader, Nelson Mandela: “Education is the most powerful weapon, which you can use to change the world.” However, the face of tutoring discreetly changed over time. In India, at this moment, quality education is equated with competitive exams and curricular activities. Children are seldom left alone to learn by their natural instincts and understanding . Somehow parents are trying to infuse intelligence inside the young minds citing the growth and success that they might earn later in their life. Enter the paramount of this era – the exam; a potential and possible way to assess children’s understanding of a particular subject taught in the said semester. However, the examination patterns have altered their shape turning into class and unit tests apart from several others on the queue. The monthly or quarterly examinations yield grades/marks that are then awarded to each student. Typically, the grades are also shared with the parents/guardians. The scenario persuades most schools in India. Today, we’re trying to understand the criteria for comprehending kids’ knowledge and analysis in the crucial developing age group of 2-8 years. We have interacted with numerous educational institutes seeking the need for examinations in junior classes. A split response was expected. It is interesting to learn many aspects of exams and their interpretation. To ensure coherence and a better understanding of the subject, we have developed a series that will be published online. Let us first try to get an insight into why should preschool/ junior classes have exams. Despite some debate surrounding the necessity and frequency of testing at this level, there are some good intentions behind the system. As per Manju Mehta, Principal, Birla Open Minds International School, Walkeshwar, Mumbai , “Exams provide a formal method for assessing students’ understanding and mastery of the material taught in class. It can provide valuable feedback to students about their strengths and areas for improvement.” “Exams help maintain academic standards and accountability. They can help in junior classes students develop important study skills, time management, and test-taking strategies that will be valuable as they progress to higher grades where exams may carry greater significance.” “Exam results may be used to inform decisions about student promotion to the next grade level or placement in different academic tracks or programs within the school. They also facilitate communication between teachers and parents about students’ academic progress and performance. They also help in building resilience and confidence through the process.” “In some educational systems, students may be required to take external standardized tests or exams in later grades. Exams can help children to cope with the issue.” Ms. Mehta further adds, “It’s important to note that while exams can be valuable tools for assessment and learning, they should be used thoughtfully and in conjunction with other forms of assessment, such as quizzes, projects, and class participation. Additionally, the frequency and format of exams should be tailored to the developmental needs and abilities of students at the junior level, taking into consideration factors such as age, cognitive development, and emotional well-being.” Speaking about the role of exams and assessments in the learning journey of children, Dr Anita Madan, Head of Curriculum Development at EuroKids , said, “ We believe the pressure of exams can create a stressful setting for young learners, hindering their natural inclination to learn and explore.” “At EuroKids, we champion a holistic assessment system that is tailored to each child’s individuality and learning process. Unlike conventional exams, EuroKids’ assessments place a premium on comprehension rather than rote memorization and fostering a deeper understanding of subjects. Children are liberated from academic pressure, and their progression to the next grade level is decoupled from their grades.” She adds. Ms. Madan further elaborates that by shifting the focus from competition to personal growth, we aim to empower children to embrace their uniqueness and develop a love for learning that extends beyond the confines of standardized testing. Mr. Raj Singhal, Co-founder & CEO of Footprints Childcare, says “ Preschool classrooms brim with discovery, not tests. Unlike later grades, exams here wouldn’t measure a child’s true potential. For young minds (3-6 years old), the emphasis should be: progress over “pass” or “fail”. Here’s why exams miss the mark: Unlike preschool, exams in grades 1-3 act as stepping stones to future learning by identifying areas where students excel and need extra help. This allows teachers to tailor their approach, ensuring children stay caught up. Scoring well builds confidence and motivates further exploration. Well-designed exams can surpass rote memorization, encouraging critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and healthy competition. The process of preparing for exams itself teaches valuable life skills. Students learn to manage their time effectively, organize their study materials, and develop the discipline needed for success in all areas of life. “Early exams should be administered to establish a solid educational base, promoting lifelong learning, rather than solely for the purpose of ranking students.” adds Mr Singhal. Contributing to the subject Ms. Sanamdeep Chadha, Promoter and Director of Genesis Global School expressed, “The progress of any child’s growth is through series of stages including physical, emotional, behavioural, and skills becoming a milestone for them at every step. Children have now started stepping out into formal set up of learning from the age of 3 and in these competitive times, we as adults start assessing them at every stage. We forget that growth, development, and learning for them happen at their own pace. With the bar of expectations going higher every time, formal assessments introduced at a very young age do cause anxiety.” Ms Chadha further adds, No doubt, every stakeholder wishes to know the progress, and assessment has a key role in that, but it should be designed in a manner that is more of an extension to the learning experience. Children learn differently and express their learning in their own way, which is why designing of assessment must cater to their needs individually. It should be creative that encourages curiosity, critical thinking and problem solving approach. The performance, therefore, for each child must be described and analysed through the systematic collection of evidence while performing diverse activities. No doubt, it should be informal in kindergarten and grade 1 that is observational, and acts more as a guiding tool to create a positive learning environment. However, in higher grades, a balanced approach that blends formative and summative assessments is to be incorporated ensuring not to create psychological pressure or stress in young students that may disrupt their emotional well-being. Lastly, assessing core concepts and competencies developed, to be focused that allows each student to compete with him or herself rather than with others. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari May 15, 2024, 13:47 pm Continuing our urge to learn more about conducting examination in junior classes, we brought to you the yet another segment of the series named ‘ Examining Young Minds: How urgent is the matter ?’ Let’s delve in! The last time we learned how exams play a crucial role in children’s lives, however a need for its establishment in the junior grades like pre-schools about age group 3-6 years is a bailiwick. The classroom study shouldn’t interrupt the playful learning and individual growth that each child may require. Moving on to the next significant question: Exams can be valuable tools if they focus on understanding, not just memorizing. Advantages should focus on skill development like Targeted Assessment, Skill Building, Confidence Boost, and Healthy Competition, enumerates Raj Singhal, Co-founder & CEO of Footprints Childcare. While exams can be valuable tools, overemphasizing memorization can have drawbacks. The pressure to recall facts can create significant stress and anxiety in young students, potentially leading to burnout. This rote learning approach limits knowledge development and valuable critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Instead of encouraging a well-rounded understanding, it creates a narrow definition of success based solely on memorization. Furthermore, focusing on grades can lead to unhealthy competition among classmates, where self-worth is measured by marks rather than a genuine love of learning. Speaking about the subject, Dr. Himani Narula, Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrician Director & Co-founder of Continua kids said, “ Exams are always know to trigger some kind of stress in the students, for some it is eustress which means good stress that motivates them to study and perform however for some it can turn into distress generating extreme fear and anxiety. While on one hand exams have their own advantages of providing a structured way of assessing a child’s understanding, it can instil discipline and study habits, can identify learning gaps in the students on the other hand it has its own disadvantages especially in young children. Exams performance can cause heightened stress and anxiety, can be overwhelming for some leading to feeling of inadequacy. Many a times poor exam performance can negatively affect a child’s self-esteem, confidence and attitude towards learning.” In childhood, exams can instill fear at a young age leading to a negative impact on their emotional development, influencing how they perceive and respond to future challenges. Early childhood fears can lead to heightened stress, which can manifest as physical symptoms like stomachache, headache and difficulty sleeping. If the child is recurrently exposed to such heightened stress and anxiety it can hinder a child’s emotional and cognitive development, it can increase clinginess to parents, low self-confidence, and may avoid participating in groups due to fear of social rejection. Unaddressed early fears can have long term effects on mental health leading to phobias, generalized anxiety disorder and related conditions. Elaborates Dr. Narula. Avoiding early recurrent stress and addressing children’s fear by providing them with a supportive, comforting environment and age-appropriate explanations, teaching them coping strategies can help mitigate these effects and promote healthy emotional development. If exams are not used as the primary means of assessing students for grade/class placement, there are alternative methods that schools can utilize to determine students’ readiness and qualifications. Manju Mehta, Principal, Birla Open Minds International School, Walkeshwar, Mumbai Enumerates some vital points here: Some schools in India aren’t conducting exams up to 8 grades, citing the considerable pressure it creates on students. “The issue of conducting exams for students in pre-schools and junior schools, particularly up to the 8th grade, is a topic of ongoing debate in education systems around the world, not just in India”. Says Ms Mehta. While exams can serve as valuable assessment tools, excessive or high-stakes testing at a young age can also contribute to stress, anxiety, and burnout among students. Implementing regulations or guidelines regarding exams in pre-schools and junior schools could help address some of these concerns and ensure a more balanced approach to assessment and learning. Ms. Mehta points out some potential considerations for such regulations: Children in the tender age group should be observed regularly rather than relying solely on annual or quarterly exams/tests. Each child possesses unique qualities that require nurturing. A single exam cannot adequately assess their capabilities. To achieve this, comprehensive policies and guidelines should be established for pre-schools across India. The primary goal should be to create a supportive and nurturing learning environment – one that prioritizes students’ overall growth, development and well-being. There should be such a system that encourages students’ innate qualities while maintaining academic accountability. After all, a healthy and happy childhood lays the foundation for an intelligent and fulfilling future. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Apr 17, 2024, 09:25 am In a country as diverse and multi-cultural as India, advertising that caters to this diverse population is surprising flat in its representation. There is low representation of various regional or ethnic groups, different body types, skin colours, and age-groups, and almost a negligible representation of the LGBTQI community, or of people with disabilities. Some of these representations are missing even in regional advertising. On a positive note, there is a positive trend in representation of women, although the quality of representation still has some catching up to do. These findings are part of an updated report titled “Mainstreaming Diversity & Inclusiveness in Indian Advertising” by The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) and the UN Women Convened Unstereotype Alliance (UA). Developed in partnership with Kantar, a global leader in brand research, this comprehensive study delves into the realm of diversity and inclusion (D&I) within Indian advertising, shedding light on evolving trends, challenges, and opportunities. The study scrutinised over 261 ads in 13 languages, and mapped them on 8 dimensions of Age, Gender, Sexual orientation, Race/ethnicity, Physical appearance, Social class, Disabilities, and Religion. It noted that Indian ads are doing well on the gender dimension, but are weak on other aspects. Report Highlights Analysis of Indian ads by Kantar’s Link™ Evaluation Framework indicates a steady increase in female representation, with 45% of commercials featuring women alone, surpassing the global average of 25%. Within the depiction of men and women, women characters are more stereotyped and shown as fair and lean versus men. Portrayal of women is also anchored to care-giving, and that of men to authority. The report noted that less than 1% of the ads featured members of the LGBTQI community or people with disabilities. About 4% of the ads featured older people above 65 years of age. In contrast to many other markets, India is a distance away in terms of celebrating the inherent diversity in its ethnicity and skin colour. Only 3% of Indian ads had representation from ethnic groups vs. the global average of 19%, and only 4% showed diversity of skin tone vs. the global average of 27%. The study uses the Progressive Unstereotype Metric (PUM) to measure consumer responses to representation in advertising. PUM measures consumers response as to whether the way people are presented in the ad represents a modern and progressive view of society. Global studies have shown that positive PUM results in higher brand affinity and intent to purchase. Manisha Kapoor, CEO and Secretary-General, ASCI , said, “Progressive advertising works better for society and for brands. Ads that are stuck in stereotypical depictions are missing a trick in connecting with India’s diverse consumer base. Collaborating with the Unstereotype Alliance and other partners, ASCI is committed to guiding and supporting the industry in achieving wider D&I representation.” Susan Ferguson, Country Representative, UN Women India , said, “As conveners of the Unstereotype Alliance India National Chapter, we are dedicated to fostering inclusivity within the advertising landscape. Over the past two years, our alliance has brought together brands, organizations, and individuals committed to leveraging advertising and media to drive a cultural shift towards diversity and inclusion. We are proud of our collective efforts to dismantle stereotypes and champion a more inclusive advertising industry.” Soumya Mohanty, MD & CCO- South Asia, Insights Division, Kantar , said, “We are proud to partner with ASCI and the Unstereotype Alliance in shedding light on the evolving landscape of diversity and inclusion in Indian advertising. Through our research and insights, we aim to drive a more inclusive and representative industry that resonates with diverse audiences.” READ THE FULL REPORT HERE: Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline May 28, 2024, 10:45 am Creating viral content on social media in 2024 hinges on tapping into the dynamic and evolving preferences of the digital audience. Here are some lessons drawn from the most shared posts of the year to help you craft content that resonates widely. And don’t forget to visit Top4SMM to find out about effective SMM solutions. Different content types resonate differently across platforms. Short-form videos continue to dominate due to their high engagement levels. However, there’s a resurgence in the popularity of longer videos (2-5 minutes), especially as platforms like Instagram and TikTok increase their maximum video lengths. These longer formats allow for more in-depth storytelling or detailed explorations of topics, catering to users looking for more than just quick entertainment ​​. Audio chat rooms have emerged as a powerful tool for direct interaction. Platforms that support live audio conversations allow brands to connect more personally with audiences, making them feel part of a community. This format is especially popular among Gen Z, who appreciate the authenticity and immediacy of live audio interactions​. Today’s consumers are highly attuned to the values expressed by brands. Content that reflects a commitment to sustainability, ethical practices, or social justice resonates deeply and tends to be shared more frequently. Authenticity in promoting these values can significantly enhance a brand’s reputation and audience loyalty​​. UGC remains a cornerstone of viral social media strategies. Content created by users that feature your brand not only provides authenticity but also serves as a peer endorsement. Encouraging your audience to share their own stories or experiences involving your brand can lead to higher engagement and broader reach​. Content that includes humor, taps into current trends, or offers relatable experiences can quickly become viral. Keeping a finger on the cultural pulse and reacting swiftly to current memes or trending topics can help your content capture the moment and spread widely​​. Posting your content at optimal times can greatly increase its visibility. For instance, mornings on weekdays are generally the best times to post on platforms like Instagram, while afternoons work better on YouTube​​. Understanding these patterns and scheduling your posts accordingly can significantly enhance their performance. Moving beyond just posting content, engaging with your audience through comments, direct messages, and live interactions can foster deeper connections and encourage more shares and likes. Personal interactions are increasingly valued by users and can lead to higher engagement rates​​. By using these plans, you can make your content more likely to go viral and also keep your audience interested in your social media posts for a long time.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 03, 2024, 17:23 pm Media as the Fourth Pillar of Democracy: Media is considered as the fourth pillar of democracy but faces increasing pressure from Governing Class, whether the legislature, executive, corporates and more. There are structured attempts by them to align the media in order to achieve their agenda. Governments exert pressure on media through advertising influence or use of state machinery to threaten so that the press can be prevented from publishing factual information. Zee Media’s flagship channel – Zee News , recently faced an alarming incident of Governmental suppression of media’s independence. On 23 rd May, 2024 an interview of Chief Minister of Delhi, Shri. Arvind Kejriwal was conducted by a senior journalist of Zee News. Post the interview, the independent editorial team at Zee Media decided not to telecast it, keeping in mind some objectionable content in the interaction. Some portions of the interview were telecasted as well but the spokesperson of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) kept insisting that “Zee News must publish the entire interview else it will face consequences like withdrawal of advertising (which was substantial on a monthly basis) by Punjab Government at the least” . I wondered, what else will they do to penalise/prosecute our freedom. I discovered soon that the Government of Punjab forced a black out across the state, leveraging a monopoly of a particular Multiple System Operator (MSO). The black out was forced, not only for Zee News, but also for Zee PHH & Zee Delhi NCR. The state government also extended the blackout of Zee Entertainment channels. To add further AAP withdrew all the spokespersons from participating in debates held by Zee Media’s news channels. Unfortunately, none of our fellow News networks raised any voice. Zee group neither could provide true news nor it could entertain its loyal viewers of Punjab for good 8 days. Zee fought this battle independently and got the channels restored by seeking justice through a legal approach. This is a real time and live example of political parties suppressing us as a fourth state. Today it is Zee, while tomorrow it can be any other news channel, news publication or platform. On 3 rd May 2024, which is celebrated annually as World Press Freedom Day, I released a video message, expressing my thoughts and views on freedom of press. This video went viral within a short frame of time. The media fraternity appreciated this step. Most of them were even shocked and surprised yet noticed this bold statement of mine. As a result, my office received 54 press interview requests. Hence, I took a yet another proactive step and conducted a Media-Meet Press Conference, leading to a constructive round of conversation with the senior members of the media-fraternity. The after effects of the viral video led to various speculations and the governing class demanded explanation. Zee Media could not only explain the reason (As mentioned above) and added that it was not directed to any particular party or person(s). Infact, this step worked in favour of the fourth estate, since Zee Media got an assurance from the system that post elections, they will work with/in the new Government and make efforts to improve the ranking of India from the current 159 th position amongst 180 nations. I was told that the mentioned rating is low since two decades and the respective governments did not attend to this issue. Unfortunately, many of the news channels, newspapers, social media and digital platforms have started accepting the pressure as part of life, instead of resisting or voicing out their disagreement. This is one reason why India ranks 159 th out of 180 in terms of press freedom. The natural blame gets inclined towards the Government, but the media itself is equally responsible. These incidences are not isolated. Various organisations/people in the governing class (political, bureaucracy, corporates and others with money-mussels) have historically employed numerous tactics to suppress media organisations, from leveraging advertising revenue to exerting pressure through corporate avenues and use of investigating agencies. Despite these challenges, Zee Media’s news channels and platforms have steadfastly upheld its credibility and commitment to public interest journalism. I not only recognise but also take pride in the importance of a free press in a democratic society and condemn any attempts to stifle journalistic freedom. The governing class has forgotten the defeat of Mrs. Indira Gandhi post emergency era. One of the major reasons of her own team’s atrocities did not come to light or to her notice; because the same team had suppressed the media. If she knew about those horrific things, she would have never let it happen to people, hence I believe that media’s freedom is important and essential for the senior/top leadership of the Government of the day. Zee Media’s news channels and platforms will continue to focus on public interest stories, bringing crucial information to the forefront regardless of external pressures. I would like to reinforce Zee Media’s Commitment towards strengthening the Fourth Estate: Despite these challenges, Zee Media remains committed to deliver unbiased and credible news focused on public interest. I urge all stakeholders, including our viewers and regulatory bodies, to recognize and stand against these threats to press freedom. A free and independent media is crucial for the health of our beloved Country in terms of it’s economy, the social structure, protection of weaker people of society, reduction of corruption and finally the democracy . I and my team are ready to pay a price or face any consequences, to keep fulfilling our ‘Dharma’ towards our readers/viewers. Zee Media has always aimed to set an example for other media organizations through its work practices and core values. Key pointers that highlight its commitment are as follows: Let us be in it together. Jai Hind- Jai Bharat Dr. Subhash Chandra Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 04, 2024, 11:35 am Source: Unsplash The nation of India is renowned for its bustling culture, natural beauty, and fast-growing economy. Every year, many people decide to relocate from the UK to India. If you have been considering whether or not to take this step, there are many factors to consider. In this guide, we will look at the benefits and challenges of moving to India from the UK, and how you can make the most of life in the country. The Republic of India, also known as Hindustan or Bharat, is located in South Asia and has a diverse climate, ranging from alpine areas in the north to tropical beaches in the south. Although it’s well-known as a popular destination for travelers and backpackers, it can also be a great place to move to permanently. If you decide to relocate from the UK, cash buyers like We Buy Any Home in Swansea and other areas can help you to sell your house quickly and easily. Property prices in India are much lower than in the UK, so you can get much more for your money there. India’s job market is one of the fastest-growing in the world, especially in the tech sector. Combined with the low cost of living, the country can be an ideal location in which to work, save, and explore opportunities. In addition, the culture is long, storied, and vibrant, with diverse languages, traditions, and festivals. India can be an excellent place to discover more about others and yourself. Source: Unsplash Although there are many benefits of moving to India, it can also be very challenging. The country’s culture and languages are extremely different from that of the UK, which can be difficult to adjust to. Social norms are notably different, and generally considered to be much more influenced by religion than those in the UK. How well you fit in is likely to depend on your specific personality traits and worldview! Aside from cultural challenges, there are also bureaucratic ones. While a travel visa can be acquired in only a couple of weeks, getting permanent Indian citizenship can vary in difficulty and time taken, depending on factors such as your heritage. One highly recommended step when moving to a new country is to learn its language. Many languages are spoken in India, with the most common being Hindi — finding out which language is most common in the part of the country you want to move to is a good idea. Alongside this integration, many expats also enjoy joining expat communities to make friends. To make the most of life in the country, you should also experience what makes it unique. Indian cuisine is popular all over the world and for good reason! Practices like yoga and Ayurveda have also traveled globally, but they originated in India, and the country is home to their best teachers. Relocating from the UK to India is a huge step, and has both challenges and rewards. When making such a big decision, you should always weigh each factor carefully, and do plenty of research. If in doubt, why not visit the country first and see what life is like there? Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 10, 2024, 11:20 am In the casino and online gambling industry, game design plays a critical role in attracting and retaining players. In addition to the striking visuals and exciting features that are also offered from your phone if you Pin Up Casino APP download , game developers are increasingly using psychological triggers to create a fun and addictive gaming experience. These triggers tap into fundamental aspects of human psychology to stimulate specific emotions, behaviors, and motivations in players. One of the strongest psychological triggers present in designing casino games is the feeling of success or reward; games are always designed in a way that they are rewarding to the players through a system of bonus rounds, free spins, and multipliers. These rewards engage the release of dopamine in the brain, creating a sensation of satisfaction while at the same time acting as motivation for the players to keep chasing the next “rush” of positive emotions and stay in the game. Additionally, many games include progression elements such as: These features appeal to players’ inner desire to grow, improve, and demonstrate their abilities, creating a constant cycle of engagement and motivation. The other powerful psychological trigger in casino game design is the idea of social proof. People are naturally known to emulate the actions and choices of others, more so in uncertain scenarios. This is where the game developers tap in by showing the popularity of some games, big wins from other players, and encouraging social sharing of gaming experience. Almost similar to social proof, limited time offers and urgency are yet another spawn of FOMO. Most often, games in the casino tend to use special offers, bonuses, and other calls to action, with an urgency element, in pushing players to participate right now; the value that could be missed out on is unimaginable. This is a psychological trigger that can really hype up the motivation for the players to be very active and involved. The illusion of control also plays an important role in the psychology of player engagement. Many of the games developed by casinos have elements that give the players an illusion of power over the outcome, even if the grounds are random. For example, in slots, some features are “stop the reel,” while blackjack and poker games tend to include a little skill or strategy. Although they don’t exactly change your base probability of winning, they add a sense of control and involvement to the fun. Modern casino games have an essential design that influences the behavior of the player and gives rise to continued long-term engagement due to psychological triggers. From that sweet sense of accomplishment and social proof to the illusion of control and the delicate balance between the familiar and the new, game developers arm themselves with psychological tools to create fun and addictive game experiences.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 10, 2024, 17:18 pm When preparing for a trip from Delhi to Vietnam, you need to do more than just choose the cheapest flight. Weather is a significant aspect of your journey because it determines how comfy and fun it will be. From Hanoi’s bustling streets to Ha Long Bay’s calm landscapes, Vietnam provides many different experiences that are strongly influenced by its weather patterns. Knowing these variations can enable you to reserve your flight at the best moment so that you have an amazing and enjoyable time. Vietnam has a diverse climate due to geographical features and monsoons . In general, the country experiences a tropical monsoon climate characterised by two main seasons: dry season and wet season. The northern and southern regions have slightly different weather patterns because they are located in different areas of proximity to the equator. Regardless of the weather conditions, Delhi to Vietnam flight prices are always affordable. To get the best weather conditions in Vietnam, try booking flights during your preferred region’s corresponding dry season. Start planning right away if you intend to go on vacation during peak tourist seasons (December-February & July-August) because airfares may skyrocket then. Use travel websites/apps that compare flight prices among different airlines for your given dates of travel. Keep your travel dates open to exploit fluctuations in airfare pricing; midweek flights or those departing very early in the morning/late night might present savings opportunities. Keep yourself updated with the weather forecasts of the dates and places you’re planning to visit. They have regular seasons in Vietnam, but there are times when exceptional weather occurs. One option is to get travel insurance, which covers weather-related disruptions so that your investment can be protected in case things don’t go as planned. Consider going on a trip during the off-peak seasons, which fall between the peak tourist periods. It promises better climate conditions coupled with fewer people around. In Vietnam, these typically fall around April-May and September-October. During this time, it is possible to find air ticket prices that are low and accommodations that charge less during good weather conditions. This allows for more affordable access to attractions while avoiding crowds at them. When planning to take a trip from Delhi to Vietnam, one needs to take into account the different climate zones throughout this country. Familiarise yourself with what each area’s climate is like during specific months in order not only to optimise but also to enjoy travelling within those times best suited for them. The right time to book an airline ticket could make all these places even more interesting by allowing seasonal activities at a reasonable cost since they all have their charms depending on when to visit.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 10, 2024, 17:20 pm Welcome to Lucknow, the Nawab city of India! The amazing traces of the city’s historic buildings can be found in every part of Lucknow, a historical city with a past of its own. As monument after monument was built throughout the Mughal era, the city gained prominence. The city’s builders and craftsmen were given royal support by the monarchs, who encouraged them to create the buildings and monuments that are now recognized as symbols of the city. Under the nawabs, the city experienced amazing flourishing. Since Bara Imambara is the most magnificent landmark in Lucknow, tourists rank it as their top destination. This historical landmark was built in the seventeenth century. It’s a complex with Bhul Bhulaiya, Asif Mosque, and a bowli. The complex’s most remarkable feature is the Bowli. The architecture is distinct and, without the use of iron, has an ornamental Mughal design. One of the best things to do in Lucknow is to book an afternoon at the complex and spend time exploring the grounds and gardens. This is one of the must-visit places in Lucknowb when taking the Goa To Lucknow flight. The Indira Gandhi Planetarium is a unique attraction located in Suraj Kund Park on the banks of the River Gomti. Designed in the characteristically ambitious Lucknowi architectural style, this planetarium was constructed in 2003 with a new design that resembles the planet Saturn, complete with outer rings. The building’s interior features air conditioning and state-of-the-art projection equipment that can be utilized to create a range of entertaining special effects during movies. Their daily programs, which are aimed at broadening the public’s knowledge of the world, have gained immense popularity in the short time since they began, making it one of the top tourist destinations in Lucknow. Standing 60 feet tall, the famed Rumi Darwaza is a stunning entryway in Lucknow’s old city. Standing between the Bara and Chota Imambaras, it boasts ancient Awadhi architecture. A historically significant structure, Rumi Darwaza is located in the heart of Lucknow. Roadways crisscross the spectacular arch of the tall structure on both sides, which is even more mesmerizing at night. Another reminder of the brutality of the “Siege of Lucknow” is the Sikander Bagh, which was once Nawab Wajid Ali Shah’s summer residence. Though the 120 square yards are called a “garden,” they also have a villa, an entryway, multiple openings, defensive walls, and corner bastions. Owing to the National Botanical Research Institute, open areas, seats in the center, and Botanical Garden, it is one of Lucknow’s most picturesque locations and a well-known landmark. Lucknow city is divided into two uneven halves by the Gomti River. It passes through the center of the city exactly. The Gomti Riverfront Park is an additional location that might help you feel refreshed. Located along the banks of Gomti, this verdant park is the perfect place to escape during the late hours of the night. A leisurely stroll or nighttime walk would be enjoyable in the visually appealing park. Tourists can enjoy a musical fountain show in the evening. To the melodies of exquisite musical symphonies, the water dances. The Aminabad Market has been a renowned tourist destination since the Nawabs’ era. Everything is on show here, including locally made handicrafts, footwear, rugs, bed linens, and jewelry and clothing made by hand in Chikankari. You can try out multiple restaurants in the region, such as Wahid Biryani, Tunday Kababi, and Kalika Chat House, after an exciting shopping trip. This is going to be non-negotiable during your Indore To Lucknow flight . Located at Saraswati Ghat on the Yamuna’s banks is the renowned Mankameshwar Mandir. The first female priest was appointed to this well-known Hindu temple honoring Lord Shiva. This location is frequently frequented by devotees during Shivratri and on Mondays. The fact that Mankameshwar Mandir is thought to be a 1000-year-old Hindu shrine is another distinctive aspect of the place. Take your family to the temple for a spiritually enlightening experience. The structure is made of shimmering white sandstone, and seeing this location is a must for any tourism itinerary. Within the compound, there are enormous minarets, picture-perfect domes, and exquisite calligraphy on the walls. The mosque is among the best in the nation because of its 260 pillars and 15 arched domes with elaborate brickwork and sculptures. When travelling by flight, make sure that you are well aware of all the airline’s rules & policies. Be well prepared with your luggage, your documents, and everything well in advance, which could cause problems in travel. Lucknow is indeed one of the most beautiful cities in India, and it is known for its food and Indian heritage. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 12, 2024, 11:18 am Nine mentees from India will be part of a cohort of 200 mentees participating in London International Awards – Creative LIAisons Virtual Coaching program. Their journey began in May and will continue through November. This program offers young industry professionals an extremely rare opportunity to have real time, one-to-one e-coaching with three different well-known, well-awarded and well-established industry leaders from around the world. Coaches will share their expertise and experiences of their many years in the industry. These private and bespoke e-mentoring sessions are customized to the mentee, covering all disciplines with emphasis on skill development, elevating ideas and boosting creative confidence to fast-track careers. It is no secret that behind every successful person, there is a mentor who has helped them along the way. Some of the most famous people had mentors. Mother Teresa had Father Michael van der Peet; Jackson Pollock had painter and muralist, Thomas Hart Benton; J.J. Abrams credits Steven Spielberg as his mentor; and this list goes on and on. Creativity is fluid, so there are no set rules or a prescribed formula for the sessions. Each session is customized between mentor and mentee. They are at full liberty to design how they want to conduct each session. The end game? To hone the skills of young creatives, so they can reach their full potential and rise to greater heights. Laurissa Levy , Creative LIAisons Director/Events Director, said, “If you go on the internet and search how to find a mentor, you’ll find that the most frequent advice tells you to set your goals, explore who is in your network, reach out, meet up and nurture that relationship. But, we all know how hard it can be to achieve all of that if you are a young creative. It’s a big ask to get a busy, respected senior creative to be a mentor. That’s why, Creative LIAisons has established its virtual coaching program. We match mentees with mentors from all around the globe. Our aim is to extend this opportunity to as many as possible, even in less represented markets. This virtual coaching program began in 2021 and has become an integral part of the Creative LIAisons program, an educational initiative to give back to the industry that supports us.” Creative LIAisons Virtual Mentees from India: Rhea Ahuja , Associate Creative Director, Dentsu India, Bangalore Adrian David , Freelance Creative, Mumbai Arundhati Deb , Copywriter, FCB India, Gurugram Mowin Dias , Brand Strategist, DDB Mudra Group, Mumbai Miriam Paul , Creative Supervisor, Ogilvy, Bengaluru Devika Saxena , Senior Creative Solutionist, McCann Worldgroup, Bangalore Tanvi Shah, Senior Copywriter, Toaster India, Gurgaon Yashaswini Singh , Creative Team Leader – Copy, McCann Worldgroup, Gurugram Kushagra Srivastava , Account Planning Strategist, Schbang, Mumbai How are mentees matched with their respective mentors? The focus is on the mentees – to give them greater length, breadth, height and depth with these sessions. So careful consideration is given to the mentees’ requests. While mentees were able to submit their wish list from the list of 200 mentors, there were a few additional criteria we abide by to find mentees the right fit. The rule of thumb is: no mentee will be mentored/coached by someone in their own company, either locally or globally. Selection process: To be eligible for the program, mentees have to be currently working in the industry or a related business and be between the ages of 21 and 30 years old. LIA does not directly select mentees. We leave it up to Companies and Agency Networks that support LIA to put forward candidates. Additionally, LIA collaborates with different Ad Clubs, Associations, and Trade Press by allocating spaces to winners of creative competitions organized by them. To cast the net even wider, the Creative LIAisons Virtual Coaching Program does accept a certain quota of self-nominations. Laurissa Levy added some advice for the mentees, “As the e-coaching sessions are underway, I urge all mentees to make full use of this rare privilege to be part of this program. Your mentors will most definitely challenge you, push you out of your comfort zone, be your confidant, cheer you on to do greater work, help you develop skills or even teach you new ones. But more importantly, they will coach you to aim higher and achieve those aims. It’s the start of your journey with not one, but three top creative minds. Enjoy the ride.” Full list of Virtual and Onsite Mentees Your email address will not be published.

He will report to Harsha Razdan, CEO, South Asia, dentsu. Narayan returned to the network for a second stint in June last year. He took on the mantle of Group Chief Strategic Advisor, swiftly establishing a Central Strategy Team for the South Asia Market alongside the Executive Leadership. In his new capacity, Narayan is entrusted with the task of executing the network’s strategy to deliver industry-defining client solutions at the intersection of marketing, technology, and consulting. His mandate includes bringing together the strategy and planning teams across various critical practices including creative, media, and customer experience (CX). Further, Narayan will also set up and run the business transformation, sustainability consulting, innovations, startup growth partnerships, expert alliances, and knowledge verticals across the group. As dentsu transforms into a Business-to-Business-to-Society (B2B2S) company committed to creating a valuable future for brands and society, Narayan will closely work with clients and internal talent to champion meaningful progress collaboratively. Commenting on his appointment, Harsha Razdan said, “Dentsu stands as an unparalleled powerhouse of creativity, innovation, and exceptional talent. Our goal is to enhance our customer focus, adaptability, and inventiveness as we embark on the next phase of our growth journey. We aspire to be the primary choice for clients seeking progress for themselves and their customers in marketing, technology, and consulting. Narayan’s appointment seamlessly aligns with our global strategic vision. He has proven himself to be an invaluable asset at dentsu – a remarkable individual, a distinguished leader, and an outstanding professional. I wholeheartedly welcome Narayan to his new role.” Narayan Devanathan added, “As someone who started off as a copywriter many years ago, I’ve never forgotten the unparalleled power of creativity to solve problems and unlevel the playing field. At dentsu, we’re now bringing that power to create positive change for companies and society. It starts with reminding our people of the power of a diverse collective and re-arming ourselves with new ways to collect and connect dots across the business spectrum. And in the process, we’re putting down three simple principles: have amazing fun, do the right thing, don’t settle for the status quo. I’m excited as I was on the first day of my first job to do all of the above, in partnership with Harsha, all of our wonderful people, our clients, and our partners. We’re the future we want to create.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Team MI Jan 30, 2023, 12:42 pm Every year, Forbes India 30 Under 30 highlights 30 individuals who are exceptional in their fields. Now in its tenth year, the winners of the 2023 list are no different. It was 10 years ago in 2014 when we first published the Forbes India 30 Under 30 list. You’ll recognise some of our winners from the Class of 2014 who are making waves even today—Bhavish Aggarwal, Ola; Rajkummar Rao, actor; Pooja Dhingra, Le15; Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja of Shivan and Narresh; Cheteshwar Pujara, cricketer, to name a few. Over the years, the Forbes India 30 Under 30 winners have represented young and upcoming talents and businesses across the most relevant sectors in the day. From 14 categories in 2014 to 21 in 2023, we have been restrained while adding new categories or dropping them, to ensure we don’t leave out any new trends emerging in business. This year, cryptocurrency is now Web3 to account for advancements in the sector in Metaverse and Web3. This year, its 10 th , the Forbes India 30 Under 30 alumni club will be 300-strong and we can safely claim that we’ve had many hits. Take Nikhil Kamath, for instance, who was featured on the list in 2016 when he was 29. Zerodha has changed the stock market investing landscape for retail investors in the country. Today, he’s one of India’s youngest billionaires. The Class of 2016 also featured the cofounders of Postman—Abhinav Asthana, Abhijit Kane and Ankit Sobti—that has now put India on the global tech map and is transforming the way developers world over look at software by taking an ‘API-first approach’. Then there’s Swiggy from 2017 as well as Pharmeasy from the same year, and Sharechat, and RazorPay. Ather Energy, Bellatrix Aerospace, and Meesho from 2018. Ninjacart, smallcase, Wakefit, and Porter from 2019. Bira, BharatAgri, and SleepyOwl from 2020. Our mantra to pick the class of 30 Under 30 has always been to discover the young before they make it big, and our success transcends business, to entertainment and sports as well. Tahir Raj Bhasin and Taapsee Pannu (Class of 2017); Bhumi Pednekar, Vicky Kaushal and Mithila Palkar (Class of 2018); Vijay Deverakonda (Class of 2019); Sai Pallavi (Class of 2020) represent the esteemed alumni in entertainment. In sports, Anirban Lahiri, Dipa Karmakar (Class of 2016); Aditi Ashok (Class of 2017); Jasprit Bumrah, Harmanpreet Kaur (Class of 2018); Neeraj Chopra, Smriti Mandhana and Hima Das (Class of 2019), to name a few in sports, have gone on to put India on the map in their own tracks and fields and won international acclaim. The Class of 2023 will be no different. 30 achievers across 21 categories, picked by an expert jury for each category have strived to reach here and will continue to build businesses to last, and careers to reckon with. They will bridge crucial gaps in the dynamic Indian market with their startups and win accolades for the country in their respective sectors. The youngest on the list this year is only 21 and his startup in Climate Change & Clean Energy represents a thinking young generation that is interested in solving the most pertinent problems of the world today and not just creating wealth or fame. “The 2023 Forbes India 30 Under 30 list is about those free spirits that dare to be different and break existing rules,” Brian Carvalho, editor, Forbes India , says. Meet the Class of 2023 —they are, like most of our alumni in their day, only getting started! Your email address will not be published.

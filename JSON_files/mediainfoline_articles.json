    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Apr 15, 2024, 13:17 pm Godrej Vikhroli Cucina- a curated, brand-agnostic, owned media platform- hosted a star-studded launch for the highly anticipated Godrej Food Trends Report 2024 at the glamorous Godrej L’Affaire 2024. The report, under the theme ‘Provenance’, explores the rich tapestry of India’s food culture, delving into the diverse origins of ingredients and India’s culinary practices. Tanya Dubash – Executive Director & Chief Brand Officer, Godrej Industries Limited , unveiled the seventh edition of the report, sparking curiosity among food enthusiasts like Malaika Arora who were present to discover the fascinating trends shaping the future of food. The Godrej Food Trends Report 2024 convened over 190 thought leaders from diverse culinary backgrounds, including celebrity chefs, bloggers, and nutritionists who shared their insights on the comprehensive trends cited in the report. In an ever-evolving culinary landscape, the theme of Provenance signifies the exploration and amplification of the depth and diversity of Indian cuisine, it not only connects us to the origins of our food but also highlights the need for sustainable practices that preserve our culinary heritage. The report also throws light on conscientious eaters who seek transparency and authenticity and gravitate towards products that champion the values embedded in their journey from farm to plate. Commenting on the 2024 edition of the report, Tanya Dubash – Executive Director & Chief Brand Officer, Godrej Industries Limited and Associate Companies , said, “The Godrej Food Trends Report 2024 marks another milestone in our quest to spark conversations and identify trends in the food industry. Consumers are getting savvier about their diets, focusing on mindful nutrition. With a focus on Provenance, this edition celebrates India’s rich culinary heritage and invites readers to explore the myriad flavours and cultures that define our nation. I am confident that readers will be captivated by the depth and diversity of insights offered within this edition, further solidifying India’s position as a global leader in the realm of food and gastronomy.” Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal, Managing Director of Perfect Bite Consulting and Curating Editor of the Godrej Food Trends Report , sets the stage for the 2024 edition: “As we launch the 2024 edition, we continue to witness India’s emergence as a global culinary powerhouse, rooted in the theme of Provenance. In India, provenance is guiding our most relevant conversations around food. This interest in provenance is also translating into real growth for the F&B industry. The traditional plate, once dictated primarily by seasonality and local bounty, is now being driven by a quest for flavour. I am optimistic that the Indian food industry will prove to be a benchmark for empowerment and innovation in the years to come. Just as each dish in a multi-course meal tells a story, each section of the Godrej Food Trends Report 2024 invites readers to savour the insights and flavours of our diverse food culture.” Some key insights from the Godrej Foods Trends Report 2024 are : “India’s soft power is our cuisine and its sheer diversity, and the power of our history, plurality, and continuity. So, I am happy to see it finally valued for being authentic and unapologetically true to itself. For the longest time, we have been carpet-bombed with a generalized idea of Indian food defined by political boundaries. But whatever prism you use to break it down by, the context for regional cuisines will always be the geography, agriculture, climate, and culture of a place.” shares Celebrity Chef Ajay Chopra . Since its inception in 2018, the Godrej Food Trends Report has emerged as one of the most credible platforms on themes that significantly impact the food industry each year. Over its existence, the report has drawn on insights from over 1500 experts and thought leaders from food, beverage, and allied industries spanning across industry verticals and geographies. Through a celebration of Provenance, the 2024 report sets the stage for a renaissance in Indian cuisine, where tradition meets innovation to create a tapestry of flavours that captivates the senses.

He will report to Harsha Razdan, CEO, South Asia, dentsu. Narayan returned to the network for a second stint in June last year. He took on the mantle of Group Chief Strategic Advisor, swiftly establishing a Central Strategy Team for the South Asia Market alongside the Executive Leadership. In his new capacity, Narayan is entrusted with the task of executing the network’s strategy to deliver industry-defining client solutions at the intersection of marketing, technology, and consulting. His mandate includes bringing together the strategy and planning teams across various critical practices including creative, media, and customer experience (CX). Further, Narayan will also set up and run the business transformation, sustainability consulting, innovations, startup growth partnerships, expert alliances, and knowledge verticals across the group. As dentsu transforms into a Business-to-Business-to-Society (B2B2S) company committed to creating a valuable future for brands and society, Narayan will closely work with clients and internal talent to champion meaningful progress collaboratively. Commenting on his appointment, Harsha Razdan said, “Dentsu stands as an unparalleled powerhouse of creativity, innovation, and exceptional talent. Our goal is to enhance our customer focus, adaptability, and inventiveness as we embark on the next phase of our growth journey. We aspire to be the primary choice for clients seeking progress for themselves and their customers in marketing, technology, and consulting. Narayan’s appointment seamlessly aligns with our global strategic vision. He has proven himself to be an invaluable asset at dentsu – a remarkable individual, a distinguished leader, and an outstanding professional. I wholeheartedly welcome Narayan to his new role.” Narayan Devanathan added, “As someone who started off as a copywriter many years ago, I’ve never forgotten the unparalleled power of creativity to solve problems and unlevel the playing field. At dentsu, we’re now bringing that power to create positive change for companies and society. It starts with reminding our people of the power of a diverse collective and re-arming ourselves with new ways to collect and connect dots across the business spectrum. And in the process, we’re putting down three simple principles: have amazing fun, do the right thing, don’t settle for the status quo. I’m excited as I was on the first day of my first job to do all of the above, in partnership with Harsha, all of our wonderful people, our clients, and our partners. We’re the future we want to create.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Apr 29, 2024, 11:40 am DigiCert, a leading global provider of digital trust, today announced the appointment of Atri Chatterjee as Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). As CMO, Chatterjee will lead the global marketing organization to promote the DigiCert brand, including the development and execution of the company’s digital trust initiatives and campaigns, while partnering closely with the sales and product organizations to drive revenue. Chatterjee joins DigiCert from ForgeRock, where he spent five years serving as CMO until the $2.3B acquisition by Thoma Bravo and subsequent merger with Ping Identity. While at ForgeRock, he drove go-to-market strategy that contributed to nearly quadrupling the company’s annual recurring revenue in five years and establishing the company as one of the leading identity and access management solutions for the enterprise. Before ForgeRock, Chatterjee held CMO roles with global cloud security leader, Zscaler, as well as SaaS marketing automation and revenue optimization provider, Act-On Software. He has also served in senior marketing roles at global B2B security technology companies including Symantec, VeriSign, McAfee, and CipherTrust. “Atri’s experience in scaling global marketing organizations at high-growth and large enterprise security companies is what DigiCert needs as we drive to $1 billion and beyond in annual recurring revenue,” said Amit Sinha, CEO of DigiCert . “He is a seasoned CMO with security market experience, product acumen, operational excellence in driving demand, and a reputation for building high performance marketing teams. We are excited to expand our executive leadership team with Atri and look forward to seeing his contributions to DigiCert’s success.” “Joining DigiCert now is a tremendous opportunity for me because of the challenges organizations face in establishing trust on the internet due to the increase in the malicious use of AI and the advent of quantum computing,” said Chatterjee. “This is a rare chance to work with the industry leader in digital trust, who is at the forefront of shaping the security landscape of the future.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline May 29, 2024, 12:46 pm QX Lab AI, a cutting edge Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) company, announced today the launch of Ask QX PRO, an advanced version of its Generative AI platform Ask QX. Expanding on the success of Ask QX, which focused on text to text capabilities, Ask QX PRO introduces multimodal features like text to image, image to text, document analysis, and text to code, alongside its text to text capabilities, incorporating a wider array of functionalities and requirements. Since its launch earlier this year, Ask QX has garnered over 15 million users, with 4 million of them engaging with the platform on a regular basis. The core focus of QX Lab AI has always been to create a platform that educates users on the vast potential of Generative AI, emphasizing use cases of this technology in both business and personal scenarios. QX Lab AI is based on a foundational model, which means that the platform trains on its datasets and has its own API. This makes QX Lab AI one of the six foundational models in the world, along with OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, and Cohere, among others. Ask QX PRO has an improved version of the previous model’s text to text feature. Additionally, its text to image feature is capable of generating clear images from textual input, while the image to text feature offers users the best source of detailed textual information derived from images. The platform’s text to code feature makes it possible to transform prose type descriptions into coded snippets, while the code editing feature allows the user to edit the code base, add new codes, and even rectify any wrong code with real-time suggestions & corrections. Furthermore, the document analyser feature allows users to browse and search documents, scan for important data, and extract information from it. These improvements give Ask QX PRO a universal value and reliability for different practical uses. For its multimodal architecture tailored for B2B industries, Ask QX PRO has introduced two pioneering technologies: the Advanced Multimodal Synthesis System (AMSS) and the Dynamic Integration and Synthesis Matrix (DISM). AMSS employs a state-of-the-art transformer-based framework, trained on 20 trillion tokens and featuring a complex architecture of multiple small expert models, enabling robust data integration and facilitating intricate interactions among varied data types such as text and images—ideal for complex B2B applications. This integration is enhanced through sophisticated manifold alignment and optimized Bayesian integration, projecting inputs into a unified, comprehensive framework. DISM utilizes advanced cross-modal attention mechanisms alongside recursive tensor decomposition to seamlessly synthesize and integrate multimodal data from multiple industry sources. With up to 665 billion parameters, it ensures precise, adaptive outputs that respond dynamically to evolving business environments while incorporating differential privacy algorithms to maintain stringent data integrity and security, supporting critical B2B applications across various sectors. Ask QX PRO has been designed to support more than 120 languages. This includes languages like English, Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Irish (Gaelic), and Cornish, and it is done with the intention of democratising access to Generative AI by catering to users from every region within this vast market. The platform inferencing ensures that outputs are relevant and resonant for all users. Users will get free access to the platform, and a premium model will be introduced by the company in mid-June this year. Keeping data privacy and security as the utmost priority, QX Lab AI will ensure local storage of user data is in compliance with relevant local laws. The company will work together with its infrastructure partners to safeguard user data privacy and security, adhering to the highest standards of data security applicable in the UK and the EU. For now, the Ask QX PRO application will be accessible to Android users , with the iOS version expected to be launched soon. Moreover, the Ask QX PRO has comprehensive data protection measures, including encryption of data at rest and in transit, using industry-standard protocols. Continuous monitoring and logging of all system activities to detect and respond to potential security threats in real time. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities. Mr. Arjun Prasad, Co- Founder & Chief Strategy Officer (CSO), QX Lab AI said, “ The launch of our multimodal platform is a testament to the tremendous response we have received for Ask QX. We believe that Europe is a crucial market for any technology company like ours, especially given the large number of tech-savvy populations ready to embrace Generative AI for personal and professional use. We recognize the importance of strategic partnerships to grow our platform and reach users across every corner of the continent. With this approach, we aim to replicate the success of Ask QX in the remotest parts of the continent. By focusing on local needs and preferences, we are confident that Ask QX PRO will become an indispensable platform for users throughout the region.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 05, 2024, 11:20 am Ruder Finn Asia (www.ruderfinnasia.com), the award-winning communications consultancy, today launched the latest version of its SONAR crisis management simulation platform. SONAR 5.5 allows corporations to practise their level of crisis preparedness in the face of evolving risks to share price, revenues and reputation. Multi-lingual, SONAR 5.5 can be operated in multiple languages including English, Chinese, Korean and Japanese. The platform also incorporates new interactive features which identify potential areas for future concern allowing for pre-emptive strategy and planning. When faced with a full-scale issue or crisis, management teams often discover the planning they have in place fails under pressure. SONAR 5.5 is fast, effective and action-oriented, designed to identify planning gaps and propose practical, workable, real-world solutions. With close to 100% client satisfaction rates, SONAR 5.5 creates an immersive crisis environment allowing participants to experience every aspect of a fast-evolving crisis. The versatile multimedia portal is internet-enabled: SONAR 5.5 simulations can be run for a single market or global teams of up to 100 people allowing corporations to see where their crisis planning works and where gaps exist. SONAR 5.5 replicates every aspect of a crisis situation: negative media reports, share price impact, stakeholder anger and employee protest. The platform is immersive meaning participants quickly forget that SONAR is a simulation due to the reality of the created environment. The output of every SONAR is a more experienced team, upgraded risk planning, greater vigilance and preparedness for the future. Ruder Finn Asia has identified the key operational implications of being unprepared for a crisis or issue as a disorganised response, scattered decision making, absence of strategy and no sense of mission. This translates to loss of narrative, loss of control and loss of value. Ruder Finn Asia’s experience has also identified the hallmarks of companies who emerge well from a crisis: preparation, leadership, action and communication. Charles Lankester, EVP, Global Risk at Ruder Finn Asia said today, “ Together, we build resilience and ensure our clients act with confidence whatever the circumstances . We have delivered close to 150 SONARs since 2020 and consistently hear how much clients value the experience and learning. The SONAR team are career experts in reputation and risk management, ensuring our clients stay ahead of situations wherever possible. Reputation is a primary global business risk, but most companies are unprepared and under-resourced in the event of an issue. We are the risk management partner of choice for hundreds of corporations and bring experience across Hong Kong, Mainland China, Asia-Pacific and globally.” David Ko, Managing Director at Ruder Finn Interactive (RFI), Ruder Finn’s digital consultancy, said today, “ SONAR 5.5 is the result of years of crisis management expertise and learning, distilled into an actionable, high value platform, updated for the AI era. The crisis landscape now evolves at an ever-faster pace, so we continually upgrade SONAR to reflect this new environment. New threats such as deepfakes, voice cloning and bots now require crisis management with technology that meets the challenge. Previously, we embedded generative AI into SONAR’s operation, harnessing the power of ChatGPT to create multimedia injects that simulate interactions with key stakeholders such as government regulators, activist shareholders, protesting employees and consumer groups. SONAR 5.5 now streamlines and presents additional interactions visually so that participants can easily track and manage their crisis decisions and actions. The core of SONAR’s value, however, remains the expert guidance and coaching conducted by trainers and their real-time feedback on client team dynamics and effectiveness. This work also incorporates a significant predictive component, identifying potential areas for future concern and pre-emptive strategy and planning.” Atul Sharma, CEO Ruder Finn India and Head, Middle East said, “In today’s dynamic business landscape, proactive crisis preparedness is key to protecting your company’s image and strength. Leveraging cutting-edge AI capabilities, SONAR 5.5 isn’t just a tool—it’s our way of giving businesses the power to steer through stormy seas. With its innovative features and user-friendly interface, SONAR 5.5 equips teams with the foresight and confidence needed to face challenges head-on.” To watch the Video click here Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Oct 17, 2023, 11:50 am Balancehero India, a prominent RBI authorised digital lending company, has launched its inaugural brand campaign, titled ‘Aapki Har Zaroorat Ka Saathi’, which revolves around the theme of fulfilling customers’ aspirations through financial assistance. At its core, the campaign showcases how TrueBalance’s digital lending platform simplifies access to instant personal loans, ranging from ₹1,000 to ₹1,00,000, with just a few clicks. The campaign’s storyline vividly portrays everyday challenges faced by people from various backgrounds, united by one common factor – unfulfilled dreams due to financial constraints . TrueBalance emerges as the solution provider, the steadfast friend, helping individuals overcome these obstacles and turn their aspirations into reality. The financial inclusion revolution in India has primarily favored urban areas, leaving tier 2, tier 3, and rural regions with restricted access to financial services and minimal availability of credit facilities, hampering economic growth. According to recent research data, out of the 814 million credit-assessable adult population in India, around 572 million fall into the ‘credit unserved’ and ‘credit underserved’ categories, which implies a significant untapped market opportunity. ‘Aapki Har Zaroorat Ka Saathi’ by TrueBalance aims to empower Millennials, salaried, and self-employed individuals in tier-2, tier-3 cities. It provides easy access to personal finance solutions, bridging the void left by traditional institutions and enabling the young middle class to achieve their aspirations in the real Bharat. Manika Mittal, Communications Head at Balancehero India , expressed her excitement about the campaign, stating, “We are thrilled to introduce our inaugural brand campaign, ‘Aapki Har Zaroorat Ka Saathi’ This initiative is geared towards empowering India’s young middle class, demonstrating how they can transform their aspirations into reality through quick, secure, and effortless access to small personal loans. At BalanceHero India, our commitment is to reach the next billion individuals in the country, promoting financial inclusion by understanding their unique needs and delivering seamless credit solutions to approximately 70% of the credit-assessable population that is currently underserved and unserved. This campaign celebrates our journey by engaging with our customers, building brand awareness, and underscoring our role as a trusted friend and credit provider to the underserved and unserved in various everyday situations and events.” The campaign’s storyline transcends geographic boundaries, highlighting the universal aspirations of people from diverse backgrounds. Whether it’s pursuing higher education, starting a business, or dealing with unexpected expenses, TrueBalance is there—a reliable companion and solution provider for those in need. The ‘Aapki Har Zaroorat Ka Saathi’ campaign is set to capture the hearts and minds of viewers through multimedia marketing, including OTT, digital, and social media platforms. While digital and OTT platforms target audiences in metros and major cities, social media will connect with viewers in tier-2 and tier-3 towns, all united by the dream of a brighter future, made possible by TrueBalance. Watch the full video here Balancehero India offers multiple types of personal loans through its digital lending app, TrueBalance. It is one of the few digital lenders in the country that is backed up by their own NBFC, ‘True Credit’. The company further plans to diversify its product offerings by taking a marketplace approach, which involves expanding its lending portfolio by introducing various financial service providers.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Feb 16, 2024, 17:30 pm In today’s fast-paced world, navigating the complexities of Valentine’s Day gifting can often feel like a matter of urgency. Recognising this challenge, Swiggy Instamart ingeniously reimagined the concept of eleventh-hour gifting with its latest OOH campaign conceptualized and executed by Havas Media Tribes. Swiggy Instamart launched its innovative approach to Valentine’s Day marketing with interactive installations tactically positioned in high-traffic areas in Gurugram and Mumbai. This campaign introduced a fresh perspective on handling emergencies especially during the season of love, offering a unique fusion of convenience and romance designed to captivate audiences. To gain maximum visibility and engage consumers in a memorable way, these installations were strategically placed at Worldmark 2, Gurugram and the Bandstand at Bandra, Mumbai. The installations prompted passersby to consider the notion of a ‘love emergency’ and encouraged them to interact with the display. The communication on the installation ‘Do Not – Break the Glass’ prompted them to scan the QR code instead. On scanning the code, the consumers were shown a vast array of Valentine-themed items to choose from and their selection could be delivered to them in 10 minutes on the spot. Talking about the innovation, Aparna Giridhar, VP – Marketing, Swiggy , said, “During such occasions, the challenge is to consistently distinguish ourselves with a disruptive concept and push the boundaries. With this Valentine’s Day campaign, we marked a paradigm shift in how we approach festive marketing. Swiggy and Havas Media Tribes team worked in close collaboration in identifying and precisely tapping into customer sentiments, making this campaign a success.” “As we strategically placed these interactive installations in high-traffic areas, Swiggy Instamart’s Valentine’s Day campaign redefined moment marketing,” said Uday Mohan, Managing Director, Havas Media India . “We seized this opportunity to captivate audiences by offering a distinctive fusion of convenience and romance, thereby reaffirming the brand’s dedication to customer satisfaction.” Through a clever combination of messaging and visuals, the campaign highlighted Swiggy Instamart’s commitment to customer satisfaction while underscoring the importance of strategic and topical marketing in today’s competitive landscape.

Besides being a Co-Founder and CFO, I also had the privilege of taking on various responsibilities and playing multiple roles similar to CXO as well. As this journey comes to an end, all I would say is that bigger things are in the offing. There is always a greater journey when one decides to be constantly in the process of creating new worlds. About moving forward, I will announce my next venture soon.” Post her exit, Soumya has ambitious plans for a new venture that will focus on a Media based SaaS platform along with several other initiatives on the technology front.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Feb 09, 2024, 15:41 pm Pocket Aces’ long-form studio Dice Media is releasing the 4th season of its school romance show Crushed. Crushed is Dice Media’s 4th show to have 4 successful seasons, a rare feat in today’s web series environment. Starting with the release of S4 of its innovative series Firsts in 2021, S4 of the most awaited show Little Things also released in 2021, S4 of What The Folks released in 2022, and S4 of Crushed now released in 2024. Along the way, they have created characters such as Dhruv-Kavya from Little Things, Anita-Nikhil from What The Folks, and Aadhya-Sam from Crushed that remain audience favorites long after each season is aired. With ratings of over 8.2 on IMDB across these shows, Dice Media has established itself as a leader in the relationship and family show space, especially when it comes to metro and Tier 2 Indian youth. Speaking about the success of our four most heart-warming shows, Aditi Shrivastava, Co-Founder and CEO, Pocket Aces says, “ Creating multi-season franchises is extremely exciting for us. We use deep insights from our short-form content to pick concepts that will have enough arms and legs to remain extremely engaging and relatable to audiences season after season. Our creative directors and writers design the characters with an endeavor to create likeable, albeit flawed, protagonists that feel like real people you know in your real lives. That’s how audiences get so attached to them and can’t get enough. It is this audience demand, anticipation,, and engagement that encourages us to keep bringing our shows back for subsequent seasons.” Vidyuth Bhandary, Studio Head, Dice Media adds, “We are excited to work with partners such as Amazon miniTV from Crushed and Netflix for Little Things that see the mutual benefit of creating long-running shows. We have also expanded some of these very successful IPs to other derivative content – such as regional shows or audio shows. We released the Telugu adaptations Alludu Garu and #BFF of our shows What The Folks and Adulting respectively on Aha, and the audio derivatives of Little Things and Adulting on Amazon Audible. Proven IPs in one language or format work extremely well in others too, so you will see us doing a long more derivative content in the future.” Crushed S4 is streaming on Amazon miniTV and Amazon Prime starting February 9, 2024.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Mar 13, 2024, 10:10 am Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Shri Anurag Singh Thakur launched the first season of “Swaraj” on OTT platform Amazon Prime, in Mumbai. Speaking on the occasion, Shri Thakur said, “Today is a moment of pride for us and a true tribute to all those unsung great heroes of our independence who sacrificed everything for the country”. He informed that this serial was commissioned by taking inspiration from the “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav” national campaign of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. He said that this serial which was launched in the month of August, 2022, are those stories of bravery in India’s freedom struggle about which very few people know. “These are the wars which got lost somewhere in the pages of history”, said the Union I & B Minister. “Swaraj” is the story of these countless unsung heroes and their indomitable courage, he added. Elaborating on the series, Shri Thakur said, this serial of 75 episodes covers unsung heroes of freedom struggle offrom all corners of our country. It helps us understand the meaning, origins and consequences of colonialism, said the Minister. He further said, In the past, the history of India was written by foreign invaders and rulers according to their political, ideological and economic interests. In this landmark serial, historical events are presented in a broader context to illustrate the concept of ‘Swaraj’, he stated. He added that this will help the national and international audience to understand the spirit of the country and our 500-year long relentless struggle to gain independence from colonial rulers. Speaking further on the importance of being proud of one’s own rich history, Shri Thakur said, those who do not take pride in their rich historical legacy can never create a great future. If we want to create a great future for the country, then we will have to instil pride in the young generation about our great history, he added. The Union I & B Minister reiterated that over the next 25 years of Amrit Kaal, under the able leadership of PM Narendra Modi, we will move forward at a greater pace in the direction of ‘Viksit Bharat’. Reflecting on the role of Prasar Bharati in making this series, the Minister appreciated the role being played by Doordarshan and Akashvani in mobilizing and channelizing the emotions and spirit of the citizens in the right direction from time to time through various memorable programs. The Minister informed the gathering about a new 52 episode serial “Sardar: The Game Changer” which has been launched by Doordarshan on 10th March, 2024, to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Union I & B Minister stated that the Government is focussed on being an enabler to help the Media & Entertainment sector thrive and achieve greater heights on an international scale. He highlighted initiatives like Ease of Doing Business for film industry, schemes like “Single window clearance” for film-shooting In India and various other incentives. He urged all to create good content in Indian languages and stated that language is not a barrier for a global audience in today’s hyperconnected world. He added that regional Indian cinema has transcended geographies and reached out to a global audience based on good content. He urged the M&E sector stakeholders to make India the ‘Content Hub of the World’. Also addressing the audience on the occasion, Shri Sushant Sreeram, Country Director, Prime Video, India stated, “This endeavor echoes the essence of our commitment to showcasing and celebrating India’s unique culture and history, and strengthening India’s creative ecosystem, as envisioned in the Letter of Engagement signed between Amazon India and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting last year”. The Producer of “Swaraj”, Abhimanyu Singh stated that the serial shows the journey of India from the arrival of Vasco Da Gama in 1498 to the attainment of independence in 1947. “When Vasco Da Gama entered in India, our country was the richest country at that time. India’s contribution in world GDP was around 24%. But, after beginning of the rule of East India Company, India’s struggle started. However, the sacrifice of our freedom fighters brought us independence”, he said. A colourful programme organized on the occasion showcased India’s rich art and culture and varied dance forms. A scintillating performance on a musical narrative depicted the indomitable spirit of millions of ordinary Indians who fought for the freedom of the motherland over the last five centuries. The telecast of the serial ‘Swaraj’ began on 14th August 2022 in Hindi on DD National and subsequently in nine regional languages (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Odia, and Assamese) on the regional networks of Doordarshan. “Swaraj” program was entrusted to Contiloe Pictures production house, famous for professionally researched and high quality content, which is also suitable for OTT platforms. The program “Swaraj” is now available on Amazon Prime Video. The first season will consist of 10 episodes and will also be available in 7 regional languages – Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Bengali and Gujarati.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Apr 15, 2024, 09:40 am ‘Two Great Masters,’ the highly anticipated spiritual web series produced by Juni Films in collaboration with Approach Entertainment and Go Spiritual India, has made its much-awaited debut on the MX Player OTT platform. Directed by the visionary Anurag Sharma, the series embarks on a transformative exploration of the spiritual teachings of two eminent twentieth-century luminaries, Swami Vivekananda and Maharishi Paramhansa Yogananda. From the serene landscapes of Shoolini University in Solan, Himachal Pradesh, to the digital screens of viewers worldwide, ‘Two Great Masters’ promises an immersive and enlightening experience. The series weaves a captivating narrative inspired by the profound philosophies of Vivekananda and Yogananda, offering audiences a unique perspective on spirituality in the modern era. Two Great Masters is directed by Anurag Sharma & Created by Sonu Tyagi. It features veteran actor Rakesh Bedi as narrator along with Anurag Sharma, Deep Sharma, Pavli Kashyap & Durga Kamboj in pivotal roles. Bedi’s portrayal adds depth and authenticity to the story, guiding viewers on a journey of self-discovery and inner transformation The web series is supported by a leading Spiritual organization, Go Spiritual India. Go Spiritual India is a Charitable Spiritual Organization Working for Philanthropy, Spiritual Awareness, Spiritual Tourism, Spiritual Media, Spiritual Events, Organic, Mental Health, Wellness, and Holistic Health. Sonu Tyagi, Co-Producer of ‘Two Great Masters’ and Director of Approach Entertainment, expressed his excitement about the series’ premiere, emphasizing its relevance in today’s fast-paced world. He stated, “We are thrilled to bring ‘Two Great Masters’ to audiences worldwide through the MX Player platform. This series not only entertains but also enlightens, bridging the gap between spirituality and contemporary life.” Anurag Sharma, Director of Juni Films, shared insights into the creative vision behind ‘Two Great Masters,’ affirming that the series goes beyond mere biography to explore the timeless wisdom of Vivekananda and Yogananda. “Our aim with this series is to inspire and uplift audiences, fostering a deeper understanding of spirituality amidst the complexities of modern living,” remarked Sharma. Amrit Gupta, author of the renowned book ‘Two Great Masters,’ on which the web series is based, expressed his delight at seeing his work adapted for the screen. “It is truly gratifying to witness ‘Two Great Masters’ come to life on screen, bringing the timeless teachings of Vivekananda and Yogananda to a new generation of viewers,” Gupta commented. With its captivating storyline, stellar cast, and picturesque cinematography, ‘Two Great Masters’ promises to captivate audiences of all ages. Now available for streaming exclusively on MX Player, viewers can embark on a journey of self-discovery and spiritual awakening from the comfort of their homes. Juni Films is a Film Production company headed by Anurag Sharma. It has already produced a Bollywood Film Juni – The Last Prayer in 2022 and is working on a few projects soon. Approach Entertainment stands as an acclaimed hub for Celebrity Management, Film Productions, Advertising & Corporate Film solutions, Films Marketing, Events & Entertainment Marketing Company. Approach Communications operates as a prominent PR & Integrated Communications agency catering to diverse sectors like Corporate, Healthcare, Entertainment, Finance, Education, and Social domains.

Additionally, the group boasts a specialized Bollywood Newswire & Content Dissemination unit known as Approach Bollywood. Approach Entertainment Group is also having a Charitable Spiritual Organization, Go Spiritual India working for Philanthropy, Spiritual Awareness, Charity, Mental Health, Wellness, Organic, Spiritual Tourism, Events, Media, and Social Causes. This unique web series is probably the first such venture that highlights the spiritual philosophy as experienced and described by Vivekananda and Paramhansa Yogananda. It remains a big question, how no one has thought of bringing the lives of these two masters on the celluloid or on the web before. In fact, the web series “Two Great Masters” is also not a straightforward biographical account of the lives of the two great masters. It rather showcases their philosophical and spiritual perspectives of life through present time characters. Your email address will not be published.

From the launch of a limited-time savoury sauce, exciting new collectable manga-themed packaging and an anime-themed restaurant to the release of four anime films, each of these elements is an ode to anime fandom to create unforgettable dining moments. One of the star attractions at WcDonald’s is the limited-time Savory Chili WcDonald’s Sauce meticulously crafted to enliven taste buds with a symphony of flavours.

Following the culmination of India’s longest electoral process, Zee News proudly announces its pioneering initiative to unveil exit polls driven by cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology. At the forefront of this technological innovation is Zee News’ AI anchor, Zeenia , scheduled to debut on Sunday, 2nd June at 5 PM , delivering the AI Exit Poll data to viewers. In collaboration with India Consolidated Private Limited, partner of the esteemed US data analytics powerhouse, Zee News has set a new standard in predictive accuracy and reliability. This partnership signifies a significant milestone in the realm of election forecasting, promising to redefine how Indian media interprets and predicts election outcomes. For years, all the survey agencies and news channels of the country have been reporting exit poll figures based on the opinions of a few thousand or a few lakh people. To ensure the reliability and accuracy of this AI exit poll, the combined team of Zee News and ICPL gathered opinions from an astonishing sample size of over 10 crore individuals,forming the basis for comprehensive data analysis covering 542 Lok Sabha seats. Whatever exit polls or surveys have been conducted before this, they have been prepared on the basis of people’s opinion. People may be inclined towards one side or the other, which directly impacts the results of the exit poll. But for the first time, ZEE NEWS has collected the opinions of voters with the help of Artificial Intelligence, in which there is absolutely no scope for bias. In such a situation, we can say that ZEE NEWS’ AI EXIT POLL is completely unbiased, reliable and accurate. The integration of AI-driven sentiment analysis into Zee News’s exit polls signifies a significant leap forward in journalistic innovation. By harnessing advanced AI algorithms, Zee News’ exit polls promise accuracy and reliability, enabling the capture of nuanced sentiments of voters across diverse regions and languages. Rahul Sinha, Managing Editor of Zee News, expressed pride in the network’s dedication to journalistic excellence, stating , “Zee News approach towards AI-driven sentiment analysis for exit polls marks a strategic leap forward from a news business perspective. This partnership signifies our commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements in the media industry. Through meticulous data collection and analysis, we aim to offer our audience unparalleled insights into the electoral landscape, reinforcing Zee News’s reputation for delivering accurate and reliable news.” “As we leverage AI technology to decipher the sentiments of millions of voters, we towards redefining how Indian media interprets election outcomes but also open new avenues for revenue generation and audience engagement in the ever-evolving landscape of news broadcasting,” added Rahul Sinha.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline May 24, 2024, 12:07 pm New report, surveying 30,000 people across 26 countries, examines the long-term trends shaping the future of technology, culture, consumers, and brands on the pathway to 2035. Dentsu has announced the release of its landmark global study Consumer Vision 2035: The Era of the Insight-to-Foresight Pivot, which charts the long-term consumer trends that will shape the next decade. The research shows a growing comfort level among consumers for an increasing number of administrative and shopping activities being managed by AI on their behalf. While technology will cocoon consumers’ lives in years to come, nature will constrain them as societal conventions around growth and prosperity will be further unseated. This will create a landscape where assumptions that previously perpetuated culture and business are re-examined. In response to these tensions, consumers will lean further into their emotions and passions when actively engaging with brands. 7 in 10 consumers say that already today a significant share of their shopping decision is influenced by the mood they’re in at the time of purchase. The study also shows that most consumers wish they were more impulsive and actively seek experiences that elicit visceral emotions. Each of the forces outlined in the research carries implications for brands, but across the entire study the ability to pivot from insight to foresight emerged as the critical quality needed to anticipate and deliver on predicted emotional states, a new requirement to thrive as a business by 2035. On the launch of the report, Jeff Greenspoon, Global Practice President, Integrated Solutions, dentsu said: “What is very clear from the findings of the Consumer Vision 2035 study is that we are only now just entering the next era of transformation across technology, culture, and consumer expectations. An AI-filtered world might seem far into the future, but it is already becoming a reality today and consumers’ interactions with brands will fundamentally shift within the next 10 years. Business leaders and brand builders must start preparing for this new landscape today with both technology and creativity. These provocative insights are the starting point to guide people-centered transformation efforts that create long-term brand opportunities, because those that push the boundaries to innovate now will undoubtedly see the biggest impact through the next decade.” The dentsu study Consumer Vision 2035 is available here.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Oct 11, 2023, 09:44 am It was his 60th birthday, and the entire company was invited to the celebration. Amidst the festivities, some speculated that he might announce his retirement soon. To everyone’s surprise, he called for a meeting and revealed his intention to work more closely with students, visiting schools – something he had never done, driven by his passion for teaching. The next day, he found himself in a school, inspiring students and representing the organisation. Meet Bade Bhaiya, aka Mr. Brijmohan, the epitome of motivation at VMC. He embraced a new challenge at an age when most people contemplate retirement, embodying the unique culture of VMC. Meet Chote Bhaiya, or Mr Shyam Mohan Gupta, the trailblazer who secured admission to IIT Delhi in the 80s. He played a pivotal role in guiding his elder brother, Bade Bhaiya, through meticulous planning , enabling him to gain admission to IIT Delhi. Physics courses through his veins, and he serves as the intellectual powerhouse of VMC, understanding precisely how much one needs to study to crack the JEE. Beyond academics, he is a passionate musician. Then there’s Munna Bhaiya, also known as Manmohan Gupta, the youngest member who resides in the USA. Content with his life, he values education as a fundamental necessity, ranking alongside oxygen, food, water, and clothing. His commitment to reaching out to the most remote students without financial barriers led him to advocate utilising the Internet as the fastest and easiest mode of education dissemination. One fine day, our fourth co-founder, in a telling incident, received a call from a concerned parent at VMC, reporting a tempting offer from a competition XJEE coaching. They offered a substantial sum to a false claim that their child was their student. Unfazed, his response was firm yet profound. He asked if the student had received a scholarship, and the father affirmed. Had VMC covered all their expenses? Again, the answer was yes. Did the student secure admission to a top college? Once more, the father replied affirmatively. With unwavering resolve, he emphasised that they had provided the child with all the necessary resources he needed. Giving in to the bribery attempt would set a wrong example, and we can’t do it. Meet the fourth pillar of VMC, Sandeep Bhaiya – the guiding light. People love him because of his humble nature, and he continues to offer mentorship, valued deeply by students and parents alike. Vidya Mandir Classes stands on four decades of excellence, founded by four IIT Delhi alums. Their organisation thrives on four fundamental pillars: goodness, faith, a motto, and a success strategy. Choosing VMC should be a decision made without hesitation. It’s a place where passion, integrity, and dedication converge, creating an unparalleled educational experience.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Mar 08, 2024, 13:28 pm Study Group, an international education specialist, recently concluded a successful media engagement in Delhi. The Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ian Crichton, visited Delhi focusing on Study Group’s commitment to providing global education opportunities for talented Indian students seeking degrees with strong graduate employment prospects. Mr. Crichton opened the session with the exciting announcement that Study Group is now accepting international student applications for California State University San Marcos, Towson University, and University of Nebraska at Omaha following its expansion in the USA through these new university partnerships. The organisation, which supports international students into higher education with more than 50 university partners around the globe, now works with 11 American institutions, underscoring its commitment to broadening access for Indian students to the global education journeys that are right for them. The CEO discussed the growing popularity of the USA as a first-choice study destination for Indian students, outlining a near doubling (+93%) of Indian students receiving offers to study in America with Study Group’s support in 2023 compared to 2022. This builds on an increase of 149% from the previous year. With a growing roster of partners and strong demand from Indians for American degrees in subjects such as Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Business Management and Social Science, the CEO expects further growth of nearly 50% this year. Chief Executive of Study Group Ian Crichton said: “We have a strong record of supporting Indian students to achieve their higher education goals in America, a highly-respected global study destination and country offering tremendous opportunities to international students. It is a privilege to respond to an increasing Indian student demand for an American study experience, and of course for the excellent career opportunities it offers, with the addition of our new university partners. “The benefits of international education have never been more important for students seeking the skills and confidence to succeed in an increasingly globalised world — global citizens who can thrive and lead will be crucial to the success of any country and ready to add real value in their careers and to society.” With Study Group’s specialist support, Indian student Prachiben Patel set her sights on the USA University. “Once I finished my high school, I was very attracted towards technology,” said Prachiben. “I chose the USA for my further studies because it is famous for technology. I think that I am getting the best opportunities by studying here.” Having worked for three years as a developer Sreelekha Mukkamalla travelled from India to the USA for a master’s in computer science. Sreelekha said: “Technology is continuously growing… and I wanted to add a little bit more to my skills so that I grow professionally. I felt that studying in the USA is better compared to other countries because of the technological advancements in the computer science field. Right now I’m concentrating in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence with a side in the Internet of Things. I think that’s the future and that’s where I want my career to go.” To close the meeting, Mr. Crichton welcomed the fact that universities in Asia and the global South are increasingly recognised as institutions of high academic standing that attract students from overseas. He shared Study Group’s vision for the future and commitment to further support for Indian students, noting that Study Group is in active discussions with a diverse range of universities and governments across the globe. Study Group expressed its gratitude to the attending journalists for their role in disseminating valuable information on the evolving landscape and opportunities of international education.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 06, 2024, 11:39 am Piyush Pandey, former Global Chief Creative Officer at Ogilvy will be accepting the Created for Creatives LIA Legend Award onsite, in Las Vegas on 1 st October 2024. Also in attendance will be the LIA Jurors, onsite Creative LIAisons attendees and speakers and global press. London International Awards (LIA), is pleased to honor Piyush Pandey with its 2024 LIA Legend Award. As the man who put Indian advertising on the world map, Piyush is the second creative giant to be bestowed this prestigious award by LIA. He was appointed the Executive Chairman of Ogilvy India in 2004. He also went onto serve as Global Chief Creative Officer for two and a half years. In January 2024, he stepped into an advisory role. Piyush Pandey. The man, the giant, the force, the phenomenon. Indian advertising’s greatest master and its most humble student. Creativity’s fiercest warrior with the softest heart. He is the man whose ideas have shaped the way an entire generation of Indians have led their lives, built, painted and furnished their homes, enjoyed their chocolates, bought their vehicles, connected with their loved ones, chosen their vacations, voted for their governments, bought their watches, saved their money, done their laundry, sipped their tea, fought illnesses, pandemics and taken pride in their nation. The LIA Legend Award is given to a leader of the industry, past or present, who through their talent, vision and generosity has demonstrated outstanding creativity. They are those who are relentless and unwavering in their commitment to build up the industry through their indefatigable mentoring, teaching and developing of others. Creative brilliance and creative leadership are, of course, very important factors. More than that, LIA recognizes people who have selflessly and with great generosity, given their time and their personal attention to further the industry. They are champions of talent at all levels and the defenders of creativity. Barbara Levy, President of LIA, elaborated, “We look for someone who has reshaped the industry for the better. More than that, it must be someone who not only has a wealth of knowledge and experience, but generously shares it with emerging talent. Piyush has shaped Indian advertising, as well as, gifted his knowledge to the global advertising world. Like all advertising legends, it is his work that tells the best story. Piyush epitomizes all the qualities David Ogilvy said great leaders should possess – bravery, idealism, curiosity, playfulness, candour, intuition, free-spiritedness and persistence.” Terry Savage, LIA Chairman, further stated, “In giving this award to Piyush, we recognize someone who has openly given back to others in an extraordinary way. Over and above that, Piyush has been a role model, inspiration and creative champion to so many people, people who follow his achievements and because of this have gone on their own creative journey.” In accepting the honor, Piyush Pandey in his characteristic unassuming manner said: “I am truly delighted and humbled to be the recipient of this award. I believe that my success is based on a lot of team members. Like cricket, even the best player cannot win alone. I have succeeded to whatever extent because of an amazing team; each a rock-star and they make me look good. It has been my great joy and pleasure to be part of LIA and their Creative LIAisons Program, as I believe the learnings of a lifetime should be shared with the next generation. Advertising is a team effort. I am delighted that LIA has considered me and decided to confer the Legend award to me. Wishing my parents were alive to read this news. Thank you, LIA.” As David Ogilvy, a legend himself and the father of advertising, once said: “Don’t bunt. Aim out of the ballpark. Aim for the company of immortals.” LIA is proud to welcome Piyush Pandey – a man who not only hit it out of the ballpark, but has changed the rules – to the line- up of LIA creative legends already awarded and those to come.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Apr 17, 2024, 13:04 pm IntrCity SmartBus, India’s leading inter-city mobility platform, is proud to announce the launch of the industry’s first Digital Luggage Tag feature. This pioneering innovation is set to redefine luggage management by streamlining the process. With this new feature, over 200,000 passengers traveling on IntrCity SmartBus across more than 630 routes in 16 states can enjoy a seamless and stress-free journey. The importance of luggage for passengers cannot be overstated. Luggage serves as a vital component of the overall travel experience, ensuring that passengers can transport their belongings safely and conveniently to their destination. With the Luggage Tag feature, we aim to communicate accountability and build passenger confidence in bus travel. The Digital Luggage Tagging system reduces the likelihood of luggage getting lost or mishandled, ensuring passengers can travel smoothly without worrying about misplaced belongings. This advanced system simplifies luggage handling and gives passengers peace of mind about the safety of their possessions. Using cutting-edge technology, IntrCity SmartBus provides a secure and effective solution that meets the changing demands of today’s travelers. Additionally, by reducing the use of paper tags, IntrCity SmartBus is actively promoting a more environmentally friendly future. This sustainable approach not only reduces waste but also plays a role in the essential sustainability efforts of today’s world, showcasing the company’s dedication to ecological responsibility and improving customer service. The Digital Luggage Tag feature is ingeniously designed to simplify luggage handling for travelers using IntrCity SmartBus services. As passengers board, they hand over their luggage to our dedicated Bus Captains, who then quickly capture essential details about the luggage’s appearance and destination through a secure digital system. What sets this feature apart is its use of advanced technology to generate a unique One-Time Password (OTP) linked to the passenger’s contact number. This OTP acts as a secure verification of the luggage’s status, significantly enhancing efficiency and eliminating the uncertainties commonly associated with traditional luggage handling methods. Manish Rathi, Co-founder & CEO of IntrCity SmartBus, expressed his enthusiasm about the new feature, stating, “We recognize the challenges and anxieties that come with managing luggage during travel. The introduction of the Digital Luggage Tag feature is our way of addressing these issues, ensuring our passengers enjoy a smooth and worry-free travel experience. Furthermore, our dedication to innovation and passenger convenience has been unwavering. From introducing personalized assistance onboard—SmartBus Captains to pioneering the installation of urinals inside our buses, alongside comfortable boarding lounges for seamless boarding experiences, we have consistently aimed to redefine the standards of intercity bus travel in India.” Mr. Rathi further emphasized the company’s commitment to innovation, saying, “Our mission is to leverage cutting-edge technology to elevate the overall travel experience for our passengers. The Digital Luggage Tag feature is a testament to our dedication to innovation and customer satisfaction, as we continue to position buses as the preferred mode of travel for middle India (‘Bharat’).” Upon departure, passengers simply provide the OTP to their Bus Captain, confirming their luggage and setting the stage for a safe and comfortable journey ahead. With safety as a paramount concern, the Digital Luggage Tag feature adds an extra layer of security, offering passengers peace of mind as they travel. IntrCity SmartBus is redefining intercity travel, providing passengers with a hassle-free journey and the convenience of advanced luggage management technology. Additionally, the company leads in introducing applications such as the Operator Dashboard, Crew App, and IoT-based Fleet Analytics. These tools ensure smooth management of every journey aspect, including real-time tracking and accurate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) information for destinations.

To soak up the spirit of the summer break, Ipsos polled urban Indians to capture their views on how they plan to spend their summer break, in the Ipsos IndiaBus Summer Holidays Survey . Interestingly, only 2 in 10 (21%) respondents said they plan to travel during the summer break, while 79% claimed to have no travel plans . Elucidating on the stark results, Parijat Chakraborty, Group Service Line Leader, Public Affairs, Corporate Reputation, ESG and CSR, Ipsos India said, “Southern states of India have their summer break in mid-April and northern states in mid May, for schools, and that is the time when families plan their vacation. But this year, we have been amid the general elections, over 7 phases – starting from last week of April to June 1st, across every nook and cranny of India, which means a number of families would have not taken a summer break this year. These days extended weekends, festival holidays are also enjoyed traveling to retreats and getaways for family time and rejuvenation. And year-end holidays are also becoming a norm from Christmas to New Year, christening the time as Happy Holidays adopting the global phenomenon.” “Hill stations are always preferred during summer. But, this year it has been a hot summer there too, coupled with high rush of tourists, making many people choosing to stay indoors,” added Chakraborty . Where to go for vacay? Source for accessing info? Ipsos also probed the travel behaviour of those planning to travel. Notably, of those planning to travel in summer, 88% said they would look at a domestic travel, while 12% were contemplating an international travel. On the type of destinations urban Indians were planning to explore, the survey showed a long list of diverse destinations appealing to the sensibilities of the discerning traveller: religious places (49%), mountains/ hill stations (47%), beaches (39%), historical locations (25%), nature – national parks, retreats (22%) and deserts (8%). Sources of information for summer vacation and holiday funding also threw up interesting insights. The survey shows that family and friends (74%) are the primary source of information for holiday getaway recommendation; citizens claimed to access holiday information from the internet (42%), social media (34%), travel blogs/ websites (33%) and travel agents (13%). For funding for holiday travel, majority of the respondents polled claimed to dig into their savings (86%) ; other sources of holiday funding being, credit card (23%), Leave Travel Allowance (21%) and loan (13%). Motivations for travel Urban Indians also highlighted some of the motivations that made them plan their summer break: Bonding with family/ friends (60%), fun family outing (49%), sightseeing (48%), relaxation time (47%), shopping (27%) and adventure (25%) , it was an interesting mix. “Domestic travel is finding more takers and citizens are mostly spending from their savings for their holiday and looking at religious locations, mountains and beaches mostly for their summer vacay. Family and friends mostly advise on the holiday location,” stated Chakraborty. Methodology Ipsos IndiaBus is a monthly, pan India omnibus (which also runs multiple client surveys), that uses a structured questionnaire and is conducted by Ipsos India on diverse topics among 2200+ respondents from SEC A, B and C households, covering adults of both genders from all four zones in the country.

The festival recognizes the power of storytelling in connecting people and fostering empathy. It will showcase a wide range of stories from various corners of India, including those from celebrated artists, well-known personalities, and individuals who have made a significant impact on society. By giving a voice to real people and their experiences, the Bombay Storytelling Festival aims to create an authentic and unfiltered platform for conversations and connections. One of the festival’s unique features is its commitment to inclusivity. It aims to celebrate people from all demographics, breaking down barriers based on gender, caste, creed, race, sexuality, or ability. This inclusive approach emphasizes the belief that everyone has a story to tell, and their narratives deserve to be heard without any restrictions. The festival offers a variety of immersive experiences to engage the audience. From the Storyteller’s Stage and Human Library to panel discussions and open mic sessions, attendees will be immersed in the rich tapestry of human experiences. The addition of live music and larger-than-life art installations will elevate the overall experience, creating a sensory feast for the attendees. Moreover, the Bombay Storytelling Festival is not just about storytelling; it also aims to encourage sustainability and support small business owners and emerging voices in the space. The inclusion of dedicated food stalls and booths provides a platform for these individuals to showcase their talents and uplift their entrepreneurial spirit. Karishma Mehta, the Founder of Humans of Bombay, emphasizes the importance of storytelling in an increasingly fast-paced world. She acknowledges its power to create connections and a sense of belonging.

An all-new offline venture by HOB, the festival promises to be a celebration of the undaunted human spirit and the power of community. It will offer audiences a chance to experience the heartfelt stories they read and love online, outside the digital realm, for the first time ever at Bayview Lawns in Mumbai on 28th October 2023. Stories are an intrinsic part of the experience of being human. It is what binds us all together, often sparking a spectrum of emotions and empathy for one another and forging lifelong connections. Rooted in this ideology, the BSF will be a culmination of all kinds of stories in every form, from nooks and crannies of India — stories from celebrated artists and well-known personalities, stories from those who are rich in experiences, and stories from people who have created a tremendous impact in society. With real stories of real people in their own words, BSF intends to be a melting pot of conversations that are raw, unfiltered, and authentic. The festival seeks to celebrate people across demographics, not only through these multifaceted stories, but also via immersive experiences like The Storyteller’s Stage , Human Library , Panel Discussions , Open Mic , etc. This experience will be elevated through a live band and music alongside larger-than-life art installations. Furthermore, BSF will be sustainable, and host food stalls and other booths dedicated to small business owners and new voices in the space, thereby realising its vision to uplift them. Attendees can indulge in delicacies that will make their taste buds travel, giving them a truly one-of-a-kind experience. Talking about the debut edition of the festival, Karishma Mehta, the Founder of Humans of Bombay, says, “Today’s world is fast-paced – everything can change in the blink of an eye, and most of us have the attention span of a goldfish. However, if there is one thing that has the power to bind us humans together, it is stories. And so, we decided to dedicate a day to celebrate these stories of love, hope, faith and courage with the Bombay Storytelling Festival.” She further adds, “The authenticity of HOB’s stories has always hit the right chord with the community, leaving them with a smile or maybe a tear but always with a sense of belonging. And with BSF, we intend to do just that, but on a wider scale. The festival will be an inclusive event and see no divide in terms of gender, caste, creed, race, sexuality or ability — everybody belongs here, and everybody can tell their stories no-holds-barred.” Humans of Bombay is a movement that started nine years ago with the belief that every person has a story to tell, thus providing them with a platform to tell these stories. The BSF endeavours to expand on this belief by widening the platform that HOB provides. With this, it seeks to enable and empower a broader audience with myriad experiences to tell their stories, thereby unravelling a tapestry of human narratives like never before.

    "article_content": "By MI Newsdesk Jul 28, 2023, 11:30 am Actor Sahil Salathia partners with PETA India to highlight the suffering of big cats in zoos and advocate for their freedom on International Tiger Day. With his bold and thought-provoking initiative for International Tiger Day, actor and fashion icon Sahil Salathia has captured the attention of animal lovers worldwide. In collaboration with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India, Salathia’s powerful image, shot by photographer Rohit Gupta and featuring stunning body paint by Nahush Pise, sends a resounding message about the cruelty of keeping big cats in cages. Salathia’s willingness to be the voice of the voiceless, by immersing himself in the vulnerability and confinement of an imprisoned tiger, reflects not only his talent as an actor but also his deep commitment to animal welfare . His involvement in this campaign is a testament to his empathy and compassion for creatures who are often subjected to a life of distress and suffering behind bars. By shedding light on the plight of these majestic animals, Salathia urges us to reevaluate our actions and choices. The heart-wrenching reality of a tiger pacing, circling, or swaying inside the confines of a zoo enclosure should serve as a wake-up call for us all. We must resist the temptation to support establishments that confine animals for our entertainment, instead allowing them to roam free in their natural habitats. PETA India , through its investigations into zoos across the nation, has uncovered the neglect, decrepit facilities, and heartrending animal suffering that persist in these establishments. Their recommendation to transform zoos into botanical gardens and repurpose them as homes for rescued animals provides a hopeful solution to the problem at hand. Salathia joins a growing list of influential figures who are using their platforms to advocate for the liberation of animals from the confines of captivity. Their collective voices amplify the message that animals are not ours to use for entertainment, teaching us the importance of compassion, respect, and coexistence with all species. This commendable endeavor spearheaded by Sahil Salathia deserves commendation and applause. It serves as a reminder of the power and responsibility each one of us holds to create a world where animals are treated with kindness and dignity. Let us heed his call and work together towards the day when no animal is held captive against their will, allowing them to live as nature intended – free.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Sep 13, 2023, 10:44 am Kate Spade New York today unveiled its Spring 2024 collection with a presentation during New York Fashion Week at the Chelsea Passage on The High Line – an iconic New York park elevated above the streets of Manhattan’s West Side. The collection – designed by Tom Mora (SVP and Head of Design, RTW & Lifestyle Categories) and Jennifer Lyu (SVP and Head of Design, Leather Goods and Accessories) celebrates Kate Spade’s brand DNA through the use of vivid colors, graphic patterns and unexpected textures. The Spring 2024 collection inspiration began with the idea of the first glimpse of spring in Manhattan…when, early in the season, New Yorkers are greeted by an unexpected, beautiful day and the city suddenly comes to life. There is a certain feeling that moment brings – it sparks release, excitement and hope for what’s to come. The Kate Spade New York collection is a celebration of that universal feeling, and the joy that it evokes. Spring 2024 delivers on the brand’s promise of femininity and joyful expression, this season designed with a more relaxed positioning that creates a sense of tension. Styling is polished yet undone, constructed and unconstructed, with vibrant colors that are complemented by soft tones. The collection brings a “sportif” aesthetic with casual silhouettes, clean lines and a modern take on suiting, all with a classic kate spade twist. As Spring is the season of new beginnings, in 2024, Kate Spade will reintroduce its iconic Noel Print – an archival classic launched by Kate and Andy Spade in 1999. Noel is both playful and pragmatic, reimagined for today with a bright new energy. Adding another layer of dimension to the kate spade brand codes, the Noel capsule’s bold graphics and bright color palette bring a youthful sensibility to the collection, and will be seen across categories. Tom Mora and Jennifer Lyu shared: “There’s nothing quite like the first hints of Spring in New York City, and the feelings of excitement, optimism and hope that are evoked when we all escape from our homes and embrace the city’s beauty. It’s a magnetic, energetic feeling that creates connectivity as friends, families and communities are coming together. This collection is a celebration of that moment, when you abandon your winter wardrobe and refuse to go back. It’s full of vibrant spring colors, fresh takes on heritage patterns, and unusual textures that drive excitement. There’s something so powerful about the way women today express themselves through personal style – it’s an evolution of creative styling, and we’re thrilled to be a part of it. Hair and makeup reflect different takes on a daytime fresh face, leaning into each woman’s natural beauty. Makeup looks by Clinique and lead makeup artist Robert Sesnek are inspired by early Spring days. Nails by Essie and lead manicurist Julie Kandalec deliver a bit of edge, with white and black micro tips and a pop of the brand’s iconic Noel symbol. To engage Kate Spade’s digital community, the brand has partnered with model Aoki Lee Simmons to offer behind-the-scenes access to the brand’s New York Fashion Week presentation through Instagram and TikTok takeovers on the brand’s channels. Immediately following its Spring 2024 presentation, Kate Spade’s space on the High Line will open to the public for the afternoon , inviting the local community for an iconic NYC moment in this iconic location. The brand will partner with local small businesses from the Chelsea Market Passage on The High Line – including Doughnuttery and La Newyorkina – to offer visitors a variety of treats, courtesy of kate spade. Guests can lounge in kate spade branded café tables or along the sun deck, listen to tunes from NYC musicians, and enjoy a moment of escape as they kick off the weekend. To close out the brand’s New York Fashion week activity, Kate Spade New York is partnering with Her Campus Media and College Fashionista on the Creator’s Loft , the ultimate home base for up-and-coming Gen Z influencers from September 8-10. The three-day popup will offer influencers a space to convene, connect and collaborate. As part of the activations, kate spade new york will present a Borrow-a-Bag Bar, where fashion enthusiasts will have the opportunity to accessorize for NYFW events with a curated selection of kate spade handbags, in addition to a Wellness Reset Room, encouraging influencers to take care of their mental health and wellbeing during such a momentous week.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Sep 18, 2023, 12:39 pm Serving as Executive Director of SCA Logistics Pvt. Ltd., Bhairavi Jani has been adeptly navigating the evolving landscape of logistics and supply chain operations. The fourth-generation entrepreneur and passionate philanthropist is playing a pivotal role in streamlining the complex global network to facilitate a seamless flow of commerce. Ever enthusiastic about development, Jani recently joined Niret Alva, an award-winning television journalist, producer, anchor, and educator, in the fourth episode of ‘UMUTE with PRCAI. During this enlightening session, she spoke about the evolving global narrative about India, the ongoing digital metamorphosis and importance of the lifelong learning. She also shared insights into her professional journey and her passion to co-create sustainable livelihoods for communities in the upper Himalayas. Addressing the question posed by the host on the hallmark of India’s changing brand image, Jani responded, “I think our culture is our strongest positioning of course, but so is technology.” Drawing reference from mentions of India in Western movies and series, she said that India has become a part of “mainstream conversation where people in general conversations have started recognizing the country.” She even credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for advocating brand India, resulting in the country’s enhanced global image. Continuing the discussion on strategies to bolster India’s global brand image, Jani asserted that, “Every brand has its core philosophy and values. For India, it has always been its diversity and pluralism. A lot of people equate India to that. If India were to lose that core identity, it would significantly damage its brand.” Advocating for digitalization in logistics and other streams of businesses, Jani said learning, experimenting, and preparing a roadmap for the organisation is essential for managing the transition. Commenting on the speculation of job losses due to the advent of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and advanced technologies, Jani stated, “There is a transition. Some people will lose their jobs, but many new, higher-skilled jobs will be created. We shouldn’t be apprehensive about it.” She even spoke about the importance of lifelong learning in the current era and shared some key skills required for an Indian entrepreneur across sectors. To hear the full episode tune into: Bhairavi Jani: The Future of India is Bright Sponsored by Adfactors PR, ‘UNMUTE with PRCAI’ is the first-ever podcast series of the Public Relations Consultants Association of India (PRCAI). The collection consists of 10 inaugural episodes that would bring together business leaders and valued ‘Opinions that Matter’.

With an aim to empower the photography community and display their talent on a grand scale, IndiGo, in collaboration with National Geographic India, announces nine finalists out of 90,000+ participants for a photography reality show, #nofilter by IndiGo.

In their quest to claim the coveted title of the show’s best photographer, judges Imtiaz Ali and Raghu Rai will challenge each one of them to explore the iconic locations of Delhi under specific themes, capturing the most powerful, unfiltered photo essays. In each episode, the participants will immerse themselves in the city’s true emotions, turning their lenses towards Old Delhi’s bustling streets, traditional kitchens, women in uniform after work, and the captivating charm and chaos of the bazaars that offer a window into the spirit of the city itself. As the judges determine the fate of each participant, they will be seen engaging in an in-depth discussion about every entry and will reveal the episodic winner. “ National Geographic has always held a distinctive and revered position in the world of photography. Our innovative visual storytelling with iconic imagery has been a source of inspiration for our audience for 135 years .

I’m thrilled to witness these talented photographers come together and compete with unfiltered creativity. Serving as a judge alongside the prolific Raghu Rai, we shoulder the responsibility of handpicking the most exceptional shots. My gratitude goes out to National Geographic and IndiGo for providing a platform that not only celebrates the art of photography but also fosters the growth of emerging talent,” said Imtiaz Ali . “India is a country of diverse cultures and landscapes, and photography is perhaps the best way to share the beauty of the country with everyone. As part of our #IndiaByIndiGo initiative, the #nofilter partnership between IndiGo and Nat Geo celebrates the diversity of India and the passion of the photographers who bring it to life.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Apr 26, 2024, 11:48 am Kraftshala, India’s largest marketing-jobs providing edtech platform, partnered with Sushrut Nalluwar, Director of Sales at Nestlé, a global leader in the food and beverage industry, for an insightful session on careers in sales. The session aimed at dispelling misconceptions surrounding sales careers while highlighting how to bridge the skills gap preventing professionals from exploiting the immense potential and growth opportunities in the field. The session, hosted free of charge by Kraftshala, featured Sushrut Nallulwar, Sales Director at Nestlé India, as the keynote speaker. With over 17 years of industry experience and an MBA from IIM Mumbai (formerly NITIE), Sushrut shared invaluable insights into the dynamic nature of sales careers and the impactful role sales plays in shaping businesses and business leaders. Unlike the popular perception, Sushrut pointed out that a profession in sales offers a dynamic learning environment with accompanying challenges, opportunities, and ambiguities. He added that the profession provides a firsthand opportunity to witness the “whole VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) world in all its glory” and a sales professional’s response to this challenge often has the potential to impact the business. “You’re hit with that VUCA world as the first line and you almost have that responsibility of how the company responds to that VUCA, both in unlocking new opportunities and responding to challenges. And that’s a great place to be in because it, in a way, defines what the company’s response will be in terms of the way forward. So it’s a position with a lot of responsibility, and the immense opportunity to create an impact both on the business and the people’s front,” he said. Sushrut highlighted that all jobs have accompanying pressures, and while it is believed that a unique kind of sales pressure comes with well-defined deadlines, the joy associated with delivering in the critical area of the business was also the most gratifying part of the sales function. “…there is no pleasure without pressure, let me put it that way. So they coexist, but that is not unique to this job. Every job has different kinds of joys and pressures that one has to deal with,” Sushrut said. Varun Satia, Co-Founder & CEO of Kraftshala, who was moderating the session added an example from his early professional career to highlight the exhilaration achieving sales targets provides. “I had a stint in sales in Kalyan, not far from Mumbai City, during the time when it was referred to as Mumbai City 3. The feeling of accomplishment when I met my sales targets after initially falling short was truly rewarding. Compared to marketing, where results could take months to materialize, the direct impact in sales was deeply satisfying. This immediate sense of achievement mirrors the fulfillment of entrepreneurship, making sales uniquely rewarding” he added. One key takeaway was the importance of understanding the ‘Whys’ behind the ‘What’ in this field, for a robust foundation. Additionally, the session emphasized the distinction between performance and results, offering valuable insights into achieving long-term success in sales careers. Speaking on the collaboration, Varun said, “We are committed to bridging the gap between academia and industry, offering actionable insights to aspiring professionals. Partnering with industry leaders from companies like Nestlé enables Kraftshala to empower individuals with the tools needed to forge successful career paths. We’ve been conducting these Kraftshala LIVE sessions every Tuesday more or less since Covid and are committed to help freshers become more informed of career options and make meaningful decisions.” Sushrut added that sales along with other commercial business functions have a lot of options available to grow in the business world. “This is a career path with immense gratification and control over outcomes. Within the sales function, there is a diversity of roles available today and there is a need for awareness around this.” A participating student, Deeksha said, “I am grateful for the invaluable insights gained during the session. The accessibility to such sessions is usually costly, but Kraftshala provided it free of charge. It’s an amazing value!.” This collaboration between Kraftshala and Nestlé Sales Director forms part of an ongoing initiative to help people start their career in Sales through a Post Graduate Program in Sales and Business Leadership where students get trained through industry experts and get roles upto 18 LPA. Kraftshala concluded admissions for its pilot batch and has already received great response from recruiters who are always in dearth of good sales talent. Like all Kraftshala programs, this one also comes with placement accountability where if the student doesn’t get a job, Kraftshala shares the responsibility and refunds the majority of the fees. Through such endeavours, the aim is to equip aspiring professionals with the requisite knowledge and skills to excel in the dynamic world of sales and beyond.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Sep 02, 2023, 13:05 pm Amitabh Bachchan was named brand ambassador and the face of Gera Developments Pvt. Ltd (GDPL), the pioneers of the real estate business and the award-winning creators of premium residential and commercial projects in Pune, Goa, and California, last month. The decision to onboard the Bollywood superstar to represent brand Gera came as a result of the commonality, brand relevance, standing in the market, and emotional appeal they possess with their respective audiences. As part of the association, the real estate developer has unveiled a new, one-of-a-kind campaign featuring Amitabh Bachchan. The campaign encapsulates the superstar’s narration of beautiful performance poetry that draws focus on the selfless love parents have for their children combined with the struggles and sacrifices they go through. The insights strike a deep emotional chord with the audience as he goes on to bring to life how parents sacrifice everything for their children and go to great lengths to ensure that they provide the best environment for the development of their children. Given his popularity amongst different age groups and the fact that he is deemed to be a doting father and grandfather, as well as a vocal supporter of child development, there was an instant resonance with brand Bachchan. As an ode to this unique initiative that throws light on the plight of today’s parents who struggle to strike a work-life balance and the significance for celebrating childhoods, the superstar voiced a special rendition; the excerpts of which read, “Wo aashiyan jiss ki deewaarein hi hui khadi bacchon ka dhyaan rakh kar. Wo ghar jiss ka aangan bana unn ki zarooraton ka hisaab le kar.” This captures the essence of Gera’s ChildCentric® Homes that offer child-friendly amenities, development activities, and an environment that fosters development, fun, convenience, and safety – just everything that parents want for their children. “I look forward to my endorsement association with Pune-based Gera Developments as I liked their innovative concept and focus on Child Centric Homes.” commented Bollywood Superstar Amitabh Bachchan. Mr. Rohit Gera, Managing Director of Gera Developments, said in a statement, “Amitabh Bachchan is the ultimate Outdoer and one of the greatest personalities the country could ever have. We are proud to have him bring the concept of Gera’s ChildCentric® Homes to life through this performance poetry. We launched this new category of living spaces to help children soar while meeting the changing needs and lifestyles of parents and children. To eliminate travel time, enable convenience, promote all-round development, and reduce the stress in the lives of parents, our ChildCentric® Homes are integrated with top-notch amenities and training academies. So far, our ChildCentric® Homes projects have received a phenomenal response and our outlook for this product line remains optimistic.” With projects spread across Pune’s upscale vicinity of Upper Kharadi, the one-of-a-kind themed-homes have not just left homeowners and investors impressed but also the Bollywood superstar. While Gera’s Planet of Joy project offers 2, 3, and 4 BHK apartments, along with duplexes and cluster villas, Gera’s World of Joy project encompasses 2, 3, 3.5, and 4 BHK apartments, duplexes and cluster villas. Both these ChildCentric® Homes projects are equipped with best-in-class specifications, smart home automation, and multi-level clubhouse, with a host of other entertainment options. The company is in expansion mode with a launch pipeline of 4.7 mn sf. As a pioneer of ChildCentric® Homes, GDPL has introduced a new segment in the real estate market and created a paradigm shift for both developers and homebuyers.

The RMI-Lodha Sustainability Conclave was convened to celebrate the inaugural year’s achievements of the Lodha Net Zero Urban Accelerator. This landmark event saw the participation of a diverse cohort comprising industry stakeholders, policymakers, and representatives from academia. The conclave was curated to foster innovation and provide a platform to researchers, developers, designers, and members of the supply chain community to collectively deliberate on the net-zero roadmap for India’s built environment. It presented a strategic model for stakeholders to accelerate towards a sustainable future and champion India’s Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) ethos. The key findings that were presented at the conclave included the adoption of strategies that make cities heat resilient, advanced adoption of superefficient air conditioning and fans in India, enhanced usage of greener concrete mixes including recently launched LC3 cement, increased shared mobility and EV charging infrastructure, and promotion of renewable integration across all domains of the built environment. Additionally, the focal model of Palava will demonstrate a type of urbanization that emits the least carbon while coming into existence and during its life. This can guide expansion or rejuvenation plans for all new or existing urban centres. Lodha Net Zero Urban Accelerator was initiated to cut down emissions for the built environment, thereby accelerating and maximising the sector’s contribution to India’s 2070 net-zero emissions target. The conclave presented the key findings of the programme, along with industry alignments on roadmaps in Embodied Carbon Reduction, Energy Efficiency, Renewable Transition and Clean Energy to achieve mainstreaming of net-zero in India’s built environment while demonstrating how economic growth can be decoupled from emissions. The Accelerator also committed to partner with the start-up accelerator Third Derivative, founded by RMI and New Energy Nexus, for piloting next-gen materials and solutions at Palava. Further, it was declared that the field testing of Global Cooling Prize units has been initiated at Palava, which will help to catalyse the market adoption of next-generation room air conditioners. The engaging event witnessed the presence of prominent global personalities who play a significant role in upholding sustainability. These included Mr. Abhishek Lodha- MD & CEO at Macrotech Developers, Mr. Amory B. Lovins- Cofounder and Chairman Emeritus at RMI, Dr. Brian Motherway- Head, Energy Efficiency at International Energy Agency (IEA), Dr. Ajay Mathur- Director General at International Solar Alliance (ISA), and many industry leaders. Sharing his views on the success of the accelerator, Mr. Abhishek Lodha- MD & CEO at Macrotech Developers, said, “We believe that the developers of the built environment have to take a pro-active leadership role in the world’s response to climate change and embrace a low/ net-zero carbon future. We are committed to becoming a net-zero carbon company by 2035 and have made substantial progress to achieve this ahead of schedule. We are keen to share our experience and learnings through this transition with industry and supply chain and are pleased that our partnership with the renowned Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) has resulted in the Lodha Net Zero Urban Accelerator. This accelerator is a major step to drive collaborative, large-scale solutions for a greener future.” Mr. Amory Lovins, Co-Founder and Chairman Emeritus at RMI expressed, “Decarbonizing the built environment holds great opportunity for India, where building operations account for about a third of the country’s energy use. Addressing this is not only important for climate action but also yields numerous additional advantages. India has made significant strides, leaping forward in its clean energy journey. When it comes to buildings and construction in India, there is also a lot of knowledge that goes back millennia on how to design buildings for the local climate. Through innovative and efficient designs, India is on its way to set benchmarks. Because efficient designs lead to better comfort and amenities and cost very little to run and make the occupants more happy, healthy, and productive, this fusion of traditional wisdom and modern innovation positions India at the forefront of sustainable growth on a global scale.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jan 06, 2023, 18:13 pm Even as Muthoot Finance continues to retain its leadership position in the competitive Gold Loan segment, it has launched its new campaign that reinforces its unique and core strengths. The campaign is once again anchored by Shri. Amitabh Bachchan, who has been the brand ambassador for the past five years. The new campaign ‘Kholiye Khushiyon Ki Tijori!’ includes four powerful TVCs. Each TVC talks about one or two unique aspects of the brand, which include its No. 1 ranking in India by the Brand Trust Report for 6 years from 2016-2022, its large network of branches, the large number of people whose lives the brand has impacted, the robust safety and security that it provides to its customers’ pledged gold, and its increasingly popular Gold Loan at Home service. The campaign also provides cues to audiences about the various purposes for which a Gold Loan can be availed such as for kick-starting your new startup venture or for making down payment for your new home or as animal lovers would recognise more than anyone else – to even bring home a pet. Besides TV, the campaign will also be carried out across mainline Print, OOH, Cable TV, Ground Activation and several Digital Initiatives. Speaking about the campaign, Alexander George Muthoot, Joint Managing Director, The Muthoot Group, said, “Muthoot Finance has always consciously focused on its own core strengths and key differentiators. We have carefully and consciously built and nurtured some great differentiators and always made efforts to add delight to our customer’s experience with us. The 2.5 Lakh+ customers who are satisfactorily served every single day by our network of 5750+ pan-India branches is one such unparalleled differentiation.” He adds: “I strongly feel these are big contributors to the ‘brand equity’ of Muthoot Finance, which has been reinforced year after year and most recently in 2022 by The Brand Trust Report when it once again ranked Muthoot Finance as India’s No. 1 Most Trusted Financial Services Brand, for a sixth time running since 2016. We have adopted technology and offered great services like Gold Loan@Home and unmatched safety and security of customer’s gold. Above all, Trust is the most important differentiator that we are humbly proud of because pledging gold is not like pledging any other collateral. A customer’s gold jewellery is an emotional currency, and we have always paid great attention while treating our customer’s assets safely and securely powered by a 7-layer state-of-the-art security infrastructure which is also conveyed effectively in one of the four films.” Talking further about the new campaign, Abhinav Iyer, Senior General Manager – Marketing & Strategy , The Muthoot Group said, “Muthoot Finance has always served as a catalyst that has helped its customers move ahead in life. In general, the gold owned by people stays idle and is not monetised, for reasons like it simply does not cross one’s mind or because of old-world beliefs or social taboos. Our new marketing campaign ‘Kholiye Khusiyon Ki Tijori!’ encourages people to consider Muthoot Finance Gold Loans to realise their dreams and unlock happiness. The campaign nudges loan seekers to unlock their gold lying idle in safes & lockers and in turn let it bring happiness for them by helping them fulfill their personal, family or business needs. In this campaign too we have advocated utilization of this idle lying gold to enable people to do things that can help them move ahead in their lives, giving themselves and their families more happiness and joy. These films have been carefully crafted in an emotive way drawing parallels to real-life emotions that makes them very pleasant for people to relate, despite presenting a core product benefit of Muthoot Finance Gold Loans.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Team MI May 17, 2023, 11:53 am DENTSU CREATIVE India has partnered with Orange Health Labs, a leading health-tech start-up, to launch the brand’s first-ever 360-degree campaign. The campaign is centered around an issue that is critical yet largely unrecognized in the healthcare industry – the impact of the freshness of blood on test accuracy. It is pertinent to note here that DENTSU CREATIVE India was awarded Orange Health Lab’s creative mandate in December 2022. The mandate includes providing the brand with 360-degree creative solutions and expanding its reach to audiences throughout India. The tongue-in-cheek campaign features the renowned actor and Orange Health Labs’ brand ambassador, Ayushmann Khurrana. The films showcase him taking a blood sample to the lab while emphasizing the issue of batching in the healthcare industry. Through the campaign, Orange Health Labs highlights its unique offerings, which include home sample collection, rapid 2.5-hour testing, elimination of batch testing, and 100% accurate results. Links to the campaign: https://youtu.be/l6bJkw3AJ4k https://youtu.be/Qoa5ZMv9dg8 Speaking about the campaign, Dhruv Gupta & Tarun Bhambra, Founders, Orange Health Labs said, “Orange Health Labs was founded to enable the convenience of on-demand at-home collections and ensure report accuracy for consumers. This campaign is an attempt to raise awareness that you can now get both, only with Orange Health. We are excited to have Ayushmann as our brand ambassador, as he represents modern and logical choices through his work.”Indrajeet Mookerjee, President – South and West, DENTSU CREATIVE India added, “In the backdrop of the pandemic, the healthcare industry became saturated with players, making it hard for consumers to make a choice. Our challenge was to devise a sharp and witty campaign to cut through the clutter and highlight Orange Health Labs’ core propositions of speed and accuracy.” Siddharth S, Executive Creative Director, DENTSU CREATIVE India commented, “While communicating the message is crucial, it is equally vital not to distress our consumers. Our campaign employs humor to convey the message that the ‘Freshest samples yield the most accurate results’.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Aug 28, 2023, 16:16 pm Yuvaa has always believed in talking about urgent issues like youth empowerment, mental health, gender, sexuality, internet safety, misinformation, climate change and many more, and have found great success in creating impact-driven content and entertainment. This year, Yuvaa celebrates its 5 years of creating awareness across the nation. Nikhil Taneja, Co-Founder of Yuvaa speaks with MI in a one on one interaction. In the article, you will read about the journey, shows, and future plans of the brand. As Nikhil delves deeper into reaching out to Tier 2 and 3 cities, he says, smaller cities lack proper vocabulary for speaking about the important topics. There’s no proper colloquial way to express them. Excerpts here: Nikhil: I am a writer and storyteller in each core that I do from writing script to everything else. The compelling work in Yuvaa is also a form of storytelling, where we try to tell the stories of a generation. As a mental health advocate, I try to talk about life experiences. While being a professor at a Mumbai college, I bring up many things related to storytelling. So I would say the role that resonates with me the most is being a storyteller. Nikhil: I am very grateful for these 5 years of my life. When we started in 2018, the word GenZ wasn’t a popular term to be used. People knew about millennials and all young people were known as millennials. So back then when we started the conversations with GenZs about mental wellness and gender, people didn’t react at all. They didn’t know how to talk and react to these topics. But after the pandemic, these subjects became worth talking about. I feel the pandemic changed people and their perspective on life. During the COVID period, people themselves understood such issues, as mental wellbeing and anxiety. Now, there are issues that are still neglected by society like gender equalization, etc. People are angry and unhappy about so many things happening in society today across classes, communities, and cross-section of the society. At that time, it was tough for us to help people recognize these urgent subjects. But we kept pushing the important issues to the forefront. Now things have changed with a lot of effort from my team, who speaks out on these important subjects. And we believe Yuvaa is the intersection of what is important and what is interesting to make an impact. Because we believe, that unless we make the important things interesting, people won’t care about them. So, it’s been tough and interesting to cater to something that is important to create an impact. Nikhil: There is a recognition of these issues, and a lot of people are speaking about them, but it’s still not enough even in metro cities. In Tier 1 cities, we are surrounded by influencers and organizations that have liberal values while talking about these important topics. But if we consider our surroundings, colleges, societies, and workplaces, these conversations are not happening a lot. This is the scenario of tier 1 cities where at least these vocabularies exist but beyond that perimeter, people don’t even know about the meaning of terms like mental health, LGBT rights, Queer, and gender topics. It’s because there is no proper colloquial way to express these subjects. Things are changing gradually even in the smaller cities. Young people are very aware today because of the great internet penetration and lower consumption prices across the nation. There are things that people residing in these places care about and speak loudly. Also, I would say that institutions are not doing enough to make a deeper impact in the country. Nikhil: We are doing roadshows. During this time, we visited different campuses across the country. In our last roadshow, we visited not only tier 1 colleges but also small ones. So we went to IIMs, Symbiosis, Hansraj, etc. but at the same time visited smaller colleges such as Aryabhatta in Delhi and Maharani in Jaipur. The young people of these institutions have so much to offer with a lot more curiosity. We also do awareness campaigns in smaller places. We did a menstruation campign in Dahsra in Jharkhand. We have been working on menstruation campaigns. Last year, we associated with UNICEF and went to Tier 2 and 3 cities in Gujarat to teach how to use social media responsively. We are associating a lot with nonprofit organizations, brands, and social media platforms. We also work a lot on women’s rights. Presently, there are many brands that believe in these important conversations. So we make sure that we give them social reach both online and offline. Nikhil: I think it has empowered everybody. Every individual has a voice today, which is provided by these social media platforms. This is a good thing. Currently, the world is becoming a community of communities. People are seeking out a community that they could belong to and if they don’t fit into, they find it elsewhere. For example, Prajakta Koli has her own community that cares about what she does. Yuvaa too has a community just like every other influencer and brand that cares about the things done. We as a platform, want young people to find the communities that they belong to, but if not they can find a place in Yuvaa. Therefore, people have lots of social media options that feel right for them. Nikhil: For us, it’s important that there is a certain sense of information that the influencer or creator carries. We work with influencers who take exclusivity over inclusiveness. Creators who engage with people and talk about everything. We don’t necessarily work with people who only talks about social impact but they are also on their journey of using their voices around in a better way. Most recently, we worked with Agasthya Shah and Tanisha, who are really doing well online. We saw Agasthya talking about masculinity and Tanisha about mental health. These topics are so relatable to young people to bring small ways to make a big impact. We are always looking at people who would care a bit. Nikhil: It is a passionate project for me. Something that I was willing to do for a long time. Unfortunately in our society, men don’t have a language to express their feelings. Unless it is a heartbreak, which brings 100 film songs. Besides this, when a man is hurt, in pain, anxious, failed, or just sad, there is no way that he can express himself. From the birth itself, men are told to be strong, and they are not expected to show these kind of expressions out loud. I faced a lot of challenges too and didn’t know where to seek support from. After starting Yuvaa, I kept hearing about these issues and met people who have faced such things in their lives too. So I feel these conversations are very important and hence I started this initiative that I am proud of. It’s called ‘Be A Man Yaar’. We had such incredible guests including India’s well known and loved people on the couch. We shared some very interesting and honest conversations with them. Nikhil: Absolutely. I have tried to keep the conversation as simple as possible. But not everyone is comfortable having a Hindi conversation, so I might switch a bit. I believe the biggest challenge in our country for now is vocabulary around important conversations. In that sense, even English can be made a simple language for everyone to understand. But we need to make important topics accessible and interesting for everyone. And that’s what we are trying to do with Yuvaa as a whole. Nikhil: People don’t realize the importance of balance in their life which is needed for both personal and professional. Another important aspect is expectation mismatch among people. We hover over the social networks, and what we see is the surplus amount of great food, scenery, places, life, etc. Now the generation has a condition to believe that life is all about the great things. And if these great things don’t happen around people they must be missing something. A lot of this is being carried into the workplace and people expect it to be great. But in reality, not every workplace is great everyday. There are challenges and bad days also. So having patience is the key. One more thing is to help each other at the workplace, either by raising a voice or having important conversations. Talking to people around the workplace can help everyone. It is also important to have a life outside of the workplace. And that’s the challenge for the older generation to understand. My advice would be to create a bridge that is handled by both heads, the younger and older generations in the workplace. Protect everyone and protect your energy. Be kind to everyone but don’t forget to be kind to yourself too. Nikhil: We all need more listeners than speakers. There are a lot of young people who have so much to say but very few to listen to. If you become a good listener there is a good chance that you will also get heard. As Gandhiji said, be the change you want to see in the world. Nikhil: We are expecting to create IPs this year across a variety of different platforms. Not just online but offline as well. We already brought The Collab this year, which was the first GenZ event in the country. We had some of the biggest youth brand associations such as YouTube, Spotify, and Tinder, and non-profit organizations like UNICEF. We just finished our 4 th roadshow. We want to do more roadshows. We are also looking forward to doing an awards ceremony for the young people. We want to do a festival for young people, though there are a lot of thoughts yet to be put on this. We want to make ‘Be A Man Yaar’ a big IP. We are also doing something unstereotype, where we will have conversations with incredible women regarding different topics. There is a property we have that we will bring at the end of this year, called All Stars, which witnesses a long list of lovable personalities on the internet of that year.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Sep 08, 2023, 09:26 am In a One-on-one interaction with MI, Supreet K Singh, Co-Founder of Safecity talks about the mission of the platform, its reach, and future plans. Supreet opens up about the problems that lie in our country related to gender based violence. She also underlines the shortage of funds and their allocation which is also a problem for the platform. “We haven’t received any government support in terms of funds to date”, Supreet says while responding about government support to the cause. Excerpts here: Supreet: Hailing from an army background, I practically grew up embracing different communities and cultures. Later I did my MBA in International marketing and business. I started off my career as a sales and marketing in Beer brand. I was the first Indian woman in a managerial position for an alcohol and liquor company. Hence, my career was always under scrutiny by a lot of people. Later I was promoted a marketing manager and transferred to London. Soon after, I faced sexual harassment by the CEO of the company. I reported but the company didn’t have an SH policy so there was no redressal . So I decided to give up the position as I wasn’t very comfortable working there. Then the company offered me a job in their subsidiaries. I chose to come back to Mumbai, India, where I joined their airline segment as a Trade Marketing Manager. Here I met, Elsa Marie de Silva. Soon we became best friends partnering on a lot of initiatives together. I left my aviation job after sometime because I felt a little shortchanged by the company. But I was still connected to Elsa. It was then in 2012, we heard the news of Nirbhaya, the brutal rape incident that shook the nation. We had already started speaking to a lot of people to understand the reason behind public transport being still a place for sexual abuse. Surprisingly, after talking to many friends and relatives, we realized that all women had a story to share. They just don’t share it openly, or report it to the authorities, which contributes to the the lack of attention to the problem . And when the problem is not visible, the authorities don’t really have any data set to work with to resolve the problem. Then, Elsa came up with the idea of Safecity and we registered in 2014. So, Red Dot Foundation is the NGO name and Safe City is our flagship program. The idea behind Safecity is to bridge the gap between the reality of the cases of sexual harassment or violence and the cases that are actually being reported to the authorities. We didn’t want to create a parallel system. The data we receive from Safecity is here to strengthen the system that was already there, and to share it with the authorities. Supreet: We realized that people don’t report violence for two reasons. One, they don’t know about sexual harassment and violence and its criminal charges under the law in the land. Two, because of victim blaming in the country. Family, police, and society, all put a whole lot of pressure on the victim. We decided to invite people to report any form of sexual violence in public spaces with us anonymously. We asked them to report every detail of the incident without disclosing their identity. So, people came forward with each detail of the incident including, time, place, date, etc. As and when people started reporting to us, the incident got pinned onto a Google map. So you start seeing the incidents as a balloons markings on the map. Once we receive these reports, we share them with authorities and communities. We also share it on our website and mobile application. It has helped the police authorities immensely. In some cases, in order to increase surveillance in hot spots, the police adjusted the beat patrol timings . Currently, we use it with police authorities in Delhi, Goa, Hyderabad, Patna, Chennai, Pune, Mumbai, and Bangalore using the data from the website . Safecity in a way made women realize that they are not alone in experiencing harassment . We believe the most integral part of finding a solution to this issue is involving men and other genders from the communities. Because if half of the population is facing harassment issues due to the other half, we can only find a sustainable solution if all the stakeholders are involved. Supreet: Our mission is to work towards ending gender based violence. We work on gender justice, equality, and safety. We want to create a space where girls and women are free to move around and live their lives to their full potential. Ending violence against women and girls using crowdsourced data, community engagement, and institutional accountability, is the mission of Red Dot Foundation . So far, we have 55,000 reports. We are present in 17 countries including India, where we partnered with local NGOs and organizations. We have a lot of impact stories. We are working towards ending gender-based violence through education, and advocacy by using crowd-sourced data. We are also working for the prevention of Sexual Harassment Against Women in the workplace. We are constantly working on DEIA which is Diversity, Equality, Inclusivity, and Accessibility. We also work on projects with the LGBTQIA+ community. We also conduct bystander intervention training , because a lot of times we have noticed people losing lives while somebody is just filming an act of violence or is not aware of how they can intervene in such situations . We believe we need to create ways to help people to become active bystanders. Supreet: We collaborated with UN Habitat on the Urban Thinkers C ampus, where we have been hosting the event for almost five years now. We invite the stakeholders to talk about sustainable cities and the theme this year is youth-led inclusive and safe cities. We have also written a book series named, She Is. This book series is based on non-fictional stories of women who have achieved something in areas where usually they’re under shadows. The first book was about women working on sustainable development. The second was She Is – Women in STEAM. The book honors 75 women from the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics. Third is She Is – Water Sheroes. Here we worked with PSA, the Canadian consulate, and the Canadian scientist advisor to the Prime Minister of Canada. This book is about 21 women scientists and 8 community leaders in water from India and Canada. Now we are working on our 4 th book, She Is – 75 Women in Chemistry. For this, we are working with PSA and the Royal Society of Chemistry. Other than this, we believe art is a very non-confrontational way of opening conversations, which are otherwise taboo. We also work with theatre artists. Misogyny, and casual sexism, are some of the acts that are done by these artists. We also created a film last year with O&M Singapore, on how Bollywood glorifies toxic relationships in the garb of love. The youth actually gobbles it up and behaves in a way that is actually a violation of law. The film brought us a nomination for the Glass Lion for Change at Cannes. Supreet: We have seen the change in the sense that people are at least opening up to conversations. People are now noticing these issues. Honestly, the violence was happening before also but we couldn’t hear them enough. I think we will never know how much of that gap we have filled to date. But we are doing our bit. For example, we have trained more than 2,50,000 people so far. We hope these people will take this forward to their family and friends. Indirectly, we have touched more than a million people. Supreet: Currently, we are present in Delhi, Hyderabad, Patna, Chennai, Mumbai, Pune, Goa, Bangalore and rural Maharashtra. We want to upscale and go to tier 2 and tier 3 cities and that is in the plans. We did a project with SDA Delhi where we worked in 3 villages near Patna Bihar, empowering women with information on sexual harassment, the law and their rights and how the Safecity app works. Supreet: We are on the web and on mobile apps. We educate people about the Safecity app when we meet people doing on-ground activities, and projects. These are the people who go out and meet bigger communities. We invite them to download the app. We don’t have a marketing budget, but we have been using the social media. Supreet: Absolutely! Unless women know their rights and are economically independent, they will not be able to fight for themselves. With education comes the ability to keep yourself safe and lead a desired life. However, educating women can’t end gender-based violence. For that, we need to educate boys. They should learn to understand the meaning of consent. They need to understand the Indian law pertaining to these actions. While the boys need to be educated about this, girls need to be told that they have a voice and can say no, whenever they are not comfortable. Supreet: We aren’t a government-funded organisation. Having said that, of course, our She-Is book series are being supported by the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India. We haven’t been able to find a way of getting any part of the fund that is meant for organizations working in this space. I think the problem is more about the dissemination of information to NGOs on how they can partake in that fund. So to utilize it for the right cause. However, we have been getting help from certain police officers, such as the Commissioner of Police, Maharashtra, Mumbai. We also work with Western Railways. Supreet: We are planning to create a learning hub where we are going to have e-learning sessions. People can simply log in and learn about things that are admissible in the eye of the law. It can expand our reach towards people at large. Supreet: I want to tell little girls that know you’re important, unique, and a creator. So paint your life in the way you want. Fight for your education, don’t ever fall back. Make sure to have a dream and aspire to reach there. Finish your education and get economically independent. Last but not the least, support other women in regard to work, school, college, and everywhere. As a society, we need to support each woman out there. There is no companionship compared to the woman constantly correcting your tiara and pushing you to achieve more. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Sep 18, 2023, 12:51 pm In an exclusive interview with MI , Moneka Khurana, Country Head & Board Member, MMA Global – India speaks about SMARTIES 2023, the process, and details. She also speaks about modern marketing and its effect on brands and their engagement. Excerpts here: Moneka: Primarily, Smarties is known to celebrate and honor best-in-class modern marketing work with a heightened focus on business impact. It is an award ceremony that allows businesses to get recognized for cutting edge work. In 2023, we have further elevated the way we were judging the impact of all the work submitted. Smarties get a range of participation from brands, agencies, companies, media companies, and tech enablers. Eventually, we receive the work and come up with a final list that further derives the win. We collect all data relating to their mapped points against being shortlisted or for winning. The data gets converted into the Business Impact Index. Currently, the index is unique providing benchmarks and ratings. It is based on a proprietary methodology which is picked to scrutinize all submitted work performance. The process significantly ranks these submitted work into various levels in terms of top rankings which are advertisers for brands, tech enablers, and agencies. The methodology acts like an index for all the best-in-class experts, which is released at a local, regional, and global level. So, it’s the way we culminate Smarties. Moneka: In 2023, we have sharpened a lot of categories. Because we wish to be relevant into the space representing modern marketing. We have also added some new categories like influencer celebrity marketing, social impact marketing, brand purpose, CRM lead generation, etc. We have also added some new industry award categories. With the introduction of these latest categories, we also wish to recognize the contribution of digital and media agencies, and creative and tech agencies. Unlike last year, we now realize that these agencies play a vital role in a campaign’s success. Moneka: SMARTIES follows a rigorous judging process. At the onset, when we receive submissions, they go through a screening process by a pre-screening council which primarily represents the ecosystem. This jury has experts from across verticals. Then each entry is reviewed at least five times before it moves to the final stage. The average of that is taken into consideration while generating the final list. Once we generate our final list, we send it to our curated jury council which is a marketer only jury council. This year, we have representation from BFSI, D2C, service, durable category, and more such different categories. Each of these categories would have to score all the entries. The average of the scores is finally discussed by the jury group. Then they’re able to decide on the gold, silver, and bronze winners for SMARTIES. This year, the jury team is essentially represented by business leaders we have, Prabha Narsimham, Managing Director, Colgate India and Sunil Kataria, CEO at Raymond Lifestyle. We announced the shortlist already. The final winners will be announced on the 5th of October at Taj Santa Cruz, Mumbai. Moneka: We have tried to move with the time. Initially, we were modern mobile marketing, then we evolved and became modern marketing, exactly reflecting the changing ecosystem. Mobile marketing is now a 360-degree segment encompassing technology. In a MarTech and AdTech world, it is necessary to see e-commerce as a full stroke of omni-channel marketing which is a part of modern marketing. The other area where we witnessed the growth is new media. Today, we are in a connected ecosystem where we are able to engage with consumers across devices and land. Also, the transition happening with technology is further strengthening personalization and delivering better customer experiences. Moneka: Brands are recently making more investments in modern marketing and are embracing tech. It is impacting their engagement with consumers in a lot of ways. Moneka: From user perspective, it has seen growth because of the number of GenZs using social media. Also, platforms like Instagram have fueled the growth a lot. In terms of engagement with social media, it’s quite consistent and has a good amount of time spent. Moneka: The maximum pivots have happened from the time COVID hit the world. Ever since there have been so many strong and prominent milestones one could have seen in digitization. We have clubbed with the fact that digital and business is an agenda for every business now. It is a time when every business has assigned a percentage invested in digital and business transformation. Second, Indian social media has been on the rise with the surge of use and innovation in platforms like stories on Instagram. Now this trend is followed by Meta, and LinkedIn. It became a driver for heightened social media consumption. Third is of course e-commerce, which whilst Amazon and Flipkart have built a market. But now it’s getting more disrupted by the long tail, which is a combination of the D2C ecosystem and ONDC advancement in helping SMEs. So it’s penetrating quickly in small towns and all the areas where it’s hard to reach otherwise from commerce standpoint. The fourth one is data-driven marketing. Data-driven marketing is now like oxygen for businesses. It is considered the better way of doing business. Data is becoming a valuable asset and an investment for the business especially with cookies crumbling. It’s a mix of collecting first party data and remarketing to them. The next stage is expanding the pool by targeting second and third party data. It helps the business to reach out to local audiences and then eventually make them their own customer base. Lastly, the mobile has also been responsible for a lot of disruption in India, having the most affordable data plans. We now understand the importance of being a mobile-first business. It’s expanded to language first business. Moneka: Generative AI is playing a pivotal role in modern marketing. GenAI is a huge enabler for personal and professional growth. However, it’s not replacing jobs (which is quite a question everyone is concerned about). GenAI is here to enhance the quality of how human beings can contribute and be more efficient. Besides, a person having knowledge about AI skills has a better chance at work than a person not upskilling for AI. In our recent survey done with the companies, we saw people are comfortable with minimum regulation in AIs. But it’s about being thoughtful and mindful. Also if we look closely, GenAI was always a part of the organization. It was just behind the scenes, enabling a lot of objects for organizations, like CRMs, better customer service, etc. It’s just now we have better access and more solutions allowing wider usage and acceptance. GenAI allows a lot of personalization that’s effectively lending to ROIs. It also can automate and personalize content reducing unwanted manual effort. As AI is penetrating all kinds of areas, there is a risk of data privacy and protection, which is still a work that needs to be accomplished in the sector. Moneka: Yes, it’s going to be a slow season. Businesses and marketers recognize it. So the expectations in terms of purchasing power is also very realistic this year. It’s going to be value based approach in which customers and marketers will have to create their products and USPs. There will also be an impact on the purchasing power slowing down the judicious investments, spends and higher price sensitivity. The low spending will also affect the market of luxury and non-essential items. Digital commerce has also plateaued unlike earlier because of COVID. So these platforms have to be backed by a good deal which is not easily available through other channels. From an investment point of view, because of inflation, marketers would be able to net off better if they could bundle offers effectively. Also, there will be a need for marketers to be more resilient, just to be able to tie over the low because eventually, it’s all going to swing back. If they’re agile and nimble enough to adjust product proposition pricing, it could still prove to be a win-win. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Sep 21, 2023, 09:26 am In a one-on-one interaction with MI , Deepti Karthik, Fractional Chief Marketing Officer, Sleepyhead elaborates more about the concept behind the campaign #HomesDon’tJudge. She also underlines the competition in the segment and different marketing campaigns in the pipeline. Excerpts here: Deepti: Sleepyhead’s journey has been quite remarkable, initially establishing itself as a direct-to-consumer (D2C) brand. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic played a pivotal role in propelling our growth, resulting in a significant revenue increase year after year. Interestingly, the pandemic also reshaped consumers’ perspectives on mattresses. We introduced the innovative concept of the mattress-in-a-box, a game-changer in the industry. In the absence of physical stores due to the pandemic, this innovation allowed us to reach early adopters who appreciated our forward-thinking approach. Sleepyhead disrupted the traditional mattress industry landscape with its innovative solutions. Notably, we signed Ranveer Singh as our brand ambassador in 2022, a bold move for a brand still in its infancy. Our vision was clear from the outset: transform from a mere mattress company into a holistic provider of home and lifestyle solutions. In 2022, we launched the “Fabulous Living” campaign with Ranveer Singh to redefine our brand identity and avoid being pigeonholed as solely a mattress brand. This is where Sleepyhead stands as of 2023. Our sales now encompass a diverse range of products, including furniture and home furnishings. Beyond mattresses, our offerings encompass furniture pieces, recliners, sofas, bedsheets, pillows, dhurries, dhohars, coffee tables, shelves, and beds, among others. Our most recent addition to the furniture line is a motorized recliner, enhancing our existing range. In 2023, Sleepyhead is embarking on the path to becoming an omnichannel brand, following the footsteps of many other D2C brands. Our journey has begun with the introduction of our products in multi-brand outlets across Kerala. Google’s Category Development Index and Brand Development Index reports highlight Kerala as a region with substantial potential for our product category, and Sleepyhead has already established a robust presence there, making it our strongest market. This marks the initial phase of our omnichannel expansion, and we have exciting developments on the horizon. We are also in the process of expanding into other states, including Karnataka, and recently concluded a retailer meet as part of our pan-India expansion efforts. Deepti: Well, we have several players in the market. There are dedicated furniture and home living brands, along with e-commerce giants like Pepperfry and Urban Ladder, which have established a strong online furniture shopping market. Brands such as Home Center offer comprehensive home solutions, and more recently, I believe even Marks and Spencer have entered this category. However, it’s not just about the competition; it’s about how a brand resonates with consumers and fits into their lifestyle. When it comes to mattresses, we face competition from companies like Wakefit, Duroflex (our parent company), and Sleep Company all of which have gained prominence. Additionally, considering pricing, brands like IKEA also become part of the conversation. In the context of Indian consumers, their behavior tends to vary. For mattresses, they often visit the nearest store, explore online options on platforms like Amazon, and consider brands like Duroflex. For furniture, it’s more diversified, with different players dominating each product category. Brands such as Stanley, Wooden Street, and Pepperfry’s in-house brands are prominent in this landscape. It’s crucial to take into account the microeconomics of these purchases, as they are not immediate necessities like food. While we had prepared for an extended period of low sales during the downturn, fortunately, India hasn’t been severely affected. With the festive season underway, the market is showing signs of recovery, and consumers are displaying interest in mattresses and furniture. Deepti: Our goal is to outpace the industry’s average growth rate. As a challenger brand, we have consistently exceeded the category’s growth rate. We are primarily focused on gaining market share and maintaining our strong growth momentum. Deepti: Sleepyhead’s revenue for the last financial year, FY 21-22, surpassed 200 crores, and we are looking forward to achieving even higher numbers this year. Deepti: Homes Don’t Judge” originates from the notion that our homes serve as spaces where we can truly be ourselves. Whether you’re an introvert or extrovert, you can freely express yourself within the confines of your home. It’s a place where you can share your innermost thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment. This campaign reinforces the message that homes embrace us for who we are. We aimed to stand out in the furniture industry, which tends to be more conservative in its advertising. Thus, we conceived the idea of furniture items having voices and revealing all their secrets. This approach highlights Sleepyhead as a brand that values fun and spontaneity. Our vibrant colors and lively social media presence mirror this perspective. The campaign resonates with various occasions and celebrations. For instance, during Onam, we spotlighted the games people enjoy at home during the festival, capturing the essence of comfort and joy. Our objective is for consumers to associate Sleepyhead with fun and memorable moments in their homes. Deepti: We have an exciting campaign called “Play Sofa” launching soon. It features a detachable sofa that allows you to easily change its configuration. Think of it like building with Lego, where you can rearrange the sofa to create different shapes such as an L, U, or V. Additionally, we’re introducing a sofa bed that transforms with a simple tilt. Our most ambitious campaign is our ongoing collaboration with Ranveer Singh, which is entering its second year. While we’re keeping some details under wraps for now, we plan to unveil innovative ideas in the near future. Overall our goal is to establish a strong association between Sleepyhead and the concepts of sleep, fun, and comfort, so that whenever you think of any of these, you think of only Sleepyhead. Deepti: We’re exploring partnerships with brands that share a similar brand ethos. For example, we recently partnered with Koparo Clean, an organic home cleaning solutions brand. We believe this collaboration complements both our strengths, with Koparo being strong in the North and Sleepyhead in the South. We’re also in discussions with a hair color brand and an apparel brand, focusing on ethnic and quirky clothing. These partnerships will enhance our product offerings. Deepti: The home and lifestyle industry typically experiences a slowdown in the first half of the year. However, from July to November, there’s a significant uptick in activity, especially during the festive season. This is when a substantial portion of our annual sales occurs. We have aligned our marketing efforts and product launches to capitalize on this festive season, making it a crucial time for us. Deepti: Indeed, inflation has affected the market. It has led consumers to seek more value for their money and prioritize affordability. Sleepyhead benefits from this trend as we offer quality products at affordable prices. Our brand positioning targets consumers looking for value-for-money home and living solutions. We have observed an increase in such consumers and have effectively tapped into this segment. Deepti: Sleepyhead, as part of the Duroflex family, maintains a strong financial foundation. Our marketing expenditures fall within the industry-standard range of 10% to 15% of revenue. However, we prioritize profitability over aggressive spending. Our current strategy focuses on efficiently allocating resources for impactful campaigns during this festive season without exceeding a reasonable budget. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Nov 15, 2023, 10:07 am With the appointment of Harsha Razdan, CEO, Dentsu South Asia , the agency looks like picking up where it left off. In an exclusive interaction with MI , Harsha speaks about his past experiences and how he utilizes them in advertising. “I see massive growth in media, creative, and CX,” says Harsha. He also speaks elaborately about the ‘East meets East’ strategy and the usage of AI in the advertising industry. Excerpts here: Harsha: It was an exciting journey, as I expected. I got the chance to dabble with a lot of new things to shape the new-age Dentsu. I was excited by the One Dentsu approach and its vision painted by our global CEO and President, Hiroshi Igarashi . The vision is coming into good shape and we’re receiving a lot of focus from Japanese headquarters. Harsha: The service industry is about people management. And I have been in this business for a long time, from Accenture to KPMG. My early work experience was primarily in brand sales and marketing at PepsiCo and Unilever, which allowed me to see one side of the brands. After all these years, now with this role at Dentsu, I am on the other side of the client servicing industry, working for other companies. Harsha: We just lost two clients from the media business. But as I said earlier, we are not just a media company but an end-to-end service company operating at the intersection of marketing and technology. We have also won many clients, like Carlsberg, Berger Paints, and Torque Pharmaceuticals. There are a few more to add to this list, which we will announce soon. It was challenging to grab clients’ trust, as in any industry. But we are on a journey of One Dentsu with a vision of creating an end-to-end marketing and technology firm. I see massive growth in media, creative, and CX (which is around data, commerce and technology). This field is much larger, and I would aspire to capture it. Harsha: I don’t think the situation was out of control at all. In the past six months, I tried to build a few bases. One is stability. We did have leaders in the past, but they were not full-time leading India and Sri Lanka as a cluster. Now, I’m the person who can work out the right strategy for clients going forward. Two, the focus is on clients and constantly re-evaluating our strategy to meet clients’ needs. I put my full attention to this issue so that we don’t get distracted by internal things that happen typically at times. Third, honest talent assessment. We already have a talented workforce. So our target is to see if they are assessed properly. Harsha: First, we are becoming a client-focused company. However we were doing that in the past, we used to see things from our perspective, which is what I am focused on transforming. Second, the cultural collaboration. Optimizing geographically for South Asia, i.e., India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Once we do that, the capabilities, such as creative, media, and CX continue to be strong. But the first access now is in geography and trying to collaborate across these services to get the best for a client. Third, failure is fine. We should not worry about failures while thinking big. I would always appreciate a person who’s taken a stretched target and failed rather than someone who’s taken a conservative target and succeeded. Harsha: I hoped that our global President and CEO, Hiroshi Igarashi would visit India as the first step of East meets East, and he gladly agreed. For him and me, East meets East means two things. One. In the past, India reported to APAC, APAC to London, and London to Japan. Now, we report directly to APAC. Japan also realized the bigger size of the Indian market as the global CEO visited here as one of the first countries in APAC. So Japan meeting India is ‘East Meets East’. Two. We have a single cluster P&L for South Asia, including Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka. We have a common talent philosophy, client, and investment across the geographies, allowing talent to flow freely across countries. We also have Dentsu Global Services, which serves global clients in India. The companies are looking at this strategy as one common pool and being seamless in terms of movements and capabilities in trying the best service to the client. Harsha: The biggest trend we will see is the advent of technology and its role in media. Media will be more customized for the clients. Technology is disrupting the space of marketing and media. It’s important to embrace technology, AI, and other aspects of technology to make our offering more customized and relevant for the clients. Harsha: I can talk about my company. I believe that we have to embrace AI full-heartedly. We set our target of about 25% of work would be delivered using AI in the next 12 to 18 months. With that intent, I believe we can deliver valuable work for clients. We would also become more efficient internally in terms of doing more core work. At Dentsu, we have a globally acquired company called TAG, a leading production house, and an expert in rapidly customizing production content. Going forward, we have to see how technology will play a role in media. Harsha: India is among the top 50 markets for us globally. And everyone is looking at India rapidly scaling up the ladder and becoming a large market. In Asia, the growth markets for most countries typically remain the Southeast Asian markets. Our Japanese team also wants to invest in the market because of the huge growth in the media, creative, and CX space. We will also look at calculated acquisitions, which give us the kind of jump. So, it’s a significant market, and we are getting support from Japanese headquarters or APAC regarding the trajectory in spirit and investment for India. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Jan 03, 2024, 12:53 pm With an engineering background, Priyanka dived deep into the family business with a zest to achieve “something big.” In her words, I was already involved in the research and development of our baby, Snow World. After finishing off my course, I joined my family business and worked alongside my father and brother. In an interaction with MI , Priyanka Jain, Founder and director of Snow World Entertainment , opens up about the journey and industry dynamics. Excerpts here: Priyanka: We entered the entertainment industry in 2012 with Snowworld Entertainment in Phoenix Marketcity Kurla in Mumbai. It was the first time people could experience real snow in Mumbai. We received enormous love and a good response from people. After two years, we introduced Ski India, inspired by Ski Dubai, in DLF Mall, Delhi-NCR. After that, in 2017, we introduced our first game brand, The Game, in Atria Mall. Then, we entered into the hospitality sector with the launch of a restaurant, Barana, in Atria Mall. However, we had to discontinue the restaurant services due to Covid. In 2020, we introduced The Game Palacio, a one-roof entertainment space, from kids’ zones to adults’ party places and bowling to dining for families. After that, we brought our projects, The Game Ranch and Formula 11 Karting. Soon after, we launched Amazonia in Mumbai, inspired by Amazonico in London. The Game Luxe was then our next project in Phoenix Marketcity Kurla. The KOA- Juhu is another project, a boho-themed restaurant with multi-cuisine. In December last year, we launched The Game Superpark Pune, which offers everything under one roof, including games and entertainment. Priyanka: We’re present in Navi-Mumbai and Thane, Mumbai. We are also present in Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Pune. In another two months, we’re coming up in Hyderabad. Priyanka: Currently, there’s no direct competition for us in the industry. Some of the brands, like SMAASH and TimesZone, that I would consider competition, but we are far ahead of them now. Priyanka: Yes, it is challenging to be a woman in the hospitality industry. But luckily, in my case, it started from the family. I joined my family business, where my father and brother were involved in the projects alongside me. A woman has to maintain the position and match the same level of work and ideas as her male counterparts in the industry. Also, as a woman, I feel we always have to balance responsibilities. Losing my mother in the Covid taught me much about women’s life. A woman has to be assertive to be successful. You need to voice your opinion while making decisions. Priyanka: The hospitality industry has transformed a lot in the last decade. People now visit malls for dining and shopping. There’s also a lot of exposure to the global market nowadays. People want the same fun and entertainment in India, too. With these changing dynamics, we must be upbeat with all sorts of technology and sustainability. Our focus should be on enhancing customer experience. Priyanka: As of 2023, we’re at 100% YoY growth that involves INR 250 crores investment (approximately). Our vision is to invest 500 crores by 2025. Priyanka: In the coming year, there are multiple projects underway. So we hope to launch them with a minimal gap of two or one month. We’ve already launched six projects this year: The Game Ranch, Amazonia, The Luxe, Koa in Juhu, and The Game Superpark in Pune. In 2024, The Game Luxe is in the pipeline in Thane and Hyderabad. The Game Palacio is to be launched in Delhi-NCR and Bangalore. A Formula 11-Karting in Mumbai is also in the pipeline. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Mar 29, 2024, 10:06 am Ashit Kukian, CEO of Radio City in a one-on-one interaction with MI , where he talks about the brand’s reach and revenue. Ashit also points out a ‘deeper penetration’ in existing cities as and when the government releases new batches of licenses. The conversation dug deep into Radigitalization and its challenges too. “Radigitalization is a way of reaching out to consumers along with the medium of radio per se.” Adds Ashit. Excerpts here: Ashit: The current year is yet to close. However, the last 3 quarters have been good showing double-digit growth quarter – on quarter. We hope the coming quarter will also result in good considering the elections around the corner. We have always been bullish about our business for two things. One is of course about the radio part. And the other is the digital and on-ground activities that we have been doing for the last two to three years. We have observed considerable growth in this medium. We have been investing a lot in seeding for this, we call it the ‘Radigitalization’ strategy of Radio City. Ashit: In every election, there is a significant amount of money spent on campaigns. It also reflects on our quarter-on-quarter revenues. We are confident that revenue will increase to 10% in this quarter. Ashit: The last listenership was conducted during the post-COVID scenario for selected markets. Since then, I believe there has been an increase in the figures considering the time consumers spend on media. People consume radio as a medium across the length and breadth of the country. Moreover, the increase in population is also a driving factor of listenership. Ashit: We have always been relevant to the market and our listeners. We are very close to the sentiments of a particular city with our content variations. There is a lot of local content that reflects the ethos of the people of that city. Apart from music, which is a private source for all radio stations, we cater a large number of relevant content to the consumer. I am using the word ‘consumer’ instead of ‘listeners’ because we deliver content that is beyond radio. Ashit: No, it is not affected. The total time spent on the medium remains the same even after all this. Newer platforms come in the market and people start consuming the content. This only gives me an opportunity to create more content and distribute them across mediums and platforms. So, we are extending our reach beyond radio. Ashit: Though we are a hundred years young, I believe the medium is just as relevant today as it was when it first began. The kind of work we all are doing as an industry is adding up a lot of value for our listeners. Being a personal medium, radio is serving relevant content to its listeners. I am here speaking on behalf of the fraternity – Radio has always been a responsible medium and we are the first to be with the authorities to give respite to the people during natural calamities. This is the only medium that reaches to the roots of the country and is fairly different from most of the mediums in perspective of its reach. Ashit: Today, radio medium reaches approximately 65% of the country. And, as the government releases new frequencies, it would become one of the largest penetrating mediums from a mass perspective. Radio City is present in 70% of the markets from a count perspective in the advertisement arena. Unlike our competitors, we are not large in number, but we are present in all critical markets that consumers and brands look at. Ashit: Radigitalization is a way of life. What we are doing is to just reflect the consumer perspective. We believe that we are a marketing solutions company and give brands an opportunity to engage with consumers. The engagement of consumers is happening in the consumer’s choice of media or platform. Radigitalization is a way of reaching out to consumers along with the medium of radio per se. Today, we are present on social and other digital platforms, and reach out to consumers because brands want it their way. As content creators, we understand what consumers want. If you look at our on-air content apart from digital radio, you’ll notice that you’re all engaged in digital activities that go along with radio. I don’t think there’s any challenge, but opportunities, with radigitalization. It will ensure your digital learning, allowing you to enter the market where you can capture consumer trends as they happen. It’s fun, and opportunity and creates more value for both the brand and the consumer. Ashit: We are reflecting on the consumer journey. If the consumer today is engaging with virtual reality and AI-led content, nothing stops us from giving them such content. AI RJ Sia is a reflection of the changing habits of consumers who consume content through technology. However, we have maintained a perfect balance by not utilizing all technology, because radio still remains an emotional quotient for people. So, the balance of both EQ and the advancement of technology is what we are currently delivering. In the future when consumers become more technology-driven, possibly you’ll see a lot of changes in us. Ashit: The volumes have shown surpassing the pre-Covid level. The yield is also steadily increasing. So, it’s a good sign, and we should look forward to better times. We will be increasing the number in the coming months. Ashit: While the success is all Vaibhav’s, I don’t think anybody should take the success away from him. But we take a lot of pride in creating tremendous opportunities for not just Vaibhav Gupta, but many other talented people across the years. We add value to their lives by having professional singers guide and shape them. Ashit: We will continue to strengthen our radio presence and at the same time expand ourselves digitally. We are exploring various digital opportunities to increase our presence in the consumer space thereby enabling brands to engage with consumers. We have a plan to expand our presence in the country vigorously, as, and when the next phase of new licences drops. We would possibly have deeper penetration in some of the existing states where we are currently present. Ashit: Radio will be seen from a different perspective. With technology entering a consumer’s life and making digitalization easier for all of us, there is a radical shift taking place in media itself. In this changing consumer and media landscape, I believe that the radigitalization space of radio would appeal to the majority of consumers and that brands would want to be associated with it as well.

It can carry your period essentials in a stylish and quirky way.” Elaborating about the product line-up, Mahipal Singh adds. In a one-on-one interaction, MI speaks with Mahipal Singh, CEO and Founder of Revaa . Singh talks about its inception, product line, and awareness programs. Excerpts here: Mahipal: The story goes back to the first time my daughter got her periods. The year 2020, when the pandemic was being cruel to all of us, her mother tested positive for COVID and had to practice isolation. Being the sole guardian at the time, I had to make this easy for our daughter. I decided to create something around menstruation and women dealing with several issues attached to it. I have seen my loved ones in menstruating pain, the myths and taboos that many women carry on their shoulders all their lives. So I wanted to create something that creates awareness and talks about everything around menstruation. In a research, we found that only 35% of women have access to a hygienic menstrual product in India. My concern was the other 65% that were lacking the basic necessities. After a few more research, we found out that the basic awareness around menstruation is missing. This is when we created Reeva to foster awareness, break taboos, and embrace wellness. We have an array of products right from day one to day five of the periods. We identified the mood swings, digestion issues, menstruating pains, anxiety, and many more problems that women suffers during this time of the month. We have oils for pain, anxious sleep, and mood swings that can help women. We developed plenty of products for skin and overall wellness concentrated on women’s health. Mahipal: The brands are doing their bit but generally, businesses follow certain courses and need to be focussed around it. However, we are approaching it by creating awareness across age groups. We are engaging with schools and creating awareness by talking to young girls about menstruation. It is particularly done by conducting sessions and talking about the subject interactively. Mahipal: We are creating a differentiator by introducing a range of reusable sanitary pads, liners, and period panties. These panties come with some added fashion of colours and prints, available in six different sizes to cover the larger part of women’s body types. These reusable leak-proof panties have a minimum absorption of 100ml. However, as per research, a woman during each menstrual cycle releases approximately 12 to 15 ml of fluid. So, our products are eco-conscious and are good up to 100 washes. Also, economy-wise, a reusable pad is one-tenth of the cost of a disposable pad. A few years back, when girls were using unhygienic cloth, disposable pads were a real game-changer. We don’t think disposable pads are bad or unhygienic. It works wonderfully for a large part of the community. But today, we have to think about the environment too. Mahipal: We have been conducting a lot of pop-ups and getting our word out into the market. We try to get people to use our brand and then give us feedback. We are reaching out to tier 1 and 2 cities to educate them to take up this initiative and be the first to try out a reusable pad. For awareness programs, we initially started with Delhi and NCR, where we were engaging with schools (both private and public). We talked with boys and girls and also invited either one of the parents to attend these conversations. In these sessions, we encourage girls to share their experiences, so other kids could learn from the stories. We are planning to move to other parts of the country in the coming months. Mahipal: Our reusable pads come in two variants – INR 475 for a pack of four and INR 465 for a pack of four. We’ve chosen to keep a pack of four because one can always get a piece handy while other pieces are might be up for wash or dryer. Mahipal: We have kept the website informative and intriguing, so people could hook into it. Whenever people drop into our website (www.reevaforyou.com), they can have a takeaway in the form of knowledge about menstruation and women’s wellness. We have curated the sections under the shop menu, with menstrual magic wellness wonders and fashion fusion. It finely covers a menstruation cycle for women, from when the mood swings happen before periods and then after the cycle. We have created a fun, loving product range that can cater to a 10-year-old and also a 35-year-old. We launched 2 months back and have been able to cater to 5000 customers. So it’s about creating a very inclusive and comfortable environment through our products. Mahipal: We are engaging with various offline distributors to get into the offline market. It’s still at a nascent stage but we’re moving towards developing this as an equivalent part of our online lives. Mahipal: The way we want to approach this is by building conversations with women around wellbeing and moods. As I mentioned earlier, only 35% of women have access to hygienic pads. So we want to engage with those other 65% Indians who don’t even have hygienic means. We want to step up into that segment. We want to reinforce positivity around menstruation. As our tagline says- swing your mood swings and be period-positive with Revaa. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari May 21, 2024, 17:22 pm MI talks with Ajit Manerikar, Senior Vice President of production & Commercials at Rusk Media in a one-on-one interaction. Ajit, a passionate content creator and seasoned production management executive, brings expertise from renowned organizations such as Disney, Fremantle Media, Endemol, Discovery, and YouTube. As Ajit completes his two-year tenure at Rusk Media this May, he shares insights into Gen Z behaviors, the research process, and the future of content creation. Edited excerpts here: Ajit: Earlier, the content available over multiple platforms was catering to the female and male community of the age group 30-35 years around themes like crime, thrillers, romance, etc. Rusk Media recognized the gap in the distribution pallet. Hence, in 2019 it was established with the intent to distribute content to the age group 14-24 years old. Rusk Media realized the issues that revolve around this age group like schools, early romance, getting into college, internship, or job. Therefore, the Rusk Studio indulged in making content to the liking of Gen Zs. Shows like School Chale Hum, School Friends, and Date with Senior were created that quickly held with their audience. Initially, we were catering to the YouTube audience. We evolved and associated with many other platforms. During the pandemic, we learned people consumed mobile content for their core entertainment because of the whole isolation process they were going through. Gradually, it increased the individual mobile usage. Even now, you can hardly see a family sitting together and watching TV. A lot of OTT platforms started licensing our content. Most of our content like Roomies in Dreamland, Couple Goals, School Friends, and more were picked up for new seasons on other platforms. So the first season for these shows is still on YouTube while all other seasons are available on different OTT platforms. We learned that content on mobile devices is much different from others. For TV, there must be a particular time and place while watching content whereas people can carry mobile devices anytime anywhere. With TV, there is a process, you keep mobiles aside while watching and enjoy the shows together. However, on mobile devices, you might receive a call, notification, and other updates constantly. As per our research, Gen Zs have a shorter attention span of time, they tend to switch content after a notification on their mobile device. So we decided to create snackable mobile-first content. We started to make shorter content for about 10-12 min with good and gripping storytelling so that people wish to come back to the show even after the distraction. The shooting and editing are also far different from that of television. When we shoot for mobile, there is not much scope to capture surroundings and background, because people want to get the actual content. We do the shooting and editing in a fast manner, with no time for too many expressions because of the audience’s shorter attention time. Every shot is captured very closely with good lighting to hook the audience and give them a good viewing experience. Ajit: At Rusk Media, we create different IPs and sell them to various platforms to make white-label content. We also have a gaming platform, where these IPs are made as a part of the game. Apart from this, we have a service segment where we cater to commission shows. We are working with Jio for another commission show. Being a mobile-first production house is our strength but we also look forward to cater television and OTTs. We are not limiting ourselves to mobile only. We are pitching daily soaps too, because we strongly believe serial content is a way forward. People will only engage with the show if they find it interesting. It also adds to the business revenue for the long 8 or 10 episodes people get hooked to. Ajit: Currently, we are available on 4 platforms, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. We receive approximately 20 million viewers across all these platforms. This helps us gather a huge data we get primarily from the platforms. Data like who’s watching our shows, and what themes and genres young people like. Secondly, we follow industry insights and global trends to understand what people prefer across the globe. Ajit: As of now, we don’t have anything for regional audiences. However, we are collaborating with a lot of platforms to create regional content. Presently, we are creating content for the Hindi-speaking Gen Zs. With the help of our data, we realized the wants and needs of Gen Zs and Alpha are common across the country. We are trying to license our content to these regional television channels. Hopefully, around the third quarter, we will announce something for the regional space. In the space of a gaming entertainment show, we just finalized the shooting of Playground Season 3. We are engaging with some global partners like Latin and European countries for licensing. Ajit: Presently, we’re not using AI to create content. There are platforms able to create videos as per your command. It’s scary to me considering people could lose their jobs. However, there are some tasks that AI seems to do quite easily ultimately saving the huge amount of money that the related software costs. I don’t think AI can fall into the area of production where we shoot video with LED screen lights. It can’t get into the making of micro dramas of 1 to 2 mins. Content creation is a serialized package. Going forward, the good snackable short video formats will become crucial. These formats can create a mind space where people know they can leave the platform after 2 minutes. Having said that, long video formats will also be present along with movies. Ajit: We have School Friends Season 4, Couple Goals Season 3, and Playground Season 4 in the pipeline. We are working towards the licensing of the new seasons. We have another show lined up on Jio. We have our focus on creating new IPs. Hopefully, we will come up with 10-15 IPs by this year relevant to the needs of Gen Zs. We also ventured into diverse kinds of mythology. We believe, there are many mythological stories yet to be told other than Ramayana and Mahabharata. We are also making these stories into animation. Apart from this, we’ll soon be bringing some biographies and documentaries. By the next 5 years, we hope to release 100 IPs. We plan to indulge in regional and global content as well along with different kinds of genres. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Jun 05, 2024, 10:06 am JetSynthesys’ Metaphy Labs , a leader in new-gen technology, transforming brand experiences with immersive worlds and proprietary AI products. Recently during the Flipkart’s Big Billion Days, Jet Metaphy Labs transformed digital experiences with Metaphy-powered Virtual Worlds, unveiling Flipverse 2.0. It facilitated brand campaigns for many brands to stand up and also enhanced visibility and engagement. MI speaks with Varun Sharma, CEO and Co-Founder of Metaphy Labs about their company’s immersive approach. Let’s read: Varun: Metaphy Labs was born from a passion for pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with technology. We saw the immense potential of AI and immersive experiences to create profound and impactful interactions. Since then, Metaphy Labs has grown from a small team of enthusiasts to a recognised force in the industry. We’ve constantly evolved, expanding our capabilities in AI, virtual humans, and building a strong foundation in enterprise-grade solutions. Varun: Crafting immersive experiences is a delicate dance between the art of storytelling and the science of data & Innovation. Our process begins by partnering with clients to understand their vision and target audience. This collaborative approach allows us to tailor the experience to achieve specific goals, whether it’s boosting brand awareness, educating users, fostering emotional connections or direct conversions. With a solid business foundation in place, our creative and technical teams take centre stage. First, we carefully design and create stunning Immersive creatives which fits with the brand Ethos. Finally, cutting-edge technology brings the experience to life. Along with stunning visuals, our immersions incorporate 3D interactions, behavioural AI & deep data analytics, making them truly interactive and dynamic. This allows users to engage with the environment in a meaningful way. Think of it as building a rocket ship. Our strategists design the blueprints, ensuring a smooth launch. Then, our creative and technical teams become the engineers, building a cutting-edge spaceship that takes you to the farthest reaches of the immersive universe. Varun: AI and emerging technologies are acting as a catalyst for a complete transformation of the brand experience. We’re seeing a shift towards hyper-personalization, where AI analyzes vast amounts of customer data to tailor interactions in real-time. Imagine a clothing store that uses AI to recommend outfits based on your preferences and browsing history. This granular understanding allows brands to create a sense of connection and valued interaction with each customer. Engagement is also being revolutionized. Technologies like AR/ VR and 3D Immersions are blurring the lines between physical and digital worlds. Virtual product trials, interactive brand storytelling through AR filters, and gamified experiences all create a deeper, more memorable connection with the brand. Customer service is being revamped by AI-powered chatbots that offer 24/7 support, answer questions with increasing accuracy, and even adapt their tone based on sentiment analysis. This fosters a sense of constant accessibility and personalized interaction. Finally, AI can analyze customer behaviour to predict needs and proactively address them. This level of anticipation builds trust and loyalty, fundamentally reshaping the way customers interact with brands. Varun: A well-crafted innovative customer experience is the bedrock of a strong brand-customer relationship. When a brand consistently exceeds expectations, it fosters positive emotional connections. These connections create a sense of trust and loyalty that transcends mere transactions. Delighted customers become brand advocates, organically expanding the brand’s reach through positive word-of-mouth. More importantly, loyal customers are more likely to make repeat purchases and spend more over time. This translates into sustainable business growth for the brand. In essence, an enhanced and innovative customer experience strengthens the brand-customer relationship by building emotional connections, fostering brand advocacy, and driving customer loyalty. Varun: India is experiencing a surge in AI adoption across various industries, positioning itself as a major player. The Indian government actively supports this growth through initiatives like “AI for All” and “Responsible AI for Growth,” showcasing their commitment to fostering a robust AI ecosystem. This is further fuelled by a thriving AI startup scene developing innovative solutions in healthcare, agriculture, and finance. We’re already seeing AI making inroads in sectors like banking (fraud detection), retail (demand forecasting), and manufacturing (predictive maintenance). However, challenges remain. Building a robust data infrastructure, attracting top AI talent, and addressing privacy concerns are crucial aspects that India needs to address to fully unlock the potential of AI. Overall, India’s AI landscape is promising, with the potential to revolutionize customer experiences and drive significant economic growth. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline May 28, 2024, 15:11 pm Kakkoii Entertainment, the strategy-first advertising, design and entertainment company founded by industry veteran Yousuf Rangoonwala, formerly of W+K and BBH, is proud to announce a strategic integrated partnership with HoneyVeda, the innovative, monofloral and cruelty-free honey brand founded by Hardik Joshi, who is widely recognized as the “Bee Man and Honey Man of India.” Kakkoii Entertainment will serve as the official brand strategy, design identity, packaging design, social media content creation and management, and performance marketing agency for HoneyVeda. Over the past five months, Kakkoii Entertainment has immersed itself in the world of bees and honey, guided by the expertise and passion of Hardik Joshi, and written an inspiring and sharp brand purpose for Honeyveda. Since 2016, Hardik has dedicated himself to enhancing the quality of honey, and protecting bees, which are essential for pollination and responsible for 70% of the food we consume. His commitment to these tiny but valuable creatures, and towards ensuring improved livelihoods for beekeepers and farmers of India, has been nothing short of admirable. On World Bee Day 2024, when the partnership was formally agreed for, it marked a significant milestone as Kakkoii Entertainment became the official AOR for HoneyVeda. HoneyVeda gained national recognition after being featured on Shark Tank, where Hardik Joshi’s pitch captivated audiences and received accolades from Anupam Mittal. HoneyVeda stands out for its exceptional taste and Hardik’s hands-on approach, from beekeeping to farming. “Our team at Kakkoii Entertainment is already ‘buzzing’ with ideas and enthusiasm for HoneyVeda. Our goal is to differentiate the brand, and we have a very exciting and meaningful purpose for it. Through it, we will highlight the importance of bees, beekeepers, and farmers, while also promoting Hardik Joshi’s remarkable journey and vision for making cruelty-free honey, and the marvelous pure honey, which honeyveda extracts, harvests and sells. The brand is already working with a few state governments, to make high quality honey more mainstream. We went deep into the category, and culture and mindset of Indians towards honey, to write the strategy for the brand. In a way, I would say, we’ve written the Bible for building a honey brand in this country. Now, This partnership is set to bring HoneyVeda’s story and products to a wide audience, creating a buzz in the industry, and the nation,” said Yousuf Rangoonwala, Founder, CSO and Executive Director for Kakkoii Entertainment. Hardik Joshi, the founder of Honeyveda conveyed to the media, “I see Kakkoii’s team as the co-founders for Honeyveda, and an extension of our marketing team. Frankly, their work has been so nuanced, sharp and thorough so far, they have understood the category, and what is required for the brand, better than us. This collaboration between HoneyVeda and Kakkoii Entertainment is the start of a new chapter filled with ideas, a new avatar of the brand and impactful campaigns. Stay tuned for more exciting updates as we work together to elevate HoneyVeda’s presence and influence.” Your email address will not be published.

Each of the newly launched beverages has unique features and benefits. TeaFit stands out in the beverage market with its unique Ayurvedic iced teas and zero-sugar instant tea premixes. Prioritizing natural ingredients and Ayurvedic formulations, TeaFit ensures each sip contributes to overall well-being, steering clear of artificial flavours and excess sugar. Each of the newly launched beverages boasts unique features and benefits, available in convenient sachet. The Saffron instant tea is made using authentic saffron sourced from Pulwama(J&K), providing a rich, balanced flavour and vibrant colour that sets it apart from other saffron teas on the market. The Lemongrass instant tea beverage offers a refreshing, citrusy taste, perfect for revitalising the senses. The Matcha Latte sourced from Japan made with high-quality matcha, delivers a smooth and earthy flavour, packed with antioxidants and health benefits. TeaFit’s latest offerings compliment a lineup of sugar free products. The brand’s Peach Green Tea is a top seller, known for its mild and refreshing taste without added sugar.

Jyoti Bhardwaj, Founder of TeaFit said, “Working with real saffron was extremely challenging. Unlike most saffron teas available that use just an essence, we source our saffron directly from Pulwama.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 20, 2024, 11:47 am Social Pill, through its AI-forward stance, developed a custom GPTthath will help advertisers cut their time of submitting the self-declaration form to about 3 minutes or less from the traditional 10 to 15 minutes for every single advertisement. Under this, the advertiser needs to upload the ad creative to the GPT and the tool will automatically read the creative and furnish the information that needs to be filled in with regards to the ads. The mandate of the new self-declaration compliance laid out by the Ministry of Information Broadcasting for all advertisements going out from 18th of June 2024, requires that every single ad in outdoor, print, television and digital media carry a self-declaration alongside. The process laid out mentions that the agency would require a letter of authorisation (LOA) from the client that enables them to apply for self-declaration. This declaration states that any information that is being communicated via the ad is not misleading and in compliance with the ethical guidelines of MIB. This poses a challenge to mid and larger digital agencies that publish multiple ads every single day on platforms like Google and Meta for their advertisers. Neelesh R Pednekar, Co-Founder & Head to Digital Media mentioned, “We anticipated the ambiguity and chaos that could come along with the implementation of the self-declaration form and started working towards building the custom GPT. We have always leveraged technology to make things simpler and easier. This tool will cut down the burden on the executives who are managing the campaigns by reducing their time to fill in the self declaration forms.” Below is how the form looks on the press council portal: Below is how the form looks on the MIB Self Declaration Portal: Dedicated to harnessing technology to simplify processes, the tool offers an intuitive and efficient solution for digital advertisers. By merely uploading their advertisements, users can quickly generate the necessary content needed for the form with all relevant Ad-related information. This tool will not only help filling in the details on the MIB portal but also for advertisers who are self declaring on the Press Council website. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Team MI Feb 03, 2023, 17:37 pm Muthoot Finance – India’s No. 1 Most Trusted Financial Services Brand as per The Brand Trust Report 2022, and the country’s leading Gold Loan NBFC, has signed on the widely loved, multi-talented, highly awarded actress, Smt. Madhuri Dixit, as its brand ambassador . The brand also continues to have the legendary Shri Amitabh Bachchan as their brand ambassador as well. Sharing the news about this new association Mr. Alexander George Muthoot, Joint Managing Director of The Muthoot Group said, “We are very delighted to welcome Smt. Madhuri Dixit Ji to The Muthoot Group family as our Brand Ambassador. We are confident that her association with us will greatly help in taking the brand to much greater heights. We continue to have Shri. Amitabh Bachchan Ji as our brand ambassador as well.” He further added, “Madhuri Ji has demonstrated a strong connection with diverse audiences through her extraordinary performances, for a long period of time. She continues to amaze people through her new roles as a producer and a reality show judge. Her immense success and goodwill can be attributed to her work ethic, dedication, integrity, and uncompromising values. Our brand resonates with her on-screen legacy and off-screen image, which makes her a natural and cultural fit for our brand. For over centuries, Muthoot Finance has transformed people’s lives by empowering their dreams into reality. We have earned people’s trust and confidence over generations of customers. Evidence can be seen in several real life stories, wherein people saw their lives transform by taking a gold loan from Muthoot Finance. In 2022, Madhuri Ji had narrated some of these inspiring real-life stories of Muthoot Finance customers in a radio programme called ‘Muthoot Finance Sunheri Soch Season-2’, which illustrated the unique role of our brand in the lives of people, and therefore in nation-building as well. As most Indians would know, Muthoot Finance is a financial supermarket with 5750+ branches across India and abroad. Madhuri Ji will be endorsing a bouquet of our financial products including Gold Loans, Home Loans, Personal Loans, and Vehicle Loans, which are all poised for the next level of growth. For Gold Loans in particular, where we happen to be the category leader amongst NBFCs, our main objective has been to put idle-lying household gold to productive use and help people achieve their dreams. It is a task that needs a strong connection with diverse audiences to accomplish its potential. We are confident that our new association with Madhuri Ji will greatly help us to achieve this transformational objective.” Padma Shri, Smt. Madhuri Dixit also shared her thoughts on becoming the brand ambassador for the brand. She said, “Muthoot Finance is India’s Most Trusted Financial Services Brand as certified by The Brand Trust Report 2022 and I am happy to be associated with them. They are a brand with a strong legacy of doing business with values and crores of Indians have transformed their lives after availing a Gold Loan from Muthoot Finance.” She added , “Last year, I had the privilege of knowing about some life-changing, real-life success stories of Muthoot Finance gold loan customers.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Mar 21, 2024, 09:34 am Warner Music India has expanded its partnership with Global Music Junction (GMJ), the music and entertainment subsidiary of JetSynthesys. The companies struck a distribution deal in 2021, but this new agreement sees Warner Music make a strategic investment in GMJ, giving it a seat on the board. The move will establish Warner Music India to become the largest player in the central Indian music market. GMJ is the dominant force in the Bhojpuri, Haryanvi, Oriya, Kannada, and Gujarati language markets and has recently achieved exponential growth in the latter two. Bhojpuri is the fastest-growing language in India, and this move makes Warner Music the largest player in its music market. GMJ is committed to empower artists and labels through services including content creation, events management, innovative distribution, marketing solutions, technical analytics, and legal expertise. The company has built an ecosystem that involves more than 100 partners, over 250 million subscribers, serving up more than 100 billion minutes of entertainment annually in more than 130,000 pieces of audio-visual music content. Its partners include renowned figures such as Bhojpuri superstars Khesari lal Yadav, Pawan Singh, Haryanvi superstars Renuka, Sapna Chaudhary and Sahil Sandhu, Odiya stars Malay Mishra and Ira Mohanty along with legends from the industry such as Sonu Nigam, Salim Merchant, Shaan, and Sulaiman Merchant. GMJ also collaborates with training and production partners such as the top online music learning platform Artium Academy, Rajasthan-based movie production company Hariprem Films and Music Directors Sahil Sandhu (Western Beats, Haryana) and Malay Mishra (Basanta Studios, Orissa). In the recent past, GMJ has achieved significant milestones with its content such as “Jale 2”, by Haryanvi superstar Sapna Choudhary, becoming one of the fastest music video to reach more than 300 million views on YouTube and more than 15 million Instagram Reels in India in 90 days. The video for “Sent Gamkauwa” by Shivani Singh accumulated more than 700 million YouTube views in just six months. Alfonso Perez Soto, President, Emerging Markets, Warner Music , says , “This is a significant milestone in the expansion of our presence across India. Working with the amazing team at GMJ last year not only strengthened our partnership but enabled us to better support artists from the central regions of India, bringing them the best artistic support that any company can provide, and helping them connect with fans across the country and around the world. India is one of the most exciting music markets in the world and with GMJ as a partner we’re right at the heart of it.” Rajan Navani, CEO and founder of JetSynthesys, adds , “Our journey with Warner Music has been remarkable, highlighted by some successful collaborations. The indigenous languages in which we operate, such as the Bhojpuri, Haryanvi, Oriya, Kannada and Gujarati language markets in India, have seen incredible growth in the recent past. Warner Music’s investment in Global Music Junction and its continued collaboration with us will fast track the increasing expansion of India’s regional music industry. With our combined collective vision and understanding of audience preferences, we aim to strengthen the ecosystem by meeting the growing fan demand in the music and entertainment space. We are looking forward to more successful outcomes from our longstanding collaboration.” Jay Mehta, Managing Director of Warner Music India, adds: “Our partnership continues to have a significant presence in the places in the Indian market which are growing most rapidly, and so enables us to be the fastest music company in our expansion. GMJ is a leading player in five language markets in central India and works with some of the biggest names in Indian music and show business. This is a critical moment in our expansion across the country as we seek to position Warner Music India as the number one choice for all discerning artists and labels.” Rajkumar Singh, CEO, Global Music Junction, comments: “GMJ is committed to pioneering innovative marketing strategies, fostering creativity, and elevating the digital music landscape across India. Our expanded partnership with Warner Music will help us fulfil our vision of becoming the foremost digital entertainment company in the country, while nurturing the next generation of talent. We will continue to enable our partners to focus on their artistic endeavours, while we manage their digital properties to engage users effectively.” Giri Digital, an early investor in GMJ, continues to stay invested.

Bada Dekho.” starring Kartik Aaryan. This campaign underscores the unparalleled joy and vibrant freshness that comes with experiencing movies in a cinema hall, an experience that cannot be replicated elsewhere or after its past its prime. Following the success of the previous campaign, this new initiative continues to celebrate the essence of Cinema, this time focusing on the immediacy and freshness of watching a movie on the big screen. “Fresh Dekho. Bada Dekho” captures the thrill and excitement that come with viewing a new release in a theatre, surrounded by fellow movie enthusiasts. The campaign brings Kartik Aaryan’s charismatic and relatable presence to the forefront. In the campaign video, Kartik eloquently narrates the magic of cinema in his signature style, emphasizing the unique energy and collective experience that only a cinema hall can offer. Kartik Aaryan highlights the unique and exhilarating experience of watching movies in a cinema hall. He compares the thrill of fresh, in-the-moment viewing to the excitement of a champion’s perfect moment. He emphasizes the collective energy and emotional rollercoaster shared with the audience, contrasting it with the lacklustre experience of watching eight weeks old movies at home or alone on small screen. Kartik urges viewers to leave their couches, gather their friends, and enjoy the vibrant, immersive experience that only a cinema can offer. The campaign tagline is “Fresh Dekho. Bada Dekho.” which translates to “Watch it fresh. Watch it big. ” Commenting on the campaign, Gautam Dutta, CEO – Revenue & Operations, PVR INOX Ltd, said, “We are delighted to unveil our new campaign, ‘Fresh Dekho. Bada Dekho,’ which reflects our commitment to bringing the freshest and most exhilarating cinematic experiences to our audience. The film celebrates cinema as a communal experience, the thrill of witnessing a story unfold on the big screen with a live audience. It argues that this shared experience, like the electric atmosphere of a cricket match, transcends the act of simply watching a movie – it becomes a vibrant, in-the-moment event, unlike the passive consumption of something past its prime. Kartik Aaryan beautifully captures this essence in the campaign, emphasizing how every twist, laugh, and tear is best experienced in the dark cinema environment. We invite everyone to enjoy the unparalleled joy of watching movies on the big screen.” Kartik Aaryan added, “On joining hands with PVR INOX for the campaign, Bollywood heartthrob Kartik Aaryan said, “The magic of cinema is truly experienced when shared with live audience. The collective gasps, laughter, and emotions create a unique atmosphere that simply cannot be replicated on a smaller screen. Just like watching a live match, a film’s power is best felt in the moment, on the big screen. So all I would say to our audiences out there is, don’t wait for the magic to disappear! Watch it fresh, experience it the way it’s meant to be, on the big screen.” The film will run in cinemas, on digital platforms as well as on TV. Kartik Aaryan’s association with the campaign will further amplify its reach and impact.

The film, directed by renowned director Arko Provo Bose, is a visually stunning recreation of a 16th century Mughal era setting, with a modern twist. The campaign takes viewers on a journey through time, transporting them to the majestic courtyard of Emperor Akbar’s court, where the famous musician Miyan Tansen sings his timeless raga, “Miyan Ki Malhar”, to invoke the monsoon rains. As the rains pour down, the Emperor’s family and their guests slip on their raincoats, courtesy of Dollar Industries Limited’s latest rainwear collection. The campaign aims to promote Dollar Industries Limited’s new range of rainwear as a fashion statement, rather than just a functional product. The film’s blend of historical accuracy and modern flair is a testament to the brand’s commitment to innovation and style.

The ad is a perfect example of how a cohesive team, a well-crafted script, and a supportive client can come together to produce a successful and impactful commercial. The project involved seamlessly integrating various elements — script, casting, location, direction, and post-production — to create an ad that is both entertaining and informative.” Arko Provo Bose, Director, adds, “Handing a period piece is always a challenge. The idea was to not blatantly shoot it like a spoof. In a country which swivels between Mughal-e-azam and Jodha Akbar, finding the middle path was a task that the team was ready to take on. Overcast skies did spoil the party for a bit on shoot day but overall it came off great, thanks to some proper post production. A truly humorous script from the agency, freedom to execute it my way and some able production helming the project led to this hilarious piece.” Mohit Pasricha, Creative Director at Lowe Lintas, praises Poonam Wahi Films’ professionalism, “As a creative, all you need from a production house is for them to stand by you and provide the best possible support in terms of product quality, logistics, and timelines – that’s everything PWF brought to the table. Though they’re new on the block as a unit, they are hardcore advertising and production professionals. It turned out to be a smooth run in the rain with them. My thanks and best wishes to them for their future projects.” With Poonam Wahi Films’ captivating storytelling and Dollar Industries Limited’s latest rainwear collection, get ready to welcome the monsoon without hesitation!

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline May 22, 2024, 11:43 am Hyundai Motor Company (Hyundai Motor) today shared its hydrogen vision and introduced its U.S. clean logistics business powered by the company’s Class 8 XCIENT Fuel Cell electric truck at the Advanced Clean Transportation (ACT) Expo 2024. The company is exhibiting the XCIENT Fuel Cell truck and fuel cell system, along with digital exhibits, demonstrating the vehicle enhancement concept and its hydrogen value chain technologies, from May 20–23 at the Las Vegas Convention Center. Building a hydrogen society roadmap At Hyundai Motor’s press conference, Ken Ramirez, Executive Vice President and Head of Global Commercial Vehicle and Hydrogen Business at Hyundai Motor, highlighted the company’s commitment to building a hydrogen society. He spoke about the true value of hydrogen and how Hyundai Motor Group (the Group) is leveraging its affiliates’ cross-industry capabilities spanning the entire hydrogen value chain — from hydrogen production and storage to logistics, transport and diverse applications — to realize the company’s vision for a hydrogen society. Earlier this year, Hyundai Motor announced a vision for the HTWO brand’s expanding role in the hydrogen value chain, signaling that it will be the catalyst for a global energy transition. Hyundai Motor aims to realize its vision for a hydrogen society by leveraging the Group’s integrated capabilities across various industries. “Our HTWO brand’s expanding role reflects Hyundai’s unique reach beyond mobility into an integrated hydrogen value chain to lead the global energy transition,” Ramirez said. “We are like no other energy company with roots deeply grounded in mobility – and we are like no other mobility company with branches so far reaching into energy. Our mission has always been clear: leverage our strengths in both mobility and energy sectors to realize our vision for a hydrogen society.” Joining the presentation, Jim Park, Senior Vice President and Head of Commercial Vehicle and Hydrogen Business Development at Hyundai Motor North America, detailed the company’s rollout of its Class 8 XCIENT Fuel Cell electric trucks in key U.S. hydrogen logistics projects, including the NorCAL ZERO Project and Clean Logistics Project as further proof of the company’s commitment. Last year through the NorCAL ZERO Project, Hyundai Motor deployed 30 XCIENT Fuel Cell trucks at the Port of Oakland and Port of Richmond to haul freight containers and vehicles, marking the single largest commercial deployment of Class 8 heavy-duty hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks in North America. In Georgia, the company is working on the Clean Logistics Project at its Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA), to decarbonize the company’s production facility. “This landmark port decarbonization initiative in California serves as a prime example of how hydrogen trucks are paving the way towards sustainable future logistics,” Park said. “By replicating the success of NorCAL ZERO and tailoring it to specific customer needs, we at Hyundai aim to create a worldwide network of clean, hydrogen-powered operations.” Hyundai Motor is actively working to decarbonize its captive logistics through the Clean Logistics Project. This year, the company will take a significant step by deploying XCIENT Fuel Cell trucks to its facility in Georgia. This deployment will begin Hyundai Motor’s efforts to reduce emissions from its internal logistics operations. HTWO Logistics to bring clean solutions to HMGMA Glenn Clift, Executive Director of GLOVIS America, a leading logistics provider that shares Hyundai Motor’s hydrogen vision, joined the press conference as a guest speaker to introduce HTWO Logistics, a partnership for benchmarking in sustainable logistics solutions revolving around HMGMA. “Our clean logistics operation in Georgia deals specifically with reducing the carbon emission of inbound and outbound transportation around our new manufacturing facility,” Clift said. “Through HTWO Logistics, we will partner with Hyundai Motor in establishing a value chain of clean hydrogen production, supply, refueling and zero-emission vehicles to handle the logistics, creating a hydrogen mobility ecosystem in and around Georgia’s Metaplant.” Through this partnership, the two companies will leverage a comprehensive suite of HTWO solutions to maximize carbon emissions reduction. By gaining valuable insights from this project, the companies aim to replicate this success model globally, further expanding Hyundai Motor’s HTWO business. XCIENT Fuel Cell truck product enhancement concept In line with Hyundai Motor’s continuous dedication to customer-driven innovation, the company digitally previewed the enhancement concept of its XCIENT Fuel Cell truck. The enhancement concept videos on display show a 12.3-inch full y -digital instrument cluster, offering drivers clear and concise information at a glance, and a 12.3-inch touch screen infotainment system with physical buttons integrated into the center console for driver convenience. The display model also features a comprehensive suite of Hyundai Motor’s Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) designed to enhance vehicle safety and minimize driver fatigue. These enhancements include Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist (FCA), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Side Collision Avoidance Warning (SOD) and Smart Cruise Control (SCC). The company also introduced its collaboration with autonomous driving industry leader Plus to enhance road safety and freight efficiencies. The two companies are testing Level 4 autonomous driving technology on Hyundai Motor’s XCIENT Fuel Cell truck in the U.S., a first for a Class 8 fuel cell electric truck in the country. Hyundai Motor’s XCIENT Fuel Cell truck, equipped with Plus SuperDrive™ Level 4 autonomous driving technology, is on display at Plus’s ACT Expo booth (#2044). HTWO’s vision for hydrogen’s potential in the CV sector and beyond Widely regarded as a safe, clean and sustainable energy carrier, hydrogen is considered a perfect solution for commercial vehicles and logistics transportation due to its diverse advantages, including production, storage, logistics and refueling infrastructure. Hydrogen is a high-density energy carrier that allows fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) to provide a sustained power output suitable for long-haul driving and carrying heavy loads. Hyundai Motor’s XCIENT Fuel Cell truck, powered by its field-proven fuel cell system, is already a game changer and leads the FCEV market, with units in operation around the world, including in Europe, South Korea and North America. Hyundai Motor’s hydrogen fuel cell technology is already going beyond mobility into various applications, including stationary power, industrial equipment and, soon, electrolyzers. As announced at CES 2024, HTWO has evolved from a fuel cell system to a complete hydrogen value chain brand, integrating the Group’s capabilities across various industries. By leveraging its strength in the mobility and energy sectors, the Group is now uniquely positioned to offer holistic solutions spanning every stage of the hydrogen value chain. Moving upstream in the hydrogen value chain, the Group has developed pioneering methods for converting organic waste into hydrogen as part of its pilot project operating in Chungju, South Korea. By extracting biogas from food waste, hydrogen is created through an advanced process. This hydrogen is then supplied to an on-site hydrogen refueling station to power hydrogen vehicles. The Group will have another facility in Korea by the end of this year in which sewage sludge is transformed into hydrogen. The Group is also reviewing a hydrogen energy business model to integrate the whole value chain, from hydrogen production through plastic-to-hydrogen technology, to carbon capture, utilization, storage (CCUS), transportation, supply and applications. XCIENT Fuel Cell truck on display at ACT Expo 2024 The XCIENT Fuel Cell truck with a 6×4 drive axle configuration is on display at Hyundai Motor’s booth (#530, open to the public May 20-23) along with a hydrogen fuel cell system. The truck will be shown together with digital exhibits demonstrating the company’s HTWO Grid solutions and the enhancement concept of the XCIENT Fuel Cell truck. The company is also operating an XCIENT Fuel Cell truck test drive program at the Expo (May 21-22). Your email address will not be published.

Additionally, the steel-belted tyres provide superior stability and puncture resistance, crucial for the vehicle’s high-performance demands.

The all-new BMW R 1300 GS features an entirely new design which is based on the traditional GS icons while at the same time reflecting extreme compactness and significant weight reduction. With its significantly flatter tank ramp, the flyline is largely responsible for the very dynamic, light and accessible appearance of this motorcycle. Continuing on through the upholstered centre cover over the aluminium fuel tank, the seat gives the GS a typically enduro-style silhouette. A striking break with tradition in terms of design are the new LED Matrix Headlights . The integration of high beam and low beam in a single projector unit results in a redesign of the iconic face of the GS headlamp. With “ Headlight Pro ” available in all option Styles, the beam of the matrix full LED headlamp turns into the bend according to the banking position. The all-new BMW R 1300 GS perfectly embodies what the BMW Motorrad development team has endowed the GS legend with: compact arrangement of the components, high functionality of the equipment – and everything focused on the essentials. In Lightwhite solid paint and in conjunction with its sharply drawn lines and very clean appearance, the all-new R 1300 GS has a truly muscular appearance and embodies the boxer GS theme in pristine style. The compact and low front end, together with the Sport windshield and wide handlebars, provide an excellent overview, while the redefined GS ergonomics offer a confident, relaxed riding position.

Together with the main frame coated in Gold, the new cross spoke wheels delineate the lower section of the motorcycle against the light front body section, thereby highlighting its powerful appearance. The Optional Style Triple Black gives the all-new BMW R 1300 GS an even more masculine attitude The rear frame is likewise finished in black, as are most of the other surfaces. Also finished in black, the luggage carrier included in the Triple Black model variant is perfectly integrated in these shapes.

With red and white tapes and inscriptions combined with a rear frame in white metallic matt, the GS Trophy stands for the highest level of performance and sporty use off-road. The high rider’s comfort seat in combination with the Sport passenger seat offers the look and ergonomics of a rally seat, which in conjunction with the seat cover continued on the fuel tank cover forms a unit that can be used along its entire length. In the spirit of outstanding off-road competence, this optional style is equipped with radiator guards for damage protection. The robust cross-spoke wheels in gold also belong to the range of off-road-oriented fittings. The all-new BMW R 1300 GS shows its exclusive and technically sophisticated side in the Option 719 Tramuntana . This combines cross-spoke wheels in gold with black components such as the main and rear frames, powertrain and the luggage carrier with grab handle. The gold anodised handlebar provides the perfect accentuation to match the gold-coloured lining on the body components and the gold rim bands. The side trim sections and the front wheel cover at the top are finished in Aurelius Green metallic, while the aluminium tank and intake silencer cover are likewise finished in Aurelius Green metallic but with a matt clear coating. The fuel tank centre cover in Luxor black/grey and the cylinder head covers in Avus black metallic matt blend in harmoniously with this.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline May 09, 2024, 12:54 pm Percept Live, creators of Asia’s largest dance music festival ‘Sunburn’ and India’s first BDM show ‘Bollyboom’, has announced a tie up with ‘SRGMS’ – a unique rock musical show specially written and performed for kids aged 8 years and below. ‘SRGMS’, the first ever Rock Band created exclusively for kids, is the brainchild of Chin2 Bhosle, grandson of the legendary music artist Asha Bhosle, and part of India’s first and very successful boy band ‘A Band of Boys’. The premiere ‘SRGMS’ show is scheduled for Sunday, 19th May 2024, at the sprawling 1,00,000 sq. ft. ‘Museum of Solutions’ (MuSo) experiential venue designed exclusively by the JSW group for children, located in Lower Parel, Mumbai. The inaugural edition of the ‘SRGMS’ Music Concert will see a power packed, hour long, interactive rock show wherein artists will perform songs, dances, share values and present a fun-filled craft activity, all along ensuring that the young audience is engaged, entertained and grooving on their feet throughout the entire performance. With a promise of ‘Music, Masti & Magic’, the Rock Musical show will focus on pre-schoolers with an aim to educate, aid development, impart values, social awareness and safety consciousness through the immersive and engaging platform of music. The Rock Band ‘SRGMS’ will present a medley of songs encompassing everything from popular nursery rhymes to original songs, that are fun and educational, such as ‘Doctors Are Wonderful People’, ‘Dance Like Monkeys’, ‘Help The Policeman’, ‘Covering Your Nose And Mouth When You Sneeze’, and many more fun numbers. Chin2 Bhosle, the founder and creator of the ‘SRGMS’ Rock band, has been writing music learning curriculum for over a decade now, was a member of the famous ‘A Band of Boys’ boy band, has launched one of India’s most astute music learning apps ‘PaDhaNiSa’ with India’s oldest music label Saregama, and teaches music too. Some of his music creations for kids on YouTube have amassed over 200 Million views in under 2 years! Said Chin2 Bhosle, Founder, SRGMS, “In a country steeped in Bollywood music, I realized that almost all of the Bollywood songs are not age appropriate and I strongly believe that young children should not be singing and dancing to songs that are mostly oozing sexuality, machismo or romantic associations. Kids deserve their own curated brand of music, and in the magical high-octane world of ‘SRGMS’, parents can be rest assured, that they will always be exposed to age appropriate content to facilitate their growth, values and knowledge curve.” Said Ajay Upadhyay, Director, Percept Limited , “Today’s kids are immersed in a fast paced world of learning through multiple technology gadgets, yet their unique way of viewing the world around them with wonder and awe hasn’t changed, and music is one of the fastest ways to garner their limited attention span. From our experience of creating youth music Intellectual Properties like ‘Sunburn’ and ‘Bollyboom’, we have seen that nothing cuts through boundaries, cultures, demographies and geographies faster than music. Through SRGMS, India’s very first Rock Band created for kids, we aim to enable young minds to explore, interact, relate to and grow through a fun, interactive, music-centric approach. And with India being home to the world’s youngest population, the potential for music events curated exclusively for children is massive!” The current gamut of songs in the SRGMS fold have been created in English. Going forward, SRGMS will be creating multiple language versions that will include Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Kannada, and Marathi. With the Rock Band ‘SRGMS’, learning and growing has never been so much fun!

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Dec 06, 2023, 12:21 pm Rapido, India’s leading commute app, renowned for its innovative and affordable two-wheeler and auto-rickshaw services, has announced its strategic entry into the cab business. The cab launch represents the latest step in Rapido’s mission to revolutionize urban mobility and ensure an affordable intra-city solution for all commuting needs. By diversifying its offerings, Rapido aims to become the go-to platform for a wide range of commuting needs, providing an affordable platform for commuters while benefiting captains. Accessible to all cab captains operating across the country, these services are designed to promote entrepreneurship, fostering a sustainable livelihood for drivers. Beyond empowering drivers, the focus extends to customer affordability, offering cabs at the lowest price to make transportation more accessible for all. With a commanding 60% market share in bike taxis, Rapido expands its footprint with the pan-India launch of Rapido Cabs, introducing an initial fleet of 1 lakh vehicles. Expressing his excitement about this latest milestone, Pavan Guntupalli, co-founder of Rapido, said , “We are incredibly excited to introduce Rapido Cabs pan India following the immense success of our bike taxi and auto services across the country.Our innovative SaaS-based platform revolutionizes the conventional commission system for drivers, tackling the persistent challenge of commission sharing with aggregators. This pioneering approach ensures that drivers incur only a minimal software usage fee, marking a significant shift in the industry.” He added, “It also prioritizes customers by ensuring lowest price guarantee and making our services exceptionally affordable for all.” Rapido Cabs distinguishes itself through an innovative SaaS-based platform featuring a cutting-edge, zero-commission model for cab captains—an outstanding hallmark of our service. The SaaS-based platform serves as a seamless mediator, exclusively connecting drivers and customers without exerting control over the marketplace. Within the Rapido ecosystem, drivers enjoy direct payment from customers, free from any interference by Rapido. Nevertheless, to sustain this model and continue delivering exceptional service, drivers are required to pay a nominal subscription fee. As an illustration, upon reaching earnings of Rs 10,000 from the Rapido app, drivers will be subject to a modest subscription fee of Rs 500. This pioneering approach ensures that drivers receive the entirety of their service value, empowering them to maximize their earning potential. Simultaneously, passengers benefit from competitive fares in the Cab segment, as the all-encompassing SaaS-based platform consolidates various commuting solutions into a single, user-friendly app. Rapido’s expansion into cab services is a strategic move to meet the diverse commuting needs of its ever-growing user base while driving business growth and expansion.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jan 16, 2024, 11:29 am Coca-Cola India and India’s largest retailer, Reliance Retail, announced the launch of a sustainability initiative titled “Bhool Na Jana, Plastic Bottle Lautana” , focused on post-consumer PET collection at Reliance Retail stores in Mumbai through Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs) and collection bins. With a vision for a circular economy, this pilot project, aligned with the Government’s Swachh Bharat Mission, has commenced in 36 Reliance Retail stores including Smart Bazaar and Sahakari Bhandar stores in Mumbai and Delhi, and will expand to 200 stores across the country by 2025 with a target of collecting 5,00,000 PET bottles annually in the pilot phase. The initiative was launched in the presence of K azi Irfan, Officer on Special Duty (OSD), Solid Waste Management, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), at Reliance Retail’s Smart Bazaar store in Santa Cruz. The installed RVMs and collection bins will give consumers a convenient way to deposit used PET bottles in exchange for compelling discounts on Coca-Cola India products. The disposed PET bottles will be collected and recycled by Reliance Industries (RIL), a leader in the recycling of polyester and plastics. This initiative will facilitate smooth waste collection by engaging consumers in responsible waste management – transitioning away from a traditional linear economy. Speaking on the launch, Mr. Damodar Mall, Chief Executive Officer, Grocery Retail, Reliance Retail Ltd, said, “ Indian families have had the habit of not trashing milk pouches, plastic bottles, even newspapers, daily. We clean, collect them, and hand them over to raddiwalas, who in today’s world are the unique front-end army of recyclers. SmartBazaar, as a modern retailer continues to encourage this habit, with modern methods. Our pilot with our store shoppers, with the support of Coca-Cola India and Reliance Industries, is one such attempt we plan to pursue with our wide network of stores .” Ms. Greishma Singh, Vice President – Customer and Commercial Leadership, Coca‑Cola India and Southwest Asia said, “Through this partnership and platform, we are delighted that we can generate awareness and give shoppers a convenient and engaging way to recycle their PET bottles in return for compelling offers while they are shopping at Reliance stores. Partnerships such as this one built around consumer-centric ideas, we believe, can be a powerful multiplier for progress on collection, recycling, and reuse.” Mr. Hemant D Sharma, President – Growth and Strategy, Polyester, RIL , said , “Reliance stands as a trailblazer in sustainability and circularity, leading India’s charge in transforming waste into valuable resources. Recycling 2 billion PET bottles annually, with a plan to scale it to 5 billion, RIL epitomizes a commitment to sustainability that predates current trends and sets the standard for eco-friendly manufacturing. For over two decades, RIL has championed recycling post-consumer PET bottles, demonstrating a foresighted dedication to a greener, circular future.” This initiative is a key step toward Coca-Cola’s commitment to collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of the packaging the company produces as part of its World Without Waste strategy. It will act as an anchor, retaining the sustainability momentum activated by Coca-Cola India’s ‘Return and Recycle’ initiative in collaboration with Zepto which has witnessed participation from 50,000 households in India and the successful RVM installations across 75 cities in the country, collecting 1 Tonne of PET waste.

    "article_content": "By Team MI Jun 16, 2022, 16:17 pm An innovative out-of-home campaign by Samsung for its brand-new Split ACs with WindFree technology is executed by Cheil India in association with Platinum Outdoor, a unit of Madison World. The new technology which is the highlight of this innovation, delivers powerful yet gentle cooling with 23000 micro holes. Following a two-year pandemic-mandated lockdown, the objective of the activity was to capitalize on bringing out the best through OOH innovation and a huge revival of outdoor commute by placing large hoardings and branding at high traffic areas. The idea of driving massive visibility and reach for the brand this summer comes out really well through this flawlessly planned campaign by Cheil India. The campaign covers four cities across India, including Jaipur, Pune, Ahmedabad, and Kolkata. Samsung ‘s bright and eye-catching billboards have been placed in prominent, high traffic locations in each city, targeting high footfall locations and commuter areas. To creatively impact consumers, a large scale backlit cut out of AC was executed with a magnifying lens that magnifies the micro holes in the AC. The magnifying lens and AC were both backlit. “Samsung WindFree powerful gentle cooling” was highlighted with acrylic letters. With the use of blue ice as a backdrop in the creatives, the campaign intended to depict a cool environment because of the ACs. Samsung’s extensive one month campaign includes bright, LED-lit creatives visible on highways. With this clever, creative and striking outdoor campaign for Samsung, the brand has positioned itself to become a hot topic of conversation by discussing the importance of micro holes for clean and cool air in our homes. Ankur Kapoor, Product Marketing Head, AC business, Samsung , “Our latest range of premium WindFree™ air conditioners addresses consumers’ evolved home cooling needs and works efficiently by dispersing cool air through 23,000 micro holes. The new line-up is designed to give highest level of comfort by creating a still air environment, along with powerful cooling. We used innovative out of home hoardings to create awareness in key markets and it enabled us to connect with the right target audience for this product range,” said. Durba Mandal, (Head – OOH Business), Cheil India said, “At Cheil India , we believe in creating both value and impact for Samsung with our focused planning approach. The brief from Samsung for its brand-new Split ACs with WindFree technology was very precise, i.e. to use the OOH format innovatively and highlight the technology feature of the newly launched range and I am glad we carried out the campaign flawlessly.” Dipankar Sanyal, CEO, Platinum Outdoor and MRP said, “We have been collaborating with Cheil for Samsung for over a decade now. It has always been our endeavor to create great work for our clients both on creative and planning using our Madison proprietary tools for sharper targeting. We are extremely happy to see our idea of bringing alive the various aspects of Samsung’s split AC with wind free technology on strategically located billboards.” Platinum Outdoor is a part of Madison World that operates several brands in OOH including MOMS, Platinum Outdoor, Activation specialist – Madison TURNT, Rural specialist – Anugrah Madison and Retail Specialist – MRP. Platinum Outdoor handles marquee clients like Tata Motors, Vi, Parle Agro, Campus Shoes, VIP Bags, Jockey amongst many others. Platinum Outdoor is a part of Madison World, India’s largest homegrown communication agency established in 1988. Madison World through its 11 Units served last year, as many as 500 Advertisers.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Oct 05, 2023, 10:35 am UNICEF Executive Director, Catherine Russell joined UNICEF India National Ambassador Ayushmann Khurrana, government officials, the private sector and young people at the launch of an innovative, digital YouthHub app to connect young people in India to future job opportunities, especially girls and marginalised youth. The platform, which functions as a digital ecosystem , was jointly launched by them along with Mr. Shombi Sharp (United Nations Resident Coordinator in India), Smt. Meeta Rajivlochan (Hon’ble Secretary, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports), Ms. Cynthia McCaffrey (Representative, UNICEF India), Mr. Ashwin Yardi (CEO, Capgemini India), Mr. Ranen Banerjee (Government Sector Leader, PwC India), Ms. Vandana Bahri (Head, Skills and Livelihood, Children’s Investment Fund Foundation – CIFF India), Ms. Dhuwarakha Sriram (Chief of YuWaah, Youth Development, and Partnerships at UNICEF), Mr. Abhishek Gupta (COO, YuWaah at UNICEF) and two young leaders – Ms. Zakira Ganji and Ms. Jagriti Pandey. The YouthHub – co-created by YuWaah at UNICEF, PwC India, Capgemini, and CIFF – aims to connect young people to curated jobs, skills, and volunteering opportunities, and enable access especially for girls and youth from marginalised backgrounds. In its first phase, which was launched on Tuesday, the YouthHub app has become accessible to young individuals via the Google Playstore. Serving as a unified platform, it offers free access to aggregated job opportunities in nine Indian languages, simplifying the job search process for young people: http://bit.ly/youthhubapp Intersecting technology and innovation, the hub is a ‘one-stop’ application that integrates diverse platforms, tools, and resources, which aggregates curated economic opportunities for young people. The launch of the YouthHub marks a significant step in convening public, private, and youth partners to foster a generation of informed and skilled young people who can transition well from learning to earning. Ms. Russell is visiting India this week to meet with government officials, members of the private sector as well as young people, children and some of India’s frontline community workers. UNICEF Executive Director, Catherine Russell, said: “Investing in children and youth is the best way to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals and create a brighter future for generations to come. Collaborative initiatives such as this YouthHub are a good way to reduce inequalities and ensure that girls are included and have access to future job opportunities. We can create a lasting impact when young people are involved in decision-making and when their voices are heard.” Ayushmann Khurrana, Bollywood star and UNICEF India National Ambassador said, “Being a UNICEF India National Ambassador has allowed me to peek into the lives, dreams, and hurdles faced by the children and young people of our country. They are our future, and ensuring they have a fair shot at success is not just a choice, it’s our duty. YouthHub app by YuWaah at UNICEF and partners is like a script for success for every young person in India. It’s not just a platform; it’s a dream factory that opens up doors to economic, skilling, and volunteering opportunities. But it’s much more than that. It’s a symbol of hope and the belief that every youngster, no matter their gender or background, deserves a shot at greatness. And we begin with equal opportunities for all. That’s what the YouthHub app will extend to young people.” Smt. Meeta Rajivlochan (Hon’ble Secretary, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports) said, “ In India, today’s youth require physical platforms to access more economic opportunities and fully realize their potential and passion. UNICEF and private sector agencies have been collaborating with us in the past and collaboration with multiple agencies, is important to increasing outreach and to fostering youth empowerment .” Ms. Cynthia McCaffrey, Representative, UNICEF India : “India has the largest population of young people in the world. Our mission is to give them the tools to drive change themselves and reach 300 million people by 2030 through all our initiatives spanning across access to economic and skilling opportunities, innovation, entrepreneurship, civic engagement, and volunteering. We have already fostered meaningful connections with over 65.5 million young people and these numbers represent lives transformed, dreams ignited, and communities strengthened and a better world in the making. YouthHub converges our efforts through YuWaah into a ‘hub’ for young people across the country which would help open doors to economic opportunities for the underserved communities.” Mr. Sanjeev Krishan, Chairperson, PwC in India said, “It is an honour to be a part of this transformative single-window platform to address young people’s socio-economic needs. This platform was envisioned because of co-creation between PwC and YuWaah (Generation Unlimited in India at UNICEF) back in 2019, where we had three key motivations: youth centrality, scale, and innovation. PwC takes pride in the fact that we have helped develop the blue book for the platform and have supported the creation of this platform. ” Ashwin Yardi, CEO – India, Capgemini said, “Capgemini is delighted to have co-created the YouthHub platform in partnership with YuWaah at UNICEF and PwC India. Serving as the co-chair of the YuWaah board in India, I have personally witnessed the inspiring passion, unwavering resilience, and boundless potential of young individuals. Their invaluable insights have been pivotal in shaping the development of this platform, a true collaboration designed to meet their unique needs. I am confident that our partnership will thrive as we remain steadfast in our dedication to innovation, ensuring that meaningful solutions touch the lives of every young individual. “ Ms. Manjula Singh, Executive Director, India Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) said, “ We, at CIFF, believe that when girls and young women are connected with the right force multipliers education, right skills and opportunities for income generation, they are able to navigate multiple barriers they face in their journey to adulthood and gain agency for their life choices among many others. Therefore, for us, investing in girls and young women is not just a moral imperative but also a strategic imperative to contribute to the Government’s vision for women-led development. Through YouthHub, we are working towards bringing a digital transformation in the lives of over a million young women by empowering them with access to a platform that aggregates job opportunities, fostering connections to 21st-century skills and socio-economic prospects.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Oct 12, 2023, 12:45 pm The stories of normal lives were never meant to be threatened by theft. Moreover, our stories are so different yet dear to each of us. Yes, they are unique in the manner they are told and because they are a part of our lives. In the past few weeks, we learned how photo blogging sites, Humans of Bombay and People of India, crawl upon other’s content to gain momentum in their business, which eventually led to copyright infringement cases. The story started with an Indian photoblog, Humans of Bombay (HOB), finding some of their content being used by the People of India (POI). It led to a copyright infringement lawsuit against the People of India. The latter was accused of copying the former’s content, including images and videos, without their consent. On the contrary, the People of India accused their rival of copying content from the US-based photo blogging site Humans of New York (HONY). The matter took a reverse turn when Humans of New York’s founder, Brandon Stanton, confirmed this using Twitter (now X), claiming Humans of Bombay to have copied content and business models from them. I’ve stayed quiet on the appropriation of my work because I think @HumansOfBombay shares important stories, even if they’ve monetized far past anything I’d feel comfortable doing on HONY. But you can’t be suing people for what I’ve forgiven you for. https://t.co/0jZM05YyTt — Brandon Stanton (@humansofny) September 23, 2023 The platform, POI, also claimed that HOB publishes similar content as other storytelling sites in India. They also claimed that the platform is not unique in terms of content. They further clarified that it’s not copyright because people share similar stories on various platforms. Earlier in September, The Delhi High Court summoned both the parties for the presence of identical content. In a verdict, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday said that there is no copyright infringement for ideas. The single bench of Justice Pratibha M Singh has stated that both the storytelling platforms are prohibited from sharing each other’s original images, articles and ways to present the picture; it should be unique on each platform. However, the bench also stated that if the same pictures are shared by users voluntarily, it would not count as a copyright infringement. On 11 th October, Karishma Mehta, Founder and CEO of storytelling platform Humans of Bombay, penned an open letter stating, “I would like to offer my story, as a duty towards our community to present the truth, now that the Hon’ble Court has passed its order.” I would like to start by saying something that I’ve said on numerous occasions in the past, over the last decade: that we have been inspired by HONY, and will always be grateful to them for showing us what storytelling can do for a community. Our legal case, however, was not about inspiration, but in fact, about – as the Delhi High Court termed it – “substantial imitation”. She writes. Our story pic.twitter.com/vg04Re16rp — Humans Of Bombay (@HumansOfBombay) October 11, 2023 “When the plagiarism first came to our notice, we reported it to Meta. This led to 16 of their posts, which were plagiarized from us, being taken down by Meta. However, it didn’t stop the plagiarism, even after we tried to resolve the matter amicably. We were left with no option but to lean on legal counsel. To that end, we’re extremely grateful to the Delhi High Court, as they have upheld our contentions and passed a permanent injunction, restraining the defendant from plagiarizing our literary works and creative expressions. It has also upheld our view that we have never sought to monopolize the story writing format, but only sought protection in relation to our expression which is created by and/or on behalf of us.” “The outcome of this case will set a precedent for the creator community, and will hopefully go a long way in safeguarding the original content that creators work so hard to build. And finally, yes, Humans of Bombay is a business; that’s something we have never hidden. While some may choose to monetize stories through mediums like books and subscription platforms, we have chosen to do it primarily through meaningful campaigns with partner brands. To this date, what motivates me and my team to work extremely hard is our love for storytelling – because we’ve witnessed how the stories we’ve told over the last 10 years have had a lasting cultural impact.” Keeping her facts right, she continues to tell the story of her side in the letter. “The last few weeks have taught me a lot, and for those learnings, I am eternally grateful. These lessons, undoubtedly, will shape the person I will become, of that I am certain. Like any young entrepreneur – I may have made mistakes, but I will continue to learn, to grow, and to evolve. Your collective feedback is not lost on me.” Humans of Bombay was founded by Karishma Mehta in 2014 with the aim of showcasing extraordinary, inspirational, and relatable stories of individuals from diverse backgrounds and walks of life. The platform has a community of over 5+ million people and has shared more than 6,000 stories to date. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Priti Singh Oct 17, 2023, 13:17 pm Come August brings the gleeful time of the year as we indulge in all our festivals. India, being a land of diversity, celebrates individual culture and tradition. Foods, clothes, jewelleries, and everything adds to that festive enthusiasm, making the perfect timing for the brands to create an imprint among consumers and expand their reach. Usually, brands this time of the year plan many sales and offers to allure customers and enhance sales. What makes this year a distinguished one? Let’s hop on. According to a report by Axis My India , 23% of people expect to shop more during the festive season this year. Companies try to tap that need to earn more revenue and eventually a faithful customer. Companies exercise their brand advertisements in a way that resonates with the emotions and minds of the consumers. They release particular promotional messages to expand their reach. Across the nation, this is a time for joy. Various regions will experience surges during festivities, from Durga Puja to Christmas. While Navratri, Karva Chauth, and Diwali are peak shopping periods for North & West, East experiences a similar uptick during the months leading up to Pujo. And North-East, a big market for us, sees it post November and up to Christmas. Says Romita Mazumdar, Founder of Foxtale. Some of the popular methods to expand reach during the festive seasons are: Khushboo Sethi, Jisora says that high inflation can affect the festive season from a retail landscape perspective. Inflation can typically increase the price of goods and services, ultimately affecting customers’ purchasing power. A shift can also be seen in the purchasing behavior of the consumers. They may focus on essential items rather than discretionary or luxury items. Retailers may also have to adjust their pricing strategies to attract customers. And all these are ultimately effecting the sales and performance of the brand. Indeed, inflation has affected the market. It has led consumers to seek more value for their money and prioritize affordability. Sleepyhead benefits from this trend as we offer quality products at affordable prices. Our brand positioning targets consumers looking for value-for-money home and living solutions. We have observed an increase in such consumers and have effectively tapped into this segment. Says Deepti Karthik, Fractional Chief Marketing Officer of Sleepyhead. Speaking of festive brand campaigns, Foxtale’s collaboration with actress Jennifer Winget for our first Festive campaign can further forecast rapid growth and increase brand equity and recall in the festive season. The Indian direct-to-consumer market is unquestionably rising, with skincare significantly influencing. Adds Romita Mazumdar, Foxtale. Jisora’s latest festival collection boasts a range of stylish fabrics like muslin and cotton, known for their comfort and breathability. At Jisora, we’ve focused on curating comfortable silhouettes that offer a modern twist to traditional ethnic wear. Our designs can be styled creatively, allowing you to express your unique fashion sense. The unique prints from Jisora are chosen to exude festive vibes, adding an extra touch of celebration to your ensemble. Above all, our collection seamlessly blends comfort and style, ensuring you feel relaxed and chic during the festivities. Says Khushboo Sethi, Jisora. In conclusion, Festivals bring bonding, love, cross-cultural exchange, and happiness among people. They represent unity and encourage social bonding. Festivals in India have certain religious connotations attached to them; Indians celebrate these with all their heart to please their deities and bring positivity and happiness to their lives. Festivals are an integral part of Indian culture that brings people together despite religious divisions. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Jan 10, 2024, 12:49 pm In a blooming world of technology, the thriving contestant is GAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence), followed by VR (Virtual Reality) and neuromarketing. These ever-evolving technologies have already disrupted businesses across industries to the core of their nature of business and working modules. As one of the key factors of businesses, marketing is always considered dynamic in nature and adapts to new technologies and consumer preferences. But are we really new to AI? Businesses leverage a spectrum of tech adaptations in a highly competitive digital landscape for sustained relevance. AI is not a new phenomenon in the field of marketing. In fact, AI has been used for various marketing purposes for decades, such as data analysis, customer segmentation, content generation, and advertising. However, with the rapid advancement of AI technology and the availability of large amounts of data, AI has emerged as a pivotal enabler for marketers, revolutionizing how businesses understand and engage with their target audience. Venugopal Ganganna, CEO, Langoor “From analysing customer behaviour and preferences to provide product recommendations to improve the customer experience, to using predictive analytics to understand and anticipate consumer behaviour, to delivering tailored content to individuals based on their interests and engagement history, to estimating the lifetime value of a customer – brands can effectively leverage predictive AI to enhance their strategies, improve decision making, and optimize their campaigns.” Says Venugopal Ganganna, CEO, Langoor. Speaking about the use cases of the technologies being used by a business, Saurabh Srivastava, VP Marketing, foundit elaborates: At the awareness stage, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) create immersive brand experiences, capturing consumer attention in unprecedented ways. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have become integral in optimizing targeting, personalization, and predictive analytics, enhancing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. In the consideration stage, Chatbots and conversational AI redefine customer interactions, providing real-time engagement and personalized assistance. Interactive content, leveraging technologies like interactive videos and quizzes, fosters deeper connections with audiences, leading to more informed purchasing decisions. Moving to the decision and action stages, Blockchain is gaining traction for enhancing transparency and security in transactions, particularly in e-commerce. Augmented analytics empowers marketers with actionable insights, enabling data-driven decision-making for campaign optimization and ROI maximization. Every business should embrace data for personalized customer experiences, regardless of the sector. Implement advanced personalization tools to create tailored consumer experiences, enhancing engagement and building brand loyalty. Businesses can also adapt technologies such as social commerce and e-commerce integrations. As per Siddhartha Vanvani, Founder & CEO of Digidarts, the biggest challenges of emerging tech and AI interface are: “Considering the current scenario, ethical challenges and regulatory issues about data privacy and transparency pose major setbacks. Additionally, the lack of proper infrastructure and high implementation costs are significant obstacles preventing businesses from embracing emerging technologies. Inaccurate and inadequate data are also a matter of concern as they challenge the business data as unsuitable for AI applications.” Says Ranjan Kumar, Co-founder & CEO, Entropik while adding on to the topic. While talking about the opportunities with tech/ AI interface, Sandeep Saini, VP-Growth, Team Pumpkin said, “Instead of being seen as a human replacement it could be considered as a supporting tool. One of the significant opportunities that AI brings ahead is enhanced customer experience. AI powered features such as chat bots or virtual assistants are making the interactions personalised yet optimised. Furthermore, the integration of AI could foster innovation and uniqueness, providing businesses with a competitive edge. Statistics indicate that more than 77% of businesses are exploring the use of AI. A figure that is expected to rise further.” The future of marketing lies in a holistic integration of technologies, creating a seamless and personalized customer journey. Russhabh R Thakkar, Founder and CEO, Frodoh World The evolving tech landscape will introduce new platforms and mediums for marketing, requiring businesses to stay agile and adapt to emerging trends. Says Russhabh R Thakkar, Founder and CEO, Frodoh World. “With the use of AI across several key industries, including tech, automotives, healthcare, edtech, etc., the future of AI has already started to take form. Prominent companies such as Tesla, Amazon, and Google are integrating artificial intelligence capabilities into their offerings to enhance consumer interaction. With technological advancements in AI, Google’s Gemini directly handles a range of input types (audio, images, video and text) and can directly output them too.” Explores Sandeep Saini, VP-Growth, Team Pumpkin. In the realm of marketing, AI could be leveraged not only while crafting innovative strategies or campaigns but to resonate with audiences, obtain insightful data, and establish a smooth customer journey. Successful businesses are those agile enough to adapt and leverage these tech innovations, positioning themselves as pioneers in a rapidly evolving landscape.

To mark this success, the Managing Editor of Moneycontrol, Nalin Mehta on Monday addressed the entire Moneycontrol team in an email, congratulating them for beating a major competitor. “We are now 4x more than ET in time spent, more than double its size in page views and well ahead of it in unique viewers.

Explaining the editorial strategy, he added, “We are strengthening our foundations for where we want to be as an essential must-have tool for anyone interested in Indian markets and business. This means a lot more exclusives, big interviews, more depth in our coverage, a wider news lens, and really upping our game in news writing for a fast-expanding digital audience.” Mehta expressed confidence about the opportunities in the new year, as he termed it a ‘big news year’. “We have a big news year coming up, with the general elections and tailwinds in the economy. We have started 2024 with a bang. But this is just the beginning! We have a tremendous opportunity here to redefine business news in India and the wider news media market.” he concluded. Moneycontrol recently launched a 360 degree ‘Indian Business ka King Kaun’ campaign to announce its leadership in the digital business news space. As part of this, Moneycontrol issued a front page ad in the Indian Express on January 29. The campaign will also go live on trade media, social and TV. *The mail has been accessed by Media Infoline.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Mar 09, 2024, 10:58 am International Women’s Day (IWD) is a global celebration that transcends mere dates on the calendar. On this luminous canvas of March 8, we brush strokes of reverence, resilience, and revolution. It’s a day when the world tilts its axis toward the remarkable tapestry of womankind. IWD isn’t just about bouquets and platitudes – it’s a symphony of voices echoing across continents. This day unfurls like a vintage map, tracing the contours of progress. It’s a call to arms—a reminder that our battles are shared. We stand shoulder to shoulder, weaving a tapestried bridge across generations. We honor the unsung heroines , the ones who whispered courage into the night, who cradled dreams in calloused palms. So, let’s raise our voices. Let’s clink glasses. Let’s honor the pioneers and the trailblazers , the ones who dared to dream beyond the confines of convention. This year, we thought of celebrating the occasion with some of the leading women voices, who marked their way through hardships; Women who adorn their tiara in the ‘man’s world’; Women who celebrate their roots and unwavering courage; Women who pick themselves up even in the murkiest time. Our first spokesperson is – Piali Dasgupta , Senior Vice President – Marketing, Columbia Pacific Communities And the second one is – Sujala Martis Director, Consumer Marketing – Platinum Guild International (PGI), India Piali: To work really hard because there is no short cut to success, unfortunately. The other advice was to “cut your coat according to your cloth.” To live within our means, and maintain a lifestyle that we could sustain, as opposed to overspending to keep up with the Jones’. Piali: In my 17+ years of corporate life, I have often noticed that many people in positions of power don’t really deserve to be there both from a competency, skillsets as well as an impact point of view. Some people are just plain lucky, and others indulge in filthy politics and manipulation to get to the top and often remain there. This is hugely detrimental to businesses in the long run and to teams that don’t go very far despite utmost dedication and hard work. Sujala: We have made great strides socially and I want to believe that we’re on this path to progress, but the news is a constant reminder that there is indeed a long way to go. I don’t think it’s possible to name just one challenge, it’s an extremely potent combination of issues from women’s safety to systemic violence to unequal access of opportunity all forming a web of interconnected obstacles. Sexual harassment and violence persist, fuelled by societal tolerance, the lack of legal recourse, and the difficulty of reporting. Girls face educational barriers, and women struggle for financial independence. At a base level bodily autonomy remains threatened even today. The challenges women face stem from the power imbalances society poses injecting vulnerability and fragility into the lives of many women. Piali: Hard, exhausting and demanding. Women work a lot harder, get paid a lot lesser, in most cases and are constantly trying to over deliver just to keep their jobs. Assertive, competent and outspoken women at work are mostly looked at as a threat, and they do have it the hardest. Sujala: It’s heartening to witness the shift – more women are stepping into roles of influence and authority. On a personal note, I realise I have been lucky, I have been able to succeed in my journey because I had strong allies and a great support system that helped me overcome challenges that came my way. But the stark facts hit home sometimes, the 2022-23 Periodic Labour Force Survey revealed that just 37% of the country’s women above 15 years of age are either working or seeking or are available for work, compared with 78.5% for males. There are many explicit and implicit challenges a woman faces in the workplace. At the root of it, is perhaps a lack of confidence, self-doubt that results in an imposter syndrome at the workplace. Even gender bias that can manifest in many ways from restricting access at the outset, to the glass ceiling, to typecasting and even labelling. It’s a long journey of perseverance and resilience, where every small victory can bring us closer to breaking down barriers and redefining the professional landscape for women. Piali: Look out for yourself first; stand up for yourself (because no one else will) and never compromise on self-respect.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Mar 12, 2024, 17:54 pm Let’s picture this: A young woman, armed with nothing but an idea and a heart full of courage, as she steps into the entrepreneurial arena. She defies societal norms, sidesteps skepticism, and carries a bag brimming with hope and possibility. This is the genesis of women’s entrepreneurship – a tale of audacious beginnings. Entrepreneurship knows no gender, yet women face unique challenges. Their striding path is rather based on biases, stereotypes, and glass ceilings. Women know their entrepreneurial canvas is textured with challenges, yet they brushstroke it with colours that are worth the narrative. The common challenges include Juggling with different roles, Gender barriers and jobs, Financial challenges, and much more. But are we ready yet as a society and country at large to assume a women leader? The organizations talk about gender neutrality and diminishing gender biases in the premises. It’s promising to see more women excelling in their fields and pursuing their passions, however, I believe we’re just a fraction of the population. Says Garima Arora, Founder & Executive Producer of Entourage Films & Co-Founder of Nammyoho Daan . While there’s progress with more girls receiving education, there’s still so much ground to cover. Inching more towards the subject, Udita Bansal, Founder, of trueBrowns , says “I acknowledge the strides made in breaking gender barriers and fostering a more inclusive environment for women-led ventures.” However, I’ve recognized the persistent challenges that women entrepreneurs face, including access to funding, gender bias, and balancing work-life responsibilities. I feel that while there has been significant advancement, there is still much work to be done to level the playing field and ensure equal opportunities for all. While building trueBrowns, I believe that starting a business with a woman’s perspective requires a nuanced understanding of female consumers’ desires, challenges, and aspirations. Key elements include designing products that cater to women’s needs while embracing diversity and inclusivity in sizing, styles, and messaging. Creating a supportive workplace culture that values women’s voices, promotes work-life balance, and offers opportunities for leadership and growth is crucial. I emphasise the importance of building a brand identity rooted in authenticity, storytelling, and community engagement, fostering strong connections with women consumers. Underlines Udita. Additionally, prioritising growth and ethical practices in sourcing, production, and business operations align with the values of many women entrepreneurs and customers. By integrating these elements into the business strategy, I have faith that entrepreneurs can establish a brand that resonates with women, drives positive social impact, and achieves long-term success in the market. The government’s support for women, through funding and networking opportunities, is invaluable. However, individual efforts remain equally crucial. Nammyoho Daan, co-founded by myself and Ness Wadia, holds a significant place in my life. It drives our passion to empower and provide a holistic development for girls and women. Says Garima. Ensuring equal access to education and supporting women to flourish and make an impact, personally and professionally. The progress that women have achieved is a testament to our collective potential. The journey might be long but one of great importance. Nevertheless, the number of female workers has fairly grown over the past decade. As per the Periodic Labour Force Survey Report 2022-23, women’s labour force participation rate has increased by 4.2% pointing to 37% in 2023. Somehow, this signifies overall progress in society at large. Let’s hope this burgeoning statistic continues to grow observing women entrepreneurs. Having said that, there are plenty of jobs yet to be concluded on the government’s part that enhance the participation of women in the entrepreneurial journey.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Apr 20, 2024, 19:10 pm When it comes to nurturing our little humans, we tend to roll around entrusting brands like Nestlé. But what happens when the brand itself is under a ‘sweet’ veil depriving a whole generation? Let’s delve deeper into the story of the top baby food and cereal brand, Nestlé, and its fondness for a not-so-innocent ingredient – sugar. A recent update took Nestlé and its baby food products to the spotlight across Asia , Africa, and Latin America. A report by Swiss NGO, Public Eye, and the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) has unearthed disconcerting findings about the brand. Nestlé baby products in less developed countries, including India, Africa, and Latin America, contain higher sugar content compared to other parts of the world including Europe and the UK. Sugar – As we all are aware can cause several diseases if consumed on a regular basis. But it can wreak havoc on infant health if introduced early. From diabetes risk to tooth decay, the consequences are far-reaching. The most reliable product, Cerelac is Nestlé’s wheat-based offering for six-month-old babies. As per the report, each serving of Cerelac contains approximately 2.7 grams of added sugar. This is the case for our country, while Nestlé in the UK and Germany serves a sugar-free product. The Food and Safety Authority of India (FSSAI) is probing the allegations. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) also raises its vigilant brow. Let’s hope for compliance, transparency and accountability. Nestlé India spokesperson said, “We would like to assure you that our Infant Cereal products, are manufactured to ensure the appropriate delivery of nutritional requirements such as Protein, Carbohydrates, Vitamins, Minerals, Iron etc. for early childhood. We never compromise and will never compromise on the nutritional quality of our products. We constantly leverage our extensive Global Research and Development network to enhance the nutritional profile of our products. Compliance is an essential characteristic of Nestlé India and we will never compromise on that. We also ensure that our products manufactured in India are in full and strict compliance with CODEX standards (a commission established by WHO and FAO) and local specifications (as required) pertaining to the requirements all nutrients including added sugars. Reduction of added sugars is a priority for Nestlé India. Over the past 5 years, we have already reduced added sugars by up to 30%, depending on the variant. We regularly review our portfolio and continue to innovate and reformulate our products to further reduce the level of added sugars, without compromising on nutrition, quality, safety, and taste. Nestlé India is committed to delivering the best nutrition to our consumers, which we have been doing for over 100 years and would always maintain highest standards of Nutrition, Quality and Safety in our products .” The question persists: Why the variance across borders? Is it a matter of taste preferences or something more insidious? As parents and conscious consumers, we must demand clarity. Transparency labels should transcend borders. Children deserve the same nutritional integrity across the world. Perhaps it’s time that all baby cereal manufacturers focus on the optimal balance between profit margins and health.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari May 07, 2024, 11:17 am Within the pages of books lie the universes waiting to be explored, a passport to wisdom, empathy and boundless horizons. Centuries ago, leaning back on the history of education when the earliest records were found from ancient civilizations, education was a natural response to the struggle for survival and prosperity. Adults imparted knowledge and skills to the young, shaping their abilities while preparing them to carry forward the legacy. As civilizations evolved, so did the education. It now facilitates awareness, uplifts moral conscience, and empowers individuals to become productive members of society, fostering critical thinking and lifelong learning. Quoting a great leader, Nelson Mandela: “Education is the most powerful weapon, which you can use to change the world.” However, the face of tutoring discreetly changed over time. In India, at this moment, quality education is equated with competitive exams and curricular activities. Children are seldom left alone to learn by their natural instincts and understanding . Somehow parents are trying to infuse intelligence inside the young minds citing the growth and success that they might earn later in their life. Enter the paramount of this era – the exam; a potential and possible way to assess children’s understanding of a particular subject taught in the said semester. However, the examination patterns have altered their shape turning into class and unit tests apart from several others on the queue. The monthly or quarterly examinations yield grades/marks that are then awarded to each student. Typically, the grades are also shared with the parents/guardians. The scenario persuades most schools in India. Today, we’re trying to understand the criteria for comprehending kids’ knowledge and analysis in the crucial developing age group of 2-8 years. We have interacted with numerous educational institutes seeking the need for examinations in junior classes. A split response was expected. It is interesting to learn many aspects of exams and their interpretation. To ensure coherence and a better understanding of the subject, we have developed a series that will be published online. Let us first try to get an insight into why should preschool/ junior classes have exams. Despite some debate surrounding the necessity and frequency of testing at this level, there are some good intentions behind the system. As per Manju Mehta, Principal, Birla Open Minds International School, Walkeshwar, Mumbai , “Exams provide a formal method for assessing students’ understanding and mastery of the material taught in class. It can provide valuable feedback to students about their strengths and areas for improvement.” “Exams help maintain academic standards and accountability. They can help in junior classes students develop important study skills, time management, and test-taking strategies that will be valuable as they progress to higher grades where exams may carry greater significance.” “Exam results may be used to inform decisions about student promotion to the next grade level or placement in different academic tracks or programs within the school. They also facilitate communication between teachers and parents about students’ academic progress and performance. They also help in building resilience and confidence through the process.” “In some educational systems, students may be required to take external standardized tests or exams in later grades. Exams can help children to cope with the issue.” Ms. Mehta further adds, “It’s important to note that while exams can be valuable tools for assessment and learning, they should be used thoughtfully and in conjunction with other forms of assessment, such as quizzes, projects, and class participation. Additionally, the frequency and format of exams should be tailored to the developmental needs and abilities of students at the junior level, taking into consideration factors such as age, cognitive development, and emotional well-being.” Speaking about the role of exams and assessments in the learning journey of children, Dr Anita Madan, Head of Curriculum Development at EuroKids , said, “ We believe the pressure of exams can create a stressful setting for young learners, hindering their natural inclination to learn and explore.” “At EuroKids, we champion a holistic assessment system that is tailored to each child’s individuality and learning process. Unlike conventional exams, EuroKids’ assessments place a premium on comprehension rather than rote memorization and fostering a deeper understanding of subjects. Children are liberated from academic pressure, and their progression to the next grade level is decoupled from their grades.” She adds. Ms. Madan further elaborates that by shifting the focus from competition to personal growth, we aim to empower children to embrace their uniqueness and develop a love for learning that extends beyond the confines of standardized testing. Mr. Raj Singhal, Co-founder & CEO of Footprints Childcare, says “ Preschool classrooms brim with discovery, not tests. Unlike later grades, exams here wouldn’t measure a child’s true potential. For young minds (3-6 years old), the emphasis should be: progress over “pass” or “fail”. Here’s why exams miss the mark: Unlike preschool, exams in grades 1-3 act as stepping stones to future learning by identifying areas where students excel and need extra help. This allows teachers to tailor their approach, ensuring children stay caught up. Scoring well builds confidence and motivates further exploration. Well-designed exams can surpass rote memorization, encouraging critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and healthy competition. The process of preparing for exams itself teaches valuable life skills. Students learn to manage their time effectively, organize their study materials, and develop the discipline needed for success in all areas of life. “Early exams should be administered to establish a solid educational base, promoting lifelong learning, rather than solely for the purpose of ranking students.” adds Mr Singhal. Contributing to the subject Ms. Sanamdeep Chadha, Promoter and Director of Genesis Global School expressed, “The progress of any child’s growth is through series of stages including physical, emotional, behavioural, and skills becoming a milestone for them at every step. Children have now started stepping out into formal set up of learning from the age of 3 and in these competitive times, we as adults start assessing them at every stage. We forget that growth, development, and learning for them happen at their own pace. With the bar of expectations going higher every time, formal assessments introduced at a very young age do cause anxiety.” Ms Chadha further adds, No doubt, every stakeholder wishes to know the progress, and assessment has a key role in that, but it should be designed in a manner that is more of an extension to the learning experience. Children learn differently and express their learning in their own way, which is why designing of assessment must cater to their needs individually. It should be creative that encourages curiosity, critical thinking and problem solving approach. The performance, therefore, for each child must be described and analysed through the systematic collection of evidence while performing diverse activities. No doubt, it should be informal in kindergarten and grade 1 that is observational, and acts more as a guiding tool to create a positive learning environment. However, in higher grades, a balanced approach that blends formative and summative assessments is to be incorporated ensuring not to create psychological pressure or stress in young students that may disrupt their emotional well-being. Lastly, assessing core concepts and competencies developed, to be focused that allows each student to compete with him or herself rather than with others. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari May 15, 2024, 13:47 pm Continuing our urge to learn more about conducting examination in junior classes, we brought to you the yet another segment of the series named ‘ Examining Young Minds: How urgent is the matter ?’ Let’s delve in! The last time we learned how exams play a crucial role in children’s lives, however a need for its establishment in the junior grades like pre-schools about age group 3-6 years is a bailiwick. The classroom study shouldn’t interrupt the playful learning and individual growth that each child may require. Moving on to the next significant question: Exams can be valuable tools if they focus on understanding, not just memorizing. Advantages should focus on skill development like Targeted Assessment, Skill Building, Confidence Boost, and Healthy Competition, enumerates Raj Singhal, Co-founder & CEO of Footprints Childcare. While exams can be valuable tools, overemphasizing memorization can have drawbacks. The pressure to recall facts can create significant stress and anxiety in young students, potentially leading to burnout. This rote learning approach limits knowledge development and valuable critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Instead of encouraging a well-rounded understanding, it creates a narrow definition of success based solely on memorization. Furthermore, focusing on grades can lead to unhealthy competition among classmates, where self-worth is measured by marks rather than a genuine love of learning. Speaking about the subject, Dr. Himani Narula, Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrician Director & Co-founder of Continua kids said, “ Exams are always know to trigger some kind of stress in the students, for some it is eustress which means good stress that motivates them to study and perform however for some it can turn into distress generating extreme fear and anxiety. While on one hand exams have their own advantages of providing a structured way of assessing a child’s understanding, it can instil discipline and study habits, can identify learning gaps in the students on the other hand it has its own disadvantages especially in young children. Exams performance can cause heightened stress and anxiety, can be overwhelming for some leading to feeling of inadequacy. Many a times poor exam performance can negatively affect a child’s self-esteem, confidence and attitude towards learning.” In childhood, exams can instill fear at a young age leading to a negative impact on their emotional development, influencing how they perceive and respond to future challenges. Early childhood fears can lead to heightened stress, which can manifest as physical symptoms like stomachache, headache and difficulty sleeping. If the child is recurrently exposed to such heightened stress and anxiety it can hinder a child’s emotional and cognitive development, it can increase clinginess to parents, low self-confidence, and may avoid participating in groups due to fear of social rejection. Unaddressed early fears can have long term effects on mental health leading to phobias, generalized anxiety disorder and related conditions. Elaborates Dr. Narula. Avoiding early recurrent stress and addressing children’s fear by providing them with a supportive, comforting environment and age-appropriate explanations, teaching them coping strategies can help mitigate these effects and promote healthy emotional development. If exams are not used as the primary means of assessing students for grade/class placement, there are alternative methods that schools can utilize to determine students’ readiness and qualifications. Manju Mehta, Principal, Birla Open Minds International School, Walkeshwar, Mumbai Enumerates some vital points here: Some schools in India aren’t conducting exams up to 8 grades, citing the considerable pressure it creates on students. “The issue of conducting exams for students in pre-schools and junior schools, particularly up to the 8th grade, is a topic of ongoing debate in education systems around the world, not just in India”. Says Ms Mehta. While exams can serve as valuable assessment tools, excessive or high-stakes testing at a young age can also contribute to stress, anxiety, and burnout among students. Implementing regulations or guidelines regarding exams in pre-schools and junior schools could help address some of these concerns and ensure a more balanced approach to assessment and learning. Ms. Mehta points out some potential considerations for such regulations: Children in the tender age group should be observed regularly rather than relying solely on annual or quarterly exams/tests. Each child possesses unique qualities that require nurturing. A single exam cannot adequately assess their capabilities. To achieve this, comprehensive policies and guidelines should be established for pre-schools across India. The primary goal should be to create a supportive and nurturing learning environment – one that prioritizes students’ overall growth, development and well-being. There should be such a system that encourages students’ innate qualities while maintaining academic accountability. After all, a healthy and happy childhood lays the foundation for an intelligent and fulfilling future. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Sep 23, 2022, 12:32 pm In an interview with MI , Satyaki Ghosh, CEO of Domestic Textiles (Grasim Industries) Aditya Birla Group speaks about the marketing innovations and brand strategy. Let’s read: Satyaki: It’s that time of the year eagerly anticipated by every Malayalee in God’s own country. Everyone is all set to celebrate Onam with full fervour this time round after two muted years filled with Covid restrictions and kickstart the festive calendar in India. The festival tends to be a barometer for consumer sentiments and spending, setting the stage for marketers’ frenzied bouts of promotional activities. Brands are rousing with innovative campaigns and product offers to match consumer sentiment and partake in festive celebrations. Linen Club, the pioneering linen brand from the Aditya Birla Group, unveiled a unique campaign called ‘Homecoming’ – a film and a beautiful Folk song to celebrate the biggest festival in the market. To mark the annual celebration of Onam. With this campaign, the brand aims to reciprocate the love Kerala has bestowed on the brand over the years. Satyaki: The campaign further brings alive the authentic aesthetics of the festival Onam & the expertise and expanse of Linen Club with a showcase of the broad palate of fabrics and apparel the brand offers. The song Thiruvonamullil Nirayenam is a unique endeavour by a fashion brand like us to present a local folk melody and join their customers as they celebrate their most important annual festival – Onam. Satyaki: Linen Club’s passion, authenticity, and expertise in creating the best linen fabrics and apparel are apparent in the campaign focused on Onam. It displays the variety and the robust portfolio of products the brand offers. Linen Club and Linen Club Studio offer premium linen fabrics and ready-to-wear apparel like shirts, jackets, trousers, kurtas, Mundus, etc., to match the festivity’s spirit. The concept of Fabrik Pookalam is exceptional and brings alive a beautiful harmony between the brand’s offerings and the festival’s nature. Satyaki: Ahead of Onam, as Kerela begins preparations, we are excited to demonstrate the broad palette of colours, categories, designs & textures we offer in pure Linen. Combined with consummate craftsmanship using cutting-edge European technology, we ensure best-in-class sustainable Linen products in both tailored and ready-to-wear categories. The driving factors of the brand’s advancement in the retail space are its unique combination of characteristics that it portrays, and the loyal consumer base it boosts off has helped the brands reach greater horizons. Satyaki: The campaign showcases a heartfelt homecoming of family and friends to their roots based on the age-old tale of King Mahabali and a celebration of the folk art forms of Kerala to bring in the new year. With Mala Parvathy and George Kora helming the beautiful video story, the TVC is produced to strike a chord instantly with the viewer. It signifies celebration and prosperity while evoking a sense of abundance. Satyaki: Brands play a pivotal role in creating a more equitable society at the grassroots level. To create awareness and acceptance of an inclusive community, brands need to work towards breaking down barriers and increasing access. The brand’s intent needs to be bonafide. Therefore, brands must introspect and re-evaluate whether the campaigns they build are truly symbolic of their core values and whether they are empowering the consumer. The way brands can inspire trust in their target audience is when they lead by example, and others follow suit, and this can be done with an honest, immersive 360-degree narrative enhancing the brand’s reputation. It should be more about participation, a celebration of being alive, being active, and being encouraged to be better. A brand is a direct manifestation of the values the company represents, and empathy and an ethical value system must lie at the core of those values. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Oct 04, 2022, 17:03 pm Manoj: I am Manoj Tulsani , a travel entrepreneur and Rayna Tours and Travels co-founder and CEO. Starting more than a decade ago, Rayna Tours has been the industry’s number-one choice for destination management services. Our main office is in Dubai and has locations in several parts of the globe, including Malaysia, Singapore, India, Israel, and South Africa. We cater to B2C and B2B clients, with dedicated sections to combine all travel elements, such as worldwide hotel reservations, international visa services, high-end logistic packages, and all-inclusive holidays. Manoj: Rayna Tours began from a small outlet inside Flora Grand Hotel in Dubai. There were just two of us (KamleshRamchandani and I) to take care of every aspect of running and growing our venture back then. That was in 2006; about two years later, we opened 15 more similar outlets before reinforcing our status as a leading destination management company by 2009. Since then, Rayna Tours has remained one of the leaders in offering full-suite travel solutions to all travelers. Manoj: I have always been an avid traveler with an entrepreneurial spirit, so when I decided on a career change after working for about seven years in the trading industry, there wasn’t any confusion or difficulty in choosing my domain, i.e., tourism and hospitality. We started Rayna Tours and Traveled more to express ourselves and nurture our passion. Manoj: It’s exciting when you’re the in-charge of your own business. But there are a lot of obstacles and struggles behind this reality. It is especially dreadful in the early stage, at least for us, as we came from an entirely different industry and didn’t have solid strategies or the right team to back our business ideas. That said, it continues in every phase. The catch is removing the roadblock by learning from the mistakes, conducting extensive market research, and devising a tactical strategy. It not only helps us to know the dynamic travel trends and customer requirements but also sets concrete goals that deliver the expectations of our targeted and potential audience with an enriched customer experience. Manoj: Our ability to innovate as per the market demands is one of the critical factors that help us to stand out in the industry. We believe consistently delivering quality services is equally vital to retaining existing and attracting new customers. That’s why we don’t have a middleman for planning and implementing most of our services, mainly cruises, safaris, or premium sightseeing tours. No matter whether they are looking for pocket-friendly or uber-luxurious travel choices. Our objective is to serve all levels of travelers, so we offer products and services that satisfy every guest’s needs through our strong presence in both B2C (www.raynatours.com) and B2B ( www.raynab2b.com ) domains. Rayna Tours is staffed by some of the most brilliant and creative talents, instrumental in the company’s ongoing success. Himanshu Laul, a graduate of B.Arch. from IIT, Roorkee, is the Managing Director of Rayna Group. At the same time, Mr. Yasser Noman, with an experience of over three decades in the travel industry, is the company’s Executive Chairman. Manoj: Starting with just two of us, Rayna Tours and Travels now has a vibrant multicultural workforce of about 600 employees working in its diverse branches worldwide. We began humbly to arrange stress-free Dubai activities and tours for the hotel guests. Over the years, Rayna Tours has made a significant mark in the industry as one of the UAE’s top and favorite destination management service providers. It is now an award-winning company with many respected awards and recognitions to its credit, including Arabian Travel Awards for Best Destination Management Company and Best B2B Travel Portal and Travelers’ Choice Awards from TripAdvisor, a few. Manoj: We have some resourceful plans for Rayna Tours. As we currently have a presence in about ten countries, our primary goal is to get Rayna Tours and its exceptional offerings to more and more destinations worldwide until it becomes a highly successful global travel brand.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Oct 10, 2022, 18:07 pm In an interview with MI, Amit Gupta, Founder, KMKD Rupay Bachao LLP speaks about inception and journey. Let’s read: Amit: Being a keen financial enthusiastic individual, I have always aspired to develop a cashless transaction system. To promote the cashless trading business in India, we have thoughtfully launched Rupay Bachao. It is an online platform for buyers and sellers to do trading without involving cash transactions. The formation of the Digital India Policy created the presence of trade platforms digitally and kicked me to start this idea. Rupay Bachao, with modern technology, created a reliable and robust trade platform where it is possible to do current barter transactions. Our platform allows trading activities between shopkeepers and businessmen to sell their goods and services in exchange for RFTs (Rupee Free Token). Registered members can use RFTs to buy or use other services without cash transactions. For the first time in India, such an application has been designed for a B2B business model where the registered members and their employees can buy and sell goods and services without involving cash. Since its inception in April 2022 with zero brand association, we have enrolled more than 500 brands, including Real Estate, Tourism and Travel Industry, Hospitality Sector, Advertising & Marketing, Interior & Décor, Food & Groceries, Construction Business, etc. Amit: Digital India is the new India! Govt has formed this vision to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. To meet this objective, we created Rupay Bachao to make businesses more efficient. Our platform promotes digital payments through cashless transactions aligned with government digital India policy. In this digital era, we have thoughtfully created a fully secure and flexible way to allow members to increase their sales through applications and, at the same time, save cash outflow by sourcing their requirements from the members on the platform. Amit: One core objective of launching this platform is to utilize the capacity and incur more output from the same amount of input. And yes, we are one of the most secured apps which are cautious about data security systems as our complete data is encrypted. At Rupay Bachao, all the transactions are above the board. Every transaction between the members will be recorded in the books of account. Further, Rupay Bachao has a transparent data-sharing policy with the Indian Government/ taxation authorities. Thus, every sale on the platform is treated as income of the individual member and every purchase as his/her expenses under appropriate heads. Moreover, we have organized a procedure to check the authenticity of the owner and digital transaction, which involves a redirected SMS alert when a transaction occurs in any account, dual authentication for the login process, and a verified confirmation to initiate any transaction. Amit: Our modern tech generation has left traditional working patterns and adopted all digital means. From buying, selling, meeting, and learning, everything has turned digital, and so is trading. Digital trading has now taken up the stage by implementing cashless transactions. It also helps in authenticating and formalizing all transactions and restricts fraud. The cashless transaction has boosted the digital trading market and is considered a safer and more secure way of transferring money. Rupay Bachao has a similar vision of making trade businesses cashless and providing significant benefits to the members and industry. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Mar 28, 2023, 08:20 am MI speaks with Goutham Vinjamuri, COO and Co-Founder of Quickplay , in a detailed interaction. Let’s read: Goutham: Quite simply, we keep our eyes on the future. We’ve created a culture that fosters innovation, a willingness to explore the unknown, and a commitment to leadership in implementing new technologies. We’ve recognized that the future of OTT requires fast, flexible, scalable platforms that can help the industry adapt quickly to changes in technology and consumer behavior. Video delivery has evolved quickly from cable and broadcast to TV Everywhere and now to an OTT world that includes subscription services (SVOD), ad supported services (AVOD), free, ad supported television (FAST), pay-per-view and more. Historically, the industry needed to build separate infrastructures for each business model, hindering the ability to change and grow with the market. We’ve solved the problem by re-imagining the OTT platform from the ground up. We’ve created a video pipeline designed for high-quality, low-latency streaming at scale; a video CMS that enhances viewers’ discovery of content with relevant and personalized experiences; and ready-to-use applications across web, mobile, smart TVs, set-top-boxes, connected TVs, and gaming consoles that are designed to get our customers’ services in front of their subscribers in record time. Our cloud-native and cloud-agnostic platform harnesses cloud-native technologies –containers, microservices, a service mesh, APIs, and immutable infrastructure – to reduce the cost and effort of deployment by upwards of 40% or more . We have the flexibility to work as a standalone end-to-end solution or integrated with best of breed technology partners to deliver significantly better performance, a modular approach for feature expansion, continuous delivery for rapid iteration of new features and apps, and built-in scalability, observability and security – in short, a future-proof architecture that can pivot quickly when the need arises. Goutham: OTT subscribers often are attracted to a particular service because of a favorite show or series. They frequently will binge-watch that content during a free trial period, with the intention of terminating the subscription once they have finished – netting the OTT provider zero return. To build long term value, providers need their content to be part of the subscriber’s daily habit, as much as a morning coffee or an afternoon walk. Providers need to use data analytics to generate content recommendations, surface content that complements subscribers’ initial area of interest, and be ready to act quickly to save at-risk subscribers. Our platform includes in-house and third-party tools that touch each and every step of the subscriber lifestyle. Our data analytics capabilities enable levels of personalization that surpass traditional recommendations by finding the connections that can help subscribers uncover new viewing opportunities amidst the longtail content in providers’ libraries. Our award-winning personalized FAST channels are the “front porch” of content discovery, feeding subscribers a virtual linear stream that is targeted to their specific interests. We’re also created a fail-safe to reduce subscriber defections. Our customers have insight into “survival curves” that can forecast how long consumers are likely to stay on the service based on their subscription levels, previous renewal track-record, video watch patterns, and more – an early warning system that can help OTT providers prevent cancellations. Goutham: When consumers have access to at least one streaming service –as does 57% of the Indian market – recommending the right content at the right time is essential. At Quickplay, we’ve created an AI/ML based solution that can increase content reach and subscribers engagement and are harnessing Generative AI to personalize content promotion. When you step back and look at the OTT business in general, there are a number of insights that help to shape providers’ decisions. In the SVOD business, for example, approximately 20% of the content catalog contributes to 80% of total watch time. And 80% of OTT playback comes from the top four carousels on the home screen. We help our customers take their subscribers more deeply into their content catalogues. Our AI-powered content metadata engages the subscriber with granular content discovery experiences by analyzing the video scenes and the closed-captions available within the content and uncovering microgenres and plot keywords. Our hyper-personalized recommendation engine considers the subscriber’s behavioral data, their watch patterns, and AI-powered content metadata to generate recommendations that expedite content discoverability. And our algorithms measure subscriber engagement, propensity to subscribe/winback, churn predictions, and personalized ads to model customer behaviour and create cohorts for targeted marketing and acquisitions. At the NAB Show this year, we’ll be showing how multimodal Generative AI is transforming the ability of content providers to personalize on-screen posters – one of the entry points to video discovery. Using Generative AI’s ability to recognize actors, landmarks, genres, content and service providers can automatically design posters that are targeted to every individual viewer, based on existing viewer behavior and preferences. This is just the latest way in which we are harnessing AI to help the streaming industry achieve new levels of success. Goutham: First, Quickplay’s cloud-native platform is cloud agnostic. OTT providers don’t need to make a platform decision based on a specific cloud provider. Instead, we can work with THEIR cloud of choice – public cloud, in-country cloud or telco cloud – removing a not-insignificant obstacle to deployment. Second, we’re expert at helping customers who were locked into premise-based or hybrid solutions to escape those confines and build fast, flexible services that reduce upfront costs and enable auto-scaling in alignment with subscriber growth. Throughout our history we’ve taken on challenging use cases in challenging operating environments and have made them look easy. We have a track record here supporting more than 50 of the world’s biggest media brands. Finally, our cloud versatility offers the added benefit of enabling OTT providers to use their existing cloud spending commitments on the Quickplay platform. This helps them achieve greater business efficiency. One last thing: We have a superb and recognized track record of working with cloud providers. Quickplay last year was the Google Cloud Industry Solutions Partner of the Year and Microsoft Cloud Partner of the Year finalist. Goutham: There no single consensus on how high global OTT revenue will be in coming years, but all sources unanimously point to continued rapid growth. According to Digital TV Research, the total OTT market was projected to be USD $157 billion at the end of 2022, $174 billion by the end of this year and $243 billion by 2028. One of the trends we are seeing is the rise of advertising supported services as households better manage the number of subscriptions to which they committed during pandemic quarantines. AVOD revenue growth is expected to outpace SVOD growth by more than 40% between now and 2028, says Digital TV Research. What this means for the industry is that there will be an increased need for technologies available that will help providers harness that growth and quickly enable new opportunities to engage and monetize audiences. We’re seeing an interest across the industry in replacing legacy platforms that limited providers’ growth – restricting scalability, implementation of new features, and launches of new monetization strategies. We see many of these customers now rethinking those choices and evaluating cloud-native platforms such as ours that can deliver the flexibility, the agility, and the scalability they need to achieve their objectives. As the industry pivots from SVOD (Subscription VOD) to AVOD (Ad-Supported VOD) and FAST (Free Ad-Supported Television), providers are looking at ways to create a new generation of ad-supported services that drive subscriber satisfaction and monetization through better personalization and targeting. Goutham: The aha story is amazing – a classic example of how technical and business innovation can combine to achieve spectacular results. aha came to us in 2021 as they were revamping their “glocal” strategy for what was at the time a service focused entirely on the Telugu market. Within six months of reaching an agreement we had helped to migrate that groundbreaking Telugu service to a new cloud-native platform, providing the flexibility and scale aha demanded; just three months into the migration, Quickplay enabled aha to launch in Tamil using the same backend. aha came into the project with high expectations; our cloud-native architecture proved that it was flexible, agile, and scalable enough to meet those ambitious cost, time-to-market, and subscriber growth objectives. We helped aha achieve a 5x increase in user engagement and watch duration via the following: aha 2.0 really has been a technology, business and market triumph that is being judged as equal or superior to major global brands. The results have been phenomenal because of its 100% regional and hyper-local strategies. Coming to market in a record time frame, the cloud-based platform today supports >10 devices, dozens of new integrations to help capture data and run operations efficiently, and gateways for payments around the globe. Currently, more than 50 million unique users have visited and upwards of 18 million mobile app downloads. International subscribership has risen by 60% since the launch of aha 2.0, and paid subscribership has increased to nearly 2 million. We recently introduced free games, are adding more innovative features, and are working with aha on expansion to new markets. One last thing: When aha and Disney+ Hotstar simultaneously aired the Indian blockbuster “Bheemla Nayak” earlier this year, aha 2.0 earned rave reviews for its performance. Viewers tweeted lavish praise for aha’s Dolby 5.1 audio and 4K HD video quality and in an informal online poll more than 62% of viewers selected aha’s telecast as the superior experience. By any measure, that’s success! In another landmark achievement, aha, one of India’s leading regional OTT, has won the Internet & Mobile Association of India’s (IAMAI) India Digital Awards 2023 ‘Best Entertainment App’ Award under the category Best Mobile & App Awards. Goutham: Last year was a banner year for Quickplay’s association with Google Cloud. We were named the Google Cloud’s Media & Entertainment Industry Partner of the Year and collaborated closely with Google Cloud on a number of streaming innovations built on existing Google Cloud products. We announced the relationship about a year ago and followed up in August with news of collaboration in three specific areas.: o Personalized FAST channels running on Google Cloud and ready for scalable CTV monetization via pre-integration with Google Ad Manager across client, and server side environments. o Analytics dashboards built on a proprietary, unified data model, bringing together user engagement, content performance, and quality of experience metrics to help drive the business. Leveraging the Quickplay analytics platform, built on top of Google BigQuery and Looker, media companies can identify and target users at risk of churn to improve retention and identify new revenue opportunities. o Linear streaming through HLS and DASH on Google Cloud Media CDN, with an early version of low latency streaming using the LL-DASH protocol. It’s also important to note that we’ve pre-integrated Google Ad Manager’s digital ad management capabilities into our next-generation OTT streaming platform. The goal is bring together the diverse ecosystems of streaming providers, CTV platform owners and advertisers – all in the name of expediting monetization. Because the integration covers both client-side and server-side ad insertion use cases for HLS and DASH delivery protocols, we can more efficiently power providers’ AVOD, linear and FAST services, using the same backend platform, across all CTV platforms. In addition, our Quickplay personalization capabilities can enable better, more intelligent experiences that engage audiences with relevant content and advertising, including personalized FAST channel. Ultimately our pre-integrated solution means that current and prospective CTV partners can utilize Google Ad Manager to power monetization by tapping into diverse content sources supported on Quickplay’s platform.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Apr 11, 2023, 09:55 am MI speaks with Shruti Kapoor, Senior Manager – Marketing, Soothe Healthcare . Shruti underlines the brand’s idea behind the campaign and their other initiatives. Excerpts here: Shruti: The Champion for Champions is more than a campaign for us; like an initiative. It’s not a recent campaign. We started it almost two years back during the pandemic. At that time, we associated with 20,000 female police officers. The thought behind this was to celebrate these women and their contribution who works tirelessly for society. These real-life champions who have a lot of potential need a little support. This collaboration was to highlight the importance of menstrual hygiene. This year, we were approached by sporting ethos. As a brand, Paree believes in supporting young girls in sports. These sports are not regular, but very niche, like para-athlete, rugby, rifle shooting, and more. We were very inspired by these girls and wanted to support these champions. And Paree as a brand proposition has been a heavy flow champion. So we thought to be the champion behind these real-life champions. Shruti: Paree has always supported female sports persons. We had associated with Badminton star, Saina Nehwal in the past. And she is still associated with Paree. This time we wanted to highlight niche sports; not regular sports like cricket, badminton, and tennis. Because it is important for people to know about other sports as well, there are a lot of representation. The payers put in their hard work and grit to make their way for the particular sport. So it’s important for us that these players get support from us. Shruti: I really hope so. But these changes would happen at a societal level which is relatively slow. In India, we have treated menstruation as a topic that is talked about in a hushed tone. I think it will slowly lead to a shift with the government aiding in openly talking about it. Our honorable Prime Minister, a couple of years back, in his Independence Day speech addressed the issue and pleaded with women to prioritize their menstrual health. In cinema halls also, there are government ads on menstrual wellness. Various brands are now talking openly about the importance of menstrual hygiene. Currently, a majority of women, don’t have access to menstrual hygiene. This is where all of ours, as an industry effort comes into play. The more we talk about it, the better awareness it creates. It is an important subject right now, as 23% of our girls drop out of school once they start menstruating. Mostly because they don’t have facilities available for them, families make these girls leave the schools. It is unfortunate, and it’s really a cost of opportunity here. If women must be a part of society, the shift needs to happen where we talk about menstruation openly. Shruti: Absolutely. The more men become a part of the larger conversation about menstrual health, the more normalized it will become in society. We had an interesting campaign that we did on Valentine’s Day. We asked men to show their women Paree walla care . Every couple celebrates Valentine’s Day with roses and chocolates. But do they know their partner’s period date, or do they pamper them on those days? The idea was to make men understand that real love is when you show your partner when she needs it. And if your woman is comfortable talking about menstruation and all about it with you. Shruti: There’s another initiative that we have launched named PareeVartan. It’s about raising awareness, creating impact, and then empowering women. These are the three pillars on which PareeVartan was based. Under this initiative, we have visited different schools and colleges where we take menstrual hygiene sessions. These sessions are about using sanitary pads and menstrual hygiene correctly. We especially target government and underdeveloped schools in different parts of the country. These girls need much more education about menstrual hygiene. We just don’t distribute pads in these places, but we also provide them with proper sessions. These sessions are conducted by our in-house menstrual hygiene experts, who are certified to take these sessions. Last year in December, we adopted 100 schools in Bihar. The objective is to take care of the girls’ menstrual hygiene in those schools. This initiative has become big now, and we have expanded in UP, MP, and Rajasthan. Another initiative was the collaboration with Dr. Kiran Bedi’s foundation, India Vision Foundation. Here we took menstrual hygiene sessions in the female presence after every quarter. We also provide sanitary pads here. The idea is to take it to the grassroots level because that’s where the real change and impacts are going to come around. Shruti: We have our on-ground sales team. They get us in touch with schools in some villages or outskirts of a city. We distribute sanitary pads and keep enough of them in the school so the girls can use them for the next 3-4 months. Then we provide proper sessions also. Shruti: In India, only 20% of the females use sanitary pads, whereas the rest don’t even have access to it. Women are still using unhygienic means like clothes or in some cases, leaves. India is the cervical cancer capital of the world. So, yes, it is essential to maintain a lesser carbon footprint and pads are non-biodegradable products. But at the same time, we need to understand that a sanitary pad is something that a woman needs to live her life normally. Why do we expect only women to suffer because sanitary pads are contributing to carbon footprint? While we can work towards other options which are bio-degradable like menstrual cups. At the same time, just think about a woman who never even used a pad, will she be able to use a menstrual cup? Different cultural biases come against menstrual cups. In some cases, women tell us if the woman can still be a virgin because they think only married women can use menstrual cups. In fact, there are a lot of things that are worse than a pad and creating humongous carbon footprints. Sanitary pads are just for five days a month for a woman, but it impacts her entire life. So I think we should give her access to sanitary pads first, then later as she grows with it she can switch or decide on bio-degradable options. We have been continuously doing our part to lessen the carbon footprint with our research and development happening at our end. We have menstrual cups as well. We are even working on the clean disposal of sanitary pads. We have been responsibly disposing of 50 metric tons of this waste. We have been recognized by the government also for doing so. Shruti: The pandemic has impacted the category as a whole in a good way. The pandemic brought up the forefront of importance of hygiene. Even if we had the knowledge, how actively we do things we have been taught or learned. Women started taking care of themselves, taking note of how to keep menstrual hygiene, and how to responsibly dispose of it. So the industry is growing while the focus is on hygiene. Shruti: As a brand, we always wanted to be present where our audience lies. We have always believed in 360-degree marketing. In this way, we can build brand awareness and, at the same time, reinforce what the brand stands for. We have a lot of younger audiences who have moved largely on to digital. We are a part of digital media to talk to our audience. Because digital is the only medium that is two-way communication, especially social media. We can engage with our audience. We have now started going to new-age digital platforms like Sharechat and Moj. Here we can talk to our consumers in the language that they want. Last year, we did a campaign in Sharechat where we communicated our brand with small influencers in Bhojpuri and Hindi. We received an amazing response from them. For our Champion for Champions campaign, Janhvi Kapoor, our brand ambassador posted a video because she was very excited about the association with athletes. After that, we heard a lot of conversations about it. Shruti: The organization is growing exponentially. Paree is now a 100 crore brand. The organization, Soothe Healthcare, is now a 250 crore brand. We have crossed 200 crores in a short span of time. So the plans for the future are exciting, but I can’t give you the details right now. We have a good product and a good face as a brand ambassador, a youth icon, Janhvi Kapoor. We also have a good media presence. So we are very excited about our future plans. Shruti: Live your life without holding back. Be true to yourself and always work towards achieving your dreams. As a woman, if we set our eyes on the goal, we are very dedicated. So, just walk towards it and make your dreams come true. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari May 05, 2023, 10:02 am In an interview, MI talks with Pawan Sarda, Chief Growth Officer, The House of Abhinandan Lodha . “The brand will soon have a limited plot launch in Goa after the success of the last one.” He says. Let’s read: Pawan: Back in 2021, amidst lockdown, Mr. Abhinandan Lodha wanted to bring back the oldest asset class ‘land’ at the forefront & make it accessible to every Indian to make it part of their investment portfolio. Land buying has always had a traditional journey of buying in the region of familiarity & through word of mouth. It is not unknown that land as an asset class has always seen the highest appreciation among other instruments. However, people have not been able to identify the safest & most secure way to invest in land & this led to a new category, ‘Branded land.’ A branded land developer undertakes the massive responsibility of performing required legal checks, validating ownership status, and generally ensuring that the land is conflict-free and approved for sale. Furthermore, branded lands are usually in an area that will be urbanized or aggressively developed. This means there is a guarantee that the value of the land will exponentially increase with time and development around the area. But the paramount reason why people prefer investing in branded lands is that the developer guarantees security, trust, and transparency. These reasons cumulatively benefit the purchaser and make the entire process of owning land a nuisance free and a smart asset class. Considering this, we launched a project in Dapoli ‘Isle of Bliss’. With the vision to democratize land ownership to every Indian, the plots in these projects were priced starting Rs. 15 Lacs. The overwhelming response from the customers made the belief in the vision even stronger. This gave a boost to an accelerated journey in the last year with many successful launches. Thus far, the brand has sold more than 5 million sq.ft of land. Pawan: The House of Abhinandan Lodha is the only PAN India branded land developer having projects across locations. We are on a mission to make land buying accessible to all sitting from the comfort of their home. Purchasing branded land ensures the purchaser has secured land that is truly theirs and that the land’s value will increase in times to come. With the usage of DigiTech we are disrupting the category. With the promise of secure ownership, transparent process & documentation & backed with data on appreciation to build intergenerational wealth, we are turning on the head of this category for all the red tapeism that it is otherwise known for. The use of technology & the recent soft launch of the app, which can help you buy land in just 3 clicks, are steps taken to stay ahead of the curve. Pawan: Anyone who is looking to make a long term investment in assets & create intergenerational wealth is our customer. Whether it is a salaried person or a businessman, or an NRI. Our customers are not only across the country but globally. The brand largely uses the might of digital, channel partners & ATL activations to reach their base. Referral & loyalty is also part of our acquisition mix. Pawan: After the success of our past projects in Dapoli (Isle of Bliss, Cape of Bliss), Goa, Alibaug, and Anjarle (TomorroWorld & TomorrowLand) , the brand is launching a unique land parcel in Anjarle under the project name ‘TomorrowView.’ Staying true to its name, the plots in this land parcel will have an unobstructed ocean view; the land contour is such that it will provide a panoramic theatre-like ocean view to the customers. Anjarle is India’s fastest-growing tourist destination & is touted to be the Goa of tomorrow. Investment in this project is expected to fetch 5X returns in 10 years. Also, the brand will soon have a limited plot launch in Goa after the success of the last one. Pawan: Technology has revolutionized how real estate transactions are conducted and brought transparency, speed and efficiency in the sector. From enabling virtual reality tours to executing the use of artificial intelligence in booking, registration and documentation processes, technology has ensured the industry is a click away for consumers. Direct-to-consumer channels like apps and websites allow real-estate players to bring experiential solutions like virtual reality and 3D tours to the comfort and convenience of the consumer wherever they are. Combined with videoconferencing, which itself got a boost during Covid, it allows the real-estate industry to disrupt the site visit routine. This has transformed the way properties are marketed and sold. Buyers can now take a virtual tour of a property and get a realistic sense of what a property looks and feels like, all the while conversing with the expert without having to physically visit it. These new channels and technologies have revolutionized the way people shop for properties and make it easier for developers to showcase their inventory to potential buyers. The House of Abhinandan Lodha is giving the control back to customers with the launch of its app which will enable customers to purchase land online, view the entire documentation of their land investments, make timely milestone payments online & keep abreast with all the progress in their investment. This is one of its kind app in the industry today. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Jun 16, 2023, 10:01 am As the Marketing Head of Tic Tac in India, Zoher Kapuswala has been integral to the brand’s journey. He has spearheaded several successful campaigns that have helped Tic Tac grow year after year and establish itself as a market leader in the confectionery segment. The brand recently collaborated with Internet sensation Yashraj Mukhate for its latest digital campaign #TicTacLife. MI speaks with Zoher Kapuswala about the journey of the brand in India and its key focus markets. Let’s read… Zoher: Tic Tac was one of the Pioneers in Preimmunizing the India Confectionery Category by creating an INR 10 price point in the market, thanks to its first-of-its-kind share-worthy format. Ever since the Brand has evolved over the years, along with the changing consumer needs. Innovation has been at the heart of the Brand. It has been one of the first brands to launch traditional Indian flavors like Fennel. Tic Tac also launched a sub-brand Tic Tac Seeds, with crushed seeds inside, that epitomizes the Indian refreshment rituals, apart from the global leading flavors like Mint, Orange, and Red Apple. The Brand also ensures it stands out in the Impulse environment, by its innovative Shelf-ready packaging (like the Iconic Tree & the Wall-Hangers). Overall, Tic Tac’s journey in India has been one of innovation and adaptation. The brand has successfully carved out a unique space in the Indian market by positioning itself as a fun, refreshing mint that appeals to the youth. With its continued focus on product innovation and targeted marketing campaigns, Tic Tac is well-positioned to continue growing its market share in India. Zoher: Tic Tac has always been focused on product innovation by introducing new flavors and formats. This has helped the brand stay relevant and cater to changing consumer preferences. We, as a brand, built a strong brand image through consistent branding and advertising. The brand has a unique identity that is instantly recognizable and memorable. We have successfully reached out to our target audience through targeted marketing campaigns. The brand has leveraged social media and other digital platforms to engage with its consumers and build a stronger online narrative. We have built a strong distribution network that ensures the products are widely available across different channels and locations. This has helped the brand to reach a larger consumer base and gain a competitive advantage. Zoher: In 2022, Tic Tac’s ‘Mouth Fresh, Mood Refresh’ campaign was launched in India and aimed to position the brand as a mouth freshener that refreshes the mood by providing a continuous release of long-lasting and refreshing experiences. The campaign included a series of TV and digital ads that helped deliver the brand’s positioning among youngsters. Tic Tac recently collaborated with Yashraj Mukhate for its digital campaign #TicTacLife. The idea behind the campaign was to tap into the current trend of user-generated content and leverage the creative talent of Yashraj Mukhate to create an entertaining and engaging jingle featuring Tic Tac through an influencer marketing campaign. The campaign aimed to portray Tic Tac as an inspiration for a refreshing transformation that brings alive the precious moments of fun and good vibes to further establish Tic Tac as the preferred refreshment amongst the youth of India. Overall, Tic Tac has launched several innovative brand campaigns in India that have helped to drive its brand narrative and engage with its target audience. These campaigns have been creative, quirky, and fun, which resonates well with the brand’s image as a refreshing and enjoyable mint. Zoher: One of our key priorities is to expand our brand presence in India’s Tier 2 and 3 cities. To achieve this, we have implemented several initiatives specifically designed to cater to consumers’ needs and preferences in these markets. For example, we have recently done an on-ground “Fresh and Crazy”(College Fresher’s day) activation in 64 colleges in 8 cities of UP, which is the biggest Indian state in terms of population and presents big business opportunities for Tic Tac. This was clubbed with a store seeding van activation, which helped us open new stores and increase our distribution and engagement with consumers and shoppers in small towns of UP. These activations helped us in increasing mental and physical availability among our target audience which is the young college students. We have also partnered with local distributors and retailers to ensure that our products are widely available in these markets. We have also introduced smaller pack sizes and more affordable prices to make our products accessible to a wider range of consumers. We have conducted extensive research to understand consumers’ unique needs and preferences in Tier 2 and 3 cities and have developed campaigns that resonate with them. Overall, our approach to expanding our brand presence in Tier 2 and 3 cities has been one of localization and personalized engagement. By understanding consumers’ unique needs and preferences in these markets and tailoring our strategies accordingly, we are confident that we can continue growing our brand presence and building a loyal customer base. Zoher: Our key focus markets are primarily the urban and semi-urban areas of the country. We have identified these markets as having high potential for growth due to their large consumer base and increasing disposable income levels. To cater to these markets, Tic Tac has implemented a targeted marketing strategy that focuses on reaching consumers in these areas through various channels. This includes leveraging social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube to engage with our target audience and promote our products. We have also established a strong distribution network in these markets, ensuring that our products are widely available in convenience stores, supermarkets, and other retail outlets. Additionally, we have partnered with popular e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Flipkart to reach consumers who prefer to shop online. In terms of product offerings, we have introduced channel specific SKUs and specialized combi packs specifically tailored to the tastes and preferences of consumers in these markets. In short, an always on the go approach and innovative thinking have helped drive growth and maintain our position as a leading confectionery brand in India. Zoher: Constant product innovation coupled with varied marketing strategies has helped us achieve year on year brand growth in the India market. Tic Tac has continuously introduced new flavors and product variants, such as Tic Tac Spearmint and Tic Tac Seeds respectively, to cater to changing consumer palate. This has helped to keep the brand relevant and drive sales growth. We as a brand, have consistently implemented effective marketing strategies that have helped to build brand awareness and drive consumer engagement. The brand has leveraged various marketing channels, including social media and influencer marketing, to reach its target audience and promote its products. Tic Tac has also come up with some innovative in & out flavors like Popcorn, Cherry Cola and Banana in India to drive brand growth, that offered something new and unique to the consumers. Some other factors for year-on-year brand growth in the Indian market can be attributed to a combination of strong distribution network, and a focus on quality and consistency, by continuing to focus on these key areas, Tic Tac is well-positioned to sustain its growth in the Indian market.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Oct 16, 2023, 09:17 am Here’s the guest talk with Clove Dental: Dr Vimal: Well! The journey undertaken by me in Clove Dental 8 years back has been spectacular, highly fulfilling and really enjoyable. I feel proud of the way Clove Dental has transformed the lives of thousands of dentists and at the same time provided an ethical treatment to millions of patients over the last 12 years. It has been enjoyable to see the metamorphosis that Clove Dental went through. From 20+ clinics when I joined to its present mammoth of more than 400+ clinics in 24 cities across India. There is no doubt that it was an uphill task but with the support of our CEO Mr. Amar Singh, the journey became a never ending story of dreams coming true. We could change how dentistry was practiced in all neighborhoods with our impeccable SOPs and standards in sterilization, asepsis, record keeping and patient care services. In the process of following us, our neighborhood dentists also underwent a change for the better. Clove Dental now sets standards for most other clinics to follow and thus changing the landscape of dentistry. Also we could bring a change in the way dental surgeons were being treated and in the absence of jobs, many private practitioners were fleecing young dentists. We provided them the respect, dignity and a place to practice their profession at a decent salary. We provide them with an opportunity to learn and improve their skills for a better future. This feeling of helping my professional juniors has been the most fulfilling one. Dr Vimal: The healthcare industry, particularly oral healthcare, holds immense potential for business growth while simultaneously addressing the critical need for maintaining overall health. Oral health is gaining recognition as a fundamental aspect of well-being, and Clove Dental is at the forefront of this movement. Dentistry is serving its golden period at this time especially with the advent of new age materials and most recent cutting edge technology, which is changing the way dentistry has been practiced for the past 100 years. Last 4-5 years have brought in unimaginable technology in the hands of dentists for patients’ benefits. However, the challenge is being faced for delivery of treatments. The primary obstacle is the lack of awareness among the general population about the importance of oral health. This is the single most important factor of Oral Health and unfortunately our regulatory bodies have no focus on this. Most dental clinics suffer from inadequate infrastructure, subpar sterilization practices, poor quality services, lack of transparency, and safety concerns. Clove Dental aims to address these challenges by setting higher standards for ethical treatment and service quality. Dr Vimal: Clove Dental sets itself apart from competitors through a commitment to ethical treatment. The company does not overcharge patients and ensures that treatments are only recommended when necessary. It employs dedicated dental professionals who prioritize patient well-being. All dentists at Clove Dental are accredited and specialize in their respective fields. For instance, only experienced endodontists perform root canals, and implant procedures are carried out by dentists who have massive implant experience. The clinics are equipped with state-of-the-art technology and prioritize sterilization and asepsis. The introduction of AI-enabled chairside assistance and a patient care team available on call further enhances the patient experience. Dr Vimal: When the incidence of dental diseases in our country is as high as 85-87%, endless opportunities present themselves and the dentist who has vision will benefit from this. Along with growing awareness of oral health as an integral part of overall well-being, there is also innovation in dental technology and treatment methods. Compounding this issue, India has the lowest percentage of people who seek dental treatment themselves. If we rightly understand these two equations, we will also be clear about our priorities for the future. Dr Vimal: Clove Dental’s future plans are ambitious and visionary. The company aims to expand its presence even further by launching 1000+ clinics across India. This expansion will enable Clove Dental to provide affordable and high-quality dental treatment to a broader population, ensuring that oral healthcare is accessible to everyone. The company’s commitment to ethical practices, advanced technology, and patient-centric care will continue to be central to its mission and vision for the future.

    "article_content": "By Choudhury Rajeshwari Oct 18, 2023, 18:12 pm Celebrating 12 years anniversary, Harshna Pasari, Head of Marketing, BlueStone speaks with MI about their inception and learning over the years. At BlueStone, she caters to evolving consumer preferences through end-to-end brand and marketing strategy. She talks about the recent trends in the industry and campaigns planned for the year. Excerpts here: Harshna: In 2011, BlueStone was launched as an online brand with the idea of reaching customers who browse information, and trending products, and ultimately make purchases from different categories of jewelry. We wanted to understand consumers with this online data available to us. The move towards online retailing was also fresh for consumers because, till now, the jewelry industry was stuck in offline stores, where there is not much scope for research. Consumers in a brick-and-mortar store find it challenging to search for one’s own style or understand more about the prices of the product or brand without having stress over the timeline. Another issue that offline retail stores face is having limited inventory as compared to online platforms. Gradually, despite having a good online presence, we realized that we must be an omnichannel platform in the jewelry industry. It is because consumers are present in every channel, and we want to expand our reach to tap into every consumer base. So we opened our first store in 2018 without looking back. Today, we are 180 plus stores and still growing. Another thing we realized is that the industry always shows the occasion-based and heavy jewelry. But consumers nowadays have changed and don’t like these heavy pieces. Customers want trending and lightweight pieces that they can wear from a coffee to a party. Women have many other occasions to step out and flaunt their style and wealth. So the journey is ever-evolving for BlueStone, understanding more about consumers using our technology and wishing to serve the perfect product to each customer. Harshna: The retail footfall is showing an upward trend for us. In the financial year 2022, we had approximately 80 stores, which grew voraciously to 180 plus stores. Our walk-in store is also seeing an increase. Because consumers want to experience products, this category especially has an added layer of higher involvement. Also, more physical stores lead to more trusted consumer relationships. We also have a Try at Home service, which caters to the needs of the consumers today. People want to experience the product from their home or office convenience. Today, we are present with Try at Home across more than 80 cities and it is growing. Harshna: Traditionally, the jewelry industry was all local brands. People had visited the stores that used to be there for generations. Gradually, there came the brands that have a presence pan India. It created a trusted relationship with the customers. It led to people preferring these certified brands. We at BlueStone believe that our designs and the quality of our products are what consumers love and trust. Yes, there’s competition, but still, our products speak for themselves with volumes, and it’s the reason consumers love us and time again visit us. Harshna: No, it’s not. Having said that, real gold, diamond, and gemstone jewelry, are something that teenagers or adolescents can’t afford unless their parents are buying for them. So our TG mostly looks 25 to 50 years old, with people who prefer modern designs. Primarily, this modern jewelry is an indulgence and not a need. People want to purchase them because they want to flaunt their wealth, or portray their statement of personal style. Harshna: I already talked about some of the changes, with light jewelry replacing heavy pieces, which are perfectly wearable for all occasions. Second, the trend of buying gold jewelry for investment purposes has also changed. People are willing to buy more diamond and gemstone studded jewelry, because they’re modern and young. People also love different enamel and ceramic jewelry. Third, multivariability and layering are also in trend among women. They want stackable rings and layered necklaces. So they can add layers whenever they wish to dress heavily for a party or occasion. Fourth is a product that we introduced as a category called watch jewelry. As per our research, most modern women are using smartwatches. So, we decided to accentuate that with our fine jewelry. That is the watch jewelry. We have sub-categorized it to smartwatch pins, bands, and charms, which people can cling to the smartwatch. These are available in gold, diamond, gemstone, and enamel. Fifth, we have seen men’s jewelry being revisited. Traditionally, men used to wear jewelry. But in the last few decades, it was almost lost. The jewelry industry was all about women. But now, we see men also welcome fine jewelry as a statement of their style, which is growing for us. Harshna: The Big Gold Upgrade is quite an exciting and unique proposition. So, based on our consumer’s choices, we realized people don’t want to keep their jewelry in the lockers and want to add value to their old gold pieces. However, they don’t want to sell the jewelry because of its emotional value. We wanted to give our customers a relief and solution to this issue. The ‘old gold exchange’ was already present in the industry. But the problem attached to this is that they don’t get the correct value for their old gold. So, our idea was to give a higher value because we wanted to build that trust by understanding or evaluating their old jewelry with their emotional values. For instance, if you give 8 grams of 18 karat gold, BlueStone will give you 8 grams of 22 karat gold. It acts as an upgrade and not just an exchange. With this higher value, you can further purchase anything from BlueStone. The campaign helped us increase the sales in respect of getting new customers and returning ones. Though not a new phenomenon, getting a higher value to their existing old gold encourages customers to try this offer. Harshna: For the jewelry industry, the festive season is the biggest. Culturally, Indians purchase gold jewelry during the festivals, for it’s considered auspicious. We still believe this. So, we at BlueStone are also geared up for the season. Looking at the last few year’s trends, we are expecting higher sales compared to 2022. Last year, people were making purchases of diamond studded jewellery. Hence, this year, we have more diamond studded collections, newer products, and overall collections. The Big Gold Upgrade will continue to be a great offer for the season. Apart from that, we are geared up across 180 plus stores. Harshna: Not exactly! Primarily, brands offering heavy jewelry for occasions and parties are the ones that are affected by inflation. For example, people planning a wedding will cut their heavy jewelry expenditures to lighter ones during the inflation. Sometimes, they reduce the number of pieces they want to buy during inflation. But our pieces are lightweight, which is suitable for everyday wear. It is not always a planned decision and is more like an indulging one. Luckily, we don’t get affected by inflation. Harshna: Our focus will be on our recently launched, Big Gold Upgrade campaign which we consider to have a huge potential. We want to increase the reach of the campaign. We want people to know more about the campaign and upgrade their style. From a product collection point of view, we are looking at many new diamond products and diamond studded gold jewellery.

The stakes are high, and this is one recession proof brand. As the event picks up, those following the game are likely to increase.” Where is the IPL being watched? Urban Indians who are extremely kicked about the sporting event claimed to be watching the IPL 2024 across different mediums of access – Television (75%), online/ mobile (49%), OTT platforms (20%) and radio (4%) . 33%).

With defending champions Chennai Super Kings hosting the opening and closing ceremony, there is a keen interest among south zone fans for the game and across cities and cohorts.

How we did it We ran the survey on Ipsos IndiaBus, our monthly pan India omnibus (which also runs multiple client surveys), using a structured questionnaire and is conducted by Ipsos India on diverse topics among 2200+ respondents from SEC A, B and C households, covering adults of both genders from all four zones in the country. The survey is conducted in metros, tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3 towns, providing a more robust and representative view of urban Indians. The respondents were polled face to face and online.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline May 15, 2024, 12:17 pm Clubber TV, a leading platform for live and on-demand sports in Ireland, will be utilising Magnifi , an AI-powered highlight generation platform, for coverage of two of the nation’s most iconic sports. As part of this engagement, Clubber TV will use Magnifi to capture sport highlights, which will then be published to its social channels on Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. With Magnifi, Clubber TV can auto-generate clips for some of their key sports like Hurling/ Camogie and Gaelic football using sport-specific metatags. The AI-powered solutions by Magnifi can very efficiently be used with tags like “Puckouts won/lost” or “turnover” and auto-generate clips of those actions in Hurling/Camogie and Gaelic football respectively. Highlights are created much faster than the traditional method of sifting through footage and manually identifying and cutting highlights. This speed aligns with Clubber TV’s mandate as a platform for live and on-demand sports. “At Clubber TV, we already deliver the best live and on-demand sports to Irish fans, whenever and wherever they desire. With this in mind, it only makes sense for us to also prioritise speed and convenience when providing highlights from those games. With Magnifi, we can now publish highlights with the same level of efficiency,” said Jimmy Doyle, the founder and CEO of Clubber TV. While Magnifi already works with major teams, franchises, and leagues across the globe in sports like cricket, basketball, football, and baseball, its engagement with Clubber TV marks its first use case for Hurling/Camogie and Gaelic football, each of which is significant in its own right. These sports are deeply ingrained into Irish sporting culture. Hurling is one of the world’s oldest field games and its national championship in Ireland draws substantial crowds. Gaelic football, for its part, has competitions at the local, county, and national levels, and has gained traction in many other countries around the world through the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). “As sports deeply loved by Irish fans, Hurling/Camogie and Gaelic football already enjoy widespread viewership. We look forward to enhancing highlights from these sports through Magnifi. By doing so, we can provide fans with the content they need, and Clubber TV in growing the reach and revenue of their coverage,” said Vinayak Shrivastava, the CEO of Magnifi.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 14, 2024, 11:33 am The Malaysian Cricket Association (MCA), the governing body for the sport in the country, will be utilising Magnifi, an AI-powered highlight generation platform, for its cricket coverage. As part of this engagement, the Malaysian Cricket Association will use Magnifi to capture cricket highlights. This process is done through the use of cricket-specific metatags, such as a Boundary, Six, Sweep or even a spin ball which can be refined through additional filters. For example, the MCA can generate clips of sweeps from a certain batsman or spins from only right-handed bowlers. These clips can then be distributed to MCA’s social media channels on Facebook, Instagram, X, and LinkedIn, complete with its iconic wickets-based logo and distinctive red, blue, white, and yellow visual identity. Because Malaysia has been traditionally dominated by other sports, such as badminton, sepak takraw, or even basketball, MCA’s use of Magnifi will grow cricket viewership in the country. MCA notably leverages Magnifi for not only men’s cricket but also women’s cricket. Since MCA is a member of the Asian Cricket Council and an associate member of the International Cricket Council, it will also use Magnifi for coverage of its international matches. Vinayak Shrivastava, the CEO of Magnifi , believes the engagement will advance the popularity of cricket among different demographics in Malaysia. “MCA proves just how democratic and inclusive AI like Magnifi can be. With our solution, MCA will highlight women cricket players, who have traditionally been overlooked by mainstream coverage. They will also spotlight how Malaysian cricket teams can thrive on the world stage. These two factors bode well for the continued success of the sport in Malaysia,” said Shrivastava. Magnifi is proud to contribute to the growth of cricket viewership in Malaysia, along with other markets in the world. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Feb 08, 2024, 10:42 am Westland Books announced the release of its political non-fiction titled Audacious Hope: An Archive of How Democracy Is Being Saved in India authored by political researcher and professor Indrajit Roy. The book is an archive of efforts by citizens in India to resist the tools of authoritarianism being deployed in present-day India. The book also documents major protests in the country over the last few decades. Audacious Hope is published by Westland Non-Fiction, an imprint of Westland Books, and is slated to release on 12 February 2024. Catering to academicians, students, scholars, researchers and anyone curious about the political situation of the country, the book talks about, among other things, the 2020 Farmers Protest, which united farmers across state borders and the national outcry in response to the controversial CAA legislation, as well as anti-caste struggles and artistic responses to the crisis India is today faced with. The book also depicts numerous ways how citizens came to aid each other during the pandemic along with the testing of free-speech boundaries by cultural activists. Speaking on the launch of his book, political researcher & author Indrajit Roy said, “Few can doubt that India’s democracy faces an existential threat today. But ordinary Indians- farmers, students, workers, lawyers, doctors, and activists- are resisting the erosion of our beloved democracy. Troubled times invite despair, but the manifold efforts of Indians striving to defend their democracy shows that hope is not lost. Chronicling their efforts is essential to building an archive of how democracy may yet be saved in India and beyond.” Westland’s Ajitha GS said, “Indrajit Roy’s book is an important archival project that serves two purposes: to remind us of the challenges that continue to lie ahead and to tell us that there is always hope. We are delighted to be able to publish this book in our research- and narrative-driven Westland Non-Fiction list.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Feb 13, 2024, 16:33 pm In a moving course of events, a one-of-its-kind book named “Mandeep Meets Mandeep” was launched in New Delhi in the presence of renowned Bollywood actress and author Tisca Chopra. The book is non-fiction and based on a real-life story about a patient named Mandeep who won his battle against blood cancer when his namesake Mandeep came forward as the perfect match for a stem cell transplant. The book “Mandeep Meets Mandeep,” which is authored by Dr. Sona Sharma, a medical professional and writer, is based on true events that unfold a remarkable tale of two lives, both named Mandeep, intertwined by fate and a shared HLA-type. Mandeep, a blood cancer survivor and 35-year-old farmer from Punjab, was diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in 2009. Unfortunately, though Mandeep was advised for a stem cell transplant, he could not find a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matched stem cell donor within his family. Mandeep had to wait for over 3 years before an HLA-matching unrelated donor was identified with the help of DKMS BMST Foundation India, and he underwent a stem cell transplant in January 2020. Despite diverse backgrounds, their unique genetic match offered a chance at survival. The story weaves through sacrifice, community support, and the delicate balance of life, connecting two individuals destined for an extraordinary encounter. Patrick Paul, CEO, DKMS-BMST Foundation India, said, “Facilitating life-changing connections is at the heart of our mission at DKMS-BMST. Witnessing Mandeep Singh’s journey, from the desperate search for a donor to the emotional meeting with Mandeep Mann, reinforces our commitment. Every successful transplant is a testament to the impact of collective generosity. We stand proud, connecting heroes like Mandeep Singh and Mandeep Mann, highlighting the profound ripple effect of selfless acts and the hope for second chances.” As the distinguished chief guest, Tisca Chopra, expressed, “Learning about this inspiring story deeply touched my heart. In India, numerous patients await lifesaving stem cell transplants, yet the shortage of registered donors poses a significant challenge. Today, I’ve personally taken a vital step to register as a potential stem cell donor, and I encourage others to join this noble cause. Your contribution can bring hope to countless individuals grappling with life-threatening diseases.” Blood cancer survivor Mandeep Singh, who was also present at the event, said, “At first, I felt helpless facing cancer’s grip. The journey to find a match was daunting, like searching for a needle in a haystack. Finally, the incredible moment arrived when I found my donor, Mandeep Mann, through the DKMS-BMST database. His selfless stem cell donation granted me a new life, and meeting him was an indescribable joy, a profound gratitude that words can’t capture. I am extremely thankful to DKMS-BMST for making this journey possible for me.” “Being a stem cell donor has given me a sense of great pride. My motivation stemmed from empathy and a desire to make a difference. Juggling a demanding career and caring for my wife, who is battling cancer, was challenging. Yet, donating stem cells felt like destiny. Meeting him was a surreal experience, bridging two worlds through a shared name and genetic bond. It’s a profound reminder of the power of compassion and the interconnectedness of lives,” said Mandeep Mann as he shared his lifesaving experience as a stem cell donor. Every five minutes, a new case of blood cancer or a blood disorder, such as Thalassemia or Aplastic Anemia, emerges in India. The scarcity of matching blood stem cell donors poses a significant hurdle for patients in dire need of lifesaving transplants. In collaboration with these initiatives, DKMS-BMST aims to raise awareness about blood stem cell donation and register potential lifesavers across diverse segments of society. Over 41 million potential unrelated donors are listed globally with stem cell donor centers and registries, but only 0.6 million are Indians. More potential blood stem cell donors should register from India to address this gap. Registration is a quick 5-minute process. If you’re between 18 and 55 years old and in generally good health, take the initial step to register as a blood stem cell donor by requesting your home swab kit at www.dkms-bmst.org/register .

In Femina ’s February 2024 issue, the multi-talented artist offers us a glimpse into her process of role selection, candidly discussing the transformative shifts that have shaped her recent endeavours. The Cover Story offers an exclusive insight into the actor’s journey. Speaking about the way she approaches her work, Raveena reveals, “It is my strong belief that… every day is a new chapter and a new learning experience. I never close myself to that, since I am a director’s actor. I leave myself at home when I’m on the set, and hand myself over to the director to mould me into the character that is solely his or her vision.” About her most recent role, she says, “In Karmma Calling, I play an unapologetically rich and powerful, high-society lady, the ultra-glamorous Indrani Kothari who does not shy away from deceit or betrayal. What excites me is doing something completely different from what I’ve done last, and Indrani was that.” With regard to her life’s philosophy, Raveena shares, “I don’t expect anything from anything or anyone… If it comes to you, great; it will be a pleasant surprise. If it doesn’t, you continue putting in your hard work and leave it to the audiences and to fate. It’s something I learned from my dad, and never let go of.” In this interview, Raveena exudes positivity and resilience, transcending the noise of trolls and embracing the joys of family and career with grace.

With each new role she has essayed, she has showcased a talent that demands attention. Her compelling performances in Gehraiyaan and Kho Gaye Hum Kahan have been especially praised, highlighting her ability to tackle complex characters with depth and sensitivity. In the April 2024 edition of Femina, the dynamic actor shares insights into her flourishing career, the intricacies of fame, and the vital role of female friendships in her life. Talking about her love for the camera, Ananya shares, “It’s not something that I’m used to, or I feel I’ll ever get used to – and I don’t want to get used to it because I like having that wonder, excitement and happiness. Every day, being in front of the camera, being on set, makes me just feel really, really joyful. Every time I step on the set, it brings me joy. Every time!” Speaking about her progression as an actor, Ananya admits it was with Kho Gaye Hum Kahan that she finally felt validated as an actor. “I think everything happens at the right time. The stars align when you’re at the right age. You look a certain way; you feel certain things in your life that are able to lend to the characters you’re playing.” In this interview, Ananya also sheds light on life, lessons, and making her mark in Bollywood.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Feb 19, 2024, 14:39 pm Bringing viewers content with a purpose, Sony Entertainment Television’s latest offering, “ Kuch Reet Jagat Ki Aisi Hai ” is a compelling drama that sees the homely, vivacious, and responsible Nandini, challenge the conventional Dahej Pratha that exists in our country. Shrouded in tradition, “dowry” is the price a woman pays with her dignity and Nandini’s stark demand – “ mujhe mera dahej waapas chahiye”, paves the way for a story that matters. With this show, the channel promises to deliver an empowering narrative, with an aim to entertain as well as educate the masses with relevant issues that exist in our society. At the heart of “Kuch Reet Jagat Ki Aisi Hai” is Meera Deosthale’s portrayal of Nandini and her character serves as a beacon of strength, challenging age-old beliefs that demean the self-respect of women. Set in the milieu of Gujarat, the show puts the spotlight on Nandini, who has been raised by her maternal uncle and aunt, played by Jagat Rawat and Sejal Jha . Deeply rooted in tradition, Nandini respects her elders, she’s well-read, and is progressive in her thoughts. Her Mama has taught her to question what she doesn’t understand, and Nandini does so fearlessly. Actor Zaan Khan essays the role of Nandini’s husband, Naren Ratanshi, while actors Dharmesh Vyas and Khushi Rajpoot play the roles of her in-laws, Hemraj Ratanshi and Chanchal Ratanshi. Despite the backdrop of a seemingly content married life, the show chronicles her courageous journey as she takes a stand against her in-laws and the custom of dowry, unveiling a poignant tale of resilience and empowerment. Watch “Kuch Reet Jagat Ki Aisi Hai” every Monday to Friday at 8.30 PM, only on Sony Entertainment Television. Neeraj Vyas, Business Head – Sony Entertainment Television, Sony SAB, PAL, and Sony MAX Movie Cluster, commented, “We are committed to delivering narratives that not only entertain but also inspire change. Through the introduction of a powerful character like Nandini, we aim to ignite meaningful conversations that catalyse social impact. Our approach is rooted in a deep understanding of the Indian consumer, and we believe that by presenting a story that captures the nation’s attention, it will resonate strongly with audiences.” JD Majethia , Hats Off Productions, commented, “The dowry system is still a threatening reality, not just in rural India but in metropolitan cities as well. It’s got a new language now, “Humein kuch nahi chaiye, aap apni beti ko khushi se jo dena chaho woh deejiye”. Why do we value a woman’s life, her worth, against the amount of gold and gifts she brings in dowry? Questions like these need to be raised again and again and our show aims to shed light on many such practices that are disguised as tradition. We are delighted to collaborate with a strong ensemble cast of actors who will deliver impactful performances in this story scripted by renowned writers that promises to strike a chord with viewers across the country.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Apr 27, 2024, 17:46 pm Navigating the turbulent seas of life can seem daunting with obstacles and uncertainties challenging every step one wants to take towards a chosen path. During such times, having a ‘saaRthi’ is like having a force akin to a lighthouse guiding ships through treacherous waters. ‘Krishna Mohini’ traces the journey of Krishna, who personifies the essence of sisterhood as she weathers any number of storms for her brother Mohan as his ‘saaRthi’ . Breaking stereotypes, their bond transcends conventional roles, as the show promises to redefine the core of a brother-sister relationship with its belief ‘Krishna Behen Ka Farz Aise Nibhayegi…Ki Duniya Mein, Rakhi Ki Paribhasha Badal Jayegi’ . Showcasing this endearing bond between a brother and sister, COLORS is all geared up to present ‘Krishna Mohini’ set against Dwarka’s scenic beauty and coastal charm. Starring Debattama Saha as Krishna, Ketaki Kulkarni as Mohan, and Fahmaan Khan as Aryaman, and produced by Susanta Das and Nispal Singh’s Boyhood Productions, ‘Krishna Mohini’ premieres on the 29th April and will air every day at 7:00 pm only on COLORS. Alok Jain, President, General Entertainment, Viacom18, say s , “ At COLORS, we are committed in pioneering stories that deeply resonate with our viewers’ emotions. Our new offering ‘Krishna Mohini’, is one such story that celebrates the unbreakable bond between a brother and sister, defying stereotypes and transcending the connections beyond traditional roles. The show underlines the importance of having a ‘saaRthi’ by one’s side further tracing the journey of an elder sister who is a guiding light for her brother. With this heartfelt narrative we aim to foster a deep emotional connection that goes beyond entertainment.” Embodying the timeless virtues of Lord Krishna as a ‘saaRthi’ and margdarshak to Arjun, the 21-year-old Krishna portrays the role of a ‘saaRthi’ to her brother Mohan. Her journey epitomizes resilience and support, showcasing the enduring power of familial bonds. This voyage is not merely a tale of a sister serving as a steadfast guiding force in his journey, but it also anchors the journey of Krishna who is destined to meet Aryaman. He is a reticent businessman who abandoned his musical aspirations to pursue entrepreneurship and is reminded of his days as a musician, blown away by her singing prowess. With her bringing back Aryaman’s zest for life, how will fate tie him to the journey of Krishna and Mohan? Talking about portraying the character of Krishna, Debattama Saha says, “Bringing Krishna’s character to life in ‘Krishna Mohini’ has been an absolute privilege. Like a ‘saaRthi’ illuminating the darkest nights, Krishna’s character casts a light to her brother, and is always ready to protect him from life’s tumultuous seas. The universal theme of unconditional and boundless love makes Krishna Mohini an ode to the unbreakable bond shared between brothers and sisters.” Fahmaan Khan playing the role of Aryaman expresses, “Having a saaRthi, a true companion is like discovering a guiding star in the vast expanse of the night sky. I’m excited to be part of ‘Krishna Mohini’ that tributes these saaRthis. In this show, I will be seen essaying the role of Aryaman, a successful businessman, hard-working and determined, however, beneath the façade of success lies a backstory that shapes his journey. As the story will unfold, the collision of Krishna and Aryaman’s worlds, each carrying their burdens and aspirations, promises to unravel a gripping tale.” Witness the beautifully encapsulated role of a saaRthi in ‘Krishna Mohini’ premiering on the 29th April at 7:00 pm and thereafter every day only on COLORS!

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 13, 2024, 13:38 pm Sony SAB’s admired show ‘Vanshaj’ completes its one-year journey and emerges as a gripping family drama touching upon the battle for inheritance based on capabilities. Over the past year, viewers have been captivated by the show, watching the characters evolve and navigate family dynamics in their quest to achieve the leadership of the Mahajan empire. From power struggles to battles for justice, Vanshaj has expertly portrayed the highs and lows of human emotions, resonating deeply with audiences nationwide. Vanshaj has grown into a gripping series with exciting character development. DJ’s (played by Mahir Pandhi) schemes have become more evil, adding to the suspense while Yuvika (Anjali Tatrari) has changed from an emotional girl into a strong woman who counters up against DJ’s manipulative moves. As the show completes a year, fans are excitedly waiting for new surprises and twists, drawn in by its powerful storytelling and intense drama. Mahir Pandhi as Digvijay Mahajan, said, “Vanshaj has been an extraordinary journey for me. Portraying DJ, a villainous character, has been incredibly fulfilling experience, allowing me to explore new dimensions as an actor. It’s heartwarming to see the love and acceptance from our audience, even for a negative character like DJ. I take immense pride in being part of a show that has in the last one year entertained viewers with its compelling storytelling.” Anjali Tatrari as Yuvika Mahajan, said, “Challenging patriarchy and portraying Yuvika over the last one year has been both rewarding and fulfilling. I think I have manifested this show, as three months before I stared shooting for Vanshaj, I had the opportunity to visit Rishikesh with my mother, and I prayed to Ganga Maa to call me back. It felt like a wish granted when signed the sow and learnt that the initial shoot for the show was scheduled in Rishikesh. Building Yuvika’s character from scratch has been a challenging yet fulfilling experience. The love and recognition from fans is overwhelming, and it’s heartening to know that people now recognize me as Yuvika.” Puneet Issar as Bhanupratap Mahajan, said “Vanshaj is like a rock among TV serials, standing tall and unshaken through all storms. As we celebrate one year of the show, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the entire team, the co-actors and the entire crew. Playing Bhanupratap has been an incredible journey, and I am proud to be part of a show that consistently delivers powerful and engaging storytelling. Here’s to many more milestones and continued success!” Stay tuned and watch Vanshaj, Mon-Sat at 7:00 PM and 10:00 PM only on Sony SAB Your email address will not be published.

Commenting on the association, Shri Sanjiv Chadha, MD & CEO, Bank of Baroda said, “Bank of Baroda has a history of associating with ace athletes and sportspersons as its brand endorsers and being a crucial part of their journey. The Bank continuously supports the youth of the country through its various banking and non-banking initiatives and this announcement reflects the Bank’s ethos of adding value to its customer experience by choosing youth icons like Shafali to inspire them. Shafali’s personality resonates grit, determination and dependability which reflects the Bank’s brand ideologies.” On this occasion, Cricketer Shafali Verma said, “I am humbled and proud of being associated with an institution whose legacy is more than a century old. I am extremely grateful to Bank of Baroda for this association and for believing in my potential. I personally connect with the Bank’s forward-looking vision and its futuristic approach in all spheres of banking and technology.” “We are extremely thankful to Bank of Baroda for their association with Shafali. Bank of Baroda has supported & is supporting some of the iconic sportspersons of India,” said Tuhin Mishra, Managing Director, Baseline Ventures , who exclusively manages Ms. Shafali Verma. Further, he added, “Shafali has had an amazing start to her career & such kind of support will only propagate her to put in more effort & bring laurels for India.” Shafali has created various records, one of which is when she became the youngest woman cricketer to play for India in her debut game against South Africa. Shafali brings in a natural connection with today’s youth, especially women and she exuberates sportsman spirit and qualities on and off-field. The youngest Indian to top any ICC list, Shafali is hailed as one of the promising talents to watch out for in Women’s Cricket. The explosive top-order batswoman is currently playing across all formats for India.

    "article_content": "By Team MI Dec 16, 2022, 16:08 pm Bank of Baroda, one of India’s leading public sector banks, today announced the launch of the 2nd edition of Green Ride – Ek Pehal Swachh Hawa Ki Aur , an initiative with environment advocate and fitness enthusiast, Milind Soman. Under this initiative, Milind will embark on an 8-day sustainable journey on a bicycle and an electric scooter, promoting eco-friendly transportation, a green lifestyle as well as the importance of health & fitness. The 1400 kms Green Ride will be flagged off from Mumbai on 19th December and conclude in Mangaluru on 26th December 2022. En route, Milind will visit Pune, Bengaluru and Mysuru as well. He will interact with Bank of Baroda’s employees, customers, and his fans in each city to spread the message of the importance of clean air, encouraging people to adopt sustainable & energy-efficient modes of transportation and making fitness a priority in one’s everyday life. On this collaboration, Shri Sanjiv Chadha, Managing Director & CEO, Bank of Baroda said, “There is a growing realization and recognition, now more than ever before, that all of us need to do our bit to protect the environment. Pollution has several harmful effects and by taking small steps towards a more sustainable lifestyle, we too can contribute immensely towards a greener environment. Bank of Baroda is proud to continue its association with Mr. Milind Soman for the Green Ride as we endeavour to raise awareness and rally all Indians together to take concerted action now.” “At Bank of Baroda, we have taken a couple of important initiatives that will help in preserving the environment. Under a unique initiative called “Plant A Tree”, the Bank will plant a fruit bearing tree on behalf of its customers for every Auto Loan or Home Loan disbursed over the next three years. We have also implemented Paperless Office for internal approvals, significantly reducing the usage of paper across the organisation,” Shri Chadha added. Milind Soman said, “My message to people is simple – all the progress and advancement that we have achieved as a society is futile if we do not have pure air to breathe. If each one of us makes a change in our day-to-day lives – walk/ cycle short distances instead of drive, plant a sapling, reuse/recycle etc. – we will collectively be able to make a significant difference to our environment. My experience last year on the first Green Ride was overwhelming, with the enthusiasm and interest shown by people all through the journey still fresh in my memory. And I am eagerly looking forward to this year’s Ride as we spread the message of pursuing a healthy and more sustainable existence.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 20, 2024, 12:55 pm Rajit Gupta has been hired as a VP and Creative Head for Cheil X, Mumbai , which is an independent full-service agency under the Cheil SWA group to manage the fast-growing new client mandates in India . With a proven track record of crafting compelling campaigns and pushing creative boundaries, Rajit will play a pivotal role in shaping Cheil X’s creative oeuvre and driving client success. In his current role, Rajit will report to Vikash Chemjong, CCO, Cheil India. His appointment comes at the heels of the agency beefing up its Mumbai operations to increase its focus on exploring new expansion opportunities in the region. Rajit joins the team from McCann Worldgroup, where he held the position of Executive Creative Director and helmed the creative execution of G20 summit in India last year. He has more than 17 years of experience in the dynamic world of advertising, collaborating with top-tier brands and agencies globally. His repertoire of work includes stints with agencies like J. Walter Thompson, Publicis, DDB Mudra, and Contract Advertising. He has extensive experience across a wide breadth of industries, having worked on brands like Air India, Incredible India, Coke, Pepsi, Volkswagen, Dominoes, Nestle Maggi, and Nescafe. His work has been consistently recognized and celebrated at national & international award shows, including a grand prix. Vikash Chemjong, CCO Cheil India , said, “There is a lot that Rajit brings to the table. His understanding of brands. His sense of design. His typography. His experience at some of the best agencies in the country. His tally of metals. Not to mention his eloquence and effortless good looks! But these aren’t the only reason we at the agency were impressed about him. He has this vibe. An edge. A mojo so to say. Or simply put, an X factor! Which probably is what makes him such an excellent fit for Cheil X! We are lucky to have him. And I’m sure our clients will feel the same very soon.” Commenting on his appointment, Rajit said , “Why Cheil?” That’s what everyone asked me when they heard the news, even Poppins, my dog. He wasn’t thrilled about his walk being moved from 10:00am to 7:00am. I tried to tell him that discipline is good for us, but he sensed there was more to it. He knew that the only reason I’d walk out of a nine year old stint is because I was ready for my second innings. I embraced the idea of transformation. A change in perspective, format, culture and city. I feel a renewed energy to accept this challenge because, as creatives, that’s what we do! We evolve and create something better. Joining Cheil X in Mumbai is like joining a start-up with the backing of a powerful company. It offers the flexibility of a start-up with the stability and resources of an established firm. It’s an opportunity to create impactful work with a confidence that comes from solid backing”. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline May 29, 2024, 19:00 pm Are you a qualified entrepreneur? Have you ever taken a loan to manage your business performance? Do you know the most common mistakes people make when applying for loans meant for business purposes? This blog must be read thoroughly to understand the answers to the given questions. Going back to the basics, business consultants state that entrepreneurs should avoid making common mistakes while calculating loans to be payable through easy monthly installments. As explained by experts, taking a personal loan can help with various expenditures related to business ventures. Personal loans could be used to attend a medical emergency or to construct a second storey of a one-storey building. However, as qualified entrepreneurs, we must be extremely careful to fully understand the implications of taking a loan for your business. It is interesting to note that people, more often than not, use personal loan calculators to understand EMI pay outs. EMI calculator can help entrepreneurs to take a close estimate for making a monthly repayment within a stringent budget. EMI calculators are available online tools that can help you plan your finances. However, experts suggest that avoiding common mistakes on EMI calculators can help you make a close estimate of your monthly expenditures. Understanding Business Loan EMIs and Calculations In the contemporary context, young entrepreneurs work carefully on business loans being applied for. Consultants state that they plan to finalise a business loan as desired. A majority of young entrepreneurs prefer to go for collateral-free business loans . Therefore, avoiding the most common mistakes is naturally implied. For a generic understanding, it is always advisable that entrepreneurs carefully work towards taking an optimal business loan amount to minimise the risk associated with it. An optimal value for a business loan might vary from one business to the other. However, a careful estimation can be done based on several factors. Cross-checking of business loans that you plan to borrow is required, as the estimation needs to be aligned with your financial obligations as well. Before making a valid loan application, an entrepreneur must make a careful online calculation. Certain common errors that need to be avoided remain to be listed as follows: Young entrepreneurs should take a close look at the business obligations, regular cash inflow and product management aspects before making a rough estimation of the loan amount to be applied for Sometimes, borrowers fail to consider the tenure for loan repayment. This might cause a huge difference in estimating the interest amount paid compared to the principal amount. Reducing the tenure would also reduce the interest rates, but one needs to keep in mind other financial obligations. This is another gross mistake that needs to be avoided, as interest rates remain a factor while calculating the repayable amount. Not paying attention to interest rates can create confusion regarding the amount to be repaid within the defined tenure. Many borrowers only focus on the amount to be borrowed. They hardly heed processing charges, penalties related to pre-payment or charges associated with late repayment. Not taking heed of these charges would keep you in the dark regarding the total amount to be paid. Certain reputed financial institutions, including banks, offer prepayment options. Only some banks have this facility, but computing it might help the entrepreneur correctly calculate the loan amount. Early repayments can be planned based on certain benefits. It is best to discuss this with the concerned authorities before making a final decision. To conclude, we must accept that borrowers are usually available online. The EMI calculator is useful for calculating your monthly installment payments based on the borrowed principal amount. Instant determination of EMI can be done by computation of the following aspects: Qualified financial consultants suggest that non-banking finance corporations (NBFCs) are the best option when applying for a business loan. NBFCs provide several options for young entrepreneurs while offering flexible repayment schedules. A major aspect remains the quick processing of business loans, with minimum processing charges. Approaching an NBFC can help you choose the right loan amount for the business’s financial obligations. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 03, 2024, 17:23 pm Media as the Fourth Pillar of Democracy: Media is considered as the fourth pillar of democracy but faces increasing pressure from Governing Class, whether the legislature, executive, corporates and more. There are structured attempts by them to align the media in order to achieve their agenda. Governments exert pressure on media through advertising influence or use of state machinery to threaten so that the press can be prevented from publishing factual information. Zee Media’s flagship channel – Zee News , recently faced an alarming incident of Governmental suppression of media’s independence. On 23 rd May, 2024 an interview of Chief Minister of Delhi, Shri. Arvind Kejriwal was conducted by a senior journalist of Zee News. Post the interview, the independent editorial team at Zee Media decided not to telecast it, keeping in mind some objectionable content in the interaction. Some portions of the interview were telecasted as well but the spokesperson of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) kept insisting that “Zee News must publish the entire interview else it will face consequences like withdrawal of advertising (which was substantial on a monthly basis) by Punjab Government at the least” . I wondered, what else will they do to penalise/prosecute our freedom. I discovered soon that the Government of Punjab forced a black out across the state, leveraging a monopoly of a particular Multiple System Operator (MSO). The black out was forced, not only for Zee News, but also for Zee PHH & Zee Delhi NCR. The state government also extended the blackout of Zee Entertainment channels. To add further AAP withdrew all the spokespersons from participating in debates held by Zee Media’s news channels. Unfortunately, none of our fellow News networks raised any voice. Zee group neither could provide true news nor it could entertain its loyal viewers of Punjab for good 8 days. Zee fought this battle independently and got the channels restored by seeking justice through a legal approach. This is a real time and live example of political parties suppressing us as a fourth state. Today it is Zee, while tomorrow it can be any other news channel, news publication or platform. On 3 rd May 2024, which is celebrated annually as World Press Freedom Day, I released a video message, expressing my thoughts and views on freedom of press. This video went viral within a short frame of time. The media fraternity appreciated this step. Most of them were even shocked and surprised yet noticed this bold statement of mine. As a result, my office received 54 press interview requests. Hence, I took a yet another proactive step and conducted a Media-Meet Press Conference, leading to a constructive round of conversation with the senior members of the media-fraternity. The after effects of the viral video led to various speculations and the governing class demanded explanation. Zee Media could not only explain the reason (As mentioned above) and added that it was not directed to any particular party or person(s). Infact, this step worked in favour of the fourth estate, since Zee Media got an assurance from the system that post elections, they will work with/in the new Government and make efforts to improve the ranking of India from the current 159 th position amongst 180 nations. I was told that the mentioned rating is low since two decades and the respective governments did not attend to this issue. Unfortunately, many of the news channels, newspapers, social media and digital platforms have started accepting the pressure as part of life, instead of resisting or voicing out their disagreement. This is one reason why India ranks 159 th out of 180 in terms of press freedom. The natural blame gets inclined towards the Government, but the media itself is equally responsible. These incidences are not isolated. Various organisations/people in the governing class (political, bureaucracy, corporates and others with money-mussels) have historically employed numerous tactics to suppress media organisations, from leveraging advertising revenue to exerting pressure through corporate avenues and use of investigating agencies. Despite these challenges, Zee Media’s news channels and platforms have steadfastly upheld its credibility and commitment to public interest journalism. I not only recognise but also take pride in the importance of a free press in a democratic society and condemn any attempts to stifle journalistic freedom. The governing class has forgotten the defeat of Mrs. Indira Gandhi post emergency era. One of the major reasons of her own team’s atrocities did not come to light or to her notice; because the same team had suppressed the media. If she knew about those horrific things, she would have never let it happen to people, hence I believe that media’s freedom is important and essential for the senior/top leadership of the Government of the day. Zee Media’s news channels and platforms will continue to focus on public interest stories, bringing crucial information to the forefront regardless of external pressures. I would like to reinforce Zee Media’s Commitment towards strengthening the Fourth Estate: Despite these challenges, Zee Media remains committed to deliver unbiased and credible news focused on public interest. I urge all stakeholders, including our viewers and regulatory bodies, to recognize and stand against these threats to press freedom. A free and independent media is crucial for the health of our beloved Country in terms of it’s economy, the social structure, protection of weaker people of society, reduction of corruption and finally the democracy . I and my team are ready to pay a price or face any consequences, to keep fulfilling our ‘Dharma’ towards our readers/viewers. Zee Media has always aimed to set an example for other media organizations through its work practices and core values. Key pointers that highlight its commitment are as follows: Let us be in it together. Jai Hind- Jai Bharat Dr. Subhash Chandra Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 04, 2024, 11:35 am Source: Unsplash The nation of India is renowned for its bustling culture, natural beauty, and fast-growing economy. Every year, many people decide to relocate from the UK to India. If you have been considering whether or not to take this step, there are many factors to consider. In this guide, we will look at the benefits and challenges of moving to India from the UK, and how you can make the most of life in the country. The Republic of India, also known as Hindustan or Bharat, is located in South Asia and has a diverse climate, ranging from alpine areas in the north to tropical beaches in the south. Although it’s well-known as a popular destination for travelers and backpackers, it can also be a great place to move to permanently. If you decide to relocate from the UK, cash buyers like We Buy Any Home in Swansea and other areas can help you to sell your house quickly and easily. Property prices in India are much lower than in the UK, so you can get much more for your money there. India’s job market is one of the fastest-growing in the world, especially in the tech sector. Combined with the low cost of living, the country can be an ideal location in which to work, save, and explore opportunities. In addition, the culture is long, storied, and vibrant, with diverse languages, traditions, and festivals. India can be an excellent place to discover more about others and yourself. Source: Unsplash Although there are many benefits of moving to India, it can also be very challenging. The country’s culture and languages are extremely different from that of the UK, which can be difficult to adjust to. Social norms are notably different, and generally considered to be much more influenced by religion than those in the UK. How well you fit in is likely to depend on your specific personality traits and worldview! Aside from cultural challenges, there are also bureaucratic ones. While a travel visa can be acquired in only a couple of weeks, getting permanent Indian citizenship can vary in difficulty and time taken, depending on factors such as your heritage. One highly recommended step when moving to a new country is to learn its language. Many languages are spoken in India, with the most common being Hindi — finding out which language is most common in the part of the country you want to move to is a good idea. Alongside this integration, many expats also enjoy joining expat communities to make friends. To make the most of life in the country, you should also experience what makes it unique. Indian cuisine is popular all over the world and for good reason! Practices like yoga and Ayurveda have also traveled globally, but they originated in India, and the country is home to their best teachers. Relocating from the UK to India is a huge step, and has both challenges and rewards. When making such a big decision, you should always weigh each factor carefully, and do plenty of research. If in doubt, why not visit the country first and see what life is like there? Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 10, 2024, 11:20 am In the casino and online gambling industry, game design plays a critical role in attracting and retaining players. In addition to the striking visuals and exciting features that are also offered from your phone if you Pin Up Casino APP download , game developers are increasingly using psychological triggers to create a fun and addictive gaming experience. These triggers tap into fundamental aspects of human psychology to stimulate specific emotions, behaviors, and motivations in players. One of the strongest psychological triggers present in designing casino games is the feeling of success or reward; games are always designed in a way that they are rewarding to the players through a system of bonus rounds, free spins, and multipliers. These rewards engage the release of dopamine in the brain, creating a sensation of satisfaction while at the same time acting as motivation for the players to keep chasing the next “rush” of positive emotions and stay in the game. Additionally, many games include progression elements such as: These features appeal to players’ inner desire to grow, improve, and demonstrate their abilities, creating a constant cycle of engagement and motivation. The other powerful psychological trigger in casino game design is the idea of social proof. People are naturally known to emulate the actions and choices of others, more so in uncertain scenarios. This is where the game developers tap in by showing the popularity of some games, big wins from other players, and encouraging social sharing of gaming experience. Almost similar to social proof, limited time offers and urgency are yet another spawn of FOMO. Most often, games in the casino tend to use special offers, bonuses, and other calls to action, with an urgency element, in pushing players to participate right now; the value that could be missed out on is unimaginable. This is a psychological trigger that can really hype up the motivation for the players to be very active and involved. The illusion of control also plays an important role in the psychology of player engagement. Many of the games developed by casinos have elements that give the players an illusion of power over the outcome, even if the grounds are random. For example, in slots, some features are “stop the reel,” while blackjack and poker games tend to include a little skill or strategy. Although they don’t exactly change your base probability of winning, they add a sense of control and involvement to the fun. Modern casino games have an essential design that influences the behavior of the player and gives rise to continued long-term engagement due to psychological triggers. From that sweet sense of accomplishment and social proof to the illusion of control and the delicate balance between the familiar and the new, game developers arm themselves with psychological tools to create fun and addictive game experiences.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 10, 2024, 17:18 pm When preparing for a trip from Delhi to Vietnam, you need to do more than just choose the cheapest flight. Weather is a significant aspect of your journey because it determines how comfy and fun it will be. From Hanoi’s bustling streets to Ha Long Bay’s calm landscapes, Vietnam provides many different experiences that are strongly influenced by its weather patterns. Knowing these variations can enable you to reserve your flight at the best moment so that you have an amazing and enjoyable time. Vietnam has a diverse climate due to geographical features and monsoons . In general, the country experiences a tropical monsoon climate characterised by two main seasons: dry season and wet season. The northern and southern regions have slightly different weather patterns because they are located in different areas of proximity to the equator. Regardless of the weather conditions, Delhi to Vietnam flight prices are always affordable. To get the best weather conditions in Vietnam, try booking flights during your preferred region’s corresponding dry season. Start planning right away if you intend to go on vacation during peak tourist seasons (December-February & July-August) because airfares may skyrocket then. Use travel websites/apps that compare flight prices among different airlines for your given dates of travel. Keep your travel dates open to exploit fluctuations in airfare pricing; midweek flights or those departing very early in the morning/late night might present savings opportunities. Keep yourself updated with the weather forecasts of the dates and places you’re planning to visit. They have regular seasons in Vietnam, but there are times when exceptional weather occurs. One option is to get travel insurance, which covers weather-related disruptions so that your investment can be protected in case things don’t go as planned.

In Vietnam, these typically fall around April-May and September-October. During this time, it is possible to find air ticket prices that are low and accommodations that charge less during good weather conditions. This allows for more affordable access to attractions while avoiding crowds at them. When planning to take a trip from Delhi to Vietnam, one needs to take into account the different climate zones throughout this country. Familiarise yourself with what each area’s climate is like during specific months in order not only to optimise but also to enjoy travelling within those times best suited for them. The right time to book an airline ticket could make all these places even more interesting by allowing seasonal activities at a reasonable cost since they all have their charms depending on when to visit.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 10, 2024, 17:20 pm Welcome to Lucknow, the Nawab city of India! The amazing traces of the city’s historic buildings can be found in every part of Lucknow, a historical city with a past of its own. As monument after monument was built throughout the Mughal era, the city gained prominence. The city’s builders and craftsmen were given royal support by the monarchs, who encouraged them to create the buildings and monuments that are now recognized as symbols of the city. Under the nawabs, the city experienced amazing flourishing. Since Bara Imambara is the most magnificent landmark in Lucknow, tourists rank it as their top destination. This historical landmark was built in the seventeenth century. It’s a complex with Bhul Bhulaiya, Asif Mosque, and a bowli. The complex’s most remarkable feature is the Bowli. The architecture is distinct and, without the use of iron, has an ornamental Mughal design. One of the best things to do in Lucknow is to book an afternoon at the complex and spend time exploring the grounds and gardens. This is one of the must-visit places in Lucknowb when taking the Goa To Lucknow flight. The Indira Gandhi Planetarium is a unique attraction located in Suraj Kund Park on the banks of the River Gomti. Designed in the characteristically ambitious Lucknowi architectural style, this planetarium was constructed in 2003 with a new design that resembles the planet Saturn, complete with outer rings. The building’s interior features air conditioning and state-of-the-art projection equipment that can be utilized to create a range of entertaining special effects during movies. Their daily programs, which are aimed at broadening the public’s knowledge of the world, have gained immense popularity in the short time since they began, making it one of the top tourist destinations in Lucknow. Standing 60 feet tall, the famed Rumi Darwaza is a stunning entryway in Lucknow’s old city. Standing between the Bara and Chota Imambaras, it boasts ancient Awadhi architecture. A historically significant structure, Rumi Darwaza is located in the heart of Lucknow. Roadways crisscross the spectacular arch of the tall structure on both sides, which is even more mesmerizing at night. Another reminder of the brutality of the “Siege of Lucknow” is the Sikander Bagh, which was once Nawab Wajid Ali Shah’s summer residence. Though the 120 square yards are called a “garden,” they also have a villa, an entryway, multiple openings, defensive walls, and corner bastions. Owing to the National Botanical Research Institute, open areas, seats in the center, and Botanical Garden, it is one of Lucknow’s most picturesque locations and a well-known landmark. Lucknow city is divided into two uneven halves by the Gomti River. It passes through the center of the city exactly. The Gomti Riverfront Park is an additional location that might help you feel refreshed. Located along the banks of Gomti, this verdant park is the perfect place to escape during the late hours of the night. A leisurely stroll or nighttime walk would be enjoyable in the visually appealing park. Tourists can enjoy a musical fountain show in the evening. To the melodies of exquisite musical symphonies, the water dances. The Aminabad Market has been a renowned tourist destination since the Nawabs’ era. Everything is on show here, including locally made handicrafts, footwear, rugs, bed linens, and jewelry and clothing made by hand in Chikankari. You can try out multiple restaurants in the region, such as Wahid Biryani, Tunday Kababi, and Kalika Chat House, after an exciting shopping trip. This is going to be non-negotiable during your Indore To Lucknow flight . Located at Saraswati Ghat on the Yamuna’s banks is the renowned Mankameshwar Mandir. The first female priest was appointed to this well-known Hindu temple honoring Lord Shiva. This location is frequently frequented by devotees during Shivratri and on Mondays. The fact that Mankameshwar Mandir is thought to be a 1000-year-old Hindu shrine is another distinctive aspect of the place. Take your family to the temple for a spiritually enlightening experience. The structure is made of shimmering white sandstone, and seeing this location is a must for any tourism itinerary. Within the compound, there are enormous minarets, picture-perfect domes, and exquisite calligraphy on the walls. The mosque is among the best in the nation because of its 260 pillars and 15 arched domes with elaborate brickwork and sculptures. When travelling by flight, make sure that you are well aware of all the airline’s rules & policies. Be well prepared with your luggage, your documents, and everything well in advance, which could cause problems in travel. Lucknow is indeed one of the most beautiful cities in India, and it is known for its food and Indian heritage. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Jun 12, 2024, 11:18 am Nine mentees from India will be part of a cohort of 200 mentees participating in London International Awards – Creative LIAisons Virtual Coaching program. Their journey began in May and will continue through November. This program offers young industry professionals an extremely rare opportunity to have real time, one-to-one e-coaching with three different well-known, well-awarded and well-established industry leaders from around the world. Coaches will share their expertise and experiences of their many years in the industry. These private and bespoke e-mentoring sessions are customized to the mentee, covering all disciplines with emphasis on skill development, elevating ideas and boosting creative confidence to fast-track careers. It is no secret that behind every successful person, there is a mentor who has helped them along the way. Some of the most famous people had mentors. Mother Teresa had Father Michael van der Peet; Jackson Pollock had painter and muralist, Thomas Hart Benton; J.J. Abrams credits Steven Spielberg as his mentor; and this list goes on and on. Creativity is fluid, so there are no set rules or a prescribed formula for the sessions. Each session is customized between mentor and mentee. They are at full liberty to design how they want to conduct each session. The end game? To hone the skills of young creatives, so they can reach their full potential and rise to greater heights. Laurissa Levy , Creative LIAisons Director/Events Director, said, “If you go on the internet and search how to find a mentor, you’ll find that the most frequent advice tells you to set your goals, explore who is in your network, reach out, meet up and nurture that relationship. But, we all know how hard it can be to achieve all of that if you are a young creative. It’s a big ask to get a busy, respected senior creative to be a mentor. That’s why, Creative LIAisons has established its virtual coaching program. We match mentees with mentors from all around the globe. Our aim is to extend this opportunity to as many as possible, even in less represented markets. This virtual coaching program began in 2021 and has become an integral part of the Creative LIAisons program, an educational initiative to give back to the industry that supports us.” Creative LIAisons Virtual Mentees from India: Rhea Ahuja , Associate Creative Director, Dentsu India, Bangalore Adrian David , Freelance Creative, Mumbai Arundhati Deb , Copywriter, FCB India, Gurugram Mowin Dias , Brand Strategist, DDB Mudra Group, Mumbai Miriam Paul , Creative Supervisor, Ogilvy, Bengaluru Devika Saxena , Senior Creative Solutionist, McCann Worldgroup, Bangalore Tanvi Shah, Senior Copywriter, Toaster India, Gurgaon Yashaswini Singh , Creative Team Leader – Copy, McCann Worldgroup, Gurugram Kushagra Srivastava , Account Planning Strategist, Schbang, Mumbai How are mentees matched with their respective mentors? The focus is on the mentees – to give them greater length, breadth, height and depth with these sessions. So careful consideration is given to the mentees’ requests. While mentees were able to submit their wish list from the list of 200 mentors, there were a few additional criteria we abide by to find mentees the right fit. The rule of thumb is: no mentee will be mentored/coached by someone in their own company, either locally or globally. Selection process: To be eligible for the program, mentees have to be currently working in the industry or a related business and be between the ages of 21 and 30 years old. LIA does not directly select mentees. We leave it up to Companies and Agency Networks that support LIA to put forward candidates. Additionally, LIA collaborates with different Ad Clubs, Associations, and Trade Press by allocating spaces to winners of creative competitions organized by them. To cast the net even wider, the Creative LIAisons Virtual Coaching Program does accept a certain quota of self-nominations. Laurissa Levy added some advice for the mentees, “As the e-coaching sessions are underway, I urge all mentees to make full use of this rare privilege to be part of this program. Your mentors will most definitely challenge you, push you out of your comfort zone, be your confidant, cheer you on to do greater work, help you develop skills or even teach you new ones. But more importantly, they will coach you to aim higher and achieve those aims. It’s the start of your journey with not one, but three top creative minds. Enjoy the ride.” Full list of Virtual and Onsite Mentees Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Apr 17, 2024, 09:25 am In a country as diverse and multi-cultural as India, advertising that caters to this diverse population is surprising flat in its representation. There is low representation of various regional or ethnic groups, different body types, skin colours, and age-groups, and almost a negligible representation of the LGBTQI community, or of people with disabilities. Some of these representations are missing even in regional advertising. On a positive note, there is a positive trend in representation of women, although the quality of representation still has some catching up to do. These findings are part of an updated report titled “Mainstreaming Diversity & Inclusiveness in Indian Advertising” by The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) and the UN Women Convened Unstereotype Alliance (UA). Developed in partnership with Kantar, a global leader in brand research, this comprehensive study delves into the realm of diversity and inclusion (D&I) within Indian advertising, shedding light on evolving trends, challenges, and opportunities. The study scrutinised over 261 ads in 13 languages, and mapped them on 8 dimensions of Age, Gender, Sexual orientation, Race/ethnicity, Physical appearance, Social class, Disabilities, and Religion. It noted that Indian ads are doing well on the gender dimension, but are weak on other aspects. Report Highlights Analysis of Indian ads by Kantar’s Link™ Evaluation Framework indicates a steady increase in female representation, with 45% of commercials featuring women alone, surpassing the global average of 25%. Within the depiction of men and women, women characters are more stereotyped and shown as fair and lean versus men. Portrayal of women is also anchored to care-giving, and that of men to authority. The report noted that less than 1% of the ads featured members of the LGBTQI community or people with disabilities. About 4% of the ads featured older people above 65 years of age. In contrast to many other markets, India is a distance away in terms of celebrating the inherent diversity in its ethnicity and skin colour. Only 3% of Indian ads had representation from ethnic groups vs. the global average of 19%, and only 4% showed diversity of skin tone vs. the global average of 27%. The study uses the Progressive Unstereotype Metric (PUM) to measure consumer responses to representation in advertising. PUM measures consumers response as to whether the way people are presented in the ad represents a modern and progressive view of society. Global studies have shown that positive PUM results in higher brand affinity and intent to purchase. Manisha Kapoor, CEO and Secretary-General, ASCI , said, “Progressive advertising works better for society and for brands. Ads that are stuck in stereotypical depictions are missing a trick in connecting with India’s diverse consumer base. Collaborating with the Unstereotype Alliance and other partners, ASCI is committed to guiding and supporting the industry in achieving wider D&I representation.” Susan Ferguson, Country Representative, UN Women India , said, “As conveners of the Unstereotype Alliance India National Chapter, we are dedicated to fostering inclusivity within the advertising landscape. Over the past two years, our alliance has brought together brands, organizations, and individuals committed to leveraging advertising and media to drive a cultural shift towards diversity and inclusion. We are proud of our collective efforts to dismantle stereotypes and champion a more inclusive advertising industry.” Soumya Mohanty, MD & CCO- South Asia, Insights Division, Kantar , said, “We are proud to partner with ASCI and the Unstereotype Alliance in shedding light on the evolving landscape of diversity and inclusion in Indian advertising. Through our research and insights, we aim to drive a more inclusive and representative industry that resonates with diverse audiences.” READ THE FULL REPORT HERE: Your email address will not be published.

Wild Stone has done the unthinkable – it has made a bold move to woo their visually impaired clients with a unique unisex perfume that comes with Braille typography on the perfume bottle. The new ‘Sense’ perfume has fulfilled the ultimate marketing recipe by including the Braille typography. The new collection is a first of its kind venture that seeks to tap in the sense of smell -the most important sense of the visually impaired. Perfume for the Blind by the Blind Wild Stone, a well-known leading male grooming-personal care brand from the house of McNROE Consumer Products Pvt Ltd, has launched its first unisex perfume ‘Sense’ meant to celebrate the sense of smell. Check out the Braille typography on their Facebook page Re-establishing the Sense of Smell The sense is a special initiative in partnership with Saksham .org to showcase and re-establish the sense of smell as the common unifier experience as felt by both visually challenged as well as sighted individuals. Talking about the product, Mr. Ankit Daga, Head of Business, McNROE Consumers Product Pvt Ltd, said: “We are delighted to launch this perfume which breaks all the barriers of sight and unifies every individual in our sense of smell. In today’s time of the pandemic, it is necessary to have things and initiatives which showcase hope and positivity to the consumers and Wild Stone Sense is one such initiative”. “ The sense of smell is far more critical for visually impaired people. They use touch and sounds to navigate their way around. Also, whether one is visually impaired or sighted, we are all equal when it comes to smell,” added Mr. Daga. At present, Sense is available on the official Wild Stone website and is priced at INR 599. Going ahead, the company plans to make it available across all online platforms.

This remarkable growth strengthens realme’s position in the Indian smartphone market, securing the No. 3 position among the top 10 smartphone brands as per IDC’s rankings for Q2 2023. Despite the overall smartphone market in India witnessing a 3% YoY decline in Q2, realme’s strategic positioning and leap-forward innovations, coupled with the industry’s focus on 5G devices in the INR 10,000-INR 15,000 (~$122-$244) segment, propelled the brand back to its coveted 3rd position in the Indian smartphone market. realme’s exceptional growth can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the brand’s strategic approach in improving inventory and demand, aggressive sales promotions, and the launch of 5G devices at accessible price points. This year, realme has achieved numerous milestones across a range of devices, with several emerging as bestsellers in their respective categories. Notably, the realme C55 sold over 100,000 units in just 5 hours on its first sale day, while the 11 Pro Series set a new record by selling over 200,000 devices across all channels during its initial launch, and achieved 390% of the previous generation during the first sale period offline. Also, the narzo N53 , a best-selling smartphone under the Rs 10,000 segment on Amazon, broke records by selling 100,000 units in an impressive 90 minutes . For the IOT category, realme pad 2 achieved 122% more than the previous generation during first sale. These achievements showcase realme’s continued commitment to delivering innovative and high-performing products that resonate with consumers. Furthermore, realme’s strong offline presence and expansion into the offline channel have played a significant role in enhancing customer engagement and ecosystem development. The brand’s strategic focus on both online and offline channels has allowed it to cater to diverse consumer preferences and ensure seamless access to its products. By continuously pushing boundaries and delivering exceptional devices, realme has solidified its position as a prominent player in the Indian smartphone market. With a compelling product lineup and customer-centric approach, realme is well-poised to continue its upward trajectory and achieve even greater success in the future. As the company continues to innovate and expand its product portfolio, realme aims to maintain its growth momentum and further strengthen its position as one of the top smartphone brands in India. With the rapid growth of the Indian smartphone market and the increasing demand for 5G devices, realme is well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and deliver unparalleled value to its customers.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Nov 02, 2017, 07:18 am Weber Shandwick was named 2017 Global Agency of the Year by The Holmes Report at the annual Global SABRE Awards ceremony. Weber Shandwick is the first agency ever to sweep The Holmes Report’s Regional Agency of the Year honors in one year, already winning top recognition in Asia Pacific, North America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa earlier in 2017. This is the fourth time in five years the firm has received the global top agency honor. Weber Shandwick also was presented with two Global SABRE awards for outstanding client work with partners ActionAid UK and Alba Chunkuk, which were recognized among the top 40 global campaigns of the year. “Being recognized by The Holmes Report as the leading agency in every major region of the world this year reflects the strength of our global network – the teams across our offices who passionately and consistently deliver value to our clients, who leverage strategic communications to help solve problems and who generate results,” said Andy Polansky, Chief Executive Officer, Weber Shandwick. “Congratulations to our people around the world, and to our client partners who inspire us to create some of the world’s most engaging and impactful campaigns year after year.” Earlier this year, Weber Shandwick was honored with the top ranking on The Holmes Report’s 2017 Global Creative Index, marking the second time in three years that the agency has been recognized as the industry’s leading creative firm. Standout Client Campaigns The firm’s work with ActionAid UK’s “#BrutalCut” campaign, which raised awareness of female genital mutilation in Kenya, was recognized by The Holmes Report among the top 10 campaigns of the year. The campaign, which has reached over 152 million people and sparked thousands of conversations online, is Weber Shandwick’s most awarded campaign of all time in EMEA, including earning two Silver Cannes Lions in 2017. Weber Shandwick was also honored in partnership with Alba Chunkuk, Korea’s biggest portal for parttime work, for giving a voice to marginalized and mistreated part-time workers in the country. The campaign has earned international recognition and praise, including being named Campaign of the Year at the Asia Pacific Excellence Awards and winning Silver and Bronze awards at the PR Awards Asia 2017. The Culture Conundrum At the The Holmes Report’s Global Public Relations Summit, which took place earlier in the day, Weber Shandwick President Gail Heimann led a discussion about the relationship between brands in culture with senior marketers Judy Berei, Excedrin Global Brand Lead, GSK Consumer Healthcare and Tracy Quan, Associate Vice President, Global Brand Communications, Royal Caribbean. The session, “The Culture Conundrum – Culture-in-Brands or Brands-in-Culture. Or both. A Meditation. And Conversation” examined the opportunities, realities and risks for brands engaging in real-time culture, and provided insight on how to navigate culture to deliver effective work and long-term value for brands and companies. Commenting on Excedrin’s “Migraine Experience,” which used augmented reality to tackle the misconception that having a migraine is “just a bad headache,” Berei said the work was a great example of anchoring on a central point and using technology to tell the story. The campaign earned three Cannes Lions at the 2016 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Royal Caribbean has also had success integrating itself into culture, recently leveraging the summer’s solar eclipse to host Bonnie Tyler for a once-in-a lifetime “Total Eclipse of the Heart” concert live on the high seas. Quan added that when it comes to culture, it’s important for brands to think proactively and react swiftly. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By Team MI Jan 30, 2023, 12:42 pm Every year, Forbes India 30 Under 30 highlights 30 individuals who are exceptional in their fields. Now in its tenth year, the winners of the 2023 list are no different. It was 10 years ago in 2014 when we first published the Forbes India 30 Under 30 list. You’ll recognise some of our winners from the Class of 2014 who are making waves even today—Bhavish Aggarwal, Ola; Rajkummar Rao, actor; Pooja Dhingra, Le15; Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja of Shivan and Narresh; Cheteshwar Pujara, cricketer, to name a few. Over the years, the Forbes India 30 Under 30 winners have represented young and upcoming talents and businesses across the most relevant sectors in the day. From 14 categories in 2014 to 21 in 2023, we have been restrained while adding new categories or dropping them, to ensure we don’t leave out any new trends emerging in business. This year, cryptocurrency is now Web3 to account for advancements in the sector in Metaverse and Web3. This year, its 10 th , the Forbes India 30 Under 30 alumni club will be 300-strong and we can safely claim that we’ve had many hits. Take Nikhil Kamath, for instance, who was featured on the list in 2016 when he was 29. Zerodha has changed the stock market investing landscape for retail investors in the country. Today, he’s one of India’s youngest billionaires. The Class of 2016 also featured the cofounders of Postman—Abhinav Asthana, Abhijit Kane and Ankit Sobti—that has now put India on the global tech map and is transforming the way developers world over look at software by taking an ‘API-first approach’. Then there’s Swiggy from 2017 as well as Pharmeasy from the same year, and Sharechat, and RazorPay. Ather Energy, Bellatrix Aerospace, and Meesho from 2018. Ninjacart, smallcase, Wakefit, and Porter from 2019. Bira, BharatAgri, and SleepyOwl from 2020. Our mantra to pick the class of 30 Under 30 has always been to discover the young before they make it big, and our success transcends business, to entertainment and sports as well. Tahir Raj Bhasin and Taapsee Pannu (Class of 2017); Bhumi Pednekar, Vicky Kaushal and Mithila Palkar (Class of 2018); Vijay Deverakonda (Class of 2019); Sai Pallavi (Class of 2020) represent the esteemed alumni in entertainment. In sports, Anirban Lahiri, Dipa Karmakar (Class of 2016); Aditi Ashok (Class of 2017); Jasprit Bumrah, Harmanpreet Kaur (Class of 2018); Neeraj Chopra, Smriti Mandhana and Hima Das (Class of 2019), to name a few in sports, have gone on to put India on the map in their own tracks and fields and won international acclaim. The Class of 2023 will be no different. 30 achievers across 21 categories, picked by an expert jury for each category have strived to reach here and will continue to build businesses to last, and careers to reckon with. They will bridge crucial gaps in the dynamic Indian market with their startups and win accolades for the country in their respective sectors. The youngest on the list this year is only 21 and his startup in Climate Change & Clean Energy represents a thinking young generation that is interested in solving the most pertinent problems of the world today and not just creating wealth or fame. “The 2023 Forbes India 30 Under 30 list is about those free spirits that dare to be different and break existing rules,” Brian Carvalho, editor, Forbes India , says.

    "article_content": "By Team MI Jan 31, 2023, 14:11 pm Epson’s dry fiber technology, which is already used commercially to recycle office paper and which requires virtually no water, has been adapted to produce printable non-woven fabric from used garments. The new fabric production process was revealed in Paris as part of a three-year collaboration between Epson and YUIMA NAKAZATO and was used in the creation of items for the first time during the latter’s runway show at the Palais de Tokyo on January 25, 2023. The collaboration between Epson and YUIMA NAKAZATO builds on the success of the company’s printing support for his couture and evolves the level of his creations to enable the low-impact production of high-quality custom garments. Both Epson and YUIMA NAKAZATO are keen to raise awareness of the water and material waste associated with excess production. The Paris Show illustrates how switching to digital textile printing using more environmentally friendly pigment inks offers the fashion industry a more sustainable and less wasteful means of textile printing. The fabric taken to create the latest YUIMA NAKAZATO fashion line was derived from material from used garments sourced from Africa, the destination for many discarded garments from elsewhere in the world. Nakazato visited Kenya where he collected around 150 kg of waste garment material destined for the “clothes mountain” of discarded textiles he encountered there. Epson then applied its dry fiber process to produce over 50 metres of new re-fiberised non-woven fabric, some of which was used for printing with pigment inks with Epson’s Monna Lisa digital printing technology. Hitoshi Igarashi from Epson’s Printing Solutions Division explains the importance of the technology: “Although in its early stages, Epson believes its dry fiber technology combined with pigment ink digital printing could offer the fashion industry a much more sustainable future, significantly reducing water use while allowing designers the freedom to fully express their creativity.” “Epson’s Environmental Vision is committed to contributing to a circular economy, and this development could be one step towards achieving this. Dry fiber technology applied to the fashion industry offers the possibility of producing material for new clothes that have been recycled from used garments.” In a trial of distributed printing for venue decoration, Epson inkjet printers in Japan and France with remote support from Epson engineers were used to create decorations in the venue space. Both Epson and YUIMA NAKAZATO intend to continue exploring the possibilities for contributing to a more sustainable fashion industry. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "By MediaInfoline Feb 15, 2024, 15:34 pm In the latest report from Redseer Strategy Consultants titled “Winning Recipe for Food Brands in India,” a transformative trend in outside eating habits is highlighted, showcasing a surge in outside food among diverse age groups in metro and Tier-1 cities. The study forecasts a leap in the food service market to surpass $100 billion in revenue by 2028. Notably, the organized sector growth is expected to outpace the unorganized segment by 3x. Evolving outside eating: Fueling food service market growth Outside eating behavior is now more habitual for Metro and Tier 1 consumers rather than being a luxury, which can be seen by the frequency of outside eating going up by 30% and 20% for students & young adults and mid-lifers respectively compared to 2018. They are increasingly looking for more variety and are also vary of quality driving the need for brands in the ecosystem. Brands are also leveraging this opportunity and scaling their presence in the India market. This is expected to drive organized food services market from $30 billion to $60 billion by 2028. Diverse Indian consumer palette: Calls for brands to tap into multiple cuisines. Indian palette is extremely heterogeneous, with varied tastes for cuisines across regions. For example, in Biryani category we see diverse regional variations such as Lucknowi, Kolkata, Ambur, and Hyderabadi, reflecting the rich culinary landscape of India. This diversity restricts the Total Addressable Market (TAM) and makes scaling beyond INR 100 crore a challenge for most standalone brands with presence in a single city or a single cuisine. For instance, in the INR 20,000-30,000 crore biryani category, a typical metro city may only have an organized market size of INR 800-1,200 crore. Thus, achieving a revenue target of INR 100 crore by operating solely in a single metro city within the organized biryani cuisine necessitates capturing 10-15% market share, posing a significant challenge for a standalone brand to overcome. The House of Brands advantage: Catering to every taste In this context, House of Brands (HoBs) has emerged as the most effective strategy for scaling food brands in India. HoBs, which own multiple brands across various cuisines under a single umbrella, demonstrate an average revenue at least 5 times higher than standalone brands. This is partly due to their ability to target a larger Total Addressable Market (TAM) across cuisines and meal slots. The sharing of resources within the HoB strategy also facilitates increased kitchen utilization and enables better operating leverage such as lower COGS, further solidifying their competitive advantage in the market. Successful House of Brands are characterized by their focus on two critical aspects. Firstly, their ability to build and scale multiple brands across diverse cuisines, thereby capturing higher revenue potential rather than being dependent on their anchor brand. Secondly, driving operational excellence through measured geographic expansion, strong consumer funnel and optimized capital & operational expenditures. Rohan Agarwal, Partner at Redseer observes “Indian food market will need lot more of mid-sized brands than fewer mega brands owing to the diversity it brings. House of Brands playbook has been successful in this context. It is particularly heartening to witness the new-age homegrown house of brands leading the charge by building multiple sizable brands already.” Your email address will not be published.

We believe that a lot of foundational and transformative work can be done within the Indian Wind Energy sector as well with all its stakeholders and policymakers. As India Chair of GWEC, I look forward to making GWEC even more impactful in India and also the opportunity to take the Indian Wind Energy sector to the world from a position of strength.” Mr Ben Backwell, CEO of GWEC , said: “ The Global Wind Energy Council has a long, successful history with the Tanti family, and we are delighted to welcome Mr. Girish Tanti to the position of GWEC India’s Chair. “It is an exciting time for wind energy in India, with the new government, under the leadership of Prime Minister HE Shri Narendra Modi, driving plans to deliver transformative action to realise India’s ambitious energy transition and energy security goals, where wind and renewables play a pivotal role.

    "article_content": "By Madhushree Chakrabarty Dec 13, 2022, 12:39 pm YouGov Bank and Payment System Consideration Rankings 2022 highlight the top ten brands among urban Indians across key categories in the Finance sector. The brands in the 2022 Rankings were ranked based on their Consideration score, which asks people, “When you are in the market next to make a purchase, which brands would you consider?” Brands were measured between 1 st October 2021 and 30th September 2022. India’s largest state-owned bank SBI, which has a legacy of over 200 years is the top ranked brand in India, with a Consideration score of +32.7. HDFC and ICICI Bank, follow in the second (23.3) and third (19.6) place, along with other private sector banks such as Axis Bank in fifth (14.4) and Kotak Mahindra Bank in seventh (12.9). Global payments and technology companies Visa and MasterCard appear in fourth (16.0) and sixth (14.0), respectively. Also present in the list is non-banking financial services company Bajaj Finserv, in eighth (12.2). Along with SBI, other leading PSUs to feature in the list are Bank of Baroda (10.9) and Punjab National Bank (10.2). The rankings also feature the top five brands that have made the largest uplift to their brand Consideration scores over the past year. Central Bank of India has been most successful in strengthening its position among urban India, with a +1.4 points increase to its Consideration score in the last year. Bank of Baroda is the second best improver, with a change in score of +1.3. Bank of India (change in score of +1.3), Punjab National Bank (+1.0) and YES Bank (+0.8) are other improvers of 2022. Methodology: The data included in the YouGov Bank and Payment Systems Consideration Rankings report 2022 has been drawn from YouGov BrandIndex. For the brand ranking, brands were ranked based on their ‘consideration’ score. In this metric urban Indians are asked, “when you are in the market next to make a purchase, which brands would you consider?” Brands were ranked by this consideration score between October 1, 2021, and September 30, 2022. To determine the biggest improvers, brands were sorted by change in score between that time and the previous twelve months. All scores listed have been rounded to a single decimal place; however, we have used additional precision to assign ranks. All brands must have been tracked for at least six months to be included in either ranking. Your email address will not be published.

This will help in integrating PR with advertising and other forms of brand communication. In a world where clients deal with a variety of creative and strategic partner agencies, such a tool strengthens the integrated focus and eases the coordination.

In order to meet these challenges, we have seen a shift in thinking and methodology, leading to more agility and speed in strategy development and execution across various communication functions. The good news is that all this has created an opportunity for those of us who know better, to help others see; invest in and embrace change. Tute’s new model is a step in the right direction that will consolidate client/agency formats across all channels and make strategic plans that were easy to understand and implement with much-needed standardisation. With this new tool PR teams will become more efficient and agile as they spend less hours creating bespoke plans for brands without getting lost in the realms of excel sheets and ppts.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Chile and Peru missed the chance to take a big step toward Copa America quarter-final qualification on Friday night, playing out a dour 0-0 draw in their Group A opener in Arlington, Texas. The teams, who have each won two Copa America titles, were striving to join Argentina on three points after the defending champions' 2-0 victory over Canada, whose qualification hopes have also been boosted by the draw. The stalemate reflected the struggles of Chile and Peru in the CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying, where they have jointly managed just four goals across 12 matches. Chile's Alexis Sanchez squandered the game's best opportunity in the 16th minute. The former Inter Milan and Arsenal forward missed a golden opportunity when he received Victor Davila's low cross in the six-yard box, only to send his effort soaring over the crossbar. \"They started aggressively. I had two chances and this is the Copa America and you have to make them,\" Sanchez said. \"We were imprecise in our passes, we played only one game before coming here.\" Chile showed more attacking flair but failed to execute the crucial final pass in a first half marred by injuries, with Peru's Luis Advincula subbed off in the 35th minute and Chilean midfielder Diego Valdes being replaced at half-time. Peru's Miguel Araujo nearly broke the deadlock in the 43rd minute, forcing Chile's goalkeeper Claudio Bravo into an acrobatic save with a well-connected header from Sergio Pena's free kick. Despite Peru's striker Gianluca Lapadula creating the most dangerous moments of the second half, he failed to seriously challenge Bravo. His most promising chance came in the 57th minute, when a deflection fell to him, but his slip resulted in a weak shot easily saved by Bravo. In the 79th minute, his volley from Pena's corner forced Bravo into another save, and the keeper managed to collect the rebound just in time to prevent a second attempt. \"I think we played a great game and, with that attitude, we can take any game forward,\" Lapadula said. \"The first half was much more defensive and the second much more offensive. I had two clear chances and we have to keep working like that. I think we played a great game and it will be our start.\" Bravo's performance in goal capped a special night for the former Barcelona and Manchester City goalkeeper, who at 41 years, 2 months and 16 days became the oldest-ever Copa America player. Chile next face group leaders Argentina in New Jersey on Tuesday, while Peru take on Canada in Kansas City. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) A lot has been written about Dommaraju Gukesh, but have you wondered about how it is to be the parents of a genius and budding World Champion. Dommaraju Gukesh's historic win at the Candidates Chess Tournament in Toronto wasn't just a triumph for the young chess player, it was a testament to the unwavering support and sacrifices made by his parents. As Gukesh prepares for his historic world title challenge, the world can't help but acknowledge the silent heroes behind the prodigy: Dr Rajnikanth and Dr Padmakumari, who sacrificed their own routines and comfort to nurture a champion, discovers A Ganesh Nadar . Gukesh's chess journey began in 2013 with a simple one-hour class three days a week. \"In 2013 I enrolled him in a chess class and he used to go for an hour on three days a week. He started playing weekend tournaments as his chess teachers said he was good,\" recalls Dr Rajnikanth. Initially, it didn't disrupt the family's routine much, with Dr. Rajnikanth taking only Saturday leave for weekend tournaments. However, things changed in 2014 when Gukesh entered week-long rating tournaments. This marked the beginning of a significant shift in their lives. Dr Rajnikanth, a busy ENT surgeon, had to adjust his schedule, becoming a visiting surgeon at the hospitals he previously worked at full-time. Recalling the days before Gukesh became a chess prodigy, Dr Rajnikanth says, \"I used to attend conferences all over India. I was a visiting surgeon in multiple hospitals. My day started at 7 am and used to end at 11 pm. I used to take an hour break for lunch\". Dr Padmakumari, an assistant professor of microbiology, faced a different challenge. Gukesh, a consistent class topper, was missing school due to tournaments. To support his passion while ensuring his education wasn't compromised, the family made a bold decision. \"We decided that if he does well in chess he can carry on playing and if not he will go back to school\". Velammal school, where Gukesh studied, agreed to a unique arrangement: He would attend only for exams, focusing on chess during the rest of the year. This was a gamble, a year-long trial to see if Gukesh could excel in both. Dr Padmakumari stepped up further, taking on extra work when her husband and son were traveling. She clocked in overtime and covered shifts for colleagues who needed leave. Her dedication ensured the family's financial stability while Gukesh pursued his chess dreams. \"Travel was becoming very expensive as we now had to travel abroad to play games. My wife was working to not only support the family at home but also for our travel and stay abroad,\" Dr Rajnikanth said. While Gukesh received some cash awards and support from his school, significant financial assistance remained a challenge until some time ago. In 2019, after returning from a tournament in Gibraltar, Gukesh and his father visited five-time World Champion Viswanathan Anand. \"He was kind enough to invite us to his house, he and Gukesh were discussing the games my son played in Gibraltar and Anand was suggesting some different moves that he could have played.\" Anand advised Gukesh to take a break and told him that it would help. Gukesh's dedication and the unwavering support of his parents paid off. He not only excelled in his chess endeavours but also cleared his exams, proving that his academic brilliance wasn't compromised.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'I would put my hand in the ground and have a little listen to what the mountain was doing.' 'Actually, it was still collapsing.' 'And there was a very real possibility that at some stage, without warning, the collapse could continue -- and continue across us, the people who were doing the rescue and also across to the men on the other side, who were being rescued.' Tunnelling professional Professor Arnold Edward Dix , 59, has just returned from his daughter's school in Monbulk, a farming town in the shadow of the Dandenong mountains, 42 km from Melbourne, in Victoria, Australia, where he spent about an hour recounting a Christmas story to her classmates. It was a true Christmas story. Not an imaginary one. His tale had nothing to do with grinches, nutcrackers, carols, a Polar Express, sugarplums or snowmen. It was a story of hope. A tale that showed \"We all might be different people, but in the end we all just want the best for our kids.\" A story with the message that \"Good People can do Kind Things, Great Things.\" Cheerful Dix, who looks and sounds a bit like a twinkle-eyed Santa himself, recounted a miraculous Christmas story about the wonderful rescue of 41 young men in Uttarakhand's Silkyara tunnel , without any loss of life, that illustrated, according to him, how we are all little people contending with the \"big forces\" out there, but we just have to stay positive, work together to find solutions. Like all tales with a universal message, it found instant resonance in faraway Australia and the children loved it. They cheered and clapped at the end of it. Ever since Dix got involved as a volunteer with the nail-biting Himalayan tunnel rescue, he, along with the rat miners Feroz, Munna, Rashid, Irshad, Naseem, Monu, Naseer, Ankur, Jatin, Devender, Saurabh, Waqeel, Hasan, have become international stars. He returned to a hero's welcome in Australia, with the country's prime minister, Anthony Albanese taking time out in parliament to celebrate him. He has been feted and interviewed wherever he went. The underground expert collected a tonne of Indian hearts when he was spied, tikka on his forehead, praying at a mountain shrine of Baba Boukhnag, heartily tucking into Indian vegetarian food and gamely and readily immersing himself, even spiritually, in our culture. Dix is quick to confess that the time he spent in Silkyara in the depth of the majestic, mysterious Himalayas was a soul-altering experience for him, where he learnt different, eccentric styles of problem solving, an alternative flabbergasting culture of management and about a kind of resilience, kindness and concern for human life he had not encountered before, that touched him deeply. A geologist and legal expert, who earned both his degrees at Monash University, Clayton, Australia, with various visiting professorships, Dix belongs to a not very large community of specialists in tunnelling, with his key area being troubleshooting and helping governments and he is the president of the Geneva-based International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association. \"I've never been in the midst of a process where it felt like India, as a country, all its agencies, the military and everything, had all got together and said, 'We're going to save the lives of these 41 men'. That was quite an experience,\" he tells Rediff.com 's Vaihayasi Pande Daniel in the first of a multi-part, exclusive, interview. What was it like coming to India and helping with this rescue? It made you quite a star. How has the entire experience changed you? What was your takeaway? Oh, that's an interesting ( question ). I found the whole experience almost enlightening. I know, it sounds a bit odd. I was really struck by the sophistication and maturity of the Indian sense of justice and fairness and of the value of a human life. I don't know if I'd really fully appreciated that before. I'd certainly seen how you shouldn't jump on ants or kill things and what have you. But I've never been in the midst of a process where it felt like India, as a country, all its agencies, the military and everything, had all got together and said, 'We're going to save the lives of these 41 men'. That was quite an experience. It's unlike what I find in many countries, when people are in trouble. They're not superstars. They're not Bollywood stars. They're not super-rich people. They're just like normal, hardworking people. And yet, the whole country just rallied around and ( said ) 'We're going to bring these kids home'. I really liked that. I found that a very high form of civilisation, a high form of humanity. I enjoyed being part of it. I understand it was quite a journey for you to get to the site of the tunnel collapse? Diwali started for me in New Zealand. I had the first call, after the incident, when I was in New Zealand. Then I got called when I was in Germany. I had something to do there. It was a bit urgent. Finally, when things weren't going so well, I was in Ljubljana, Slovenia. That's when the secretary and the chief engineer ( India's ministry of road transport and highways ) said to me, 'Look, can you get here?' Actually, it was quite hard to get there. I was in a kind of a remote part of Europe. You wouldn't think Europe has a remote part. It was like: 'Oh, yeah, we don't have a plane going today. But we've got one tomorrow' and then I had to get connections from Slovenia to the Middle East and a plane from the Middle East to, I think, Mumbai, from Mumbai, I had to get to Delhi and then from Delhi to Dehradun. From there, it was pretty easy because there was a helicopter. That was pretty cool. You arrived at the site on November 19 by helicopter? Yeeeaah! Which was fantastic. Because my name is Arnold. This was like what Arnold Schwarzenegger does in one of those movies. I got no muscles. I got no guns, but it was awesome to actually come into the Himalayas on, I think, a military helicopter. That was pretty much like a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Who was the person who contacted you first? The first person to contact me was India's chief engineer, Mr Gupta ( Rahul Gupta, Chief Engineer, MoRTH, New Delhi ). We just discussed strategies in the beginning. And then the next ( conversations ) were with him and the secretary of the whole federal department ( Anurag Jain ). The secretary then asked me to come. I said, 'Yes, of course'. It was as uncomplicated as that. He had an emergency, and we just kind of help each other like 'You're my friends'. It could have been my kids ( Australian underground workers ) who were stuck in there, because my kids also work in tunneling. I was like, 'Of course, I will come'. Of course, I just came as quick as I could. Did you get to know the 41 men after they were pulled out? It was a funny thing. Yes and no. A little bit. So, what happened was I was meant to, in fact, I was told immediately after they were pulled out ( on November 28, 17 days later ), I was to go to a helipad and get flown back to Delhi. I just felt that I had unfinished business. I kind of didn't do what I was told. Not kind of. I didn't do what I was told. And I snuck off with the SDRF rescue men ( State Disaster Response Force ). I was to be at the helipad. But actually, I ran off and went up the mountain where the main temple is for the god for that particular mountain. I had the best day but unfortunately, I made a lot of people a bit annoyed with me because a helicopter was waiting, and I never came. I thought I'd told them, but apparently my message didn't get through. They were a bit worried that maybe I'd fallen off a cliff or any of all the sorts of things that happen when you're in the Himalayas. The good news about all of that was: Even though I missed my helicopter, even though I had a great day up the mountain, even though that meant I couldn't get a helicopter so I had to get a car, even though that then delayed me another day, even though I missed my flight... But the flight that I did get had a whole heap of the men I rescued on it! They were on the flight with me, and we were all seated together. Actually, I had the best time. We all introduced ourselves to each other. And it was a really wonderful experience. It was obviously just meant to be. The funniest thing was the airline had put them in the exit rows. I thought that was really funny, next to the little door on the airplane. They'd never been on a plane before. When the airline hostess comes down to tell us like, 'Are we prepared to use the doors in an emergency?' I just start laughing. Like, I was telling the air hostess, 'Don't you know who these guys are? These guys have just burrowed out of a Himalayan mountain through a million tonnes of rock. You can assume that they're going to be able to open a little door onto the wing'. But the airline lady, she's getting angry with me. It doesn't matter how many times she tells me to shut up, I just keep on laughing at her and thinking it's very, very, funny. Anyway, so eventually I had to behave myself. Eventually they agreed that they would use the emergency door if in the unlikely event of an accident, blah blah blah. We said farewell in Delhi, and sort of wished each other goodbye. It was wonderful. It was a really charming and fitting end to an epic -- an epic rescue of almost god-like proportions. I couldn't have couldn't have written the story better than this reality. It was just fantastic. WATCH: Arnold Dix with members of the Silkyara rescue team The Australian prime minister was talking about how you went into the Uttarakhand tunnel and your wife was very scared that you might get trapped inside. What was it like on a day-to-day basis inside there? Well, it's a mountain. It's collapsing. So, we had the initial collapse. Speaking as an engineer now, and as a tunnel expert, it was quite clear from all the data that we were getting -- data from drone-based LIDAR surveys, from satellite LIDAR surveys, from traditional on-the-ground surveys -- that everything was still moving. We increasingly had data from the site, where the men were trapped, showing us that the roof was collapsing, particularly on the left side. So, we had collapse occurring on the left side, on the side the men were trapped. Plus, we had what looked like the early stages of collapse on the side that we were rescuing. I would always go right down to the avalanche, and literally put my hand in the ground, and just sit there and have a little listen to what the mountain was doing. Actually, it was still collapsing. And there was a very real possibility that at some stage, without warning, the collapse could continue -- and continue across us, the people who were doing the rescue and also across to the men on the other side, who were being rescued. It was very much a high-alert thing. You go in there. But you're listening to the rocks. You're listening to the sound of the cracks. You're watching for things falling from the roof. You're watching for rocks coming from where the avalanche had been. The good thing was that the best experts in the world were there -- like the Himalayan experts from India are just fantastic. And they come from the federal agencies, the state agencies, the army, the Indian coal agency, so many areas. Between us all, I think we were able to come to quite an informed view about the likelihood of it collapsing while we were there. Although we knew it was still collapsing, and we knew that there was a chance it was going to collapse at any moment, we were just on super high alert, because we knew we also had a rescue to complete. It was quite a balancing act. But an informed balancing act. Not a crazy balancing act. But we were going to do this , we were going to be calm, we were caring about our own well-being, we were making sure that people on the other side were going to be rescued. We were not going to jeopardise that, we were not going to cause another avalanche by doing something crazy. It was a quite informed and careful balancing act that we were performing.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Is India headed there again? asks Ajit Balakrishnan He was a stout, illiterate man, son of a butcher, struggling to earn enough to feed his 13 children by weaving handloom cotton in his tiny home when he suddenly hit on an idea that could increase his earning and feed his family. The idea was to make a small improvement in his spinning wheel such that it could, for the same effort. So, he put eight different spindles that were powered by a single wheel. This allowed him to produce eight threads in the same amount of time it previously took to produce one. He called this the spinning jenny, made a few of these contraptions, and earned a little money selling them to his neighbours. The year was 1764, the man was James Hargreaves, and he was in Lancashire, England. His invention triggered Samuel Crompton to invent the spinning mule and Charles Babbage to invent a weaving machine, thus triggering what we have come to know as the Industrial Revolution. It is this tiny invention, the spinning jenny, which had a cataclysmic effect on India s economy by reducing the number of workers needed to produce cotton cloth and thus created the impetus for the Indian Independence movement and was symbolised in the charkha symbol in the flag of that movement. What leaves me puzzled even after digging through many thousands of Web pages and books is this: If the idea of a spinning wheel with multiple spindles struck this lone man in Lancashire, why didn t a similar thought strike any one of the hundreds of thousands of cotton spinners in India at that time in the 1760s? Robert Allen, the distinguished economic historian, suggests the spinning jenny and the related Industrial Revolution occurred in Britain rather than in India because wages were exceptionally high compared to capital prices in Britain, so the jenny was profitable to use in Britain but not elsewhere. Since it was only profitable to use the jenny in Britain, that was the only country where it was worth incurring the costs of developing and using it, and that irrespective of the quality of their institutions or the progressiveness of their cultures the Indians would have not found it profitable to mechanise cotton production in the eighteenth century . Not inventing the spinning jenny and mechanised weaving and the other inventions that soon followed the steam engine, steam-powered locomotives, ships, and so on kept India imprisoned in the pre-industrial era and Indians had to wait for the British to colonise them and then teach them about such industrial things. Are there some equally disturbing things at work in India that might signal to us Indians that something wrong is under way? I can list a few and, please, dear reader, please list some others that are disturbing to you. We set up high-quality institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology, hoping that the students who graduate from there will innovate at a world-class level and bring India up to the level of the best in the world. But horror of horrors: Tuition businesses like those in Kota lure hundreds of thousands of students to attend coaching classes and game the IIT entrance examinations. And about 200,000 students take the IIT entrance test. Of those about 10,000 are given admission which means that 95 per cent go home disappointed. Then there are children who cannot make it to any of the top institutions such as IITs and Indian Institutes of Management and their parents send them to study abroad, paying Rs 50 lakh to Rs 60 lakh a year or more it is estimated that last year 450,000 went abroad to study. Let us look at another aspect of this puzzle. In the late 1980s, India had a small bunch of tech companies designing and building computers and related hardware under the protection of 100 per cent import duty on such items. Then, as Siddhartha Mukerji points out in his recent book India's Software Industry: Politics Institutions and Policy Shift : During 1991, NASSCOM (National Association of Software and Service Companies) lobbied with the government and for the first time secured income tax exemptions on the profits of software exports. Later, due to the pressure by NASSCOM, the government lowered the import duties from a high 114 per cent to almost zero, and all of the players designing and building computer hardware perished or switched to the business of providing services workforce to foreign companies. The shift from information-technology products to IT workforce services was complete from that day onwards. Now, we as a nation are proud that we supply workforce to the worldwide IT industry: Earning a gigantic $250 billion as revenue and employing more than 5 million young Indians no doubt a great step forward but letting United States-based tech giants own the IT product market. Surprisingly, Indian-origin people are now increasingly dominant as senior executives/chief executive officers of these American tech giants. Now, as the world swings into the era dominated by artificial intelligence, it looks like India's role will again be to supply workforce to the new set of United States-based tech giants like OpenAI, which are set to dominate the world. What if we discover that the AI wave will dispense with the need for a cheap tech workforce? More importantly, what is in India's political economy that drives us to seek IT services revenue rather than leading in IT products? The answer to that question may tell us why the spinning jenny was not invented in India and the Industrial Revolution did not start in India.

The team could field all four spinners -- Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel and Yuzvendra Chahal -- in their opening Super 8s game against Afghanistan on Thursday, June 20. This strategy was evident in the nets session, where the four spinners got valuable practice bowling against Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav. BCCI shared pictures on X with a caption, 'Gearing up for the Super 8s. Prep Mode on. #TeamIndia.' While a brief shower caused a minor interruption, the focus remained clear: Honing skills to tackle the challenge against Afghanistan. India has its sights set on big wins against Afghanistan, Bangladesh (June 22) and Australia (June 24). Victories would secure a semi-final berth and potentially end India's long wait for an ICC trophy, a drought stretching back to the 2013 Champions Trophy win. They also aim to lift their first T20 World Cup title since the inaugural edition in South Africa back in 2007. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) IMAGES from the Group 2 Super 8 match, played between South Africa and USA, in North Sound, Antigua, on Wednesday. Resilient Andries Gous led a sensational fightback for USA but South Africa's experienced professionals pulled off an 18-run victory in their Group 2 Super Eight match of the T20 World Cup, in North Sound, Antigua, on Wednesday. South Africa-born Gous led a stunning fightback for USA with a 47-ball 80 not out studded with five sixes and as many fours to keep his side alive in the contest right until the final over, but the Proteas had the final laugh as they opened their account with two points in kitty. Chasing 195 even on a batting-friendly deck at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium was going to be a monumental task for USA against South Africa's bowling attack, but the Associate nation showed incredible gumption in finishing with 176 for six in reply. The South African-born Gous waged a lone battle of sorts for the majority of USA's reply, putting on an incredible 91-run stand for the sixth wicket with Harmeet Singh (38, 22 balls, 2x4s, 3x6s)m, but South Africa had just too many on the board. Even though Steven Taylor (24 off 14 balls, 4x4s, 1x6s) set the tone early for the USA at the top, others like Nitish Kumar (8), skipper Aaron Jones (0), Corey Anderson (12) and Shayan Jahangir (3) flopped with the bat which almost shut the doors on their side. Reduced to 76/5 in the 12th over with another 119 runs to win, USA appeared down and out. But Gous, who has played U-19s for South Africa, and colts World Cup winner Harmeet, went on a carnage of sorts to take their side as close as possible. He swung his bat at will and found gaps with precision as South African bowlers, who had almost set up a comfortable win, were scurrying for cover. In tow, the left-handed Harmeet also dealt a few lusty blows, especially against Tabraiz Shamsi towards the end, to keep USA in the hunt even if the asking rate hovered around 15 runs per over. But at the end, it was Kagiso Rabada's (4-0-18-3) brilliance which ensured Proteas' win after he broke their stubborn partnership and allowed a mere two runs in the penultimate over. USA's resistance also ate into a significant chunk of South Africa's margin of win which would have been far bigger had the two not added 91 for the sixth wicket. Quinton de Kock's quickfire 40-ball-74 provided the impetus as South Africa set USA a daunting 195-run target, in their Group 2 match of the Super Eight stage in the T20 World Cup in North Sound, Antigua, on Wednesday. On a pitch expected to be slow and spin-friendly, De Kock defied the odds to put the USA bowlers to the sword while bringing up his maiden fifty in the tournament, while South Africa put on 194 for four in 20 overs. De Kock's fireworks at the top and skipper Aiden Markram's fluent 46 also helped South Africa banish their top-order woes after the frontline batters had flopped collectively in the group stage. Towards the end, Heinrich Klaasen (36 not out) and Tristan Stubbs (20 not out) added 53 runs unbeaten for the fifth wicket in just five overs. De Kock led South Africa's charge following a meek start which saw Reeza Hendricks (11) being Saurabh Netravalkar's (2/21) latest victim in the Powerplay, putting on 110 runs from a mere 60 balls for the second wicket with Markram. After the right-handed Hendricks mishit a slower one to be caught by Corey Anderson, De Kock took the attack to the opposition and blazed his way to a stunning fifty. De Kock tore into Jasdeep Singh (0/36) hitting the USA bowler for 28 runs in his first over, with as many as three sixes and two fours to set the tone in the South African team's favour. USA introduced spin in the next over but De Kock continued with his charge, hitting left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige for a couple of fours as South Africa finished the powerplay at 64 for 1. De Kock cashed in every time the USA bowlers erred in length, bringing up his fifty off 26 balls when Harmeet overstepped in the ninth over. The left-handed batter was also severe on the burly Anderson who was wayward in the 12th over, smacking him for 17 runs comprising two fours and a six to set himself up for a big total. De Kock, however, failed to get the elevation when Harmeet gifted him with a full toss in the 12th over and Shayan Jahangir took a sharp catch near the ropes at deep midwicket to bring an end to his assault. Off the next ball, Harmeet plucked his second consecutive wicket as he took a sharp catch to dismiss David Miller. Having struck twice, USA brought back Netravalkar and the left-armer did not disappoint, bringing an end to Markram's innings. Ali Khan took a sharp diving catch in front to deny the Protea skipper a fifty, who walked back for 32-ball 46 with four fours and a six. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Politicians from the Left and the Congress party in Kerala have rallied behind Malayalam superstar Mammootty, who is facing online harassment from certain right wing sympathisers in connection with his 2022 film, Puzhu . Certain posts on social media platforms claimed that the movie was anti-Brahmanical. Some of them even used Mammootty's birth name, Muhammed Kutty, to criticise the National Award-winning actor. The row erupted following a recent interview given by the debutante director Ratheena P T's husband to an online channel, where he claimed that the movie was against a particular community and criticised Mammootty for doing the film. Rubbishing the social media campaign against the actor, several persons, including state Ministers V Sivankutty and K Rajan and Congress General Secretary K C Venugopal came out in support of Mammootty. 'Mammootty,' General Education Minister V Sivankutty said, 'is Malayalees' pride' in a Facebook post. CPI leader and Revenue Minister K Rajan described Mammootty as the 'Pride of Kerala and Malayalees'. The minister alleged that 'Sangh Parivar politics' was behind the campaigns and said that such propaganda would not reap its desired results in the state. 'This is Kerala,' he pointed out to those behind the campaign. Recalling a similar campaign unleashed against director Kamal some time ago, the minister said, 'The Sanghi politics of calling Mammootty as Mohammed Kutty, Kamal as Kamaluddin and Vijay as Joseph Vijay will not reap any result here.' Sharing similar views, Congress General Secretary K C Venugopal also strongly supported Mammootty and said the secular society of the state would not support such propaganda. No matter how hard they try to brand a person who has clear political views and acting skills, Venugopal said the people of the state won't support them. In an FB post, the Congress leader added that it is the duty of Kerala society to take care of the actor without being affected by the 'poison of hate campaigns'. A person like Mammootty cannot be confined to the compartments of religion and caste, he said, adding that vested interests are doing so with a clear political agenda. 'Mammootty is Mohammed Kutty only in the contemptuous minds of those hate campaigners,' Venugopal added. The actor is yet to react to the controversy.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'If I had continued staying in Kerala and making films, I would have probably lost my life.' 'I am no longer a film-maker.' Malayalam director Sanal Kumar Sasidharan, whose 2014 film Sexy Durga created a stir, is now trying to release his film, Vazhakku . Sanal claims that the film's leading man Thomas Tovino is obstructing the release. Tovino has vehemently denied this, arguing that it would be in his interest to release Vazhakku as he is the producer. When Subhash K Jha caught up with Sanal in the US, he said he had given up film-making and left the country. \"I stopped making films some years ago. My last film was Vazhakku , which is in the news for all the wrong reasons,\" he says. Why did Sanal take such a drastic decision? \"Too many threats. If I had continued staying in Kerala and making films, I would have probably lost my life. I was being threatened from all mediums possible. For the past few years, I live in the US. I am no longer a film-maker.\" Sanal, whose Sexy Durga was a chilling film on sexual harassment, was accused of the same crime. \"A false sexual harassment accusation was made against me. I was arrested. That's when I decided to leave the country. You will be surprised to know that two years have passed, and no case has been registered against me. No legal procedure, nothing.\" Sanal says. Sanal blames Tovino for Vazhakku getting stuck. \"Tovino Thomas feels it will harm his career. If he felt this way, why did he do this film with me?\" Sanal uploaded the entire film on Vimeo and shared the link on his Facebook page, and captioned it: 'Cinema should be viewed by the audience. For anyone who wants to watch it, here is Vazhakku ( The Quarrel ). You will understand now why the movie hasn't been released.' The film has been taken down from the Web site.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'There is no cringe shot in the film which could give me a sleepless night.' Janhvi Kapoor says her sport drama Mr & Mrs Mahi is a hat tip to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, whose statement from a media event served as an inspiration for the film. Directed by Sharan Sharma ( Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl ), the movie features Janhvi and Rajkummar Rao as the titular couple: Mahendra, a former cricketer, and Mahima, a doctor. After Mahendra spots the cricketing talent in his wife, he encourages her to chase her dream and becomes her coach. \"He ( Dhoni ) gave an interview where he said, 'It's not about the result but about the process. If you do your process with honesty and hard work, the result will be seen at the end and even if you fail, it doesn't matter.' This film is made on that line. I hope we honour his philosophy,\" Janhvi told reporters at the launch event of the film's song Dekha Tenu . Hitesh Harisinghani/ Rediff.com and Afsar Dayatar/ Rediff.com bring back interesting moments from the launch. Rao, who earlier collaborated with Janhvi for the 2021 horror comedy Roohi , said he believes there is a lot to learn from Dhoni. \"True sportsman spirit is visible in him a lot. He is humble and grounded, kind hearted, it shows in his aura. He is such a big legend and the way he conducts himself, there is a lot to learn from him,\" the actor said, adding that the team wants to show the film to the cricketer and his wife, Sakshi. For Kapoor, learning cricket for Mr & Mrs Mahi turned out to be a herculean task as she suffered a lot of injuries during the process. \"A lot of hard work has gone into it. I trained for almost two years. I started training while promoting Mili . Our director is a purist and works with a lot of honesty, so he wanted me to become a cricketer for the film. He didn't want to use VFX or do anything halfheartedly. \"I suffered a lot of injuries as well. While prepping, both my shoulders were dislocated. But I'd like to give all the credit to him, the director, and both my coaches Abhishek Nayar and Vikrant sir who have done a lot of hard work and held my hand at every turn,\" she said. Sharan Sharma praised Janhvi for her dedication and pushing the envelope with the sports drama. \"I think I pushed her very hard to achieve the cricket level we needed for this film. There is no cringe shot in the film which could give me a sleepless night. We pushed her very hard and she endured the torture. The cricket fan in me is thrilled with what she has done in the film,\" he added. On collaborating with Rao for the first time, the film-maker said he is a \"lethal actor\". \"He has the hunger of a first timer and the skills of a legend which is a rare combination. I am only blessed that I got to work with Raj on my second film. It's fair to say he is one of the greatest actors of all time in India,\" he said. The song Dekha Tenu is derived from a stanza from the hit song Shava Shava from Karan Johar's Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham . The track is composed by Jaani and sung by music reality show winner Mohammad Faiz. The song is shot in picturesque locales in Jaipur, showcasing the couple's wedding sequence in the film. Showing his love for the track, RajKummar said, \" Dekhha Tenu is a beautiful song. I've grown up listening to it, and so it holds a special place in my heart. It comes at a crucial and sweet juncture in the film and I am happy that it's finally out for everyone to listen to.\" Janhvi said that Dekha Tenu resonates deeply with her. \"It has a nostalgic charm with a beautiful rendition. Featuring in this timeless gem feels like a full-circle moment for me and my heart is filled with gratitude. It's an important part of our love story in the film and I can't wait for everyone to experience it,\" she said. Mohammad Faiz, the singer, expressed his gratitude for getting the opportunity to recreate the verse. \"It has been a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me. This marks my debut song in Bollywood and the excitement is overwhelming. Being part of such a special film is a wonderful opportunity for me and I am truly grateful for it. \"Preparing this song for Rajkummar Rao and Janhvi Kapoor, alongside working with Jaani, has been nothing short of a dream come true. I am hoping that everyone resonates with the song and gives it the same love that we had while creating it,\" he said. Lyricist-Composer Jaani added, \"It's amazing to see the love people are already pouring in for Dekhha Tenu just after watching a small glimpse of it. It's such an iconic verse, and we wanted to live up to that legacy while ensuring that the new version is as beautiful and unique as the older one. \"The journey of composing this song has been exciting, and I truly believe that Mohammad Faiz has done an exceptional job singing it.\" Produced by Zee Studios and Dharma Productions, Mr & Mrs Mahi releaseS in theatres on May 31.

A bridge connects the living room and the storeroom, suspended over a water-printed carpet. 'We wanted the Bigg Boss OTT Season 3 house to be incredibly unique and vibrant,' says Omung Kumar. 'As a designer, I believe in the magic of transformation. Following the success of last year's sustainability theme, this season posed a fresh challenge to create something equally captivating. In alignment with our theme, we aimed to deliver an experience unlike any other seen before.' 'The keys and locks are a personal favorite -- they represent how contestants are locked in and have to unlock new aspects of themselves.' 'Each element was carefully chosen to evoke intrigue and surprise.' Bigg Boss OTT 3 will stream from June 21 on JioCinema Premium. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Though April didn't see successful films at the box office, one just hopes that the situation is different when they arrive on OTT in June. Not many original Web series or movies have been announced for June, but quite a few Bollywood films will have their digital premieres. Gunaah Where to watch? Disney+ Hotstar Release date: June 3 Gunaah , a thriller. stars Gashmeer Mahajani, Surbhi Jyoti and Zayn Ibad Khan. Abhimanyu, played by Zayn, is falsely accused of murder and betrayed by Surbhi's character, Tara. To seek revenge, he undergoes surgery to change his looks; his new avatar is played by Gashmeer. Maidaan Where to watch? Amazon Prime Release date: June 5 One of the better films post the pandemic and certainly amongst the best of 2024, Maidaan deserved an audience in theatres. Even though it was delayed for many years, the film was promoted quite well and saw a good release for itself despite the clash with Bade Miyan Chote Miyan . The critical acclaim was there as well, but surprisingly it didn't get the kind of audience footfall that it deserved. Now that the film has completed 50 days at the box office, its getting ready for its OTT premiere. Bade Miyan Chote Miyan Where to watch? Netflix Release date: June 6 Bade Miyan Chote Miyan failed at the box office with hardly any collections coming in. The film has folded up under Rs 60 crores, but then on the flipside, it also means that a large volume of audiences hasn't checked it out yet. Considering the fact that this one is a biggie with Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff in lead roles, there is a captive fan base out there which may just prefer to watch them on the small screen now after having missed the big screen experience. Gullak S4 Where to watch? Sony LIV Release date: June 7 One of the most loved Web series, Gullak is now arriving with its fourth season. Each of its first three seasons has seen massive popularity coming its way and very importantly, they have been short, sweet and largely impactful. It's the story of a loveable family on display and the relatability factor is what keeps audiences attracted to it season after season. Blackout Where to watch? JioCinema Release date: June 7 Blackout is a crime thriller starring Vikrant Massey, Mouni Roy and Sunil Grover. The plot revolves around a blackout that hides a jewellery heist. Crime reporter Lenny, played by Massey, stumbles upon the loot and sees it as an opportunity to start anew. However, his plans take a dark and dangerous turn as the night progresses​. Maharaj Where to watch? Netflix Release date: June 14 Though ready for quite some time, it's only now that Maharaj has been announced for OTT arrival. The film is currently being hyped for the debut of Aamir Khan's son Junaid Khan. Given the kind of volatile subject that it boasts of and the fact that Jaideep Ahlawat is the antagonist here, one waits to see what has Director Siddharth P Malhotra created for YRF. A period film, it also features Arjun Reddy leading lady Shalini Pandey as the female protagonist. House Of The Dragon S2 Where to watch?JioCinema Release date: June 17 The second season of House Of The Dragon is all set to arrive in mid-June. The first season had seen mixed reactions coming its way, but it was inevitable that the second season would come into action as well. A prequel to Game of Thrones , comparisons with the legendary series were inevitable and that's something that pulled away a few as well. However, with the second season coming in, hopefully all comparisons would be set aside and the Web series would be seen for what it stands for. Do Aur Do Pyaar Where to watch? Disney + Hotstar Release date: To Be Decided With Vidya Balan leading the show along with Pratik Gandhi and Ileana D'Cruz stepping in as well along with Sendhil Ramamurthy, this romcom has quite a few moments that resonate well with the urban couples. Theatrically, it definitely deserved to do better but then it arrived at a time when audiences had just stopped going to theatres. The reviews for the film and word of mouth from the select audiences who saw it were reasonably fine as well. This means that once it arrives on the small screen, the target audience should grab it. Love Sex Aur Dhokha 2 Where to watch? Netflix Release date: TBD Back in time when Love Sex Aur Dhokha released in theatres, it had turned out to be a surprise success at the box office. No wonder, Ekta Kapoor and Dibakar Banerjee decided to make a sequel and that too with a much bolder theme and a no bar approach of storytelling. Yet again, an all new cast was brought together for this experimental film. Unfortunately, there were no takers for it in theatres this time around and the film went unannounced. One now waits to see how mature audiences grabs it on its digital premiere. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Maharaja is an audacious attempt that breaks down the tropes of a crime film with a brilliant Vijay Sethupathi in the lead, notes Arjun Menon. Nithilan Swaminathan's sophomore directorial outing Maharaja hinges on an emotionally charged, disturbing subject matter that could have gone awry in the hands of a lesser film-maker. It starts with a blank screen, over which we hear someone singing an obscure Tamil film song. We then see that this was from a recess session involving a game of Antakshari , played inside a saloon between the owner and his disinterested employees. We get introduced to our hero, a quiet, head-firmly-to-the-ground kind of awkward guy, a barber by profession, asking his boss for a day off. This detail, like pretty much everything else in Nithilan Swaminathan's film, is derived from the text of the film and you see every accumulated information gets some sense of a payoff in the following bizarre chain of events. We get an early glimpse into his quiet ways and the absent personality in this brief yet effective exchange. Like his debut film, Kurangu Bommai (2017), this film also brims with a sense of detached coldness that is funneled through a more mainstream approach in the writing. Maharaja is a crime procedural in a lot of ways as it follows Maharaja (Vijay Sethupathi), a battered down, older man now, who approaches the local police with a missing case. The missing entity referred to as 'Lakshmi' is a source of comic relief and we wonder at the zany context of its relevance in Maharaja's and his daughter’s life. Nithilan uses the story of how the item went missing for great comedic effect even though Maharaja seems to take it seriously. Maharaja 'S peculiar narration of the events of the night and the thing that went missing becomes eerily funny through repetitions and the straight-faced rendering by the hero, who seems to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown over the missing item. Vijay Sethupathi is the perfect casting choice to play the low-key, guarded figure, whose passive energy is matched by the actor's innate gentleness. There is a blank quality to the way Vijay renders the lines and his held-back body language makes it even more difficult to read the intentions and motivations driving Maharaja's actions. The performance adds layers of despair and lived-in emotional stakes to the screenplay that is content not diving any deeper into his psyche as a human being. The actor underplays the uneasy squirminess of Maharaja's personality. Anurag Kashyap gets to revel as well, in a broader, villain archetype, that is upended by horrible revelations. The performance contrasts nicely with the subtle obscurity of Sethupathi's passiveness. Abhirami gets sidelined in a role that is best warranted to support the main engine of the film's tragic echoes and the rest of the supporting cast, including Mamtha Mohandas, gets very little to do to drive the central events forward. Nataraj Subramaniam is highly effective as the sleazy, bribe-loving cop and his enjoyable rapport with the supporting cast of police officers provide some comic relief. Ajneesh Loknath overuses the thumping, operatic score and sometimes nudges the emotional beats of the film a bit too far. The camera work by Dinesh Purushottaman uses blacks to great impact drawing out the murky, dark undercurrents of the story. At its heart, the film is a story of two fathers caught on the wrong sides of moral and emotional catastrophes in their personal lives. Maharaja can be relentless in its portrayal of gratuitous violence and gore, which is a requisite in this exhilarating story that demands the physical catharsis and release of its characters from the grueling nature of their marginalised existence. A barber, devoted to his work and his daughter, is dragged into a past misunderstanding that propels the narrative forward and we feel like playing a game of catch-up built around a crime and its effects. Time and narrative ellipses are a key part of the film, and we are forced to fill in the structural design of Nithilan's smartly fractured screenplay that never bothers to explain the jumbled timelines. Maharaja works more like a film of great narrative ideas that echo the sorry fate of two men, whose faith is sealed after a chance encounter. Nithilan spends too much time in the darker details of some of the crime episodes and that adds a flavour to the film, but the running time suffers in the process. Nithilan packs the former half with scenes involving Maharaja's stilted interactions with the cops and it almost looks like a workplace comedy, mounted on an emotionally stunted protagonist, whose straight-face sincerity and innocence becomes a butt of many jokes. You keep waiting for the other shoe to drop and slowly get to see the film play its hand ever so slowly. But some of the ideas feel far more effective as story beats that work as a brooding, disturbing idea that is stretched a little too thin in some places due to convenient writing. For instance, the final moments with the police characters and some revelations feel rushed and convenient. At the end of the day, Maharaja feels like a whole picture derived from the many accumulated images, details and reckonings that are tied together by an unexpected final revelation. The brutality of the images and character motivations is balanced by the distancing tone that does not indulges in excessive drama, except for some parts. Maharaja is a surprisingly novel outing, rejuvenating the tired tropes of revenge films with a morally challenging revelation in the final hour, that compensates for the little contrivances in the writing. Nithilan Swaminathan comes up with an impressionistic image in the final shot of the film, where footsteps and drops of blood are used to draw out the fatal tragedy that has befallen one of the characters. That image soars above anything seen in Tamil cinema in recent times. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Bad Cop is not unwatchable. For older viewers, there may even be some comfort in the familiar, notes Deepa Gahlot. Bollywood has already put its stamp on this formula -- twin brothers, one grows up to be a cop, the other a criminal. Still, the new Web series Bad Cop needed to be imported from the German Kriminell Gut (2017). Adapted by Rensil D'Silva, directed by Aditya Datt, the series almost has a neon déjà vu sign flashing over it. In the process of Indianising it, the team of writers has picked every cop-gangster cliche seen in mainstream Hindi films. Even Hussain Dalal's pungent dialogue, with profanity considerably toned down, does not help lift this humourless show. The intention of naming the twins Karan and Arjun must have been cheeky but it just comes across as unimaginative! The show goes into frequent flashbacks to explain how they got separated in the orphanage, and took different paths. Karan (Gulshan Devaiah) is a cop, so resentful of his wife Devika's (Harleen Sethi) promotion to become his boss, that the marriage is on the rocks, despite that annoying kid who keeps popping up and interrupting dramatic scenes. Arjun and his partner Kiki (Aishwarya Sushmita) are petty crooks, and get into trouble when they witness a murder, and he leaves DNA behind (by now, everybody who watches crime thrillers knows they must not touch a dying stab victim!), making him the prime suspect. The dead man (Deepraj Rana) was an investigative journalist, who was about to expose a major criminal nexus. Arif Khan (Saurabh Sachdeva), is a CBI officer, who grabs the case because the journalist was his friend. Where there are so many heroes, there has to be a villain. Kazbe (Anurag Kashyap) is the typical Bollywood don, who rules the jail he is in -- he dances, waves a gun, has a girl in his bed, and chops mutton while barking commands at his minions, adding a touch of comedy which is otherwise missing in the script. The hapless recipient of his rage is usually his bumbling nephew Raghav (Deepak Kamboj) whose spirit is strong, but gun arm weak. During a shootout, one of the twins is killed, the survivor takes on the identity of the other, and as it always happens in films, nobody can tell the difference! There must be some difference in their speech and body language, but why go into that, when there are enough complications to deal with, the biggest being a consignment of contraband that goes everywhere but to its intended recipient. (Kazbe dresses slummy, but uses the word 'consignment', not the colloquial ' maal '.) Meanwhile Arif, with his reptilian gaze, haunts the scene, looking for the killer of his friend, even resorting to illegal bugs, and bullying sleep-deprived techies working on his team. The action sequences and chases are slick, the pace is whizz fast, and the runtime of the episodes (six sent for review out of eight) kept to around 30 minutes. So Bad Cop is not unwatchable. For older viewers, there may even be some comfort in the familiar. Gulshan Devaiah and Anurag Kashyap give good performances, without looking like they have seen or done this a dozen times before, even though Devaiah does not get to really enjoy the double role and work out variations between two characters. There is an unexpected twist in Episode 6, as a reward for viewers who do not give up on the show. Bad Cop streams on Disney+ Hotstar. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

Late in the documentary, amidst the 2022 Laver Cup frenzy, Roger Federer's long-time coach and friend Severin Luthi remarks, 'You know what they say, sports people die twice.' It is the dying moments of Federer the athlete, who once seemed immortal, that Asif Kapadia's documentary Twelve Final Days , addresses. Not surprisingly, the documentary reels you in with footage of Federer's most stunning shots. In that, he could not have found a better muse. We could all happily just watch hours and hours of the Swiss turn tennis into art, with the most elegant, fluid strokes. Peak Federer, untouched by time. But then, it jerks you into reality, takes you to a place where the 20-time Grand Slam champion is preparing to record his retirement note. When Federer bid, in his own voice, a fond farewell to tennis. The one we heard a few days later, on September 15, 2022, in stunned silence. That may be the film's biggest failing. Given that the movie doesn't really delve into the genesis of the champion, the ups and downs of his career, the assumption is that it is meant for people who are already familiar with Federer's work. But the movie seldom tells us much about the last few days of his athletic career, that we hadn't already seen, heard or experienced before. There is much of the same for the die-hard Federer or tennis fans, and not enough for the others. Federer's has been one of the most documented careers ever. He was a master of masking emotion on the court but the Swiss never failed to give an insight into how he felt in the post-match analysis. Whether he was happy or sad or hurt or miffed or just genuinely proud of himself, Federer usually laid it all out. There are some attempts to add context to the retirement saga, like the interactions with his family. His wife, Mirka, a former tennis player herself, makes a rare appearance, as do his parents and four children. There is a lot of tearing up, from Federer, from his family, his rivals, his team, his fans, but very little raw emotion. At least, nothing that hasn't already been captured on film before. The second half of the movie looks like an extended cut of the 2022 Laver Cup, Federer's final tournament as an active player, with his media interactions in London around that time and official press conferences thrown in for good measure. But anything Federer touches can't be all bad. Right? The 20-time Grand Slam champion has been the best advertisement and the most eloquent spokesperson for the sport. He does sprinkle some gold dust through the movie with his insights into the sport -- a confluence of boxing and chess, his own game and also into his rivalries. It is baffling to many how the guy has so much time and grace -- in his career and in the documentary -- for those who have stolen glory from him. On the tennis court, Federer was all about the effortless beauty. When Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic burst onto the stage, their searing intensity was blinding. Their chase-every-ball-like-life-depended-on-it game threw some shade on Federer’s easy style. 'It was something for which I was criticised heavily,' he says of the time Nadal and Djokovic loosened his grip on men's tennis. 'Why didn't I fight more when losing? I didn't quite understand what that meant. Do I have to grunt? Do I have to sweat? Do I have to shout more? Do I have to be more aggressive towards my opponents? I tried but it was all an act.' The documentary spends considerable time on the dynamics of Federer's rivalry with Nadal and with Djokovic. And rightly so. Federer may have kicked off the greatest generation in men's tennis but it took Nadal and Djokovic's undying spirit to make it what it was. The setting of the finale is the Laver Cup, a team tournament conceived by Federer to honour tennis legend Rod Laver and one that provided a fitting platform for his farewell in 2022. As the action shifts there, it becomes clear why the Swiss ended up as one of the most loved sportspeople. Even though every conversation, be it with fans or with his heroes like Laver and Bjorn Borg, carries the under-current of his impending retirement, Federer carries on being funny and curious and personable. For years, he was the glue that held tennis-bringing players and fans of different countries, cultures and generations together. His farewell ended up being a celebration of not just Federer's career, but that of the sport and some of its best practitioners, past, present and future. His final match, a doubles match with Rafael Nadal as his partner on September 24, 2022, and the ceremony and speeches after were a tearjerker then, and are a tearjerker now. While Federer was always a crier, watching strongmen Nadal and Djokovic weep for a part of their career and life they were saying goodbye to was extraordinary. Humanity of super athletes rarely fails to move. And that's what Federer, Kapadia and everyone involved in the making of Twelve Final Days , will be banking on to make it a success.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'Love in today's time is very fast paced, whereas I seek calmness in love.' Once the cherubic face who charmed audiences as Krish, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol's son in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham , Jibraan Khan is now set to step into the spotlight once more, this time as the leading man in the rom-com Ishq Vishk Rebound . His journey from child artist to adult actor has not been easy. It's filled with hundreds of auditions and multiple rejections. \"My struggle has taught me a lot of things but I am happy with what is happening today and whatever is going to happen ahead in my life,\" Jibraan tells Rediff.com Contributor Mohnish Singh . The trailer and songs of your debut film as an adult have been generating buzz, especially among youngsters. How does it make you feel? It's a feeling that I cannot describe in words. I waited for years to bag a film of this scale to make my debut with. We are so blessed to be working with a production house like Tips Films, with our producers Ramesh Taurani and Jaya Taurani. Our director ( Nipun Dharmadhikari ) is fantastic. The icing on the cake is this kind of reaction that we are getting for the film's music. When I wake up in the morning and see this love coming my way, it overwhelms me. It also motivates me to work even harder in future. I hope we get the same amount of love when our film releases in cinemas on June 21. What are your memories of the original Ishq Vishk ? I was eight when the film released. I clearly remember that I, along with my sister and her friends, went to Chandan cinema in Juhu ( north west Mumbai ) to watch the film. When I came out of the theatre, I was singing the title track, Ishq Vishk . The entire cast of the film was fresh and so was its album. I would say Ishq Vishk was a breath of fresh air at that time. The makers and Rochak ( Kohli, music director ) have tried to come up with a fantastic soundtrack this time around as well. How is Ishq Vishk Rebound similar to Ishq Vishk ? There is nothing common between the two films story-wise. Our story is new, our characters are new. The only common thing, I would say, is that Ishq Vishk had a fresh cast and incredible music. Our film also has a fresh cast and great music. Another similarity would be the confusion around love. See, love is the same but its meaning has changed over the years and that we have tried to show in this film as well. Additionally, you will see emphasis on friendship and the importance of family. How challenging has your journey been from child actor to leading a big banner like this? The answer to this question is long but I would say that it has been very, very tough. Every actor's journey is different and difficult. I cannot say that it's easy for some actors and difficult for others. But when I talk to you, the press, go out for promotions, see my face on hoardings and amid all of this, someone walking up to me and asking for a selfie, all those memories of my struggles evaporate. The journey was difficult, of course, but when I see the present, it's worth it. My struggle has taught me a lot of things but I am happy with what is happening today and whatever is going to happen ahead in my life. Was it the first film you auditioned for as an adult actor? No, no, not at all. I have auditioned a lot in my life like any other actor and have been rejected. I have said no to scripts as well. This was one film where I felt when I left the audition room only that yeh mil jaye to mazaa aa jaye because the title has a great recall value. Additionally, our producers are very prominent. They make hit films and always deliver good music. How do you see love? Love is all about simplicity. When I reach home, I want peace, happiness, and, of course, a lot of fun. I fear unnecessary, irrelevant questioning which maybe stems from insecurity. I believe that love in today's time is very fast paced, whereas I seek calmness in love. I am a little old school type, so I believe in simplicity and calmness in love. Do you think social media has complicated love? Yes, but it is a tool that you can use the right way also. See, love has been different in every generation. It was different when our parents were young. Love was then about a phone call, a trunk call. Then it came to e-mails. Now, it's about right and left swipes. Love keeps evolving, but that simplicity has gone somewhere. Did the fact that it's not a solo-hero film and that you are sharing screen space with three other actors bother you? All of us read the script before signing the contract, so we knew who was doing what in the film. It's a film about four young people. At the end of the day, what truly matters is that what your story is trying to say. It's extremely hard to bring audiences to theatres in the age of OTT. Does that scare you as a newcomer? See, no actor or producer is trying to make a bad product. We put our hearts and souls into making a film thinking the audience is going to love it. Come June 21 and the fate of our film would be in audiences' hands. I don't know how they are going to react. I can just pray that they love it. Everyone comes with that belief that, you know, it will be accepted. Yes, I am nervous ( laughs ). But I also strongly believe that we have made something solid.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'The earlier you get your treatment done, the better the chance of recovery.' Singing legend Alka Yagnik shared heart-breaking news this week when she announced that she suffered from a rare sensory neural nerve hearing loss due to a viral attack. Just what does that mean and what causes it? More importantly, how can we avoid it? Dr Suresh Singh Naruka , Senior Consultant, ENT, at Apollo Hospital, Delhi, has been treating patients for 15 years and does a quick FAQ with Ronjita Kulkarni/ Rediff.com , advising, \"Never use your amplification hearing devices like headphones and Bluetooth for more than half an hour in one go and try to moderate the intensity. It should not be 90 or 100 decibels. If you want to enjoy your music, 45-50 decibels is fine.\" What does Sensory Neural Nerve Hearing Loss mean? The ear serves two functions. One is to make ourselves hear the world, and the second is to maintain balance. So we stand, sit and we walk because of our eyes, our ears and our joints. Like other organs can lose their functions, the ear can also lose their functions. Sudden hearing loss means the functional capacity of ear goes off all of sudden. The ear has three components: The outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer and middle ear serve transfer the sound from the environment to the inner ear. The inner ear has some hair like cells, which transfer the sound by making them into signals to the brain. This is how we hear. Now if these hair cells lose their function, we cannot hear. This is what we understand as hearing loss. Hearing loss is bilateral or unilateral, which means either both ears or it can affect only one ear. Sometimes, the ear can lose function but not completely. So the hearing loss is not 100 percent. One can have a partial sudden hearing loss too. Sensory Neural Hearing Loss means the inner ear is not functioning. What are the reasons for this? There are two types. One is idiopathic, which means we don't know the reason. Majority cases are in this category. In the second, it's a known cause. These known causes can be sound trauma, viral infection, bacterial infection like meningitis and trauma. Sometimes we can have sudden hearing loss because of tumors. In her post, Alka Yagnik cautioned against loud music and headphones. Is that also a cause? Yes. In medical science, we understand these situations as noise trauma. If there is a sudden blast or if you go to a ( night ) club where there is loud music of 100 decibels and if you expose yourself to that for more than 30 minutes, you may get sudden hearing loss. Is this age-related? Sudden hearing loss is not age-related. Gradual hearing loss is age-related. Nerves start aging like the other parts of the body. Diabetes, chronic diseases, liver disease and blood pressure can make the nerve age faster. But sudden hearing loss can happen at any age. We have seen kids with sudden hearing loss. What are the symptoms for Sensory Neural Nerve Hearing Loss? Sudden hearing loss itself is the symptom. Sometimes, sudden hearing loss is associated with dizziness or imbalance because the other purpose of the ear -- balance -- may also get compromised. They may also feel vertigo and vomiting, but not always. What is the treatment for this? Again, there are two types. If the cause is known, the treatment becomes a little easier. You have to remove the cause. Like if it is a bacterial infection, you remove the bacterial infection and you can get your hearing back. If it is a tumour, you remove the tumour, and you can get your hearing back. But the most important factor in idiopathic hearing loss is time. The earlier you get your treatment done, the better the chance of recovery. Like, if you have any organ failure, if you reach hospital faster, the chances of your survival or your organ survival is better. The same goes for the ear. If you have sudden hearing loss, and you reach hospital in one hour, you will get better chances of recovery. If you will reach in one day, you will have more chances of recovery, but not as good as one hour. So time is very important. For treatment, we use an audiogram to check the hearing. We do an MRI to check for tumours. We sometimes do impedance audiometry to identify hearing problems. We check your blood sugar and do a thorough check on any other illness you have. We can start giving steroids through the intra-tympanic route. There is a window in the ear, the round window, through which we can introduce steroid drugs into your inner ear and hyperbaric oxygen. Oxygen can sometimes revive your organs. What are the precautions against this condition? Avoid noise pollution. Whenever you are having fever for a long time, correct your fever because in some cases like viral fever, one can have hearing loss. Avoid the use of ear buds. Avoid listening to loud music. Of course, other things like avoid smoking and alcohol, blood pressure is bad, uncontrolled sugar is bad. We all know that we should take care of these things. You mentioned ear buds. Can you please elaborate? Ear buds are not to clean ears. The purpose of ear buds is to apply ointment but mistakenly, we use ear buds for cleaning ears. We don't know what is inside our ears. We use ear buds blindly. Suppose if our ears have some structural abnormalities, it can be damaged with ear buds. A blind procedure by using ear buds for ear cleaning is not advisable and sometimes, can be dangerous. Sometimes, you can also stimulate a nerve which can stop the heart from functioning. You can have syncope and be unconscious for a few seconds because the nerve which supplies the eardrum is also supplying the heart. To stimulate your nerve from your ear can stop your heart to function for a few seconds. So if you are on a flight of stairs at that time, you can fall down and have other injuries too. Would you say this condition is common in your experience? See, it's not uncommon. Being an ENT, working in Apollo Hospital, Delhi, we see such patients weekly, especially the youth, who use hearing amplification devices like headphones or Bluetooth too often. It will be disastrous if we keep up the noise pollution, for our ears, for society... You know, noise is not good for animals too. If it can impact animal behaviour, it is impacting our behaviour too. If you are habitual of using headphones all the time, the social interaction is becoming less and it's impacting our behaviour. If you're listening to music or watching movies or videos all the time on your headphones, you are on your own. How will you bond with the others around you? So for the future, this is not something we recommend. What advice would you give our readers? Get a routine check-up of your ears annually. Never use your amplification hearing devices like headphones and Bluetooth for more than half an hour in one go and try to moderate the intensity. It should not be 90 or 100 decibels. If you want to enjoy your music, 45-50 decibels is fine. We should not involve ourselves in activities which include loud sounds for a long time as are troubling your ear as well as your brain. Like, if we are going to a ( night ) club, we should not be inside for more than an hour. Try to come out after 30 minutes, so you can relax your ears so that they are ready to bear that noise trauma again. If you are in a club for a long time, it is not good for your ears. We should not use ear buds to clean our ears. You can introduce infection. You can even traumatise your eardrum. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'It's such a mishmash of wonderful things, so many different cultures, subsections of society and weird histories.' UK-based artist-turned-film-maker Karan Kandhari was one of the first-time directors celebrated at the recent Cannes Film Festival. His film Sister Midnight , starring Radhika Apte, opened in the festival's Directors' Fortnight sidebar. In Sister Midnight , a quirky, at times deliciously funny and dark comedy, Apte plays Uma, a newly-married bride who moves to Mumbai to live with her husband Gopal (Ashok Pathak) in a small room by the side of the road. The marriage is in trouble from the beginning. Uma knows nothing about maintaining a home or cooking. The husband is almost always drunk and afraid of initiating sex. As time passes, Uma reveals her dark desires which give the film a wildly crazy twist. Apte is a delight to watch in the film. Screen Daily referred to Apte as 'sensational' in its review of the film. Born in Kuwait and educated in the UK, Kandhari uses an eclectic mix of world music in the film, including Cambodian songs from the 1960s. In another unconventional film-making style, he marries live-action with stop-motion puppets used for animals. While Sister Midnight has one Indian producer on board, Alex McAlex ( Kila ), and the Amazon Prime Web series Poacher ), the film is mostly funded by Film4 and the BFI. Recently, Anurag Kashyap and Resul Pookutty pointed out that nearly all the Indian films that played at Cannes this year, including the Grand Prix winner All We Imagine As Light , were funded from outside the country. The Indian government and film production houses gave no support to these films. Aseem Chhabra spoke to Kandhari a day after the film's premiere at Cannes, and there were two things he mentioned before the interview: \"Please be gentle with me\" and \"I am a little hungover from last night.\" He added: \"I don't live in India. The film happened to be set there. I am obviously Indian but I don't know much about the industry there or anything. So I am a bit of an outsider.\" Karan, even as an outsider, the film gives a feeling that you have a keen sense of life in Mumbai. I visited Bombay about 20 years ago, just after art school. I didn't really know the city. It has an intoxicating personality. It's such a mishmash of wonderful things, so many different cultures, subsections of society and weird histories. All these things clashing with each other that somehow it works. I was not being able to get the city out of my head. That was the initial seed for the film. The character then came to me but then it took another 10 years before that sort of wordless moment pops in your head. And then, it took another 10 years to get the film made. Can you talk about casting Radhika Apte? She's amazing in the film and I have never seen her this animated, this much fun. She's doing comedy, but it's not laugh-out-loud kind of comedy. How did you direct her? I was struggling for five years to find the right actor. I tried to look at films and TV shows to see who could do the role of Uma. I couldn't find anyone, until someone suggested I should meet Radhika Apte. So I checked a clip and as I was watching it, I was like, 'Oh my God, this woman is fearless.' I didn't look at anything else. I was already sold and based on that, we sent her the script. I was a little nervous when I went to meet her because if she had said no, I don't think I could have made the film. She was talking about stuff, all the things she was doing. She was scuba diving at that time. Then she just said, 'Yeah, I loved it. I want to do it.' So she was attached to the film for five years and we got to know each other. We would talk around the film because many times, it was about to get made and then it got delayed. When it got to actually doing the film, we did a lot of rehearsals. It started with just Radhika and me. She's obviously a prolific performer and has her own process. She has a very clear idea of how to work. Her approach was very intellectual, while I was trying to get her to be in the present because the film is very behavioral and has its own strange rhythm. Once she got it, she said, 'My God, I have never acted like this.' Radhika was so trusting, fearless and willing to be as silly as the film needed her to be. Was it difficult for Radhika since she has very few dialogues? For Radhika, it was very liberating. The role is made for her. What about your other cast members? I know you worked with Dilip Shankar for casting. But how did you find the supporting cast, especially Smita Tambe, Chhaya Kadam (both play Uma's neighbours) and Ashok Pathak? I call Dilip, Detective Shankar, because he works like a detective. I was looking for actors who could leave their intellect at the door and crawl into my strange way of doing things. So we saw lots of people. It was a drawn-out audition process, working through scenes together and trying to find actors who could slip into that humour and rhythm because it is a strange way to perform and not everyone is going to click into it. Tell us about the music you selected for the film. I have an amazing music supervisor who's worked with me since my shorts. She's my secret weapon. Her name is Chloe Savage. I don't have an intellectual answer for the choice of music. It was literally in my head as I was writing the film. So we pre-cleared everything. I think the best way I can describe the music is there is a playfulness in the way we juxtaposed things -- listening to Motorhead while Uma is running down a shack, or towards the end of the film, cutting to the Buddhist monastery with nuns and you have a Marty Robbins cowboy ballad playing. It just felt right. Also, it wasn't a conscious decision but we don't use any Indian music. I was listening to this beautiful Cambodian soul music from the 1960s which to me, shared a similar vocal style to Indian music. The film, in a sense, is a weird cultural collage. It's interesting when you said there is no Indian music. It just felt right. The Cambodian stuff, when it plays in the West and people can't identify it, because all of this culture belongs to the world. Why not mix it up? Was the animation there from the beginning? It was always in my mind that the animals should not be real. I wanted something that was slightly askew. Stop motion animation inherently has that quality, so you don't need to push it. Also, I am not a fan of things done digitally. A lot of the film is handmade and you can't fake light-hitting physical fur or feathers. So it was very important to have that tangible quality. What I like about the film is that while it is set in India and the actors are Indian, it is not an Indian film. The ethos and the mood is from everywhere. I am Indian but I think it's restrictive to say you are an Indian film-maker or a UK film-maker. This is the only other story I have in India. The next one is about a woman from North Shields, and it's partially set in Stavanger and Bergen ( both in Norway ), and then in Berlin. That is all I can say. I can tell you what it's called because I only seem to be able to think of movie titles that are based on Iggy Pop songs. Sister Midnight is named after an Iggy Pop song, and the next is called A Heartful of Napalm which comes from the Stooges and Iggy Pop lyrics for the song Search And Destroy . ( I'm a streetwalking cheetah with a heartful of napalm/I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb). Why Iggy Pop? He's my hero. I listen to a lot of music as I am writing. It's not necessary that music makes it into the film. I was also listening to Leonard Cohen and Patti Smith. And a lot of Bob Dylan. There's a sequence towards the end of film, when Radhika's character is being hunted by a mob. She jumps off the roof and this lightning strikes. A couple of minutes later, two electricians cut the wires the wrong way. They think she is a goddess. That came from Bob Dylan song called Drifter's Escape and it goes: Just then a bolt of lightning/ Struck the courthouse out of shape/ And while everyone knelt to pray/The drifter did escape. Are there any film-makers who have influenced you? Yes, John Walters, ( Jean-Pierre ) Melville, ( Yasujirō ) Ozu. That's quite a span of film-making. Ozu was a big thing for me when I was younger. I learned the ability to observe and be still and humour also. Look at Good Morning about the two kids who go on a silence strike because they want their parents to buy them a television set. It is really funny. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) \"Just three months more,\" says mom-to-be Deepika Padukone in a witty reply when asked if she is still in her character of a pregnant woman from her coming film Kalki 2898 AD . \"The movie went on for about three years. So I was like, why not?\" the actress said, flashing a radiant smile that adds to her glow. The question came from Rana Daggubati, who graciously hosted the pre-launch event for his Baahubali co-star and dear friend Prabhas ahead of his latest pan-India biggie. The star-studded gathering for Director Nag Ashwin's ambitious Kalki 2898 AD was held in a hotel in Mumbai on Wednesday evening, setting the stage for exciting countdown to the film's June 27 release. Deepika and Prabhas were joined by Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan, who form the stellar ensemble of the upcoming sci-fi drama. In contrast to the film's dystopian theme, Prabhas looked dapper in a black shirt, whereas Kamal Haasan wore a snappy beige-coloured jacket and a black cap. Deepika Padukone was ultra glamorous in a body-hugging black number and high heels and her Piku co-star Amitabh Bachchan looked at ease dressed in a black hoodie paired with a comfy pair of trousers. The extremely shy Prabhas said he has always been a fan of Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan and working alongside them in this film was 'bigger than a dream.' \"The first time when I met Amitabh sir I touched his feet. Sir asked me not to do it. He said he would touch my feet as well. We grew up watching his films. He is the first actor to attract audiences across the country.\" The actor shares an anecdote of how he wanted to imitate Kamal Haasan after seeing his films, \"When Sagara Sangamam came, I wanted to sport Kamal sir's costume and asked my mom for it. In Indrudu Chandrudu , sir had a tummy. My cousins used to wear a cloth around their stomach and imitate Kamal sir. I am now working with him. This is something unbelievable.\" The film marks Prabhas and Deepika's first collaborative project and the actor was all praise for her, \"I always wanted to work with Deepika. She attained stardom across the globe. She is a gorgeous, beautiful, and a great actress.\" Oh, Prabhas does talk, and here's proof. Even Deepika couldn't resist saying, \"He deserves applause for speaking more than just two lines.\" Nag Ashwin, best-known for directing the National Award winning 2018 biographical drama Mahanati , previously hailed Kalki as his passion project. The film marks the 50 years celebration of the Telugu industry's prolific studio Vyjayanthi Movies. Producer C Aswani Dutt's younger daughter Priyanka is married to Ashwin. While the director couldn't attend the event due to the film's demanding post-production work, he conveyed his excitement in a video message. He shared a peek into the dystopian future of the film and explained that Kalki is set in Kashi where the Ganga has dried up and people live in brutal conditions as all the major resources are sent to the Complex, controlled by Kamal Haasan's tyrannical figure named 'Supreme Yaskin'. Kamal Haasan, who is known for his wacky get-ups in films like Indian and Dasavathaaram , shares the story of how he experimented with his look on his own as the antagonist of this film. He then realised that the Big B has already got it in his look, so he dropped the idea. The senior actor then suggested donning a heavy armour suit but Prabhas had already got that one. He quipped that he would have tried Deepika's look as well but didn't want to be pregnant in the film. Just why did Kamal Haasan take up the project? He tells us here. Pointing towards her baby bump, Deepika reveals that Prabhas would feed everyone on the set \"from his heart\" and added, \"Actually, I have become like this because of all the food he ( Prabhas ) has fed me. \"Every day Prabhas would bring food for all of us. It got to a point when it wasn't just food coming from home, there was like a full catering service. Those, who know him well, know he feeds from the heart.\" After her speech when Deepika stepped off the stage, both Prabhas and Bachchan rushed forward to escort her. The Big B playfully chided Prabhas for beating him to it. Producer C Aswani Dutt and daughters Swapna and Priyanka Dutt presented Amitabh Bachchan the first day first ticket of the film, as a long-running tradition of the Telugu film industry. Bachchan thanked them and mentioned that Dutt is the \"most simple and kindest\" person he has met in his life. He went on to touch Aswani Dutt's feet. Visibly surprised, Dutt reciprocated the gesture. Amitabh buys the ticket and gifts it to Kamal Haasan: Amitabh touches Aswani Dutt's feet When asked whom he would like to give the ticket to, Amitabh said, \"I will give it to my colleague, my dear friend, my brother Kamal Haasan.\" While accepting the ticket, Kamal Haasan reminisced about waiting 'three weeks' to watch Sholay . He jokingly said that he wished this had occurred four to five decades ago during the release of the 1975 Hindi blockbuster. \"I waited three weeks to watch it. I never imagined I would be here receiving the first day first show ticket from Mr Amitabh Bachchan. I was a film technician then, and now I am an actor. Nothing has changed,\" the superstar said.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'Playing Murlikant Petkar changed my life.' Kartik Aaryan considers Chandu Champion the most important film of his career so far. \"Playing Murlikant Petkar changed my life,\" he tells Subhash K Jha . \"I've done so many films, in so many genres, but never a biopic. The experience is completely different. I had to transform myself, both physically and mentally, and the prep began from the day I signed the film. \"A thrilling opportunity. The lessons I learnt on this film are going to remain close to my heart forever. I've also gotten a window to connect with a newer, wider audience, specifically every person striving to achieve their dreams by going against odds. Not many actors get this opportunity, to touch the hearts of the audience, and this character gave me that.\" Kartik speaks on the rigorous regiment he underwent to look convincing through various stages of Mr Petkar's life. \"The training regimen brought more discipline into my life. I had never looked at fitness the way I did during the process of becoming Murlikant. Once I got started, something changed in my wiring. \"Now I am more particular about what I eat, how I eat, and when I eat. It's a completely new lifestyle. Everything now has to fit within my health plan. I learnt on this film is that health needs to be taken care of first. So it is important to have the right health coach to take you through a transformation and do it the right way without any shortcuts.\" The transition from Bhool Bhulaiyaa to Chandu Champion wasn't easy for Kartik. \"In my earlier work, the characters I played had a bit of 'Kartik' in them. I would find a personality trait of mine and highlight it. \"But getting into the shell of a real person, with a life as illustrious as Murlikant Petkar, was important to me. It needed focus, a lot of unlearning and new learnings. I had to set 'Kartik' aside and become a different performer.\" Kartik reveals that the real Murlikant was very much a part of the project. \"Kabir sir ( Khan, Director ) spent the most time with him, and I was tasked with following his cinematic envisioning of the character. I met Murlikant Petkar for the first time after our first schedule. I was shooting in Pune and he had come on the set. He saw me giving a swimming shot and he said, ' tune ekdum mere jaise kiya .' That was a huge compliment for me. \"Then we had our first movie screening in Delhi with Murlikant sir being the main guest. It was heartwarming to watch the film with him in the theatre, smiling throughout the film, with some occasional tears. Post the viewing, he was very emotional. His smile and him holding my hand was all the validation I needed. I feel like I've already received the biggest award for this film.\" Among the directors he has worked with, Kartik rates Kabir Khan very high. \"Kabir sir is a very disciplined film-maker. He is so well prepared that it makes you push your boundaries further. He gives a lot of space for an actor to perform. \"Murlikant Petkar was a very difficult character for me to get into, and I would give the entire credit to Kabir sir and team because they helped me understand the character and bring out my best on screen.\" Kartik is overwhelmed by the response to Chandu Champion so far. \"I have been getting overwhelming response. Of course, getting appreciation from veterans like Shabana Azmi ma'am and Javed Akhtar saab is a huge deal. Shabana ma'am came out of the screening and gave me a tight hug. Javed saab said that ' tumne hansaya bahut tha, lekin itna rulaya pehli baar hai .' These words are no less than a medal or an award for me. A senior person messaged me after watching the film saying, please let me know wherever you are, I will come and want to give you a jhappi . \"My mom got so emotional after watching the film. I have never received so much love and appreciation for any of my film.\" To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The new season takes the students out of their preoccupation with studies to other problems -- jealousy of another's easy success, a blip in a romance, financial crunch, meltdowns, discovers Deepa Gahlot. When the first season of Kota Factory came out in 2019, it brought the Rajasthan city to the notice of audiences, who may not have been aware of the intense competition and soul-crushing slog that goes into the preparation for entrance exams of elite engineering and medical courses. Getting in means success and financial stability for the whole family. The flip side is the fear of failure that has led to an inordinately high number of suicides among the coaching class students of Kota. Subsequently, this grim reality of youngsters cracking under the pressure of expectations and shattering of dreams has been making it to the news. The solutions, like locking terraces or putting springs in fans, hardly tackle the actual core of the issue: The shortcoming of the Indian education system. TVF's Web series went into the classrooms and hostel digs of Kota but sanitised the air of anxiety that must permeate the walls of the commercial coaching classes for whom topping exams is more important than the mental or spiritual health of the students. Then there was Jeetu bhaiya (Jitendra Kumar), who was different: The popular physics teacher, with an aphorism for every crisis. It was in Season 2 that a suicide occurred and in Season 3, directed by Pratish Mehta, that Jeetu bhaiya is assailed by self-doubt (and recurring mould on his walls) that leads to therapy. The star teacher of Kota had, in the last season, started his own institute called Aimers because he always told his students not to dream but to aim, as dreams are just seen but aims are meant to be achieved. In Kota Factory Season 3 , also in black and white like the earlier two, the same core group of students returns, to carry forward the plot from coaching to the make-or-break exam. The fine bunch of actors include Vaibhav (Mayur More), Balmukund Meena (Ranjan Raj), Uday (Alam Khan), Vartika (Revathi Pillai) and Shivani (Ahsaas Channa). A new character is added in the form of Pooja didi (Tillotama Shome), whose approach to teaching is like Jeetu bhaiya 's -- make the kids feel for the subject, not just pass. The new season takes them out of their preoccupation with studies to other problems -- jealousy of another's easy success, a blip in a romance, financial crunch, meltdowns -- but the focus shifts from the students to Jeetu bhaiya 's angst (which gives the actor more performance challenges). He becomes aware that he takes on too much of the emotional burden of the students, trying to be the balm for everyone's bruises, and something's got to give. Meanwhile, reality gets darker, the education system more toxic, its purveyors more avaricious. Jeetu bhaiya may fly off the handle when a colleague (Rajesh Kumar) suggests that they focus on the brightest students but even to his own ears, his words about making the effort regardless of the results sound hollow. Because the coaching classes of Kota and the town itself flourishes because it promises toppers. The students, often seen like ants scurrying about in top shots, are just fuel for the money-making machine. The real achievement of Kota Factory is that it inspired other shows ( Crash Course, Shiksha Mandal ) and films ( 12th Fail, All India Rank ) to bring attention to the atrocities of the education system in which aptitude comes last. Kota Factory 3 streams on Netflix. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

The game for the Mirzapur throne is about to get more exciting in the third season of the highly anticipated Web series. To make the announcement of this power battle, Kaleen Bhaiya and Guddu Pandit had a face-off on Thursday, June 20, 2024, afternoon. Pankaj Tripathi, who plays the dreaded Kaleen Bhaiya , and Ali Fazal whose violent turn as Guddu, will power Mirzapur 3 , took centre-stage at the event. Other members of the cast -- Shweta Tripathi Sharma, Rasika Dugal, Vijay Varma, Anjum Sharma, Isha Talwar, Priyanshu Painyuli and Sheeba Chadha -- were also present. Mayur Sanap/ Rediff.com brings back some interesting tidbits from the launch. \"Wherever I go,\" says Co-Producer Farhan Akhtar, \"people ask me only three questions: One is, What are you doing here? Second is, When will Don 3 release? And third, When will Mirzapur 3 come? So I'm very happy that the show is finally happening.\" Mirzapur 's first season began streaming in 2018 to a critical reception, followed by Season 2 in 2020. So what happens next? The cast mostly remained tight-lipped but Ali Fazal disclosed that his character Guddu goes to extreme ends. \"I know I have justified a graph for this particular boy, who at the essence of it all, holds his innocence despite so much corruption around him,\" says Ali who garnered much national attention in Mirzapur 's first season before making waves overseas. \"A young boy, almost at an impressionable age, gets turned into all kinds of demons because of the circumstances in society, and he becomes what he becomes,\" says Ali. \"So yes, it has taken a lot out of me. I will always cherish it.\" The actors reveal what to expect in Season 3 \"In the first season,\" says Shweta Tripathi Sharma, \"Golu was a rasgulla . In the second season, she was an aag ka gola . In the third season...she is a bomb.\" Addressing the popularity of his character Kaleen Bhaiyya , Pankaj Tripathi says, \"We are just puppets, they are the masters. We only read lines that are given to us and we enact our characters to the best of our capability. If the show is successful, it is because of the fantastic team of all the creative people working on it.\" Vijay Varma gives us his spin to the story: \"Revenge is the main thing.\" So what can fans expect from Season 3? Director Gurmmeet Singh shares that the theme is \"relentless\" and the long wait for the show will be worth it when audiences watch it on Amazon Prime Video beginning July 5. \"We are excited as our audience who waited for three-and-a-half years for this new season,\" he says. \" Sabra ka phal meetha nahi, Mirzapur 3 hota hai . The stakes have gone notches higher and the canvas has surely become bigger. With Mirzapur 3 , we strive to build on the momentum and take the narrative to a whole new level,\" says Gurmmeet.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Maharaj 's mediocre social drama lacks the spine and spunk to recreate the relevance of revolutionary decisions in the face of religious fanaticism, observes Sukanya Verma. It's rare for a star son to come out with a debut in a manner as lowkey as Junaid Khan's Maharaj . Yet, Aamir Khan's son's first film, produced by one of the premier banners of Hindi film industry Yash Raj Films, is bereft of the pomp and fanfare that accompanies launchpads without as much as a teaser, forget word-of-mouth, to announce its presence. Perhaps its premise, inspired by the Maharaj libel case of 1862 argued at the court in (back then) Bombay made it imperative for its makers and platform to underplay its existence. Seeing the objections and delay in its release after a legal petition was filed by followers of the Vaishnavite Pustimargi sect resulting in a stay order exactly one day before it was to drop on Netflix as originally planned on June 14, their caution wasn't entirely unfounded. A week later, Maharaj 's intentions of retelling a real-life case has the last word and the movie is available for all to stream and see. Much ado about nothing, really. Directed by Siddharth P Malhotra, Maharaj 's mediocre social drama lacks the spine and spunk to recreate the relevance of revolutionary decisions in the face of religious fanaticism. In the tradition of PK, Ashram, Sirf Ek Bandaa Kaafi Hai . the idea is to lay bare the blind devotion of bhakt s as well as the unchallenged exploitation at the hands of Godmen against the backdrop of 19th century Hinduism. What unfolds though is a jaded, wobbly commentary that has the mind of a monotonous television serial and the face of a mainstream Bollywood masala . It is essentially a conflict of David versus Goliath magnitude between righteous rage and spiritual narcissism. Vipul Mehta's adaptation of Saurabh Shah's Gujarati novel starts out by reformist journalist Karsan Das Mulji's ' krantikari soch ' (Junaid Khan) noting the wrongdoings within the ashram, addressed as haveli by its devotees. The devotees include Karsan's family and fiancée (Shalini Pandey, reinforcing herself in a regressive stereotype), willingly offering themselves to their guru Yadunath or JJ (Jaideep Ahlawat) as everyone calls the man. But Maharaj 's aesthetic depiction of inappropriate practices branded as ' charan seva ' neither fully shames JJ's sexual predator nor explains his grip over his followers. Jaideep Ahlawat's charisma looms large but the writing fails to capitalise on his menace beyond a smug cardboard figure. When Karsan learns about his betrothed's betrayal, the scenario takes the discomforting shape of 'my patriarchy is better than yours' as he goes about blaming his girl and guru in the vein of a petulant child. By the time he comes around to protesting in an adult fashion by collaborating with the icons of the time, Maharaj has fizzled out on all fronts. History's heroes like Dadabhai Naoroji and Bhau Daji Lad are reduced to costume-y nondescript figures to accommodate Sharvari's vintage style and flirtatious activist lest the hero feels arm candy-less for too long. Treating a serious period drama as fluff by stuffing it with distractions of song, dance and romance, Maharaj neither looks like it belongs in the British Raj nor wants to. When the token English faces do show up at the fag end of is flippant courtroom battle, Karsan's moderately expressed criticism of representatives of religion not to be mistaken for religion itself loses its vigour around the scandalous revelations of JJ's sexual ailments. Maharaj 's shortcomings would be less noticeable under some dazzling leadership. But newcomer Junaid has a long way to go. He has a statuesque quality and his dad's smile but cannot convey any emotions beyond huff and puff. Looks like that's the only reaction Maharaj is capable of eliciting. Maharaj streams on Netflix.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) South Africa beat the United States by 18 runs in the first T20 World Cup Super 8 game in Antigua on Wednesday as Kagiso Rabada's experience came to the fore at the end of a tense game. Having struggled on New York's slow pitches in the group stage, South Africa scored freely at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, posting 194-4 on the back of Quinton de Kock's fine knock of 74. In response, USA opener Andries Gous (80 not out) provided the fireworks along with Harmeet Singh (38) down the order but fast bowler Rabada picked up crucial wickets in his spell of 3-18 and restricted the run rate as USA fell short. \"We've had some tricky wickets coming up to this game and I think it's just nice to spend some time out in the middle,\" player of the match De Kock said. USA had won the toss and opted to field first, picking up the wicket of Reeza Hendricks early but De Kock cut loose as South Africa scored at over 10 runs per over during the powerplay. De Kock reached his fifty in 26 balls and shared a 110-run partnership with skipper Aiden Markram off 60 deliveries. Harmeet Singh dismissed De Kock when he mistimed a full toss and was caught near the boundary and the all-rounder was on a hat-trick when he had David Miller caught and bowled. Markram fell four runs short of his fifty when he chased a wide loose ball and Ali Khan took a sharp diving catch to give Saurabh Netravalkar his second wicket. Despite Netravalkar's superb spell (2-21), the others failed to contain South Africa as Heinrich Klaasen dealt in sixes and scored a quick-fire 36 in an unbroken 53-run partnership with Tristan Stubbs (20) to propel them to 194-4. American opener Steven Taylor (24) underlined his intent when he smashed a boundary off the first ball, but after four fours and a six, he fell to Rabada when a mistimed shot was caught at mid-off. The fast bowler also dismissed Nitish Kumar, who was caught at deep square leg, and U.S. captain Aaron Jones fell for a duck to spinner Keshav Maharaj. Gous continued to resist, bringing up his fifty with back-to-back sixes, but the required run rate continued to climb. There was hope when Shamsi went for 22 runs in an expensive 18th over but Rabada returned to dismiss Harmeet, conceding only two runs in the penultimate over. \"It's hard to take the defeat after getting so close. We could have been a little more disciplined bowling-wise,\" Jones said. \"It could have been a closer game and we could have got over the line.\" To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'If I am greedy, we were 10-20 short, especially after the start we got. Not quite played a complete game of cricket but we are on the right track.' South Africa skipper Aiden Markram applauded his bowlers for sealing a thrilling seven-run victory over England in a T20 World Cup Super Eight Group 2 match in St Lucia on Friday, saying they did not wilt under pressure. England needed just 25 runs from the last three overs with six wickets in hand but tight bowling left them stranded at 156 for 6 in their chase of 164, on an easy-paced wicket with even bounce. \"Last three overs we had a lot against us but the bowlers had good plans and pulled it off,\" said Markram, whose side's innings was built around opener Quinton de Kock's fine 65 off 38 balls. \"If I am greedy, we were 10-20 short, especially after the start we got. Not quite played a complete game of cricket but we are on the right track.\" He singled out de Kock for special praise. The opener dished out a second good performance in the Super Eight stage and helped South Africa win their sixth game on the bounce in the World Cup. \"Quinny (de Kock) has been good for us in the last two games. It was a bit nerve-wracking in those ( last three ) overs but it can happen. The plans were there, just the execution wasn't. I'm grateful that catch ( of Harry Brook ) stuck,\" he added. England skipper Jos Buttler too praised De Kock on his enterprising batting. \"The tougher overs in the power play today were from the bottom end which de Kock really took on and took some risks and played well, so as I've mentioned, I felt like the power play was the difference in the game,\" he said. \"I think the way Quinny could bat at the rate that none of us could bat at for -- but like I say, yeah, we fought back brilliantly well with the ball and restricted a really strong line-up to what was about a par score probably.\" England couldn't push the pace in the powerplay, losing Phil Salt (11) in the second over. None of the top-order batters -- Jonny Bairstow (16), Buttler (17) and Moeen Ali (9) could capitalise on the starts. It was a spirited fightback from Harry Brook (53) and Liam Livingstone (33) which gave England hope but South African bowlers executed their plans to perfection as the defending champions couldn't make 25 runs in the last three overs despite having six wickets in hand. \"The wicket was probably a little bit slower than everyone expected. So, yeah, 160 was about a par score. I thought we bowled really well in the back 10-15 overs there to restrict them. \"Brook and Livingston had a fantastic partnership, like I say on a slow wicket where other guys struggled and I thought their partnership was brilliant and they've got us to a position where, you're probably looking like your favourites at one point to go on and win the game. \"But yeah, I thought that was an awesome partnership and just couldn't quite finish it off.\" De Kock, who picked up his second 'Player of the Match' in Super Eight stage, said he just tried to carry on from where he had left off against the USA in the previous game. De Kock had scored 74 off 40 deliveries in the opening Super Eight game. \"I try to carry on confidence game by game. We bowled really well in the powerplay and we controlled it very nicely. To be able to defend 160 on a decent wicket is a good effort from us.\" To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

South Africa's wicket-keeper and opening batter Quinton De Kock attributed his swashbuckling display against England, at St Lucia, to his knowledge of the local conditions which was possible due to his stint in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL). De Kock slammed a 38-ball 65-run knock studded with four sixes and as many fours to help South Africa post 163 for six in their T20 WC Super 8 match. In reply, England fell seven runs short, finishing at 156 for six. \"I've played a lot of day T20s in cricket in the West Indies and generally that is the most important time to score runs, it was the easiest time to score runs,\" said de Kock, who slammed 49 runs off 20 balls in the powerplay. The match started at 10.30am local time, while the previous four T20 World Cup games at the venue had an 8.30pm start. \"I don't know if the rest of the guys knew, but I had a fair sense. I've played here quite a bit in the Caribbean League. Same thing, (the) wicket looks beautiful at night, plays most differently, but at the day 160-170 are winning scores here in the day. \"I think generally it goes by like that in the Caribbean. I think the lights and maybe a bit of dew at night help the ball skid on a bit better. \"The easier time to score runs is in the powerplay. When the ball is old and as the wicket deteriorates, it gets harder.\" De Kock said powerplay wasn't the only factor and there were other moments which helped them win. \"I think our bowlers also bowled really well, one or two key moments that could have also been a standout over I think KG's (Kagiso Rabada's) final over was also could be potential match winning. \"I think there was (some) other moments but obviously that's probably one of our better powerplays this whole World Cup so (it) could be, you never know.\" To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The Blackcaps, who are among the most consistent team in world cricket, failed to qualify for the Super 8s of the ongoing ICC event, marking the end of a cycle, reckons former Kiwi wicket-keeper Ian Smith. “They've just come to the end of a really good cycle where their results have always been competitive, and we've got through to finals in world competitions. Players getting on a wee bit, getting older, starting to work on what is important to them and how they can maximise what's left in their career dollar-wise. “You can't blame a lot of them for that. You get one opportunity at it and it's a lot more lucrative to travel the world and play in the leagues than it is to stay in New Zealand and be based there. It's something New Zealand have to look at,” he said referring to top players opting out of central contracts. \"The other thing is we need some fresh ideas in the coaching department. I don't think one coach can coach all three forms of the game anymore and so therefore New Zealand just needs a bit of a new broom to sweep through after a pretty successful cycle.” Following the World Cup exit, Kane Williamson declined a central contract to spend more time with family and be available for franchise cricket. First Trent Boult and now Willamsoin, does it set a dangerous precedent? “Well, he's not the first player of course to do that. Trent Boult has done it, Jimmy Neesham has done it, Colin Munro has done it. He's the most important cricketer to us to have done it. “So I think it's an indication that when you have paid your dues, when you've had a long and distinguished career, you start to be able to pick and choose what you want to do for the remainder of your time. And I think it's just an indication now for him he would have thought long and hard about giving up the captaincy because it's important to him. “The good news is he's still available for New Zealand. And in particular, in Test Cricket, 32 Test Hundreds to improve on, that's important,” said Smith, who played 63 Tests and 98 ODIs between 1980 and 1992. Does the trend of giving up contracts lessen the importance of a national cap? “Oh look, yeah, it depends you see on what level your national contracts are and what financially valuable they are. In New Zealand our pay scales are well below than some other countries. And so in our respect, we've been hanging in there with our dollar value contracts because that's been really our only option and there's nowhere else to go. But now there is (with so many leagues going on). “Myself back in the day. Yeah, I would have done the same thing at this stage of my career (as Williamson did). I would have followed the money,” he said with all honesty. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Records toppled as West Indies clinched a thumping 9-wicket win over the co-hosts, USA, in the Super 8 match of the ongoing T20 World Cup, in Bridgetown, Barbados, early Saturday. Both teams struck a total of 14 sixes during the match. This took the overall sixes tally to 412 in the ongoing World Cup. This is the most sixes scored in a single edition of the tournament, surpassing 405 in 2021. Nicholas Pooran struck three out of the 14 and took his individual tally to a whopping 17, the most sixes scored by a player in a T20 WC edition, going past the iconic West Indies opener Chris Gayle, who racked up 16 sixes in 2012. Pooran is also now the leading run-scorer in the ongoing World Cup with 227 runs at an average of 45.40 and a strike rate of 148.36. On a batting-friendly surface, West Indies produced a clinical bowling spell to restrict the USA to 128. Roston Chase made the headlines with his clinical spell that spun out the USA batters. Chase kept the run rate in check and registered figures of 3/19. Andre Russell complimented Chase with his variations and ended up with figures of 3/31. The star all-rounder is now level with former West Indies all-rounder Dwayne Bravo for most wickets for the Caribbean side in T20 WC. Both all-rounders have 27 wickets under their belt in the marquee event. Hope raised his bat for a 26-ball fifty by smoking the ball into the stand right after the powerplay. He ended the match with a towering six and sealed a 9-wicket win for the Windies with more than nine overs to spare. Hope finished the match with a quick-fire 82* off 39 deliveries.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Global consumer preferences can be influenced through music, films, literature, yoga and sports because they create interest and a sense of familiarity that can help our businesses to access foreign markets, suggests T N C Rajagopalan. India's soft power is set to go up a notch or two with the T20 cricket World Cup being held this month. In turn, that can help trade and investment. Soft power is the ability to connect with others through culture and moral authority that can help influence their attitudes, and over a period of time their behaviour to get the desired outcomes. It is a matter of building trust and establishing a positive image and reputation. Sports can play as powerful a role as culture in doing so. During the freedom movement, the non-violent protests by Mahatma Gandhi and millions of his followers caught the attention of the world in a positive way. Our policy of non-alignment and principles of peaceful co-existence at the height of the Cold War also gained a lot of respect during the initial years of independent India. Of late, yoga is being popularised in all parts of the world. Our software professionals and people settled abroad have vastly enhanced our image. Our film songs, Raj Kapur's Awara and other movies in Soviet Union, the films of Amitabh Bachhan and Shah Rukh Khan in West Asia, Rajnikant's Padayappa and other movies in South East Asia and Japan, and Aamir Khan's Dangal in China gained enormous popularity and created plenty of goodwill for India. Widely respected cricketers like Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble and Virat Kohli have generated enough positive vibes towards India that our diplomats have been able to build on. Till recently, only Britain and its erstwhile colonies played the game. However, the result oriented T20 format that lasts for only about three-and-a-half hours and played in the evening hours has got more countries interested. The WCT20 this year is an important event because 20 countries are participating in the tournament and for the first time 16 matches, including the high profile India-Pakistan match, were played in the United States. It is a great opportunity to improve the connections with the people in the richest country of the world and Canada. Cricket is included as one of the sports in the 2028 Olympics to be held at Los Angeles. The spread of the T20 format has increased the opportunities for our franchises, cricketers, coaches, umpires, commentators, support staff and curators who prepare the pitches. With a strong positive image among the people in various countries, it is easier to attract foreign investment. Cultural appeal coupled with political values such as respect for rule of law and human rights build trust, which is important for investors. Global consumer preferences also can be influenced through music, films, literature, yoga and sports because they create interest and a sense of familiarity that can help our businesses to access foreign markets. Personal connections through educational exchange programmes, cultural interactions, sporting links and travel also help develop a favourable view of the country. Soft power through culture, sports, yoga etc, however, can go only so far. Stability of economic policies, respect for rule of law and human rights, responsible policies towards sustainability and environment, a credible judicial system, a well-educated and skilled manpower and a favourable perception of fair play by the Executive etc are also important factors that influence businesses in various countries in a positive way.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The Budget should use the extra RBI surplus to better effect, suggests A K Bhattacharya. Now that Nirmala Sitharaman has returned to the ministerial portfolio she held for the last five years, the Union finance ministry has got down to its most important task -- preparing the Budget for 2024-2025. An Interim Budget was presented by her on February 1 earlier this year, but that was only a vote-on-account, seeking Parliament's approval for incurring a specified amount of expenditure till such time as the full year's Budget is presented by a new government and approved by Parliament. Unlike a few of the previous Interim Budgets, Ms Sitharaman refrained from making any policy announcement or taxation changes, honouring convention and staying on the path of correctness. Now, as she gets ready to prepare the full Budget for the current year, what should be her key concerns? Undoubtedly, the macroeconomic circumstances under which the forthcoming Budget will be prepared are looking healthier than what prevailed when the Interim Budget was presented. Retail inflation is under control, even though it is still above the government-mandated target of 4 per cent. Gross domestic product or GDP grew by 8.2 per cent in 2023-2024 and is expected to grow by 7.2 per cent in the current year. Foreign exchange reserves are comfortable at over $640 billion. The current account deficit was well under control at 1.2 per cent of GDP in the first three quarters of 2023-2024 and may even be lower than 1 per cent for the full year, according to some estimates. There are, however, worries on the exports front, with merchandise goods exports falling marginally last year and service exports losing their earlier momentum. With geopolitical tensions showing no signs of subsiding, international commodity prices, particularly those of crude oil, could be another cause for concern. But, overall, the Budget for 2024-2025 can benefit from reasonably sound fundamentals of the Indian economy. There is yet another positive boost for the 2024-2025 Budget that comes from recent developments. The Reserve Bank of India's surplus transfer this year would be 133 per cent more than what was originally expected. The total transfer estimated at Rs 2.1 trillion will create an additional fiscal headroom of almost 0.37 per cent of GDP. Should the government use the extra receipt to reduce its fiscal deficit, or increase investment to add to the country's infrastructure capacity, or provide tax incentives to revive consumption demand, or take steps to create more jobs at the lower end of the employment market? The efficient husbanding of resources by the government last year has meant that the fiscal deficit for 2023-2024 has been brought down to 5.6 per cent of GDP, against the Budget estimate of 5.9 per cent. This should make the task of reducing the deficit to 5.1 per cent, as projected in the Interim Budget, relatively easy. Indeed, the finance ministry can aim at a sharper reduction to achieve the 4.5 per cent target earlier than 2025-2026 and outline a new glide path for meeting the optimum target of 3 per cent over the next few years. The big policy options that need to be exercised by the next Budget is whether it should focus only on reducing the deficit this year or use the available resources to address other pressing needs of the economy, such as investments, employment creation and boosting consumption demand. A mixed approach would be ideal. The second upside for this year's Budget may come from unexpected quarters. From July 2022 to June 2024, the government's goods and services tax (GST) compensation cess revenue is likely to be around Rs 2.7 trillion, which is the amount the Centre had borrowed from the RBI on behalf of the states to meet their revenue losses during the Covid months. While the states ceased to get any compensation cess benefits from July 2022, the Centre has been collecting that amount to help it repay the loans. Details of the actual repayment liability on this account are not available, but it is likely that the full repayment will be completed before the end of March 2025. This will offer an opportunity for the government in two ways. The finance ministry could remove the GST compensation cess (at present the cess is applied to non-merit goods like tobacco products, aerated water and motor vehicles at different rates) or subsume a part of it in the revised rates for such products. Ideally, the cess should be removed, and this exercise should be aligned with the overall long-pending GST rate rationalisation to reduce the multiplicity of rates and increase the revenue neutral rate for the GST regime. The second benefit could be to use the removal of the compensation cess for reducing the overall GST incidence on products and services and boost demand. Going beyond the Budget options, there is a major reform that the finance ministry could undertake by introducing greater transparency in Budget presentation. All Budgets presented after general elections have relied on the revised estimates of the preceding year, which were presented in the interim Budget. However, by the time the full Budgets are presented, the finance ministry has access to the provisional numbers for the previous year, even though they are unaudited. Notably, in a few of the Budgets for pre-election years, the differences between the numbers given in the revised estimates and the provisional estimates have been quite significant. For instance, in 2008-2009, the provisional estimate for total revenue receipt was 3 per cent lower than what was given out in the revised estimate. And the government's capital expenditure in the provisional estimate was 8 per cent lower than the corresponding number in the revised estimate. In 2013-2014, the government's net tax revenue in the provisional estimate was 2.4 per cent less than it was in the revised estimate. The variations reached excessively high levels in 2018-2019, when the provisional estimate was 9.6 per cent lower than the revised estimate for total revenue receipt, 11 per cent lower for net tax revenue and 6 per cent lower for total expenditure. In most of these cases, these differences did not make a major impact on the final fiscal and revenue deficit numbers. But the variations in revenue and expenditure figures meant that any reading of the economy based on those numbers would have been misleading. More importantly, the full Budget estimates presented for the election year made comparisons that were patently inaccurate. The Budget documents would provide numbers on revenue and expenditure only under the heads of Budget estimate and revised estimate, even though sharply divergent figures based on the provisional unaudited estimate would be available with the government. The differences between the provisional figures and the revised estimates for 2023-2024 have not been sharp (the former numbers have been 1 per cent more than the revised estimate), but the finance minister could be more transparent if the Budget provides the provisional numbers as well, along with the revised estimates, so that a more accurate reading of the government's revenue collections and expenditure pattern could be possible. That decision would be another step towards imparting greater transparency to Budget-making. Feature Presentation: Aslam Hunani/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live!

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Technology giant Apple Inc has pushed the pedal on exporting iPhones from India by racking up exports valued at over $2 billion in the first two months of the current financial year (FY25), according to the data provided by vendors to the government. This accounts for 81 per cent of the country’s total production of iPhones worth $2.6 billion. In May, Apple repeated its performance of April and once again crossed $1 billion of iPhone exports. An Apple Inc spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. The commitment under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for the three Apple Inc vendors in FY25 is to hit a production value of $10.2 billion (including exports). They have achieved 25 per cent of that target in just two months. So far in FY25, Apple’s leading vendor Foxconn Hon Hai has contributed 65 per cent of the total exports, Wistron 24 per cent, and the remaining 11 per cent has come from Pegatron. All three iPhone vendors are participants in the smartphone PLI scheme, and have just begun the fourth year of the five-year scheme. Apple, which has the world’s largest global value chain (GVC), closed FY24 in India with a total iPhone production of $14 billion in free-on-board (FOB) value. The market value of these iPhones would be approximately $22 billion, depending on the cost of logistics and local taxation. In FY24, Apple exported $10 billion worth of iPhones, which accounted for 70 per cent of the FOB value of the year’s production. Rapidly growing iPhone exports pushed up India’s mobile phone exports to $15.5 billion in FY24. This constitutes a nearly 40 per cent increase from the $11.1 billion mobile phone exports in FY23. Electronics exports, led by mobile phones, have also climbed from sixth spot in FY23 (with an export value of $23.6 billion) to fifth in FY24, clocking $29.1 billion — which is an increase of 23 per cent over the previous year. In FY24, iPhone exports constituted 35 per cent of India’s total electronics exports and 65 per cent of its total mobile phone exports. Apple has continuously expanded its production and exports from India over the last three years, crossing $1 billion exports each month during non-peak periods of April and May. Usually, Apple’s production for India sales peaks ahead of the festive season between July and October, and the new iPhone model is usually launched in the country in September. Its exports peak from October to December as the Indian factories get ready to supply iPhones to Western markets during Black Friday, Thanksgiving, and the Christmas and New Year festivities.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The ministry of information and broadcasting (I&B) on Wednesday held an inter-ministerial meeting with various departments to discuss issues regarding revenue sharing between Big Tech companies and digital news publishers, according to sources. The meeting — chaired by I&B Secretary Sanjay Jaju — invited senior officials from the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA), Competition Commission of India (CCI), ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity) and departments of promotion of industry and internal trade, legal affairs and consumer affairs. “We have only had preliminary discussion to develop an understanding of the issue at hand and whose purview these matters would fall under,” a senior official said. The government has been approached by digital news publishers regarding abuse of dominant position by Big Tech players in ad-revenue share agreements, sources said. The discussion comes in the backdrop of the draft digital competition Bill proposed by the MCA. The Bill was drafted on the suggestions of an expert committee constituted to look into the need for ex ante regulations for Big Tech companies. Favouring the ex ante regulations, the Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) had said large digital enterprises indulge in non-transparent data and revenue sharing policies, search and ranking preferencing. They are into bundling, tying and collecting user data to improve their own products, allowing bidding on keywords, leading to infringement of registered trademarks, among other issues. “CCI should have pre-factum power for checking abuse of dominant position by large digital enterprises before revenue-sharing agreements are entered into with news publishers,” DNPA had said. Sources, however, said that the unfair competition issues between news publishers and technology companies may require a separate framework. Taking into account numerous representations by industry associations raising serious concerns on the proposed digital competition Bill, Meity also called for a meeting with MCA and various industry associations to discuss the matter. The meeting is expected on Thursday. Concerns have been raised by several industry representatives on the pitfalls of the proposed digital competition Bill. According to a report by Reuters, a US lobby group, representing tech giants Google, Amazon and Apple, has asked India to rethink its proposed EU-like digital competition law. It argued regulations against data use and preferential treatment of partners could raise user costs. The proposed Bill requires digital companies to notify the CCI that it fulfils to qualify as a Systemically Significant Digital Enterprises (SSDE) based on the criteria set in the Bill. Such enterprises would have to establish transparent and effective complaint handling and compliance mechanisms. They have to report and operate in a fair and transparent manner with end users and business users, according to the draft Bill. SSDEs cannot directly or indirectly favour its own products, services, or lines of business, or those of related parties. They can’t use or rely on non-public data of business users operating on its core digital service. Issues at hand To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) As the job markets open up, top IT services firms may look at a tiered strategy in which they hire entry-level talents at higher salaries, amid a major technological shift, say HR analysts. About five years ago, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Accenture, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant, and Capgemini, among others, were the companies who had formulated this strategy. \"IT services companies were losing talented freshers to MNCs and differentiating the engineers based on assessments has given them the ability to financially bucket these grads into different pay packets. \"This allowed them to hire highly skilled and in some cases freshers from premier colleges at higher pay brackets,” said Kamal Karanth, founder and CEO, Xpheno, a specialist staffing enterprise. A fresher joining the IT services sector gets anywhere from Rs 3.25 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh per annum. Freshers who get selected through this tiered framework can get salaries that range from Rs 6.25 lakh to Rs 12 lakh per annum. With the campus hiring in the slow lane, hiring under this tiered framework has also taken a hit, but campus placement heads and HR specialists that Business Standard spoke to opined that with artificial intelligence and new-age technologies in focus, this strategy will now become the core focus area. Emails sent to players such as TCS and Wipro remained unanswered. The trend started as digitisation started to become the buzzword and clients started asking for skills that were higher than what IT firms were generally hiring for. “A decade ago, most of the engineering hiring done by the IT services was largely plain vanilla type of hiring. \"Again from a skill point the projects that IT services handled were also application development management type that entailed Java, Testing, SAP or Oracle. \"This started to change when the buzz of digitization started. \"Clients would also say that they do not want the same plain vanilla engineering talent skill sets. \"Over the years, software development also started to undergo changes,” explains S Pasupathi, COO, HirePro. This is when the companies started to relook at their strategy. So either they went to Tier-I colleges, but then they would not get the day one placement slot or within the same campus there would be a different stringent cut-off based on a different test to identify these students. Another reason why this was launched was the competition coming from global capacity centres (GCCs), startups, and MNCs who also began to visit campuses. “These firms would pay a higher level of salary for a fresher, which was Rs 7 lakh. So the top talent started to move there,” said a head of HR operations in a mid-tier IT services firm. Neeti Sharma, CEO Teamlease Digital believes that as a strategy, differential salary at fresher level, even in a slow hiring market has not lost its relevance. “Each of these categories under the differential salary comes with different salary levels, educational level as well as aptitude,” she explains. “We have seen that people hired through these funnels, the stickiness of these employees increases. \"We have seen that the attrition in this hiring goes down by 8-10 per cent,” she added. In the case of talent, this works for the freshers as well, since those who get hired through this route get a clear growth potential for them as well as a clear career road map. Though this was launched in 2019-2020, those hired through this tiered structure formed 20-30 per cent of the total fresher hiring that was being done by the companies. V Samuel Rajkumar, director (career development), VIT Vellore, says that of the total students hired over the last two to three years, almost 20 per cent were hired through this tiered framework at the campus. In 2024 Accenture handed 181 offers for freshers from VIT for the role of Advanced Engineering with a package of Rs 11.89 lakh. In 2023 it was 201 offers, and 289 offers in 2022. Likewise, TCS gave offer to 324 students under the Digital category at VIT in 2024 with a CTC of Rs 7 lakh and 104 offer in Prime category with CTC of Rs 9 lakh. In 2023, TCS had given 418 offers under the Digital Category at VIT. Pasupathi believes that going ahead, as the market opens the focus will be on hiring through this tiered framework. The ratio of such hiring already touched a ratio of 30:70, which is likely to change over the years. To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Equity investments by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) in the Indian market have shown a mixed trend over the past six months. While foreign investors withdrew money in two months during this period, including April, domestic institutions remained consistent and were net buyers. Cumulative flows by FPIs during this period amount to Rs 75,000 crore, while those of DIIs are 2.4 times higher, totalling just under Rs 1.8 trillion. Instances of withdrawals for domestic investments have been few, with negative flows or outflows recorded in only four months out of the past 28. In April, FPIs turned sellers due to the rise in crude oil prices and US bond yields. Given that institutional investors have substantial holdings in midcap and largecap companies and their actions play a major role in price trends, Business Standard examines the S&P BSE 200 group of stocks in which the two investor categories have shown the most confidence. The 10 stocks on this list have witnessed at least four consecutive quarters of an increase in shareholding by FPIs or DIIs, respectively. In the FPI list, except for Mankind Pharma, the shareholding of foreign investors is higher than 20 per cent. For the DII group of stocks, the highest shareholding is in Voltas at 40 per cent, followed by Delhivery at just under 20 per cent. Additionally, except for Star Health & Allied Insurance Co, most stocks have delivered strong double-digit returns in the past year, with Indus Towers leading the pack with gains of 129 per cent. Supreme Industries Riding on strong demand, Supreme Industries delivered a 41 per cent volume growth in the pipe segment in the January-March quarter of 2023-24. The segment accounted for over 80 per cent of the company's overall volumes. Given the robust demand traction, it has guided for overall volume growth of 20 per cent, with the pipe segment expected to grow by 25 per cent in 2024-25. Geographic expansion through brownfield projects and setting up new plants at Patna and Vijayawada are key positives. YES Securities is bullish on Supreme s growth prospects, given healthy demand from agriculture, infrastructure, and plumbing segments, coupled with a focus on expanding market share via adding more stock-keeping units, finding newer applications (such as gas distribution), and increasing its distribution network. Indian Hotels Company The management of hospitality major Indian Hotels Company is eyeing double-digit growth in revenue per available room for 2024-25 on a high base, led by the opening of 25 new hotels that can add 3,500 rooms, and new businesses growing at over 30 per cent year-on-year. The uptrend in the hospitality industry, according to Motilal Oswal Research, is expected to continue, with all-India demand growth likely to be 10.6 per cent from 2023-24 (FY24) through 2026-27 (FY27) compared to supply growth of 8 per cent. Revenue and operating profit of the company are expected to grow by 13 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively, during FY24-27. Growth, according to JM Financial Research, will be led by a robust development pipeline (80 per cent of which is asset-light), strong traction in new brands, and expansion into newer categories/businesses. Mankind Pharma One of the leading domestic pharmaceutical majors, Mankind Pharma is the fourth largest in terms of value and third largest in volume share of the Indian market. The company s focus on increasing its share of chronic drugs is expected to boost its gross margin. Growing its presence in diabetes, respiratory, central nervous system, and urology, among others, is expected to help take the chronic share rise to 50 per cent in the long term from 35 per cent in the nine months of 2023-24. JP Morgan has an overweight stance on Mankind, given a higher revenue growth forecast in the domestic business aided by thrust from modern trade, e-commerce, and hospital channels and guidance of double-digit growth in exports. New launches in the US can potentially offset declines in one-off opportunities, and pricing growth in domestic business is expected to remain healthy in 2024-25 despite no pricing growth in the National List of Essential Medicines portfolio. Indus Towers The successful follow-on public offer and efforts to raise debt by Vodafone Idea (Vi) have removed a key overhang on the recovery of dues for Indus Towers, which offers its telecommunication towers on a rental basis to Vi and Airtel. IIFL expects Vi to raise its mobile broadband location count from the current 170,000 to 250,000 over the next two years. It expects Indus to garner 80 per cent of the same, which should boost its tenancy ratio to 1.95 times from the current 1.7 times. A key trigger would be the resumption of dividend payment, which was suspended due to Vi s receivables issue. If Indus reinstates its dividend policy of paying out 100 per cent of its free cash flow, the same could translate into a dividend yield of about 6 per cent. Delhivery The company is a market leader in India s business-to-consumer express division (outsourced pie) with a market share of 21-22 per cent, nearly twice that of the nearest competitor. Delhivery is better placed than peers, given its low customer concentration risk of less than 15-16 per cent, scale and reach in T.ier-II and Tier-III cities (18,500 pincodes), and has the lowest cost advantage, says Elara Securities. A healthy balance sheet with a cash surplus of Rs 4,600 crore as of September 2023 to fund working capital and growth is an added positive. While the thrust on its own logistics service is likely to impact volumes in the near term, operating leverage and the sustenance of incremental gross margins around 50 per cent in transportation could lead to breakeven at the net profit level in 2024-25, says Emkay Research. Ashok Leyland After strong growth in the medium and heavy commercial vehicles industry over the past three years with an annual growth of 18 per cent, some moderation is likely in the near term. However, positive macros and continuing infrastructure spends should sustain growth in 2024-25. Within commercial vehicles, categories such as bus, tractor-trailer, and tipper are likely to do well, says Nuvama Research. An added demand trigger for Ashok Leyland is defence orders, which are expected to take the revenues from that vertical from Rs 300 crore in 2022-23 to about Rs 800 crore in 2023-24, estimate analysts. Net pricing is expected to stay healthy in the near term, given the price hike of 1.5-2 per cent by the sector and stabilising average discounts. This is positive for the company which is eyeing a mid-teen margin ahead of the current 11-12 per cent levels. Voltas Voltas indicated that its volume growth in room air conditioner (RAC) was 71 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2023-24 (FY24) and it has been gaining market share in the quarter (FY24 share expected at 22 per cent) after losing share over 18 months. Motilal Oswal Research believes that RAC is a long-term structural story, given the low penetration level in India, rising income levels, and thus, aspiration of middle-income group and rising heatwaves across the globe. UBS Research believes that Voltas has successfully reworked its supply chain in the RAC segment, further optimising its cost structure. With reducing costs, it will be difficult for new entrants to match Voltas, leading the industry into the early phases of consolidation and potential market-share gains for Voltas, says the foreign brokerage. FSN E-commerce Ventures (Nykaa) Nykaa s pre-quarter update for the fourth quarter (Q4) indicates sustained momentum for the beauty and personal care segment with gross merchandise value (GMV) growth at 30 per cent and fashion GMV growth in the high twenties. Overall, GMV growth has been strong and crossed 30 per cent after three quarters (on a high base of 36 per cent last year). The performance is relatively superior to other discretionary companies, given the sustained demand weakness in Q4, says Axis Capital. With competitive intensity moderating and working capital stabilising (at a higher level), a key driver ahead shall be margin delivery, says Nuvama Research. The brokerage has built in a 400-basis point operating profit margin expansion from 2023-24 through 2025-26. Key levers for the company include a revival in advertising income, moderation in marketing spends, and operating leverage. Cholamandalam The non-banking financial company has delivered its best-ever payouts, collections, and profitability in the fourth quarter of 2023-24. Net income was 41 per cent year-on-year while net profit was up 24 per cent over the year-ago period. Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company is a well-managed franchise and has displayed agility in moving across segments to grow ahead of the industry with no major asset quality issues, says Centrum Research. Repricing of automobile loans will help offset a higher cost of funds and support steady net interest margins, while return on assets can rise 20 basis points from 2023-24 (FY24) through 2025-26 (FY26), says Jefferies Research. Earnings are expected to rise at an annual growth of 30 per cent during FY24-26, estimate analysts. Over 70 per cent of analysts polled by Bloomberg are bullish on the stock; their target price indicates over 10 per cent upside potential. Star Health & Allied Insurance Co Star Health & Allied Insurance Co is the largest private standalone health insurance company in the country and has the largest retail health insurance share based on gross written premium (GWP). In 2023-24 (FY24), the company s retail health market share stood at 33 per cent. The company highlighted that the GWP growth in FY24 was a result of strong retail health insurance demand that the company capitalised on through one of the largest agency networks, its strong digital channel sales, and collaborations with banks and financial institutions. Loss ratios improved 356 basis points sequentially to 64.1 per cent as the impact of price hikes kicked in, and seasonal illnesses abated, driving the normalisation of loss ratios. Investments in preventive health checkups also helped loss ratios. Nuvama Research says it is enthused by Star Health s improving commentary and focus on growth, with targeted improvement in loss ratios. Seventy per cent of the analysts covering the stock have a buy rating on the insurer. Disclaimer: This article is meant for information purposes only.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Plug-in hybrids have two engines and the electric part has a much larger battery than in the regular hybrids. Car companies, led by the Japanese, are pushing the Indian government to look at hybrids in the interim if it wants to reduce carbon emission. Just over a year ago, the march of electric cars around the world seemed unstoppable. Sales were on an upswing and the general expectation was that they would soon dominate the passenger vehicle industry, supplanting internal combustion engines (ICE). How things have changed. In 2023, electric car sales slowed down and hybrid cars threatened to steal electric's thunder. According to S&P Global, the penetration of all categories of hybrids has gone up from 9 per cent globally to 11 per cent in 2023 and is neck-and-neck with electric cars, though the latter are marginally ahead at 12 per cent, compared to 10 per cent in 2022. In the United States, hybrid sales in 2023 were 1.4 million and overtook electric cars, which sold 1.2 million. Globally, sales of plug-in hybrids grew faster, going up by 43 per cent in 2023, compared to a 28 per cent increase for electric cars. Plug-in hybrids have two engines and the electric part has a much larger battery than in the regular hybrids. As the name suggests, plug-in hybrids require to be plugged into an electric socket to charge their battery. A regular hybrid gets its battery (smaller than in plug-ins) charged by the gasoline engine -- the two complement each other -- and regenerative braking. Plug-in hybrids in China grew by 85 per cent in 2023, while electric vehicles grew by 70 per cent. In India, the popular hybrids, such as Toyota Hyryder and Maruti Suzuki's Grand Vitara, do not require to be plugged in. The global trend towards hybrids is now visible in India, where they are being seen as an essential bridge to EV land. \"India will take a long time for 100 per cent electric cars. However, to reduce carbon emission, we have to go in the interim for an alternative, which complements electric cars and that is hybrids, which will replace ICE cars,\" Maruti Suzuki Chairman R C Bhargava, a vocal advocate of hybrid cars, said in an earnings call a few days ago. Going by the trend, the government's earlier target to have a 30 per cent penetration of electric cars by 2030 looks like a tall order. New estimates put the penetration from as low as 15 per cent to 23 per cent. That is why car companies, led by the Japanese, are pushing the Indian government to look at hybrids in the interim if it wants to reduce carbon emission. Bridge to EV Bhargava said in the earnings call that Maruti was working on technology with which hybrid models will give more mileage than their existing ones, which are based on Toyota technology. And they will also be available in the smaller, cheaper cars. Last year, according to S&P Mobility, hybrids were 1.75 per cent of all passenger vehicle sales in India, while pureplay battery-operated electric cars were 2 per cent. However, in the first three months of this year, hybrid sales have surpassed electric. \"In India, during the transition period to EVs, hybrids serve as an ideal solution, anticipated to maintain their relevance for almost a decade before electric vehicles begin to dominate. This is partly due to India's inherent advantages for EV adoption,\" says Puneet Gupta, Director, S&P Global. S&P global estimates that pureplay battery electric vehicles in India will increase their penetration to 23 per cent by 2030. By that time, hybrids would go up to 9 per cent -- to 11 per cent if small hybrid cars come in, as Bhargava promises, with a lower price tag. The global market for electric passenger vehicles is concentrated in three areas: China, US, and Europe, which accounted for 95 per cent of global electric sales last year. China alone was 60 per cent. In contrast, India's electric car market share is 2 per cent. Of course, electric is ideal, especially if more and more of the charging is done through renewable energy, but its adoption is stymied. Lack of enough charging stations on roads or in housing complexes across the country, combined with range anxiety, deter consumers. India's new Electronic Mobility Promotion Scheme, which provides subsidies for electric vehicles, does not support electric cars, only electric two- and three-wheelers. Building small, affordable electric cars, which have the potential to sell in large volumes, is still a technological challenge. Taxing matter Electric cars attract a goods and services tax (GST) rate of 5 per cent. Hybrid cars attract 28 per cent GST, but the cess takes the total tax incidence to 43 per cent, unless it is a small car. ICE cars attract the same GST, but the cess takes the total to up to 50 per cent, varying according to the size of the body and engine. This could change. Roads and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari has proposed to the finance ministry that the GST on hybrid cars be reduced to 5 per cent. This, if approved by the GST Council, will push up hybrid penetration manifolds, according to S&P Mobility. Bhargava agrees that this would lead to a big bump-up in hybrid sales. However, the proposal worries global companies that are looking to introduce plug-in hybrids in India. They say light hybrids, which have a smaller lithium battery, are just ICE vehicles providing better mileage, as the bulk of the driving is still on gasoline. Questioning electric There are critics, global and Indian, who doubt whether electric cars would help in reducing carbon emissions significantly in the near term. Maruti Suzuki has said that charging stations in India, powered by energy from coal, not renewable sources, will only generate additional carbon emissions, neutralising the impact of electric cars. So, the focus should be on changing that. A study by Goehring & Rozencwajg, a natural resource investor, says despite the noise on Norway's successful model for electrification of cars, the country forks out $4 billion on electric vehicle subsidies annually, as much as it does for building highways and maintaining public infrastructure, which has a big financial impact. Goehring & Rozencwajg also points out that despite all the action on the electric front in Norway -- 20 per cent of all vehicles on the country's roads and 80 per cent of new vehicles are electric -- gasoline demand has gone down by only 4 per cent. That is because Norwegians are reluctant to give up their ICE cars even after they have bought an electric. Two-thirds of car owners in Norway have at least one ICE vehicle, and they continue to use it. Some political groups say electric cars are elitist and favour high-income families. That may be debatable, but the role of hybrids as a bridge to electric may be less so.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Since 2008, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency is running a star rating programme, under which electric equipment are rated according to their efficiency. This in turn helps the consumers save electricity. Intense heat has pumped up the sale of cooling equipment across the country. There has been a record spike in sales of air conditioners and refrigerators. There are new users coming from smaller towns and rural areas, apart from incremental demand from the existing urban consumers. According to the World Energy Outlook 2023, AC ownership in the country has tripled since 2010 to reach 24 units per 100 households. Along with space cooling, these sectors are now pushing India's electricity demand. Thanks to the increase in residential cooling, new 'high electricity demand' hours have emerged during the evening time, which was earlier only during office hours. With ACs, fridges, and space cooling becoming necessities, there are now concerns about their impact on the environment. Environment experts have repeatedly pointed out that ambient heat increases as more cooling equipment is installed. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are the main chemical gases used in coolants, are proven beyond doubt to be causing ozone layer depletion. India has a star rating programme for efficient electrical equipment and is a signatory to the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol for phase down of HFCs. But the spike in use of cooling equipment will inevitably cause more warming. Growing cooling landscape Space cooling now accounts for nearly 10 per cent of the country's electricity demand, which is now 21 per cent higher than its share in 2019. By 2050, household AC ownership in India is projected to increase nine-fold, leading to a nine-fold increase in energy demand for cooling, said a report by Delhi-based iForest, which has been at the forefront of building an action plan against environmentally harmful cooling chemicals. \"In room air conditioners, India's household penetration is around 8 per cent. Our market size will be around 11 million this year,\" said B Thiagarajan, managing director, Blue Star. \"China's market size is around 90 million. Now, India is the fastest growing market and India will also exceed China by 2045-2050,\" adds Thiagarajan. He pointed at a developing trend in AC purchases. \"The ( AC consumption ) growth in India is driven by an aspirational middle class. Over 90 per cent of ACs sold is to first time buyers. Around 65 per cent are bought by Tier 3-4-5,\" points out Thiagarajan. \"Over 50 per cent are through consumer finance -- this is broadly the profile of the Indian AC buyer. They are not going to afford a five-star air conditioner; they will afford only a three-star air conditioner or a two-star air conditioner,\" explains Thiagarajan. The lower the star rating, the less efficient and more environmentally hazardous the AC. An iForest survey of businesses in 2021 had indicated predominant use of HFC. While businesses showed an intention to move to natural refrigerants, none were using HC or CO2 refrigerants, while some were using NH3 and water as refrigerant. 'Penetration of natural refrigerant-based cooling and not-in-kind technologies in the market remains limited,' said the report. The report also noted that India was in the third stage of refrigerant transition. 'The phase out of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFC ) is complete. The hydrochlorofluorocarbons are expected to be phased out in India by 2030. 'Simultaneously, with a freeze in 2028 under the 'Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol', with no ozone depletion potential but with large global warming potentials, are set for a phase-down in India,' it said in a report titled Promoting Green Cooling in India and the Global South . Stars on your ACs Since 2008, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency is running a star rating programme, under which electric equipment are rated according to their efficiency. This in turn helps the consumers save electricity. The programme advertises how more energy efficient equipment help save power bills. High-rated equipment is also safer for the environment. The star rating metric keeps getting stringent, which the industry feels is a great marker of the Indian cooling market. \"Since 2008 onwards, every two or three years they have been tightening the label. Therefore, what you see today what is a one- or two-star rating was earlier a four- or a five-star,\" says Kamal Nandi, business head and executive vice president, Godrej Appliances. \"This whole collaboration between industry and government to bring out more energy efficient products is a continuous process and this will continue,\" Nandi adds. Godrej, he said, was continuously bringing out more green and energy efficient technologies. \"The effort -- from both industry side and government side -- is to bring greener technologies and to bring in more and more energy efficient products and this will happen.\" For consumers, there are campaigns for higher energy efficient products, both online and at store level. There are also calculators to show the payback when you pay a premium to buy a five-star rated appliance, how that premium is recovered in two years or so. But, Nandi adds, though the industry believes there should also be incentives for the consumers to adopt similar equipment. Higher star-rating equipment is costlier. \"We have been proposing to the government to bring in some sort of incentive for consumers to adopt the highest or the higher energy rated products like a four-star or five-star.\" As a country India was doing well in maintaining the green standards in the cooling industry, Thiagarajan says. \"I am of the view that we will be leading the world in terms of greening. I don't think we should burden the consumer by saying you should buy only five-star because the developed countries use it 24 hours, 365 days,\" he explains. 'Developed countries use air conditioners that are outdated. India that way has been demonstrating its commitment,' he says. Turning the debate over the Kigali agreement, Thiagarajan says Indian industry would be way ahead in its commitments and that would be solely because of market competition. He, however, is of the view that Indian market should get some grace time, compared to the developed world. \"I am of the view that this industry will do it ahead of time, because competition will force you. No one will wait, they will go ahead and launch it. \"I am telling my team that by 2030, we should have it ( targeted reduction on HFCs ),\" Thiagarajan says. While the industry dons more stars, it is time consumers counted them too. Feature Presentation: Ashish Narsale/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'The demand for international fashion labels, particularly from tier-II cities and beyond, has seen a notable uptick.' Walmart-owned online fashion retailer Myntra is expecting 20 million visitors on the platform during its upcoming End of Reason Sale (EORS), Sharon Pais , chief business officer (CBO), told Peerzada Abrar / Business Standard in an email interview. Pais says the demand for international fashion labels, particularly from Tier-II cities and beyond, has seen a notable uptick. What role is the premiumisation of fashion going to play? The rising disposable income in India has added to the growth of the country's middle-class cohorts. The digital boom has also enabled shoppers to be up-to-date with the prominent trends from across the globe. We recognise the transformative surge in the fashion landscape, with non-metros emerging as significant contributors alongside metros. The demand for international fashion labels, particularly from tier-II cities and beyond, has seen a notable uptick. Besides fashion and beauty and personal care, what are the other areas you are witnessing demand? There is a noted trend of fashion percolating into the lifestyle choices of shoppers as trends across categories have become a mainstay with consumers. For instance, shoppers are gravitating towards more trendy colours and designs in the luggage category and the watches and wearables segments. Home is another category. Consumers here are looking for aesthetic choices to best reflect their personalities. Considering the wedding season is around the corner, how are you tapping that opportunity? Festivals and weddings serve as pivotal moments where ethnic attire takes centre stage. People are elevating the celebration of various festivals and occasions by dressing up in Indian wear. Additionally, there's a noticeable trend towards blending Western and Indian styles. This makes ethnic wear a go-to choice. We expect the ethnic wear segment to continue its upward trajectory during the EORS. What are the expectations from this year's EORS? EORS-20 will begin on May 31, with Early Access starting on May 30 for about 8.6 million Myntra Insiders, members of our coveted loyalty program. We also anticipate around 1.35 million new customers this EORS from across the country. About 20 million visitors are expected to throng the platform during the event.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'When you look at reviving private sector capex, I don't think there's a better story than steel.' Tata Steel has a lot on its plate -- restructuring the business in the United Kingdom, expanding capacity back home, and keeping an eye on the balance sheet. \"On a year-on-year basis, we expect Ebitda per tonne in India to be reasonably flat but the volumes higher,\" Tata Steel Managing Director and CEO T V Narendran tells Ishita Ayan Dutt / Business Standard in a video interview. Steel spot spreads have improved and the blast furnace relining in The Netherlands, which was dragging the performance, is complete. Do you expect a better Q1? The blast furnace in The Netherlands went on stream only in the first week of February. So we didn't have the full quarter of supplies. To that extent The Netherlands Q1 will be better than Q4. The UK will not be because it had a one-off benefit of about £50 million, which will not be there. In India, we expect Ebitda ( earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ) per tonne to be a little lower though the spreads have improved a bit because it's a quarter where we have a lot of shutdowns. So the volumes in Q1 will be less and hence the fixed cost gets distributed over a smaller volume. On a year-on-year basis, we expect Ebitda per tonne in India to be reasonably flat but the volumes higher. We will have 1.4 million tonnes net addition. In The Netherlands, Ebitda should be much better. In the UK, it will be negative but less than last year because the second half of the year will be Ebitda neutral or Ebitda positive. So overall, for Tata Steel, it will be better than last year. What is the status of the grant-funding agreement with the UK government? There were many finer points which were being worked out and now it is concluded. It's gone to the government, which will run through the process to approve it. We are in the final stages of it. With the UK headed for general elections, is there any risk to the agreement? We don't see that as a derailing factor. The closure of the heavy end is irrespective of who is in power simply because the assets have become end-of-life. You are investing £750 million in the UK project over and above the restructuring cost. Will that impact expansion plans in India? The money needs to be spent over three-four years. So we don't expect that to derail growth plans in India. We must not forget that a lot of the support has been given to Europe when Tata Steel was much smaller. When we acquired Corus, we were 4 million tonnes ( mt ). Now we are 20 mt and going to 25 mt. So the India business, which generates all the cash, is getting bigger. And the UK, which was in some sense, drawing in the cash was 10 mt and is now 3 mt. So supporting the UK on a lower magnitude is easier than in the past. So where do we see Tata Steel in terms of capacity in the next two to three years? The Kalinganagar unit will have fully expanded and the Ludhiana plant will be ready. Bhushan Steel will go from 5 mt to 7 mt, Kalinganagar from 8 mt to 13 mt, and Neelachal from 1 mt to 5 mt. And if we find the operating model working in Ludhiana, we can quickly set up another two-three electric arc furnaces. So we may not complete all the expansion of 40 mt by 2030, but we will be well on our way at all the sites. Will imports into India weigh on expansion plans? Not yet, but if it sustains for another six months or so, it will hurt the domestic industry. When you look at reviving private sector capex, I don't think there's a better story than steel. Each is spending Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 15,000 crore ( Rs 100 billion to Rs 150 billion ) a year to expand. What is your capex for FY25? About Rs 17,000 crore ( Rs 170 billion ), of which around 75 per cent will be in India. Feature Presentation: Rajesh Alva/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live!

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'The demand for housing is always increasing, and so is housing shortage.' New Delhi-based PNB Housing Finance will restart its corporate business after three years, its managing director and chief executive officer, Girish Kousgi , tells Harsh Kumar / Business Standard in an interview. The company, he says, will grow at a pace faster than the industry average. What is the future of the housing finance market in India? The real estate cycle is about 7-8 years. The demand for housing is always increasing, and so is housing shortage. With the government's focus on housing, the housing finance sector will only grow. Our focus is also going to be on growth and on the profitable segments. What is the plan for PNB Housing Finance's corporate business? We are planning to restart our corporate loan business this year after a gap of three years. There was a lot of stress on the corporate book, so about three years ago, we took a call to stop doing additional business. We have worked on resolving this and have brought down the NPAs (non-performing assets) to as low as about 3 per cent (in financial year 2024) from about 33 per cent as on March 2022. There were sales through ARCs (asset reconstruction companies), certain accounts were written off, and in some accounts, builders came forward for settlement. So, there were multiple strategies. Our focus on the corporate side will be in terms of the overall portfolio mix (retail included). At its peak, corporate will be less than 10 per cent. Currently, our corporate book is a little over Rs 2,000 crore. Our main focus will be on the retail business, and within that, mostly in the affordable and prime segments. What is your growth outlook for the company? We are looking to grow our retail book by 17 per cent, and disbursement will be 24 per cent of our book. Between December and March, we have opened 100 branches; so now we are at 300. This year, we plan to open another 50. If you look at our asset quality, our retail NPA is 1.45 per cent. By the end of the year, we are looking to bring it down to 1.1 per cent. How do you see PNB Housing standing amid rising competition in the housing finance market? See, there is a huge demand in the housing finance business - in all categories: super luxury, luxury, mid-segment, and affordable. We are present in three of the four segments: affordable, prime, and emerging. We are not there in the super-prime segment. We see demand in all the segments. So, we will be able to grow at a much faster pace. The industry will grow at about 13.5 per cent, and we should grow at about 17 per cent. What is your view on the Reserve Bank of India's draft guidelines on infrastructure financing? It is a draft. I don't think it should have any major impact. But in terms of provisioning, it is great. Scheduled commercial banks are expan-ding their reach in the housing finance market. Does that impact you? Yes, to a certain extent. Typically, banks are present in the prime and super-prime segments. We are not there in super-prime. In prime, there will be some overlap. Otherwise, on the affordable side, not too many banks are that aggressive. Last year, we grew more than 11 times in the affordable segment.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'This is a good time to restructure your portfolio because the sectors and stocks that performed in the last bull market may not perform as much now.' On January 24, after four days of sharp selloff from 18,350 on January 18 to 17,150 on January 24, independent market expert Ambareesh Baliga had told Rediff.com that he was expecting Nifty to reach 16,000 levels if tensions between Ukraine and Russia continued to escalate. Exactly a month later on February 24, Nifty is looking down at the 16,000 mark as it closed the day at 16,250, a huge 4.78 per cent cut in the benchmark index, as markets the world over tanked weighed down by Russia's military invasion of Ukraine. As crude oil hovered around 98 dollars per barrel level in international markets and the US dollar rose 1.2 per cent against the Indian rupee, the markets also worried about India's balance of payments account, the fiscal deficit target set by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for fiscal 2022-2023, inflation and the rise in interest rates. As the Nifty and Sensex crashed almost 4.8 per cent on February 24, Prasanna D Zore/ Rediff.com spoke with Ambareesh Baliga and Deven Choksey of K R Choksey to take stock of how India is poised to weather this storm. Here's what they said. Deven Choksey: 'If the markets don't hold this level ( 16,350 ), then we can easily see another 400-500 point fall' Do you look at Thursday's selloff as panic selling or there is more to come in the days ahead as world figures out how the Russia-Ukraine conflict plays out? We have seen a global fall and it is bound to happen that markets react to a variety of factors with different intensity. Markets react to crude prices, war, uncertainty, differently. So, markets reaction is very relative in nature. Definitely, investors, big or small, would play it safe in such an environment, so this kind of fall is naturally expected. One will have to wait and watch how the situation pans out in Eastern Europe. Do you see this panic abating in the days ahead or will it escalate further? My point is that if this war/invasion with/of Ukraine doesn't translate into a global war situation even after ( US and Western ) sanctions ( on Russia ), then I think this panic will settle down. Importantly, if war doesn't escalate then sanctions in themselves don't mean anything. So, markets will settle down. God forbid, if this war happens, then too India is in a position to attract significant amount of money from global investors because they will then find huge value in Indian markets at a cheaper price. Whichever situation you look at it, according to me, there is no need to panic; let the situation settle down. What impact could this conflict have on India's macro economy and hence on Indian equity markets? Whatever negative impact our economy faces will be transitory in nature. Higher inflation, higher cost of production, higher possibility of interest rate hikes, everything will be transitional. Where will the markets settle down in this situation? I can't say exactly how long the markets will take to settle down ,but this won't last permanently. Currently, the surge ( in panic ) has happened, but it will have to settle down. Any key levels to watch out for in the days ahead? 16,350 was an important level, which broke today ( Thursday, February 24 ) as the markets closed around 16,250. If the markets don't hold this level ( of 16,350 ), then we can easily see another 400-500 point fall. I think this is a possibility. If markets settle down around after another 400-500 point fall, where should investors look at for value buying? In every correction that we have seen this year, investors are seeing value because fundamentals of businesses haven't changed. Will this conflict cast any shadow on the LIC IPO? Too early to say anything ( about the LIC IPO ). Let us allow things to settle. Ambareesh Baliga: 'If you are looking to buy Rs 100 worth of stocks you should buy stocks worth Rs 20 NOW' When we spoke on January 24, you had said we could reach 16,000 levels on Nifty if tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue. We are almost close to that level. What next? It is likely to break 16,000 now and move towards 15,000. Now, looking at the situation and the way things are it is unlikely to get resolved in the next two-three days. It will take a while longer, which means that tomorrow if we open lower, and most probably we will open lower, then I think we could see panic selling. One can say today ( Thursday, February 24 ) was a day of bloodbath, but we did not see the panic which we normally see in situations like these. Based on the developments we could see panic selling either tomorrow or on Monday. What factors could help this panic to abate? Difficult to say, but as of now if the tensions in Eastern Europe were to settle down in the next seven to 10 days one could see some semblance of calm ( in the markets ) then. If tensions escalate, then no one knows where we could be headed to. We can see even lower ( than 15,000 ) levels. As of now, one hopes that the situation will return to normal sooner and tensions will de-escalate. What impact could this conflict have on India's macro-economic indicators? We are going to see its impact on the Indian currency, interest rates, inflation and that's the reason the markets reacted ( today ). If oil goes towards 110 ( US dollars per barrel ) and possibly 120 ( US dollars per barrel ) if tension escalates further, then that will have an impact on our balance of payments because we import 85 per cent of our crude requirements. At the same time, exports too will suffer because of geo-political tensions. Of course, our forex reserves are much better than what we had during the Gulf crisis ( US invasion of Iraq in January 1991 ) and even a decade ago. That will in fact lead to rise in inflation and interest rates, and we are already in that sort of a situation; even though the RBI has postponed the rate hikes ( during its monetary policy meeting on February 10 ), they would still look at it in their next meeting. We also don't know, looking at the situation, what will happen to the LIC IPO. If tensions escalate, it could get a bit difficult for the LIC IPO. If government postpones it, then you miss FY22 target ( of garnering divestment revenues and fiscal deficit ) because we are still short of Rs 64,000 crore, which was expected to come from LIC. If panic sets in and we head for another bout of selling which sectors and stocks could provide bunker-like protection to investors? Sectors like pharma, autos to a decent extent because that is domestic market business, infrastructure plays and to a certain extent FMCG sector because I don't really see domestic consumption or manufacturing getting affected so much. What's your advice for retail investors now? If investors have cash in hand, they should utilise the next fortnight or three weeks to buy because this is an opportunity to buy and expect things to settle down. Our experience of past several decades tell us that whenever tensions like these happen, markets settle down in some time. End of the day, across the globe, nobody really wants situation to deteriorate further. Don't wait for the bottom. If you are looking to buy Rs 100 worth of stocks you should buy stocks worth Rs 20 NOW. In case you don't have cash to deploy, then this is still a good time to restructure your portfolio to ride the next move because the sectors and stocks that performed in the last bull market may not perform as much now. If tensions further escalate, would we be heading towards March 2020 COVID-19 lows? No. I think we have moved quite ahead of that already. To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live!

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Having exposure to international funds and gold is a must for those who have foreign currency-denominated goals, suggests Sanjay Kumar Singh. If your child is headed to a university in the United States soon and you have to pay her fees in the coming days, then the recent depreciation of the rupee from the 72-plus level in March to 75-plus in April to Rs 77.69 in the opening trade on Tuesday, May 17, 2022, would have left you worried. The bigger cause for worry, however, is the tendency of the rupee to depreciate against the US dollar over the long term. Over the past 10 financial years, on average, the rupee has depreciated at a compounded annual rate of 4.7 per cent against the dollar (between 2011-2011 and 2020-2021). Today people have multiple goals that will require them to spend in foreign currencies --children's higher education, foreign travel, purchase of house abroad, and so on. Clearly, they need to build a portfolio that can safeguard them against the trend of currency depreciation. High inflation differential Why does the rupee keep depreciating against the dollar over the long term? Says Abheek Barua, chief economist, HDFC Bank: \"India keeps losing trade competitiveness due to the higher inflation rate in our economy vis-a-vis that of our trading partners.\" While the US usually runs a low inflation rate (two per cent or less), in India it is much higher. The Consumer Price Index (Industrial Workers)-based inflation has averaged 6.7 per cent over the past 10 financial years. The rupee depreciates due to this erosion in competitiveness. Barua explains that the depreciation would have been higher, but for the fact that the Indian markets receive robust capital inflows. Invest in international funds The best way to deal with this issue is to have a geographically diversified portfolio, that is, hold dollar assets. \"Build a simple portfolio comprised 50:50 of a Nifty index fund and an S&P 500 index fund,\" says Avinash Luthria, a Sebi-registered investment advisor and founder, Fiduciaries. Not only will investing abroad give you the benefit of geographical diversification, holding dollar-based assets will also make your portfolio less susceptible to currency risk. The US market has been in a continuous bull run since 2009, making many investors wonder if it is prudent to invest in it anymore. \"Stagger your entry into a US fund by taking the systematic investment plan ( SIP ) route. Also, do not go just for the big-tech stocks, which have appreciated the most but take more diversified exposure,\" says Vishal Dhawan, chief financial planner, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors. Investing in a broad, globally diversified equity fund is another option. \"It is difficult for investors in India to know which country or theme will do well in the future. With a global fund, they can entrust this task to expert fund managers,\" says Ajit Menon, chief executive officer, PGIM India Mutual Fund, which runs the PGIM India Global Equity Opportunity Fund. Menon informs that their fund tries to capture new themes that are catching on across the globe -- on-demand economy (video streaming, education on-demand, etc), cloud-based technology, data security, e-commerce, digital payment services, robotics and automation, and health tech. For international funds to have an impact, they must make up at least 15-20 per cent of an investor's equity portfolio. LRS route for evolved investors Investors may also take the liberalised remittance scheme (LRS) route, which allows them to invest up to $250,000 abroad annually per person. They would have to open an account with one of the brokerage platforms that enable Indian investors to invest directly in markets like the US. The key attractiveness of this route is that the investor gets more options in terms of the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and stocks he can choose from. \"However, the tax-related compliances become more complicated,\" says Luthria. Only bigger, more sophisticated investors should opt for this route. Take exposure to gold Having an exposure to gold can also help investors counter the rupee's depreciation. The international price of gold is determined in dollars. The Indian price of gold is derived from the international dollar price. Suppose that you have one dollar worth of gold. And one dollar equals, say, Rs 75. Even if the rupee depreciates from 75 to 80, with the gold that you hold you can still buy one dollar. However, like all commodities, gold too witnesses prolonged up cycles and down cycles. So, invest in the yellow metal for the long term and limit exposure to 10-15 per cent of portfolio. Direct investors: Understand the nuances Generally, a depreciating rupee benefits exporters while affecting importers adversely. Those who run direct stock portfolios need to dig deeper to understand the impact of currency depreciation on their holdings. \"Some companies import certain raw materials and export a part of their finished goods, so the net impact on them is not high. Many hedge their net foreign exchange exposure, protecting them from wild movements in the short term. Some companies have pricing power, given the nature of their product and favourable industry structure, and are able to revise pricing to adjust for adverse currency movements,\" says Jatin Khemani, founder and chief executive officer, Stalwart Investment Advisors, a Sebi-registered independent equity research firm. He adds that instead of generalising the impact, investors need to understand each company's business model. \"Look at how the financials moved in the past when the currency behaved wildly. That will help you understand how resilient the business model is,\" adds Khemani. Ankur Kapur, managing partner, Plutus Capital, a Sebi-registered investment advisory firm, adds: \"The IT sector is likely to be a net gainer. In the case of pharma, chemicals, and paints, all of which import inputs, the impact will depend on how much they export or can raise prices. Build a portfolio diversified across sectors so that the currency impact is mitigated.\" To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

Cheque bounce or 'dishonour of cheque' occurs when a drawee is unable to withdraw money using a cheque due to certain limitations. It is covered by the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act), 1881, which aims to deter the issuance of cheques without sufficient funds in the bank account, and provides legal remedy to the aggrieved party. Insufficient funds Section 138 of the NI Act mentions two reasons for cheque bounce. Tushar Agarwal, advocate, Supreme Court of India, says, \"First, there is insufficient money in the account. Second, the cheque amount exceeds the arrangement the account holder has with the bank.\" The second reason refers to the cheque amount being higher than the account's withdrawal limit. Over time various other reasons have emerged. Signature or number mismatch : A cheque can be dishonoured if there is a discrepancy between the drawer's signature on the cheque and the specimen signature available with the bank. Pratyush Miglani, managing partner, MVAC Advocates & Consultants, says, \"This is done to avert fraudulent activities like forgery.\" A number mismatch may arise if the cheque number entered in the MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) code line doesn't correspond with the pre-printed cheque number. Expired or damaged cheque : A cheque is usually valid for three months from the date of issuance. If presented after this period, it is not honoured. The bank may also declare a damaged or mutilated cheque as invalid. Miglani says, \"Essential elements like the date, payee's name, amount, and signature must be legible and undamaged for successful processing.\" Stop payment instruction: The issuer may have instructed the bank to stop the payment due to reasons like a dispute, suspicion of fraud, loss of the cheque, or change in circumstances. Legal consequences Cheque bounce is a criminal offence under Section 138 of the NI Act Suhael Buttan, counsel, SKV Law Offices, says, \"The sentence can be for up to two years; a fine, which can be extended to twice the amount covered by the dishonoured cheque; or both.\" Anushkaa Arora, principal & founder, ABA Law Office, adds, \"Bail can be secured when the matter is pending in lower court. Post-conviction the chances of bail become bleak.\" Regarding legal notice, Abhinay Sharma, managing partner, ASL Partners, points out, \"The receiver of the bounced cheque can send a legal notice to the issuer within 30 days of receiving the bounce memo from the bank.\" Sections 143A and 148 have been inserted through recent amendments. Buttan says, \"These sections give the trial or the appellate court the right to direct payment of interim compensation during the trial and deposit of a certain minimum sum in an appeal by the drawer of cheque against conviction.\" The Sikkim high court recently ruled that offences under Section 138 of the NI Act can be compounded at any stage. This means the parties can enter into a compromise and settle the matter out of court. Proceed with caution Keep sufficient funds in your bank account until the cheque is cleared. Fill all details correctly. If there is any doubt, verify with the bank that your signature hasn't changed. Also avoid overwriting. If availability of funds is an issue, communicate with the payee and resolve the matter instead of issuing the cheque. Use the Sikkim high court's recent ruling to compromise and settle out of court. M Barve, founder, MB Wealth Financial Solutions suggests making online payments. Landlords can use cheque bounce laws to their advantage. \"Take one or a few signed cheques in advance. The stringent consequences of bounced cheques will ensure you get the rent on time and there is no default.\" Check bounce: Fallout can be expensive The bank may charge the issuer a penalty, which can range from Rs 50 to Rs 750 If the cheque amount is not paid within the stipulated time, the receiver may be entitled to claim interest on the cheque amount The issuer's credit score could take a beating This can make it difficult to obtain credit in the future Feature Presentation: Ashish Narsale/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live!

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Passenger vehicle wholesales in India witnessed a marginal growth in May on account of high base effect and muted demand due to general elections. The overall passenger vehicle dispatches from companies to dealers stood at 350,257 lakh units last month as compared to 335,436 in the same month a year ago, registering a growth of 4 per cent. Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) said its total domestic passenger vehicle sales rose marginally to 144,002 units last month from 143,708 units in the year-ago period. The company saw year-on-year dip in sales of entry level and compact cars last month as against May 2023. Utility vehicle sales, including that of Brezza, Grand Vitara, Ertiga, S-Cross and XL6, however, rose to 54,204 units last month as against 46,243 units a year earlier. \"It has been discussed that growth this year will not be very high. It will be in single digit because of the high base effect. \"Secondly, there were elections and the scorching temperatures also had an impact on the overall sales in May,\" MSI senior executive officer (marketing & sales) Partho Banerjee told reporters. He further said: \"We are very hopeful that we will start seeing the green shoots coming with the election results coming in. \"I think things will turn around.\" Banerjee noted that the company is going to introduce a limited edition trims of its entry level cars -- Alto K10, S-Presso and Celerio -- in order to rejuvenate the small car segment. The Dream Series edition trims of the three models will be launched at a price point of Rs 4.99 lakh (ex-showroom), he said. \"Based on the feedback of our target customers we have come up with an edition in which we are mostly focusing on the utilities and convenience features,\" Banerjee said. Sales of Maruti Suzuki's mini segment cars, comprising Alto and S-Presso, declined to 9,902 units last month from 12,236 units in May 2023. Rival Hyundai Motor India reported a 1 per cent year-on-year increase in domestic dispatch of vehicles to dealers last month. The company's wholesales rose to 49,151 units in May as compared to 48,601 units in May 2023. Hyundai Motor India COO Tarun Garg said that the sales growth this financial year is anticipated to remain in low single digit range. \"In April also the industry grew by around 1.5 per cent ...so April plus May the industry growth should be around 2-2.5 per cent over same period last year,\" he noted. Tata Motors said its passenger vehicle sales, including electric vehicles, in the domestic market, were up 2 per cent at 47,075 units as compared to 45,984 units in the year-ago month. Mahindra & Mahindra on the other hand reported a robust 31 per cent year-on- year increase in passenger vehicle dispatches last month at 43,218 units. It had sold 32,886 units in May 2023. Toyota Kirloskar Motor reported a 24 per cent year-on-year increase in total wholesales in May at 25,273 units as compared to that of same month last year. Kia India said its total wholesales increased 4 per cent year-on-year to 19,500 units in May. The automaker had dispatched 18,766 units to dealers in May 2023. \"So far in this year, we have been aggressive in introducing new competitive variants of our models, which has contributed significantly to our sales,\" Kia India senior VP and head sales & marketing Hardeep Singh Brar said. With a robust network expansion strategy in place, the company shall continue to grow in the rest of the year and cross 1 million domestic sales milestone soon, he added. MG Motor India reported a 5 per cent dip in wholesales at 4,769 units in May compared to the same month last year. The company had dispatched 5,006 units to dealers in May 2023.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Automakers dispatched over 3.47 lakh passenger vehicles to dealers in domestic market in May, recording an year-on-year growth of 4 per cent over same month last year, industry body SIAM said on Tuesday. The overall passenger vehicle (PV) dispatches from companies to dealers stood at 3,47,492 units last month, as compared to 3,34,537 units in May 2023. The dispatches were the highest ever for the month of May so far, driven by robust offtake of utility vehicles. Maruti Suzuki sold 1,44,002 units last month, as against 1,43,708 units in May 2023. Hyundai Motor India dispatched 49,151 units in May, as compared to 48,601 units in May 2023. Mahindra & Mahindra sold 43,218 units last month, as against 32,886 units in the year-ago period. All the segments -- passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, two-wheelers and three-wheelers have posted growth in May, as compared to the same month last year, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) President Vinod Aggarwal said in a statement. \"Passenger vehicles have only witnessed a moderate growth, primarily owing to a high base effect of the previous year,\" he noted. Two-wheeler sales rose 10 per cent to 16,20,084 units last month, as compared to 14,71,550 units in the year-ago period. Three-wheeler dispatches rose 15 per cent to 55,763 units in May, as against 48,610 units in May 2023. \"With expectations of above normal monsoon and continued emphasis on economic development by the new government, as it pursues its goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047, the auto industry is optimistic of steady growth in 2024-25 as well,\" Aggarwal stated. Elaborating further, SIAM director general Rajesh Menon said PV dispatches last month were the highest ever in May so far. Two-wheelers saw a growth of 10 per cent last month but still remains lower than 2017-18 levels of May, he said. \"Domestic sales of three-wheelers in May 2024 grew by 14.7 per cent compared to May 2023, posting the highest-ever sales in May,\" Menon said.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'The scheme excludes tractors, light commercial vehicles, and medium and heavy commercial vehicles.' Chennai-based Murugappa Group-promoted Tube Investments of India (TII) is expanding its presence in the electric vehicle (EV) market by entering the small commercial vehicle (SCV) and tractor segments. About six months after launching its three-wheeler, it has already captured a 35 per cent market share in South India, says Arun Murugappan , executive chairman of TII. In an exclusive interview with Shine Jacob / Business Standard , Murugappan discusses the EV road map, semiconductor plans, and the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India III (FAME III) wish list. You are the makers of iconic cycles like BSA and Hercules. What led to your foray into EVs? TII was originally 90 per cent dependent on the automotive industry. We decided to diversify into other businesses and chose four areas: medical, EVs, contract development and manufacturing organisation, and electronics. In EVs, we decided to move forward with four platforms and formed a subsidiary called TI Clean Mobility. Under this, we have already launched three-wheelers and 55-tonne trucks. The two additional segments we plan to launch are SCV and tractor. SCV will be launched by the end of the second quarter, around August or September. The tractor launch will take a bit longer. I am happy with the performance of our three-wheelers. It has been five to six months since we started selling these three-wheelers, predominantly in South India, and we already have a market share of close to 35 per cent in the region. Why are you betting big on SCVs? There is a strong push for electrification in last-mile delivery. SCVs are easily manoeuvrable in the city and can cover 150-200 kilometres on a single charge. We believe that 25-30 per cent of these SCVs will be electrified by 2030. To achieve this target, annual penetration needs to be between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. In the SCV segment, Tivolt Electric Vehicles, a venture of Murugappa Group and a subsidiary of TI Clean Mobility, is preparing to introduce its electric SCV under the brand Montra Electric. We plan to offer a full range of vehicles below 3.5 tonnes. Over the next 13 to 18 months, the entire range will be available in the market. We have a production capacity of about 50,000 units per year. From the policy side, what support do you require as the majority of these segments are excluded from the FAME subsidy? The FAME scheme excludes tractors, light commercial vehicles, and medium and heavy commercial vehicles. These vehicles are top polluters, and 50 per cent of commercial vehicles fall into these categories. We have approached the Government of India through the National Highways Authority of India to include these segments in the FAME category. The government aims for 70 per cent of all electric three-wheelers to be electrified. The main challenge is the charging infrastructure, which requires both government and private participation. We need a common charging standard and a proper scrappage policy. Also, incentives should be provided for SCVs to reduce the price gap with internal combustion engine vehicles. Murugappa Group was one of the first groups in the country to foray into EV two-wheelers way back in 2008, but then you exited the business. How different is the EV segment and your preparations this time? In 2008, we were ahead of our time. I wasn't involved in that project. This time, our products have undergone extensive testing, and we are confident they will be successful. We have made focused efforts, formed a separate company, and hired the best people in the field. This is the first time we have become an original equipment manufacturer through our three-wheeler launch. We are investing Rs 3,000 crore in the EV business. We aim to produce best-in-class products in all four categories. Currently, we have no plans for two- and four-wheelers. What are your plans for battery and semiconductor supply? For batteries, we have partnered several companies and will set up a battery packing plant in Coimbatore by the end of this year. For semiconductors, CG Power and Industrial Solutions has obtained a licence in Sanand. We will leverage CG Power's expertise. The unit will be operational in 2025-26, with investments of around Rs 7,600 crore. We have a technical partner in Renesas Electronics Corporation. What is your strategy for trucks, and what response are you getting for them? Tractors will take some time because the battery needs to last for several hours. We are working on extending battery life and hope to launch tractors by the beginning of next year. Currently, we are using trucks in the cement and steel industries to transport materials from mines to factories. The main issue with trucks is the high capital expenditure. We are working on reducing the cost of trucks. Feature Presentation: Aslam Hunani/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'We are expected to grow at above 28 per cent this year, higher than the industry.' Shriram Life Insurance Company, a joint venture between Shriram Group and South Africa-based Sanlam Ltd, is betting big on the rural market, from where it gets about 45 per cent of its business. Casparus J H Kromhout , managing director and chief executive officer, talks to Shine Jacob / Business Standard about its growth road map, rural market penetration, and expansion plans in the lower-income population at the company's office in Chennai. Overall life insurance penetration in India is hardly 3-4 per cent now. How do you look at this? There is a lot of focus on it now, with the regulator in the past few years putting emphasis on it. We are seeing some movement, but penetration is still quite low, and the opportunity is big. India is a country of countries in many ways, and each of the states is extremely large. Even though it has grown, there is still a lot that can be done because India is below the world average. In South Africa, from where I come, life insurance penetration is closer to 12 per cent. The focus in India is still on people in the higher-income segment. There is a bit more awareness now, but life insurance is still seen mostly as a tax-saving alternative. If you look at penetration in the lower-income segment, it is significantly less. As an industry, we have a big job to reach out to more families and get them covered. Whether it is finance or insurance, Shriram focuses on communities that typically do not get covered by the mainstream. According to reports, Private life-insurance firms are expected to grow 9-12 per cent in FY24. How do you see your growth? Profits are very good, and we are investing very significantly in capacity for business development. Life insurance is a face-to-face activity, and the tough job for anybody is to sell it to people. We are expected to grow at above 28 per cent this year, higher than the industry. Around 45 per cent of our business comes from rural India. The focus for us is retail business, and that's where we are seeing growth. Last year, we had 24 per cent growth. What is the impact of the new norms on taxing the total returns on high-value life insurance policies on your company? We are in a segment where we cover more families with lower premiums. We are in a segment where only a few customers are able to spend more than Rs 5 lakh on insurance premiums. We are trying to cover the aam aadmi , and the large segments of society. Percentage-wise, such high-end customers will be insignificant for us and will be in decimals, if at all. The average annual premium for the industry is Rs 60,000-70,000, whereas for us it is around Rs 20,000. Now, we are number seven in terms of the number of policies that we serve, but the premium size is much lower. So, for us, there is no impact of the base effect following the change in norms. We are protected as a company. You have a 45 per cent share in the rural market, one of the highest in the industry. What will be your strategy? The rural population in India is 65-70 per cent of the total. It is much more difficult to reach rural customers. We are committed to this market. With Shriram Group, we have a large customer base in the rural market, where cross-selling of the life insurance business can happen. Their life is not protected for additional money for the families, if something happens. We have reached out to them. Our strategy will be to continuously increase the access that we have through Shriram Group. We create business models that are unique and technology-driven in rural areas -- feet-on-street models. Where do you like to see the rural market after three years? I want the share of the rural market to cross 50 per cent. We will be growing quite fast. We are seeing over 20 per cent growth year-on-year as a plan towards 2030. At present, closer to 50 per cent claims are coming from the rural market. Our claim settlement ratio was around 97.4 per cent in FY23, up from 95 per cent in FY21. This financial year we are targeting around 98 per cent. We are on a par with the top players and are focusing on a sector in which risk and mortality are higher.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The governor made it clear that the RBI is aware of what's happening and acts accordingly, but doesn't make a noise about that, points out Tamal Bandyopadhyay. Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das, a cricket aficionado, wants all who bat on the banking and non-banking finance turf, and the stakeholders, to play long term -- like Rahul Dravid. That's his message to the entire financial sector, delivered at Business Standard 's BFSI Summit in Mumbai last fortnight Dravid, often called 'Mr Dependable' and 'The Wall', signifies the three Cs that are essential ingredients for success -- commitment, consistency and class. He stood out for his hard work, never-say-die spirit, and a super-cool temperament against all odds. Governor Das expects these qualities from the players in the financial sector. The 70-minute fireside chat with him that ended the two-day mega show touched upon quite a few sensitive issues, and the governor did not shy away from explaining how the banking regulator looks at them. For instance, the RBI has been closely watching the business model of banks. A few bankers and sector analysts often wonder whether that's a regulator's job. Shouldn't that be left to the bankers themselves? The governor's answer is clear: The RBI doesn't get down to the nitty-gritty of the business models, but it continuously evaluates whether the model is sustainable. For instance, if a bank depends on a mix of just corporate loans and unsecured loans, it could invite trouble for itself. It must have a bouquet of loan products (including home loans, auto loans et al ) to avoid concentration risks. Similarly, if a bank is into retail loans in a big way and supports that with money sourced from wholesale deposits, it may face problems (interpretation is mine). India's banking sector, particularly private banks, has been finding it extremely difficult to attract and retain talent. In private, a few say the RBI could be more liberal in clearing the salary and perks of bankers. \"Even if we want to pay a handsome bonus to our employees, there are many restrictions,\" they say. The governor is aware of the problem of attrition; he has pointed this out to the banks and left it to them to tackle the HR issue. But he doesn't agree with the perception of the RBI being unfair in approving bankers' salary and perks. The salary of a public sector bank employee is typically determined by an industry-wide wage settlement, brokered by the Indian Banks' Association, while the government norm determines the managing directors' and executive directors' pay packages. The RBI comes into the picture only for the packages of the whole-time directors of private banks. It objects to the proposed package only when it finds it too high for a bank that is too small and/or not doing well. In other words, the perks and salary of top bankers should be in sync with the performance and size of the banks they head. The governor has made it clear that the regulator is alert and aware of what's happening in the sector and acts accordingly, but doesn't make a noise about that. Why? The explanation is somewhat similar to what Ananth Narayan, whole-time member of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, discussed in his speech on the first day of the summit. He spoke about 'Type-1' and 'Type-2' errors of a regulator. In this context, 'Type-1' errors could be the regulator missing certain misconducts of banks that are detrimental to their health. If the regulator goes to town with this, it runs the risk of misinterpretation of its action, which could play havoc with the system. After all, banks deal with public money. That's a 'Type-2' error. Das implicitly said the RBI knows what's happening in the banking system and takes actions accordingly -- but this is done quietly, below the radar. To rectify certain mistakes, it doesn't want to take steps that can be more disruptive and cause systemic problems. The governor also emphasised the importance of governance for a sustainable growth. A bank cannot grow with weak governance, for long. Kicking off the summit, veteran banker and the uncrowned king of retail banking in India, K V Kamath, highlighted the health and resilience of the banking sector -- the best in the past five decades. They are well capitalised and the level of bad loans of the industry is very low. They are also earning good interest income as credit offtake continues to be high. He pointed out that a committee (headed by him) had recommended the restructuring of loans worth Rs 9 trillion of 26 sectors post-Covid, but the banking system restructured only Rs 45,000 crore worth of loans since the Indian economy has been on a firm growth path. Bosses of private banks discussed a subject that has been the talk of the town -- should banks become technology companies? Should the techies run them? The consensus is: No. Banks must remain banks as the business is subject to strict regulations. Beyond technology, which the banks are riding on, banking is all about compliance, underwriting and risk management, and trust is key to the business. Yes, they need to understand technology and use it to move ahead, and that can be done by forging partnerships with fintechs, forming tech subsidiaries or having techies on the payroll, but a banker must be in the driver's seat. They also say there is a digital bank within every bank. Both private and public sector banks feel the good time is here to stay. They don't agree that there are cracks in retail and unsecured loan segments. Even if there are minor issues, the banks are well equipped to tackle them. State Bank of India Chairman Dinesh Khara, too, belongs to this camp. Exuding confidence, he said the country's largest lender (it has a little over 20 per cent share of the banking industry) does not have any concern over the quality of assets and is well equipped to face any challenges. Incidentally, SBI, one of the top 50 banks globally by assets, is readying to roll out version 2.0 of YONO ('You only need one'), its integrated digital banking platform, in nine months. Of its 480 million customers, 70 million are on the YONO platform and 97 per cent of SBI's transactions don't happen in its branches. YONO intends to become a 'primary digital bank of choice' in the coming years. Finally, all banks are aware of the war for deposits that has been on for quite some time now. The assets under management of the mutual fund industry in September rose to nearly Rs 48 trillion, one-fourth of the banking industry's deposit base. The savings community has started exploring different assets to park their surplus money. But the bankers don't think offering higher interest rates is the only way to attract money. Bundling products, making the bank a one-stop shop for all financial needs, and caring for customers are the key to deposit mobilisation. Yes, they are talking about customer engagement and not business targets. Neglected for long, customers finally seem to be ready to take centre stage in Indian banking.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'SUV is a very intensely fought category, unlike hatchbacks and cars.' In line with the industry trend, Tata Motors unveiled the updated versions of its popular sports utility vehicles -- the Safari and the Harrier. Speaking on the sidelines of the launch in Chennai, Shailesh Chandra , managing director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, spoke to Shine Jacob / Business Standard about the future of SUVs, the electric vehicle industry, and other issues. You have come up with new versions of the Safari and the Harrier. What was the thought behind launching their diesel models only? This segment is about 16,000 units a month. Diesel vehicles account for nearly 80 per cent of the sales. There is a high preference for diesel, at least in the high-end SUV segment. So, we focused on diesel ( SUVs ) because people love them due to a very good torque performance and high fuel efficiency. We realise that petrol will also grow and it gives you a more affordable price point. Therefore, we have started the development of a 1.5 litre GDi engine. It will not be coming in the near future and may take beyond one year. About 52 per cent of the passenger vehicles sold in September were SUVs. Do you think the trend will continue? We have been hovering around 18 to 23 per cent share. This ( SUV ) is a very intensely fought category, unlike hatchbacks and cars. It also depends on the number of launches by players. For six-seven quarters, we were number one in this category. Our focus has been that each of our SUVs is on the top in its respective category. The Punch is number one in its category; the Nexon is number one in its category and among all SUVs; and then you have the Harrier-Safari combo, which is number two. All are doing well. We will come up with the Curvv and the Sierra in both EV and ICE ( internal combustion engine ) categories in 2024 and 2025, respectively. You are focusing a lot on EVs, but facing competition too. How are you seeing the market growth? We have strong potential. With competition, our market is also growing. We would always be at a growth rate of above 50 per cent. Last year, on average, we sold 11,000-12,000 EVs a quarter. In the last two quarters of this year, we saw sales of 19,000-20,000 units each. Sales have grown despite rising competition. The focus on charging infrastructure will be crucial. The government should also make a push. What steps are being taken to tide over EV infrastructure bottlenecks? We are in discussions with the government, so that OMCs ( oil-marketing companies ) and other players are pushed to install about 22,000 chargers they were planning to come up with. Going forward, we will see a lot of very long-range vehicles. If you are able to unleash common chargers for different residential complexes, that should also give a lot of comfort. What is your strategy for localisation of EVs? Tiago localisation was at 60 per cent and we got a PLI ( production-linked incentive ) certificate for that. Our aim is that we should not stick to what is the requirement of PLI, but keep enough headroom. We are also aware that the group is also investing into cell manufacturing through Agratas Energy Storage Solution. That will be a big thing, so deeper localisation is the way forward for us. In the first quarter of the calendar year, Tata Motors' sales numbers were high. However, they seem to be coming down. What are the reasons for this? In the first quarter, our market share was around 14 per cent. We had been selling around 140,000 cars a quarter, which we did in Q2 as well. We were impacted during the quarter as we brought down the production of the Nexon, Harrier and Safari deliberately because we were transitioning to new models. The Nexon, which had been selling 16,000 units, was brought down to 8,000. The Harrier-Safari combine also sold around 4,500 units, which was brought down to around 2,200 units. However, other cars compensated for this. Punch sales went up from 10,000 to 14,000 during the quarter, and the Altroz went up from 6,000 to 8,000. On the other hand, the Tiago and the Tigor sustained their numbers. There is no fall in volume, but there is a fall in market share because of the loss of outgoing models, which I think should come back.= What do you think the updated versions of the Harrier and the Safari mean for Tata Motors as a company? The Safari is an iconic brand. In 2021, we thought we should reimagine this brand so that it continued as a modern SUV. On the other hand, the Harrier is based on the D8 platform from Land Rover and started a new trend in the SUV segment in 2019, where it brought the aesthetics, stance and in-cabin experience closer to what you get in high-price SUV or a premium SUV, appealing to the young achievers. Since then, both these products have been doing very well and we have sold around 165,000 units. They have become better in every aspect -- technology, comfort, and safety. A lot of comfort features are there, but what has gone to the next level is safety. Feature Presentation: Rajesh Alva/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, scheduled to meet on June 22, could take a call on ending uncertainty on taxing foreign airlines and shippers as regards certain services, a senior official in the know told Business Standard . He said the Council was expected to decide on exempting the services in question from GST — aircraft lease rentals, maintenance, crew salaries, etc. These services are provided by foreign airlines to their Indian operations. Multiple foreign airlines and shippers have received notices for not paying GST on services rendered by their headquarters to the Indian arms. Following this, foreign entities have approached the finance ministry and their respective embassies, seeking a resolution to the issue. The head of the International Air Transport Association warned early this month airlines could withdraw from the Indian market if this issue was not resolved. The fitment committee, comprising revenue officials of the central government and states, is learnt to have reviewed the matter and made recommendations, which will be presented to the Council when it meets. The panel examined whether it was considered “reimbursement of expenses” to the India offices of overseas entities, and could be exempted, another official said. A clarification will be issued once approved by the GST Council, the official cited above said. Tax authorities say since the Indian arms are separate legal entities, these services provided by the headquarters are subject to tax in India. The Directorate General of GST Intelligence, the GST investigation arm, issued the notices and alleged services provided to head offices abroad by the Indian entity were liable to pay GST on a “reverse charge basis”. In a reverse charge the recipient of goods or services and not the supplier pays GST. “Taxability and valuation of intra entity cross charges have been a vexed issue under GST with ambiguity continuing on whether there is an actual provision of service /supply from foreign head office to Indian branch to trigger GST, potential arguments on NIL valuation, etc,” said Abhishek Jain, indirect tax head and partner, KPMG. Clarification on transactions between foreign head offices and Indian branches will help contain litigation, Jain said. The GST Council meeting comes after eight months and needs to take up rate rationalisation, another expert said. “A preliminary effort to include low-impact petroleum products such as natural gas within the GST ambit would be beneficial to business. \"The stability established in GST collection, together with the fact that GST changes are outside the Union Budget proposals, should provide an impetus to the GST Council in addressing various issues,” said M.S Mani, partner, Deloitte. The fitment panel, which is meeting before the Council meeting, is expected to review the proposal of bringing natural gas within the GST ambit. To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live!

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The commerce department has reaffirmed its plans to launch the ‘Trade Connect’ e-platform to help exporters connect with stakeholders of international trade, as a part of the new government’s 100-day action plan, a senior government official said. The online platform is being planned at a time when on one hand, export growth has been tepid, while on the other, the government is gearing up to achieve the target of $2 trillion exports by 2030. Since India has been on a free trade agreement (FTA) signing spree, the platform will offer easy access to benefits under these agreements. For instance, the details of concessional tariffs, product-specific rules of origin with India’s FTA partners will be available on a single platform. Once launched, ‘Trade Connect’ will address specific challenges faced by Indian exporters, helped new and aspiring exporters with information on various regulations to access markets, sectors, and export trends. There will be a facility to address trade-related queries to government officials and associated entities to get expert advice to address trade barriers and trade disputes in export markets. The services on this platform will provide cost-free country and commodity-specific trade data and intelligence, support for e-commerce export, certification courses to learn export trade, to learn and avail services of state-owned ECGC and Exim Bank, as well as windows to access shipping and logistics services. Similarly, the exports will have a single go-to website that will have product-wise details of all the export-boosting schemes such as interest equalisation scheme, Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products (RoDTEP), and duty drawback, among others. “The platform will be beneficial for MSMEs, who struggle to get information. \"Availability of comprehensive information on one platform will help boost their exports,” said Ajay Sahai, director general and chief executive officer at the Federation of Indian Export Organisations. The government official added that after the initial launch, the government will bring in more value-added services such as insurance coverage, and other services on the platform eventually, for which a small fee may have to be paid. “We can ask ECGC to be onboard on the portal. \"Its insurance coverage can be availed online, and for which the entire transaction fee may be charged. \"The portal will also require maintenance, for people/large helpdesks will be needed for monitoring the issues faced by exporters,” the official added.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Good results for the January-March quarter (Q4) of FY24 and strong seasonal demand have led to strong investor interest in Crompton Greaves (CG) Consumer Electricals which is hitting new highs. While there’s bullish consensus on the company’s future performance, the stock has gained over 40 per cent in the last six months and valuations may become stretched. The Q4FY24 revenue rose 9.5 per cent YoY to Rs 1,960 crore. The ECD (Electronic Consumer Durables) revenue climbed 14.3 per cent YoY while lighting revenue was flat and the revenue of Butterfly Gandhimathi (which was merged in 2023) fell 12.2 per cent. The gross margin expanded 37bps YoY to 25 per cent due to cost savings and a better product mix. However, the EBITDA margin fell 142 bps due to higher ad-spend (up 29 per cent YoY) and EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) provisioning of Rs 15.4 crore. Interest costs were down 43.2 per cent YoY which pushed up profit after tax (PAT) 5.5 per cent YoY to Rs 138 crore. The revenue of the appliances business grew 27 per cent YoY, led by coolers (up 33 per cent) and Small Domestic Appliances or SDA (up 35 per cent). The company is No.1 in geysers on the e-com channel. The SDA business has been growing 30 per cent YoY for several quarters. Sales of large kitchen-appliances in FY24 were Rs 61 crore, with a Rs 25 crore loss at EBITDA level. The company continues to invest in this business and is setting up a manufacturing line for kitchen appliances in its Baroda plant. But industry-wide slowdown, and ongoing channel realignment and a one-time settlement hurt Butterfly’s revenue. The management expects growth to bounce from Q2 but margin recovery in Butterfly will be crucial. Fans grew in double digits in FY24, with sales crossing 20 million units. Growth was led by premium fans, which are selling much faster. The company claims to have gained market share in ceiling and premium fans and sees an opportunity seen in TPW (Table/Pedestal Wall) and domestic exhaust fans. While competitors did reduce prices, the company hiked prices thrice in the last six months and is prepared to hike again if required. It also hiked prices in pumps and it has outstanding solar pump orders of Rs 100 crore. Given a focus on innovation, the company spent Rs 71 crore on R&D in FY24. It filed 85 design registrations along with 17 patent registrations, of which 10 have been granted. Alternative channels (e-com, rural) account for 20 per cent of sales. The rural channel grew 23 per cent while e-com sales crossed Rs 100 crore for the third quarter in a row. Export revenue was Rs 100 crore. The FY25 capex was pegged at Rs 80-100 crore. The EPR impact for Butterfly was Rs 12 crore. Management is focusing on optimizing the channel mix for Butterfly and expects revenue growth from Q2. Investments in people and A&P are largely done and management expects double digit margins for Butterfly, long term. CG Consumer Electricals has raised A&P expenditure to 3.4 per cent of annual sales. In FY24, the company allocated Rs 270 crore towards A&P, up 49 per cent over FY23. The momentum of growth in ECD should continue and Butterfly should rebound with better margins. However, at Rs 425, valuations may reflect the anticipated growth.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-India), the national agency responsible for analysing suspicious financial transactions, has received requests from four more offshore crypto exchanges to operate in India again, said a senior government official familiar with the matter. In the beginning of 2024, India had banned nine crypto exchanges — Binance, Kucoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, Bittrex, and Bitfenix — for non-compliance with anti-laundering law in the country. “Apart from Kucoin and Binance, we have received four more requests from the offshore crypto exchanges,” said the senior government official. An email query sent to the Union Ministry of Finance remained unanswered at the time of going to press. The FIU India lifted the ban from Kucoin in March, after imposing a penalty of Rs 34.5 lakh. However, proceedings for Binance are still pending. “We expect them to go live very soon,” the official said. On December 28, before banning the nine exchanges for illegally operating within the country, the FIU-India had issued show-cause notices to them in response to violations of India’s anti-money laundering regulations. “India’s thriving grassroots crypto adoption and Web3 developer activity have made it a significant market that cannot be ignored, despite unfavourable taxation and strict compliance. \"This has led offshore crypto exchanges to refocus on the Indian market, where there is growing acceptance of tokenisation of bonds and securities-focused use cases,” said Sharat Chandra, co-founder of India Blockchain Forum. Currently, there are 46 registered crypto entities. With Kucoin and Binance, the total number of such entities will increase to 48. Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das has stuck to the central bank’s stance on banning crypto assets despite a global trend towards regulating them. In September 2023, the International Monetary Fund-Financial Stability Board (IMF-FSB) published a synthesis paper presenting guidelines for countries and a road map for crypto regulations. The paper provides insights into investor protection, cybersecurity, and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures. In October 2023, G20 finance ministers and central bank governors adopted the road map on crypto assets proposed in the synthesis paper, calling for its swift and coordinated implementation. The joint communiqué, issued after the final meeting of the FMCBG under India’s presidency in Marrakech, urged countries to implement policy frameworks. It advocated outreach beyond G20 jurisdictions, global coordination, cooperation, and information sharing, and addressing data gaps. “We ask the IMF and FSB to provide regular and structured updates on the progress of implementation of the G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets. \"We support the ongoing work and global implementation of FATF (Financial Action Task Force) standards on crypto-assets,” the communiqué said. Das had told reporters last year that the IMF-FSB synthesis paper pointed out the risks involved in crypto. “Regulation is always on a scale of zero to 10. \"Zero regulation will mean that there is no regulation, it’s free for all, and 10 means you don’t allow it. \"In between zero and 10, it depends on where you are. \"FSB now has to look at the granular details of regulation,” Das had said in October.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Finally, some good news for the Indian startup ecosystem. After four consecutive half-year periods of declining funding since 2022, the first half (H1) of 2024 has shown an upward trend compared to the second half (H2) of 2023. According to the India Tech Semi-Annual Funding Report H1 2024 by Tracxn, Indian technology (tech) startups raised $4.1 billion in H1 2024, marking a 4 per cent increase from $3.96 billion in H2 2023. However, this represents a 13 per cent decrease compared to the $4.8 billion raised in H1 2023. India, which ranked as the fourth-highest-funded country globally in the tech startup landscape, slipped a position as China advanced in the pecking order in terms of raising higher funds. China raised a total of $6.2 billion in H1 2024, becoming the third-highest funded country. In H1 2023, India had surpassed China to be the third-highest fundraising country globally. Although China raised more funds, the total number of funding rounds for the period was 327, lower than India’s 540. Additionally, the number of first-time-funded companies in India, at 168, was higher than China’s 159. The US continued to lead in overall funding volumes, followed by the UK. Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn, commented, “Despite four consecutive half-year periods of declining funding since H1 2022, we are now showing signs of stabilisation and an upward trend. \"India’s robust performance as the fourth-highest-funded country in the tech startup ecosystem is encouraging. \"From emerging developments in retail and enterprise applications to pioneering advancements in financial technology (fintech), Indian startups are transforming industries and driving economic growth.” The funding landscape across different stages showed varied trends: seed-stage funding increased to $455 million, up by 6.5 per cent from H2 2023 but down 17.3 per cent from H1 2023. Early-stage startups maintained steady funding of $1.3 billion, consistent with H2 2023 but 28 per cent lower than H1 2023. Late-stage funding rose to $2.4 billion, marking a 3.8 per cent increase from H2 2023, although it experienced a slight 1.3 per cent drop compared to H1 2023. Despite these challenges, H1 2024 witnessed eight funding rounds surpassing $100 million, including Flipkart’s $350 million Series J round led by Google, Apollo 24'7’s $297 million private equity round, and Meesho’s $275 million Series F round. The leading sectors in terms of performance in H1 2024 were retail, enterprise applications, and fintech. Funding in the retail sector increased by 32 per cent, reaching $1.63 billion in H1 2024 compared to $1.23 billion in H1 2023. The enterprise application sector raised $933 million in H1 2024, a 10 per cent decrease from the $1.04 billion raised in H1 2023. In the fintech space, funding dropped by 50 per cent, from $1.45 billion in H1 2023 to $726 million in H1 2024. In H1 2024, three unicorns emerged, a notable increase from zero in H1 2023, along with 33 new additions to the soonicorn club. The number of initial public offerings also rose to 17 in H1 2024, from six in H1 2023 and 12 in H2 2023. Bengaluru led in total funds raised during this period, followed by Delhi and Mumbai. The overall top investors in H1 2024 were Accel, Blume Ventures, and Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA). In the seed stage, Venture Catalysts, Z Nation Lab, and WeFounderCircle were the top investors. Peak XV Partners, Alpha Wave Global, and Saama Capital were the most active early-stage investors in H1 2024. DST Global, Epiq Capital, and UC-RNT Fund led late-stage investments in H1 2024.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The number of fresh formal jobs generated in a month increased to a seven-month high in April, signalling a recovery in the formal labour market in the country, according to the latest monthly payroll data released by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) on Thursday. In April, the number of new monthly subscribers under the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) sequentially increased by 18.77 per cent to 887,438 from 747,146 in March. Previously, in September 2023, 950,527 fresh formal employees had joined the EPF. The EPFO data is considered crucial as only the formal workforce enjoys social security benefits and is protected by labour laws. Of the total 887,438 new EPF subscribers in April, the share of young people belonging to the 18-28 age group declined to 65.5 per cent (581,106) from 66.74 per cent in the preceding month. This is crucial because subscribers in this age group are usually first-timers in the labour market, thus reflecting its robustness. Additionally, the share of women among the total new subscribers increased to 28.1 per cent (249,254) during the month, compared to 26.8 per cent (199,998) in March. Meanwhile, the net payroll additions — calculated by taking into account the number of new subscribers, the number of subscribers that exited, and the return of old subscribers to the social security organisation — increased by 31.94 per cent to 1.9 million in April from 1.44 million in March. However, the net monthly payroll numbers are provisional in nature and are often revised sharply the following month. That is why the new EPF subscriber figure is considered more reliable than net additions. “The payroll data highlights that approximately 1.45 million members exited and subsequently rejoined EPFO. \"These members switched their jobs and rejoined the establishments covered under the ambit of EPFO and opted to transfer their accumulations instead of applying for final settlement, thus safeguarding long-term financial well-being and extending their social security protection,” said the labour ministry in a statement. However, data from the private agency Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), which conducts its own Consumer Pyramids Household Survey, showed that the labour markets worsened in April as the unemployment rate in India increased to 8.1 per cent from 7.4 per cent in March. “The unemployment rate recorded an uptick in April alongside a fall in the labour participation rate (LPR) as well as the employment rate. \"LPR in India inched down to 40.9 per cent in April from 41.1 per cent in the previous month,” CMIE said in a statement. The monthly payroll data released by the EPFO is part of the government’s effort to track formal-sector employment by using payrolls as an instrument. Since April 2018, the National Statistical Office has been bringing out employment-related statistics in the formal sector, sharing data from September 2017 onwards, using information on the number of subscribers under the EPF scheme, the Employees’ State Insurance scheme, and the National Pension System.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Ambuja Cements’ announcement that it would acquire Hyderabad-based Penna Cement Industries could be the Adani Group company’s first step for wider inorganic expansion, according to analysts. Citing media reports, analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equity said Adani Group was preparing a war chest of $3 billion to acquire cement companies and become a leader in the sector in three to four years. Saurashtra Cement, Vadraj Cement, and the cement business of Jaiprakash Associates are companies the group could seek. “We believe that further acquisitions are indeed possible considering Ambuja Cement’s strong balance sheet,” said the brokerage in a note with a ‘buy’ rating for the company and a target price of Rs 767. Ambuja Cements’ share on Friday (June 14) hit a record high of Rs 690 on the BSE, rising 3.8 per cent in intraday trade. It ended 1.9 per cent higher at Rs 677 apiece as against a 0.24-per cent rise in the benchmark BSE Sensex index. Ambuja said on Thursday (June 13) it has entered into a binding agreement to acquire Penna Cement at an enterprise value of Rs 10,400 crore (cash consideration), mainly funded through internal accruals. The deal is expected to be completed in three or four months, subject to regulatory approvals. Penna has operational capacity of 10 million tonnes (mt): 90 per cent in Andhra Pradesh and Tela­ngana and the rest in Maha­rashtra. The company has a clinker capacity — a key metric in the cem­ent industry — of 7.3 mt. Penna has an up­coming grinding capacity of 4 mt and clinker capacity of 3 mt in Jod­hpur, Rajasthan. The plant is expe­ct­ed to be operational in 6-12 months. Ambuja had a nationwide market share of 13-14 per cent in FY24, but it was just 5-6 per cent in Southern India. The Penna acquisition would help Ambuja improve its market share in the South by 700-800 basis points (bps), said analysts at Emkay Global. When capacity additions are completed (20 mt by FY27), the company’s nationwide market share could improve by 200-250 bps, they said. “With Penna’s acquisition, Ambuja Cements will move to the top-three players’ group in the Southern market. \"Besides, the acquisition reinforces the company’s strong position as growing pan-India market leader,” said analysts at Jefferies. They have a 'buy' rating with a Rs 735-target. The increasing market share of major companies may further squeeze smaller players, leading to more mergers and acquisitions. Ambuja Cements aims to have a manufacturing capacity (consolidated) of 140 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by FY28 from 78.9 mtpa now. It is running expansion projects of 20 mtpa across regions to reach 100 mtpa capacity by FY26. The company’s Board has appr­oved a 2.25 mtpa clinker unit in Mundra in Gujarat and 17 grinding units (2.4 mtpa each) at different places in the country (including 4 mtpa proposed at Godda, Jhar­kh­and). Land acquisitions and statut­ory approvals for these projects are in progress. Ambuja Cement’s consolidated sales volumes in FY24 grew around 8 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to 59.2 mt. Its cement capacity utilisation stood at 82 per cent compared to 81 per cent in FY23. To­tal capital expenditure (standalone) stood at Rs 2,000 crore in FY24 compared to Rs 2,100 crore the year before. “We believe this acquisition will help Ambuja Cements move closer to its long-term growth target of 140 mt capacity by CY28. \"Additionally, capacity augmentation would strengthen its position in India, likely making it a key beneficiary of demand prospects. \"However, due to the teething issues at Penna Cement plants and the regional mix, which would tilt towards the surplus market of South India, the acquisition may be margin-dilutive in the medium term,” according to analysts at Elara Capital. “Given the competitive intensity in South India in the medium term, the asset may earn return ratios similar to cash yield and thus, may be EPS-neutral. We reiterate ‘accumulate’ rating with a target price of Rs 655,” they said. To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Bengal can be the game changers of 2024.' \"Welfarism only works when it is backed by bharosa [ trust ] -- and bharosa is Narendra Modi along with a combination of factors like cultural and muscular majoritarianism,\" notes political commentator Rasheed Kidwai . \"The challenge for INDIA is the prime ministerial face: Modi versus who? If the alliance targets Modi, they are doomed and if they don't, he gets away with everything, therefore, it is a difficult conundrum for the INDIA alliance,\" Kidwai tells Rediff.com 's Archana Masih . What is the Congress's future in North India? Is resurrection even possible? The result was not as expected by the Congress, but the party can draw heart from the fact that it has held onto its vote share in the Hindi Heartland. The states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh comprise over 90% majority community, unlike Bihar, West Bengal or UP which has a sizable minority population. The Congress has got 40% vote share from this majority population. The BJP has benefited at the expense of votes lost by other parties [like the Bahujan Samaj Party] . Although this is a cause of concern, it shows that the roots of the Congress are intact in this region. How does this likely impact the Congress' performance in 2024 because it fared abysmally in these states in 2019? The Congress had won these three states in the 2018 assembly election, but six months later conceded 62 out of 65 Lok Sabha seats to the BJP. In the worse-case scenario, the Congress can lose three more seats, and the BJP can gain three seats if it does very well. The situation remains bleak for the Congress in 2024 in the Hindi heartland, similar to 2014 and 2019. But the win in Telangana, which has 17 Lok Sabha seats, opens up the possibility for the Congress to pick up 10+ seats in 2024 from Telangana. In Parliamentary democracy, MPs elect the prime minister, but in 2014 and 2019, the PM got 282 and 300 MPs elected to Parliament on his own strength. And now that trend appears to have moved to the state elections as well. The prime minister has shown that he has the ability and influence to even get MLAs elected. The common thread in these states was Narendra Modi -- not welfare schemes like Ladli Behna. The chief ministers of Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan were also recklessly pursuing welfare and pro-women policies, but it did not help them return to power. Such welfarism only works when it is backed by bharosa [ trust ] -- and bharosa is Narendra Modi along with a combination of factors like cultural and muscular majoritarianism. It is a package. India is a personality driven polity. During the golden era of the Congress, there was no dearth of quality Opposition, but they could not match up. They were stalwarts like Ram Manohar Lohia, Jyoti Basu, Charan Singh, Chandrasekhar, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L K Advani, but they could not pin down Indira Gandhi, except post-Emergency in 1977 through a coalition, but by and large Mrs Gandhi remained formidable. She could outsmart them. Similarly, in today's time, there is no dearth of good leaders like Nitish Kumar, Mamata Banerjee, Sharad Pawar and others, but they are not a match for Mr Modi. You spoke about the Opposition. What options does the INDIA alliance have if it wants to arm itself against the BJP going into 2024? The INDIA alliance is not poorer or weaker by the outcome of the state election results. Telangana has given them a hope of gaining around 10 seats in the Lok Sabha 2024. The alliance needs to get their act together. They need to function as co-equals. The Congress cannot play the dominating partner. Historically, India's coalition politics has always had a dominant partner -- in the UPA, it was Congress; in the NDA, it was the BJP. However, the idea of co-equals is easy in theory, but difficult in practice. The second challenge for INDIA is the prime ministerial face: Modi versus who? If the alliance targets Modi, they are doomed and if they don't, he gets away with everything, therefore, it is a difficult conundrum for the INDIA alliance. The inability to come up with seat sharing agreement dented their chances in these assembly elections. The INDIA alliance is also plagued by egos and conflicting voices emerging from 28 different parties. Firstly, they need a seat-wise, nation-wide alliance backed by data, not the whims and fancies of different leaders. Data science and strategists like Sunil Kanugolu can help them figure out who is best suited to contest from individual constituencies. They need a consensus on 80%-90% Lok Sabha seats. The alliance should have a common social media policy and authorised spokespersons. Udhaynidhi Maran's comment had an impact on traditional, conservative, Hindus who have a strong sense of association with Sanatan Dharma. It is difficult to discipline 28 parties, but members should be actively discouraged from making such statements. The alliance has experienced leaders like Sharad Pawar, Nitish Kumar, Mamata Banerjee, Sitaram Yechuri who understand politics and can look at issues dispassionately. They should have an active team on the ground comprising Akhilesh Yadav in UP, Tejaswi Yadav in Bihar, Stalin in Tamil Nadu, etc. Leaders like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, Nitish Kumar and Sharad Pawar should provide heft in establishing cohesiveness among the partners. There needs to be a quick response mechanism. For example, the Sanatan Dharma remark went unattended. Meanwhile, the NDA speaks in the same voice on all social, economic, cultural issues, whereas the outlook of the INDIA alliance is very diverse. However, this diversity also gels with the civilisational ethos of the country where diversity is welcomed. Some of the parties in the INDIA alliance were partners of the NDA in 2019 and are now on the opposite side of the BJP. How will this impact the outcome of the 2024 election? Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Bengal can be the game changers. Maharashtra has 48 seats -- the BJP along with united Shiv Sena won 42 seats in 2019. This time the Shiv Sena [UBT], Congress and NCP have the potential to reduce the NDA tally by half. Bihar: The BJP-Janata Dal-United alliance won 39/40 seats. This time, the JD-U, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress are in a coaltion which will enhance their collective potential. Bengal: The BJP won 18/42 seats. Mamata has the capacity to reduce it to a single digit in 2024. Karnataka: The BJP won 25/28. The Congress has the potential to reduce it to a single digit in 2024. The southern states, along with other states in north-western, central, eastern India have the potential to reduce the number of seats for the BJP. The Congress should look at expanding Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra to Odisha, Bengal, Bihar and the North East. Therefore, the yatra that he intends to do from east to west will carry some hope for them, but it has to have effort. The Congress and the INDIA alliance also need a composite outlay to deal with communalism. India's civilisational ethos is diverse and accommodative. It is do-able and this counter-narrative can be shaped. The southern and eastern states are accepting it, so they can find a solution in north India also. The alliance needs ideological fine tuning. They need to be sure footed. Feature Presentation: Aslam Hunani/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'Rahul should have learnt so much in the last 20 years. But give him a mic and he begins to talk without thinking about its consequences.' Dr Sant Kumar Tewari , assistant professor, department of political science at the Pandit Sunadrlal Sharma University, Bilaspur, explains the reasons behind Congress' rout in Chhattisgarh and BJP's astounding victory. In the 2018 election, the BJP could win only 15 out of 90 MLAs as against the Congress's 68. In 2023, the BJP romped home with 54 MLAs against 35 from the Congress, a huge 50 per cent drop from its showing in the 2018 election. \"The Congress and top leaders made no attempt to mingle among the people two-three days before polling day. There were no big rallies of Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi before polling day. They ( Rahul Gandhi and the top Congress leadership ) will have to climb down from their ivory towers,\" Dr Tewari tells Prasanna D Zore/ Rediff.com . Among all the defeats, isn't the Chhattisgarh loss the most surprising for the Congress? It is surprising of course. Even the exit polls got this one ( state ) wrong. Everybody had predicted an easy win for the Congress in Chhattisgarh. It nevertheless, offers an opportunity for introspection, especially, for those who have lost power. They ( Congress ) should introspect why they lost so badly despite doing so much good work for the people. What worked for the BJP? The biggest gain for the BJP is the astounding victory that people of the state handed to them. Narendra Modi is the BJP's biggest and most powerful leader. Nobody has been able to dent his clean image. The Opposition is doing all it can to link him with such activities ( corruption ), but they have failed to even make a small dent on his clean image. He has also got a very efficient team of leaders working under him. The voters have undergone a huge change in the way they vote. The voters are more educated today. Gone are the days when victories were obtained by bribing voters at the last moment or promising them the moon and freebies. Along with promises the voters today are also looking at a politician's image and Narendra Modi ranks right there at the top. Their ( Congress 's) leader ( Rahul Gandhi ) seems to have learnt nothing despite being in politics for almost 20 years now. Any person, after spending over 20 years in any school or institution, would shine like the Kohinoor ( diamond ). Look at the rise of Narendra Modi and look at Rahul Gandhi's graph. He ( Rahul Gandhi ) should have learnt so much in the last 20 years. But give him a mic and he begins to talk without thinking about its consequences. During an election, even the smallest mistake made by a politician attains huge proportion. Rahul Gandhi must focus now on building a solid team which would at least give him a good speech when he holds the mic in his hand. Whatever a person's stature, if he realises his follies, accepts them and makes efforts to improve upon them then he still can offer a formidable challenge to Narendra Modi. You have been repeating the same mistake since the last 20 years as a result of which you are being rejected by the people time and again. The BJP also fielded 47 new faces in the state. Did that help? One must always remember that the respect people have for their elected MPs and MLAs start dwindling once they start losing a couple of consecutive elections. I am not disrespecting the experience such leaders, have but I firmly believe that all the leaders who have crossed 50 and who are unable to win elections should start working for the party in an advisory role. These leaders should hand over the reins of the party to the youth. Just consider the morale of the youth in your party who has been toiling for decades when they see that a few leaders, just because they have political mai-baap ( godfathers ) backing them, are getting tickets to contest the election despite defeat-after-defeat. In the BJP, change happens quietly; even if a senior leader is sidelined, nobody raises an eyebrow and accepts the decision. In the Congress, if you try to bring even a small change at the local level, then the party is faced with rebellion from here to Delhi. While the Congress has won Telangana, it must not ignore how the BJP has increased its MLAs manifold. The best thing about the BJP is that once they decide to contest election from a state where they do not have a strong presence their entire team descends upon the state with all their might. But Bhupesh Baghel has been quite a popular chief minister in the state. Being from Chhattisgarh, I can tell you that Bhupesh Baghel made for an excellent chief minister. His work for the people is noteworthy. When the results started swinging towards the BJP, I was quite stumped. But Baghel ji too must introspect the reasons for the BJP's huge victory margin in this election. But then he can only do that much. Interestingly, in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, the BJP went to the hustings without declaring their chief ministerial face compared to the Congress. Despite this shortcoming, if the people of Chhattisgarh voted heavily against the Congress and in the BJP's favour, then the credit must go Narendra Modi. The Congress and its overall leadership must try to figure out what is it that attracts the voters towards the BJP. I think it is time for the Congress to change its leadership. The way the Congress's top leadership has failed to win the confidence of people in critical Hindi belt states like Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan now, and in Uttar Pradesh for almost three decades now is shocking. These leaders, for some reason, are not able to win people's trust. These leaders have closed their eyes and ears to the public. They still consider themselves above the common people resulting in Congress getting alienated from the people. One definitely got an impression before the election that the Congress would definitely win Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Congress and top leaders in these two states made no attempt to mingle among the people two-three days before the polling day. There were no big rallies of Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi in these states before polling day. They ( Rahul Gandhi and the top Congress leadership ) will have to climb down from their ivory towers and mill around with the common masses. What went wrong for Congress in Bastar which voted for Congress in 2018? The tribals of Bastar seem to have voted for BJP. Why? I have always stood by the opinion that the law and order of any state should always follow the rightful legal path; it should not depend on circumstances or change for select few. The Congress did win sympathies of Bastar's tribals ( in the 2018 election ) after their leadership was killed in the region in 2013 ( 25 senior Congress leaders, including Nand Kumar Patel, Vidya Charan Shukla and Mahendra Karma were killed by Maoists in Bastar in 2013 ). When the Congress came to power in 2018 they did pussy-foot with the Naxals instead of taking them head on. The Congress should have shown spine in dealing with the Maoists in Bastar. Like, people would always say that Article 370 will never be abrogated in Kashmir; that it is a Constitutional guarantee given to the Kashmiris. But if you are firm on your decision then there is nothing that can stop you. People don't look at the Congress leadership as firm and decisive as much as they consider Narendra Modi to be firm and decisive. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'When he was sidelined in the INDIA bloc, it was was the turning point because it badly hurt Nitish's ambition.' 'After that, he decided to damage INDIA by changing sides.' Three days after Janata Dal-United President and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar thanked Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi for conferring the Bharat Ratna, the country's highest civilian award, posthumously on veteran Socialist leader Karpoori Thakur , he dumped the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan that included the Congress and Left parties, and aligned with Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. Bihar's BJP-JD-U government was sworn in on Sunday evening. Till last week, senior JD-U and RJD leaders repeatedly refuted any rift, differences and heartburn in the Mahagathbandhan. This correspondent was the first to report in December that Nitish Kumar was planning to dump the Mahagathbandan and return to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. What provoked Nitish Kumar to return to the NDA, which he dumped in August 2022? JD-U sources tell me that Nitish was angry after he was not named convenor or the prime ministerial candidate of the Opposition bloc INDIA. Nitish had convened the first meeting of Opposition leaders in Patna in June 2023, which led to the formation of the INDIA bloc in Bengaluru in July 2023. \"For Nitish, what matter most is his self interest and ambition, neither ideology nor ethics,\" confides a senior JD-U leader clearly unhappy with his leader's latest political somersault. \"His decision to join hands with the BJP may surprise many, not us. It was on the cards and expected.\" INDIA leaders, he explains, had frustrated Nitish by their behind the scenes politicking not to name him the bloc's convenor or its prime ministerial candidate for the Lok Sabha election. Nitish, he says, has been ready since last year to play an innings in national politics and for that he had mobilised Opposition parties and worked successfully to unite them. \"But when he was sidelined in the INDIA bloc, it was the end of his dream. This was the turning point because it badly hurt Nitish's ambition,\" the JD-U leader adds, \"After that, he decided to damage INDIA by changing sides.\" A political observer in Patna claims Nitish Kumar made up his mind to move to the NDA after viewing the BJP mobilisation over the Ram temple. JD-U leaders and Bihar ministers, close to Nitish, were already in touch with BJP leaders who were working to convince Nitish that the JD-U would not repeat its 2019 Lok Sabha election performance (16 seats) in 2024 with the Mahagathbandhan in a polarised condition. Senior JD-U leaders K C Tyagi and Bihar ministers Sanjay Jha, Ashok Choudhary, Vijay Kumar Choudhary convinced Nitish to change sides after the INDIA bloc extinguished his convenor ambitions, this commentator adds. \"Had he been named INDIA's PM candidate as he expected, Nitish could have take the political risk. But he realised better gains contesting the Lok Sabha elections along with the BJP. Taking into account this weakness of Nitish, the BJP used the service of two Constitutional post holders to convince him to join the NDA,\" claims the political observer. In January 2023, Nitish had declared that he would prefer to die rather than join hands with the BJP. Earlier, in the state assembly, he proclaimed, ' Mitti mein mil jayenge lekin BJP ke saath nahi jayenge ', an identical sentiment. Nitish Kumar may also have been irked by RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav's insistence that his younger son Tejashwi Yadav be promoted as chief minister at the earliest. Last year, Nitish himself announced that he wanted Tejashwi to replace him and that the 2025 assembly polls would be contested under the younger Yadav's leadership.\" According to a senior RJD leader, Lalu had laid down a condition to Nitish -- when the JD-U left the NDA and formed the Mahagathbandan in Bihar in August 2022 -- that Tejashwi would be made chief minister when Nitish moved to national politics. But Nitish was not ready to step aside. JD-U sources say Lallan Singh -- who resigned as JD-U national president on December 29 -- and senior party leader and Bihar minister Bijendar Yadav opposed their party rejoining the NDA on the ground that its political credibility would hit a new low if it did so. The BJP's top leadership in December, these sources say, invited Nitish to rejoin the NDA and contest the 2024 poll together to win all of Bihar's 40 Lok Sabha seats. The BJP leadership, these JD-U sources add, has offered Nitish over a dozen Lok Sabha seats, two Rajya Sabha seats and a governor's post for one of his nominees.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The finance minister's assertion that industry should not expect any spectacular announcements in the 2024 interim Budget suggest that the electoral imperatives of more tax concessions or higher expenditure on welfarist programmes could be far less pronounced than they were before the 2019 interim Budget, expects A K Bhattacharya. In the run-up to the presentation of the interim Budget for 2024-2025, two major issues have come under scrutiny. One pertains to the scope and size of the fiscal space that the Union government currently enjoys in financing its expenditure plan for the next couple of years. The second issue is about the nature of the government's political imperative for announcing any fresh expenditure plan to secure the much-needed electoral dividends during the forthcoming general elections. It will be instructive to assess both the issues even as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present her first interim Budget. Growth assumptions are critical inputs for framing the government's fiscal consolidation strategy. The First Advance Estimates (FAE) of India's gross domestic product (GDP) was released last week, placing the nominal size of the economy for 2023-2024 at Rs 296.58 trillion, showing a growth rate of 8.9 per cent. This was a huge deceleration. The nominal size of the economy in 2022-2023 had grown by over 16 per cent. But despite a relatively low rise in nominal GDP in 2023-2024, the Centre's net tax revenues have maintained a growth rate of over 17 per cent (April-November 2023). This implies that tax buoyancy has improved. What's more, it appears the target of 11 per cent net tax revenue growth for the full year of 2023-2024 is set to be exceeded. On the expenditure side, the Centre's revenue as well as capital spending has seen a perceptible slowdown in recent months. In the first half of 2023-2024, revenue expenditure grew by almost 10 per cent. But by the end of November, this growth rate slowed to 3.5 per cent. Clearly, revenue expenditure growth is being gradually aligned to what had initially appeared to be an ambitious full-year target of 1.4 per cent. Capital expenditure too had grown by 43 per cent in the first half of 2023-2024, but slowed to 31 per cent for the April-November period of the current year. This is even lower than the annual growth of 36 per cent projected for the full year. Even though there will be some additional expenditure pressure in the last three months of the year because of the extension of the free food grain scheme and other social welfare programmes, there are reasons to believe that the fiscal deficit target of 5.9 per cent of GDP will be met during the current year. Non-tax revenues will be more than the Budget projections and should be able to make good the shortfall in the government's disinvestment proceeds. A lower nominal growth rate of 8.9 per cent for 2023-2024, compared to the Budget premise of 10.5 per cent, could exert some extra pressure on government finances, but given the revenue buoyancy and slowing expenditure growth, the stated fiscal deficit target appears achievable. Where the low nominal growth rate of 8.9 per cent for 2023-2024 will cause concern for the Budget makers is in its potential impact on the assumptions for 2024-2025. Remember that Ms Sitharaman in the last few years has displayed an admirable degree of conservatism in projecting the government's revenue and expenditure growth, apart from introducing transparency in accounting by including in the Budget all expenditure that earlier was kept out of Budget calculations. The last few years have seen no recourse to such off-Budget spending. But now, a relatively low nominal GDP growth projection could become a constraint. The interim Budget for 2019-2020 was helped by an unusually rosy nominal GDP growth projections of over 12 per cent for 2018-2019. Based on that number, the interim Budget five years ago had assumed a nominal economic growth of 11.5 per cent for 2019-2020. Indeed, the full Budget for 2019-2020 had raised the nominal economic growth projection to 12 per cent, even though the Second Advance Estimates had brought down its GDP growth rate for 2018-19 to 11.5 per cent. As it turned out, the actual nominal GDP growth rates in 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 were 10.6 per cent and 6.4 per cent, respectively. The consequences of such over-optimism were evident in the final fiscal deficit numbers for 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. Against a Budget Estimate of 3.3 per cent for each of the two years, the actual deficit turned out to be 3.4 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively. This slippage took place even after the Budget numbers had resorted to the unhealthy practice of off-Budget expenditure. The finance ministry today is a lot different from the finance ministry of 2019. The FAE indicating a nominal GDP growth of only 8.9 per cent for 2023-2024 will naturally restrain the current finance ministry from projecting a significantly higher nominal size of the Indian economy in 2024-2025. Recent reports suggest that the finance ministry may settle for 10.5 per cent nominal growth for 2024-2025. Improved tax buoyancy might, nevertheless, help the Centre project a decent double-digit revenue growth for 2024-2025, but this may not be enough to both step up its capital expenditure and bring down the fiscal deficit. If the Centre must bring its deficit down from 5.9 per cent of GDP in the current year to 4.5 per cent by 2025-2026, the available fiscal space is limited. A reduction of 1.4 percentage points in the next two years will be a challenging task. Note that despite healthy revenue growth in the post-Covid years (2022-2023 and 2023-2024), the government had to spend more, and its fiscal deficit could contract by only 0.8 percentage points in these years. The challenge ahead could get more complicated because of the general elections that would be held in May 2024. The big question is whether the political leadership will push the finance ministry to loosen its purse strings in the days before the polls, through higher expenditure allocations and tax giveaways in the interim Budget. However, the finance minister's assertion that industry should not expect any new spectacular announcements in the interim Budget and the ruling party's electoral victory in the recent assembly elections suggest that the electoral imperatives of more tax concessions or higher expenditure on welfarist programmes could be far less pronounced than they were before the interim Budget in 2019. That could well pave the way for a fiscally prudent interim Budget for 2024-2025. If that happens, the ruling party's growing political capital could at last create the base for robust economic reforms in the days ahead. With less baggage or burden of concessions and populist schemes, the full Budget for 2024-2025, to be presented after the elections, could build on the current tax buoyancy through steps to widen the tax base and by expediting non-tax revenue flows with a renewed focus on asset monetisation and privatisation.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'My understanding is that by the time President Xi Jinping came for the Chennai summit [2019], he had already instructed his army to undertake the action in Galwan in the summer of 2020.' If there is a diplomat who deeply understands the intricacies and complexities of India-China relations, it is Ambassador Gautam Bambawale . India's former ambassador to China, Ambassador Bambawale served four tenures in China in his nearly 35 years in the Indian Foreign Service. He speaks fluent Mandarin and is an expert on China. He is only one of three Indians this century to have served India's ambassador to China and Pakistan -- Ambassador Vijay Nambiar and Ambassador Shiv Shankar Menon being the others. Four years after the Chinese offensive in Galwan as India-China relations remain in very bad shape, he feels the relationship will continue to deteriorate unless the Chinese untie the knot. \"The Chinese thought they could muscle their way in, but India's military-politico-diplomatic response has been very good,\" Ambassador Bambawale tells Rediff.com 's Archana Masih and Nikhil Lakshman in a multi-part interview. Four year after the Galwan offensive, have you deciphered the reasons why the Chinese incursion took place in Eastern Ladakh? One of the factors behind China's offensive action in Eastern Ladakh was the asymmetry of power between China and India. Chinese GDP in the summer of 2020 was about 17 trillion dollars; India was about 3.5 trillion dollars. Therefore, the power differential between the two countries was sizable enough for them to meet the necessary condition to be assertive. The Chinese thought they could muscle their way in, but India's military-politico-diplomatic response has been very good. Therefore, we have been able to keep China at bay. What are some of the political steps that helped keep China at bay? The ban on Chinese foreign direct investment in 5G and on mobile apps are some examples of the right political response by India. External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar has said that India-China relations are in a bad space and will not improve unless China takes some measures. After India conducted the nuclear tests in 1998, the Chinese had said: 'The one who ties the knot has to untie it'. At that time, India had tied the knot when then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee wrote a letter to ( then US ) President Bill Clinton explaining the reason behind the tests. This time, the Chinese have tied the knot and they must untie it. The relationship cannot move ahead unless they do so. The Government of India has stood firm and should continue to remain steadfast. The firmness is also evident on the border. The Northern Army Commander has said that our troops have remained on the frontline even through the winter. There was recent news about two clashes that took place between the troops on the LAC. Therefore, India has to stay firm -- politically, diplomatically and militarily. Do you think the foreign minister has rightfully called out China, something that has not been done before? It is a fact. Anyone who does not say so is delusional because the relationship is in very bad shape. India-China ties have deteriorated and will continue to deteriorate unless the Chinese do not untie the knot. Do you think China will make any effort to untie the knot? I don't think they will. It will continue to deteriorate and that is where we are unfortunately. Diplomacy means speaking the truth and Dr Jaishankar is right in telling the country that India-China relations are in a bad place . You were pivotal in negotiating the Wuhan Agreement five years ago and had foreseen better India China relations. When you served as India's ambassador in China, did you get the feeling that winds were changing? The first informal summit between India and China was in Wuhan in April 2018, and second was in Chennai in October 2019. My understanding is that by the time President Xi Jinping came for the Chennai summit , he had already instructed his army to undertake the action in Galwan in the summer of 2020. This can give us a sense of how Xi thinks. Wuhan was seen as a big breakthrough in India-China relations. How did it resolve the Dokalam standoff? Dokalam was one of the series of incidents that brought home to India that India-China and the world had changed. The old rubric for India-China relations which had been put together by Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China in December 1988 had served us well, but that template was no longer tenable. The two summits were an attempt to initiate a new rubric or template so that India-China relations could continue to move forward despite the difficulties and tension. It was evident that it would need more than just two rounds of meetings between the leaders to arrive at a new rubric. Unfortunately, Xi Jinping had already made up his mind militarily by the second summit. The basis of a good relationship is peace on the border, but since China moved its troops in forward positions in 2020, the relationship could not move forward. Today, there are hardly any government to government meetings between India and China except the military talks at the border -- or on the sidelines of international summits. A plethora of interactions had been planned, but that has fallen by the wayside. This breakdown is impacting other areas like FDI. The Government of India has put stringent security considerations into Chinese investments in India. India has ensured that Chinese investment goes through several hoops and layers before it is approved - and a lot hasn't been approved. Trade hasn't been cut down because certain imports go into our own exports and the government has been practical. Were any concessions made in Wuhan to resolve the Dokalam crisis? There was no question of concessions at all. Dokalam had been resolved earlier. The effort in the two summits was to find a way to handle the relationship and move forward, but it did not get a chance. Do you think the relationship started deteriorating long before that? Former Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran wrote that Indian diplomats had noticed a change in the Chinese attitude from 2012 itself. Many of us saw it. We definitely felt there was a possibility of the Chinese getting aggressive, not only with India but with other countries as well. Their position in the world was strengthening because of the size of their economy and the asymmetry of power between them and other countries, including India. India needs to reduce this asymmetry -- economic, technological, scientific and military - and increase its comprehensive national power. Since the relations between the two countries are in poor shape and expected to deteriorate further, what is the possibility of reverting to status quo ante pre 2020? The action taken by China in Eastern Ladakh changed the status quo . According to newspaper reports there are certain patrolling points and routes that the Indian Army cannot patrol anymore because the Chinese are sitting at those junctions. Since there is no agreed boundary, you should not ask whether India has lost territory or whether China has lost territory. You must ask whether the status quo has changed and the answer is yes. India should stick to its position of demanding a restoration of status quo ante and continue talks after that.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Thousands of Yoga enthusiasts and practitioners assembled at the iconic Times Square in New York for day-long sessions of the ancient Indian practice on the eve of the commemoration of the International Day of Yoga. The Consulate General of India in New York along with the Times Square Alliance hosted special yoga sessions at Times Square Thursday, the day of the summer solstice, as yoga enthusiasts geared to celebrate the International Day of Yoga, marked every year on June 21. Amid heat advisories in place for the New York area, which experienced temperatures as high as 93 degree Fahrenheit (33.8 degree Celsius) during the day, people from all walks of life and nationalities arrived early morning and rolled out their yoga mats in the heart of the popular New York City destination. Yoga instructor and Breath Meditation teacher Richa Dhekne, who has over two decades of experience as a volunteer and faculty member with the Art of Living Foundation, led the yoga and meditation session hosted by the Consulate General of India in New York. Several other yoga teachers and experts led various meditation, exercises and breathing sessions throughout the day at Times Square, as thousands participated in the day-long activities. \"As you can see, we have yoga participants from several nationalities, and this is going to go on for the entire day today,\" Consul General of India in New York Binaya Srikanta Pradhan said. Pradhan said they were expecting about 8,000-10,000 participants and added that the theme of the 2024 Yoga Day is 'Yoga for Self and Society'. \"I'm sure this is going to inspire everybody participating here today, and around other different parts of the United States,\" Pradhan said. The Consulate said in a post on X 'celebrated the 10th International Day of Yoga at the iconic @TimesSquareNYC!' 'The day-long celebration of Solstice at @TimesSquareNYC featured seven yoga sessions, in which about 10,000 people from across nationalities participated, showcasing the widespread enthusiasm for yoga in the city,' it added. Pradhan greeted the participants, highlighting the benefits of Yoga for both physical health and spiritual well-being, as well as its role in promoting harmony with nature, the Consulate said on X. Officials and staff from the Indian Consulate as well as members of the diaspora joined the yoga session. The Consulate, along with partner associations, held several yoga sessions in the lead-up to Yoga Day, including one at Bryant Park near the famous New York Public Library as well as a special yoga session for women at Central Park that was led by Swami Brahmanishthananda.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) It is possible to be blind to this and pretend to carry on as if nothing has happened but that will not change the reality, asserts Aakar Patel. India's new government has a new Cabinet which is the old Cabinet. The ministers for home, finance, foreign and defence will be the same. These four are considered the most important by the government, which classifies them as comprising the committee on security. And so once again it will be Amit A Shah, Nirmala Sitharaman, S Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh. Road and highways will again by managed by Nitin Gadkari, railways will be run again by Ashwini Vaishnaw, commerce and industry again by Piyush Goyal, law again by Arjun Ram Meghwal. Even where portfolios have been shifted, ministers have been retained and readers will not be unfamiliar with names like Kiren Rijiju, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Giriraj Singh and so on. Some famous names are gone, like Smriti Irani and Rajiv Chandrasekhar, at least for now, but this is because they lost in high-profile contests. No reason has been given for moving around those ministers who have been retained but shifted, but presumably this has been done to accommodate allies like the Telugu Desam (civil aviation), Janata Dal-Secular (steel), Janata Dal United (micro, medium, small industries), LJP (food processing), Shiv Sena (ayurveda and Yoga). Or done to bring in former BJP chief ministers like Shivraj Singh Chauhan of Madhya Pradesh (agriculture) and Manohar Lal of Haryana (housing). Overall it resembles not so much a new cabinet as one that has undergone a minor reshuffle. In the old days, when most newspapers reported news, this would have been reported 'below the fold' as it were, meaning not on the top half of the newspaper. The question is why does 3.0 look like 2.0? The obvious reason is that there is nothing to change because everything is going well. Change is necessary only if there is a need to correct course, and because the BJP won the election, there is no such need. But defeat, meaning sitting in the Opposition, would have meant no BJP Cabinet at all so perhaps it is unclear what the middle ground would be in such a line of thinking and what conditions would trigger change. It is unlikely then that 'all is well' is the reason. What else could it be? One possibility is that there is weak bench strength, that there are not enough talented individuals in the party to be given the important jobs and the prime minister is stuck with the small set he has. This is not the likely reason because under this prime minister, the PMO functions as a mini Cabinet and intervenes on critical issues as the defence, finance and foreign ministries know. There is a third possibility and that is the reluctance or inability to concede that something has in fact gone wrong. The prime minister made a speech in the Lok Sabha on February 5 that has been uploaded on his YouTube channel. As he concludes it, he says the following: 'Mr Speaker, normally I don't get into the issue of numbers. But I have observed the mindset of the nation. It will certainly take the NDA beyond 400, but it will also definitely ( avashya ) give the BJP 370 seats.' At this point the treasury benches are thumped and the chant of 'Modi! Modi!' rises. The prime minister repeats: '370 seats for the BJP and beyond 400 for the NDA'. The thumping and chanting continues. As we now know, this did not happen. The BJP did not get 370 and it did not even get 270. For the first time in his career, the prime minister is leading a minority government. Is this a defeat? If you look at the Opposition and its voters they are behaving as if they have won. The fact that the new government is shaky and dependent on external support is not lost on them. As Yogendra Yadav has said, the acceptability and prestige that was there in the last decade is gone. The invincibility is gone and gone forever. For this very reason many of the BJP's supporters and especially the prime minister's following remain despondent. Externally things have changed. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is again expressing itself on issues concerning the government's functioning after a decade of silence. The NDA partners are asserting themselves. It is possible to be blind to this and pretend to carry on as if nothing has happened but that will not change the reality. The voter has told the prime minister he is less popular than he was in 2019 and less popular in 2014. The voter has also told him that it is okay with an NDA government but not a BJP one. To pretend we are still in February is to lie to oneself. There is no question that the performances of key ministries, including finance and perhaps even home, were the reason for the defeat. Carrying on without change is to continue with the damage. But who in the party can tell him that? Not those who are returning to their positions surrounding him. Not those who know they will be punished for speaking the truth. For those who are opposed to the BJP, this being in denial is not a bad thing because nothing good will come of it as the coming months will show. The world does not change itself to align with one's delusions. Aakar Patel is a columnist and writer and you can read Aakar's earlier columns here .

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Rival governments in Tamil Nadu expend the most on social welfare schemes, especially targeting women and youth and children, but that money comes only by selling more liquor. There is always the specious plea, which has been peddled very many times in the past, that without licensed liquor, drinkers would go after hooch and there could be more hooch tragedies and hooch deaths. No one is convinced, but no one can dispute it either, comments N Sathiya Moorthy. A noticeable aspect of this week's hooch tragedy at Karunapuram and neighbourhood villages in the hilly terrain of central north-west Kallakurichchi district is that no critic of Chief Minister M K Stalin's DMK government has demanded total prohibition. Their demands and the government's response to the tragedy have followed the template model that is not unique to the southern state. A sample: The state government suspended the district police superintendent and a few other police officers down the line and also transferred the district collector, when their presence on the spot might have helped in coordinating relief and response measures. Then it ordered the transfer of the ADGP and SP, prohibition wing, without assigning them alternate posts. Stalin has ordered a judicial probe, by retired high court Judge B Gokuldas, with the predictable three-month period for him to submit his report. Any future extension for the probe under the Commissions of Inquiry Act will also depend on the mood of the media and the masses, the people's readiness to forget the tragedy early on, and move on to other spicy developments. For their part, the political Opposition too has reacted on equally predictable lines. Opposition AIADMK Leader of the Opposition and predecessor CM, Edappadi K Palaniswami, after visiting the affected families, has demanded Stalin's immediate resignation, taking up moral responsibility for the failure of the civil administration in general and the police force in particular. Since the exit of the Congress regime as far as 1967, successive Dravidian chief ministers, starting with the late C N Annadurai, have retained the home portfolio. Stalin, like his late father and chief minister M Karunanidhi, is no exception. The state government has moved the mandatory criminal investigations into the incident from the local police to the Crime Branch-CID operating across the state. The AIADMK Opposition has joined some individuals and has moved the Madras high court for ordering a CBI probe, claiming that the local police and CB-CID were manned by personnel from the same force under the same uniformed leadership, too. Maintaining the same line but making it even more political, state BJP President K Annamalai has written to Union Home Minister Amit A Shah, demanding a CBI probe. It is not that Annamalai, a former IPS officer, did not know that under the law, CBI probe into crimes unconnected with the Union government requires request from or consent of the state government concerned. Alternatively, only the high court of the Supreme Court could order one. Not the one to miss an opportunity when one presented itself, Annamalai has also called for a state-wide protest against the Stalin dispensation and focused on the hooch tragedy. Any AIADMK announcement, or those by other non-INDIA/anti-INDIA political parties or combines, too will be on similar lines, for similar purposes. Among the current crop in the Opposition just now, the PMK alone has been demanding total prohibition across the state, every now and again. The party is taking on the ruling DMK in the Vikravandi by-election in neighbouring Viluppuram district for the BJP-NDA, and is sure to use the hooch tragedy in the adjoining district as a major campaign point. So will actor-politician Seeman's NTK, with the mainline AIADMK Opposition having announced a by-poll boycott this time. If the ruling party/combine thought that they could effectively use the revived budget session of the state assembly to snub the divided Opposition over the Lok Sabha poll drubbing of theirs, it is not to be. The hooch tragedy is going to dominate the daily discourse in the House through the short session. If at the end of it all, the divided Opposition had found common cause in the hooch tragedy to bring them closer way ahead of the state assembly polls due in 2026 summer, the DMK has only itself to blame. Yet, it can breathe easy in the fact that no critic of the government has laid the blame for the tragedy at the doorstep of any specific DMK leader or minister, at least so far. All that the AIADMK has said thus far is that their local MLA had repeatedly written to the government authorities, cautioning them of an impending calamity of the kind, but to no avail. A section of the local media, not seen as friendly to the present day rulers, has also attributed the previous SP seeking voluntary retirement to alleged political pressure brought upon him while dealing with hooch-makers, distributors and sellers. Non-political and apolitical critics of the government system as a whole and the DMK dispensation in particular have asked why Stalin did not visit the tragedy scene, as is customary, but despatched only his minister-son Udayanidhi, in the company of a few senior colleagues, to pay condolences to the dead and offer solace to the affected families. Some cheeky social media posts lacking taste claimed that Stalin had used the tragedy to promote his son further in the political administration of the state. But it is another criticism against the state government that matters the most. Significantly, no political party or leader has spelt out those lines but social media posts have questioned the morality and propriety of the chief minister announcing Rs 10 lakh compensation to the families of every dead victim of hooch. The question is being asked is how and why the government thought it fit to pay for the hooch dead from the tax and other revenue collections that go mostly from non-drinkers. There is also a sociological anxiety that the continued act of the state government paying high compensation to hooch victims while depriving more needy victims of other social evils can have a deleterious effect on community-living. Comparisons too will be made of governmental compensation for flood and cyclone victims, and those in fire tragedies, especially in match and cracker factories. In extreme cases, there is the temptation to believe in the abuse and misuse of governmental grace and generosity. It is in this midst that mild voices have begun to be heard about the need for total prohibition in the state. It may or may not pick up momentum, and a lot of it may also depend on the Madras high court observations, at times obiter dicta that have no binding force on the government, especially. Already, social media has begun addressing questions at social activists, political commentators and film actors who had posted views and demands critical of the previous AIADMK government on a host of issues -- but are supposedly stone-deaf and colour-blind to the incumbent regime. It is also such voices that in particular have questioned the high compensation for hooch victims. This societal double play is unquestionable, yes. But that applies to everyone, big and small, then as now. The late journalist, satirist and moralistic political commentator, Cho S Ramaswamy, was once known to have been a director of a liquor-manufacturing company identified with the AIADMK under J Jayalalithaa. He supposedly quit the post only after his association became public knowledge. In the same vein, social media activists this time round have specifically begun questioning the so-called left-extreme social groups that launched long and relay-like protests across liquor shops across the state through the long run-up to the 2016 assembly elections when Jayalalithaa was chief minister. These groups, mostly with women activists in the frontline, co-opted local women in their protests, which at times turned violent, especially if the local police acted in defence of the liquor shops all of which were/are owned by the state government, then as now. During the state-wide protest, 60-year-old Sasi Perumal, a Gandhian and prohibition activist from Salem, died while carrying the message atop of a mobile tower in Kanyakumari district. That did not deter either the protestors or the government, which however promised the Madras high court to cut down on the number of shops in a gradual manner. This has not happened after a purportedly promising start. It is against this background that every liquor tragedy, hooch or otherwise, in the state has triggered a host of public demands for total prohibition -- only to die a natural death until the next one. The Kallakurichi tragedy is no different. The reasons are many but two of them need special mention and attention. One, it was in present day Tamil Nadu, C Rajagopalachari as the short-serving premier of the Madras Presidency (1937 to 1939) in the pre-Independence British Raj, introduced prohibition on a trial basis in his native, undivided, Salem district, and also parts of present day Andhra Pradesh that were then part of the presidency. It was the policy of the Indian National Congress to which he then belonged and also the personal wish of Gandhiji. The situation changed only after the DMK came to power, especially under the post-Annadurai regime of Karunanidhi. The government claimed that lifting of prohibition became necessary in the early 1970s as a short-term measure to shore up the state's revenues and also to check against hooch tragedies of the kind. Between then and now, the alternating governments of the DMK and breakaway AIADMK have kept blaming the other for the easing the liquor/prohibition policy, and for hooch tragedies, depending on whoever was in power at the time. This time round, it is the bane of the DMK and Stalin, so to say -- but none of them has found an alternative to 'liquor revenues' that have been mounting over the years and decades, and whose contributions to the state budgets too have been shooting up, year after year. The second and more important reason for the common man's desire for a liquor-free environment is the embarrassingly unique record of Tamil Nadu being the only state where the government runs liquor stops -- and the government alone runs liquor shops and bars -- other than those licensed in star-hotels. At least the AIADMK cannot escape the blame for Jayalalithaa as chief minister for 'nationalising' liquor procurement and sales through public sector TASMAC (the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation). For the past two decades, all liquor shops in the state are owned by TASMAC and all serious and pun-intended writing on drinks and the drunk refer to liquor shops only as 'Tasmac', whether in Tamil or English. Even while criticising Jaya for the nationalisation policy and the corruption it had led to -- like with sand-mining, also under her care -- successive DMK governments, including the present one, has done precious little to reverse or even alter the course. The question of total prohibition does not arise, as all political parties have come to believe that there is no alternative to revenue building. Ironically, rival state governments expend the most on social welfare schemes, especially targeting women and youth and children, but that money comes only by selling more liquor, especially to their own men-folk. There is always the specious plea, which has been peddled very many times in the past, that without licensed liquor, drinkers would go after hooch and there could be more hooch tragedies and hooch deaths. No one is convinced, but no one can dispute it either. Today, the situation is such that actor-politician Vijay, who launched the Tamizhaga Vetri Kazhagam earlier this year, with the promise to contest all 234 assembly seats in the 2026 elections, too has not talked prohibition, after visiting the Kallakurichi tragedy victims. Whether he will do it in the coming months, especially in his manifesto for the 2026 polls, too is a remote question. This despite the fact that many of his fans and expected voters are young to middle-aged women, whose livelihood and lifestyle is what hooch tragedies and liquor-flows, legal or otherwise, end up hurting, and beyond redemption and recovery.

They did not take a single article of the J&K constitution and merged it with the Indian Constitution. \"Had they done it, the people of Kashmir would have felt that the Government of India has taken something from our constitution too while abrogating Article 370,\" Sanjay Tickoo , president of the Kashmiri Pandits Sangharsh Samiti, tells Syed Firdaus Ashraf/ Rediff.com . The concluding segment of a three-part interview: Why has India not been able to win the hearts of Kashmiri Muslims? Nobody can win the hearts of Kashmiri Muslims by danda ( stick ). You have to accommodate them. You have to feel their pain. You cannot deny the human rights violation of State actors. And similarly, the majority of Kashmiri Muslims in Kashmir should not deny the human rights violation by non-State actors. We Kashmiris living in Kashmir are victims of both the State as well as non-State actors. But I see a very contrary Kashmir Valley to what you are saying. Youngsters are going to coaching classes. Unicorns like Physicswallah have arrived in Kashmir and the youngsters want peace. Kashmiri Muslims have always studied hard and this is true especially after 1990. They saw how Kashmiri Pandits survived outside the Kashmir Valley only because of their educational qualification. Taking that cue in every Kashmiri Muslim house, parents force children for education and they spend money on education. Therefore, you see these Allen and Physicswallah in Kashmir. Secondly, people only see Lal Chowk and Dal Lake where you see tourists and think that is normalcy. Normalcy does not come in that fashion, it comes from the heart. And let me tell you, Kashmiri Muslims will never ever forget the abrogation of Article 370. They can forget the killings, rapes but they will never ever forget the abrogation of Article 370. There was nothing in Article 370 but for me too as a Kashmiri, it was a privilege to be a Kashmiri in India because of Article 370. I had my own flag and my own constitution of J&K. The central government made only one mistake while abrogating Article 370. They did not take a single article of the J&K constitution and merged it with the Indian Constitution. Had they done it, the people of Kashmir would have felt that the Government of India has taken something from our constitution too while abrogating Article 370. They did not take anything from us, snatched away everything from us and imposed everything on us. What must India do to win the hearts of Kashmiris? They have given subsidies for so many years to J&K. India is giving subsidies to every state in the country. You cannot claim that India will become a number one economy by given 5 kg ration to 80 crore people. You cannot win hearts by the Ujjwala scheme. You will win my heart only when I feel I am safe in Kashmir and I have been accommodated by the central government. When India has failed Kashmiri Pandits, how can they win over Kashmiri Muslims? When Prime Minister Modi came for a rally in Kashmir in March 2024, why were government employees made to attend the rally compulsorily? Why did the BJP fail to get three candidates for parliamentary elections in Kashmir? The BJP claims they have eight lakh cadres in the Kashmir Valley so why can't they contest elections from Kashmir? I want to know the answer. The BJP has a reported tie-up with the Apni Party in Kashmir Valley so they did not put up their own candidates. At the end of the day, the lotus, which is the BJP's election symbol, will not bloom in the Kashmir Valley. You sound tired of everything that is happening in Kashmir today. Yes, because nothing is moving on the ground. Politicians are running the business in the Kashmir Valley now. In fact, everyone is doing business in Kashmir. Be it Kashmiri Pandits, Kashmiri Muslims, bureaucrats or name anybody. Everybody is doing business in Kashmir. And nobody is concerned about the future generation of Kashmiris who will live in Kashmir. Kashmiri Muslims are not endorsing the pain of Kashmiri Pandits and Kashmiri Pandits are not endorsing the pain of Kashmiri Muslims. In an ideal world they should have endorsed each other's pain on the international level. This would have given weightage as a Kashmiri. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) For the last four years since abrogation of Article 370, Kashmir-based political parties have been struggling to forge an alternate narrative to the one forcibly snatched from them. The BJP is bound to go hammer and tongs at them now that their armoury is reinforced with the Supreme Court judgment, notes Mohammad Sayeed Malik, the veteran commentator on Kashmir affairs. Linking the Supreme Court's momentous decision , finally burying the Kashmir-related Article 370, with its historical perspective, it becomes crystal clear that the Sheikh Abdullah-led Kashmiri leadership had been taken up the proverbial garden path by 'New Delhi' during the crucial period of negotiations over division of powers between the centre and the state during early 1950s. They fell for a tantalisingly wrapped package mistaking it for a prize-trophy. They made a fatal blunder: Not looking into the intrinsic worth of guarantees and commitments being gifted to them in return for popular endorsement of the state's accession to the Indian Union against the run of events on the subcontinent in 1947 and mobilising a popular uprising against the tribal invasion from Pakistan. The myth of the state's 'semi sovereign' status somehow lasted for 76 years until the apex court pricked the balloon and tersely ruled against its perpetuation. The court also held that Jammu and Kashmir ruler (Maharaja Hari Singh) had surrendered his sovereignty along with the accession, like rulers of other nearly 500 states. It held that the existence of J&K's separate constituent assembly (1951-1956) or its decisions were not binding on the President of India under whose authority Constitutional orders governing the state-Centre relationship were being issued from time to time. That is how J&K had sustained a separate constitution and a separate flag until August 5, 2019 when the BJP-ruled central government bulldozed it, downgraded the state and divided it into two separate Union Territories -- J&K and Ladakh. The Delhi Agreement of 1952, between Sheikh Abdullah and the central government was the first formal demarcation of authority between the Centre and J&K state. Sheikh Abdullah's dismissal from power and arbitrary arrest shortly thereafter (1953) permanently tilted the balance of power at the state's expense. Areas of central jurisdiction multiplied after Sheikh's exit and Article 370 became a virtual a one-way tunnel. This truth was reflected in the torrent of central laws extended to supposedly 'autonomous' J&K state. The Supreme Court's interpretation that Article 370 in relation to J&K had been conceived as a temporary/transitional mechanism 'in atmosphere of war' is, at the best, a partial fact. By the time Article 370 was evolved (1949-1950) the war atmosphere triggered by the tribal invasion had subsided and the constitutional mechanism for transfer of power from the maharaja to a popular government headed by Sheikh Abdullah had been meticulously put through. It was during this period that the state constituent assembly was elected, a framework of Centre-state relationship was being devised and socioeconomic measures of far reaching implications were being implemented under the constitutional/legal protection of Article 370. But for this legal safeguard the land reforms and other measures like protection of 'state subject' privilege could have been nullified through judicial intervention. Obviously, an arrangement intended to serve 'in war atmosphere' only couldn't have been stretched as far as Article 370 was to usher such far reaching changes across the board. Failure of the state leadership (1940s-1950s) to secure a permanent set of guarantees and rest assured with temporary/transitional commitments turned out to be fatal flaw when the arrangement was challenged legally and constitutionally. The Supreme Court's unanimous decision to bury the temporary/transitional Constitutional proviso after it had existed for over seven decades is unquestionable. Politically, the story is no less intriguing. It was no secret that after Sheikh's dismissal in 1953, even Jawaharlal Nehru was aiming at getting rid of Kashmir's special constitutional status. Whenever questioned, his favourite explanation used to be ' ghiste, ghiste ghis jaye ga ' (Article 370 will wear itself out through gradual wear and tear). The post-1953 torrential inflow of central laws into J&K rendered Article 370 virtually hollow from inside and its statutory existence was just nominal. No doubt even this hollow contraption served the political purpose of demarcating the nationalists from the separatists within the state's political format. Post-August 5, 2019, the mainstream part of the arena, broadly identified with the National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party and the Congress remains bereft of a marketable (alternative) political agenda, resulting in desertion and poaching by NDA-blessed new local outfits. The Gupkar Alliance was an expedient arrangement to tide over the immediate challenge faced by the beleaguered mainstream groups. Now that the Supreme Court verdict has removed that fig leaf they would be hard put to assemble some kind of politically saleable platform. Survival of the Gupkar Alliance itself is at stake now. Interestingly, for the last four years since abrogation of Article 370, Kashmir-based mainstream parties have been struggling to forge an alternate narrative to the one forcibly snatched from them. On the contrary, the Bharatiya Janata Party is bound to go hammer and tongs at them now that their armoury is reinforced with the Supreme Court's judgment and also its psychological advantage goes to them exclusively. The BJP is making no secret of its long-nursed ambition to get into power and rule the country's only Muslim-majority state/UT. That explains the unduly long delay in holding assembly polls even when conditions on the ground seem to be fairly suitable for holding assembly elections. Ironically, no one finds any issue with preparing to hold the 2024 parliamentary poll along with the rest of the country. But the hesitation to also go for the all-important assembly elections is being deflected under one pretext or another. For unexplained reasons, the Supreme Court has skirted the politically ticklish issue of downgrading J&K state and breaking it up into two Union Territories. 'We did not go into this issue' because the central government had vaguely committed to restoring J&K's statehood. It ought to have been addressed with the seriousness that it merits as it is of great emotional value to the people of the erstwhile state across the board. Their expectations were belied. The over 475 page court judgment relates, directly or indirectly, to numerous other issues which would continue to be debated for a long time to come. For instance, the proposal mooted by one of the five judges that a ' Truth and Reconciliation Commission ' be set up to go into post-1989 developments in Kashmir notably mass migration of the Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley and its possible resolution. It is a multi-layered multi-dimensional issue that has far defied attempts at resolution. Also it continues to feed communal rancour with ugly projections.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Such a course would require a Constitutional Amendment, requiring two-thirds majority in both Houses of Parliament. Even assuming that the INDIA combine comes to power next year, a two-thirds majority in the Lok Sabha could be way off the mark for them, observes N Sathiya Moorthy. It may no more be an election issue for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre as the party may want to believe and also want the nation to believe. But Monday's Supreme Court verdict upholding the abrogation of Article 370 can become a thorn in the flesh for the anti-BJP Opposition INDIA combine, beginning with their upcoming seat-sharing talks in Delhi on December 19. The reasons are not far to seek. The INDIA combine partners from J&K would want a unified stand against the abrogation despite the Supreme Court verdict. It they do not seek a review or a larger bench (for which the chances may be less than for the other), they may want the combine to swear by restoring status quo ante if they came to power. The J&K partners in the INDIA combine too know the complications, but they cannot but be seen as making the demand on the combine. The latter cannot be seen as side-stepping the same, either. The chances of the alliance appointing a high-level experts' committee and report back at the next meeting may be an immediate way out, but that is not going to end the agony in some, anguish in others and anxiety in a few more. The reasons are not far to seek. If the Samajwadi Party, for instance, took objection to the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's Lok Sabha member, Dr Senthil Kumar, branding the traditional 'Hindi belt' as a ' gaumutra belt' because it hurts majority Hindu sentiments across the country, especially in north India, it may have to agree to consider similar sentiments pervading a reopened discourse on Article 370. It pertains to 'Hindutva nationalism' of the BJP kind, which overlaps with the very same Hindu vote-bank of the BJP, whatever be the religious sentiments that influence the north Indian voter in public. If anything, even more than Hindu religious sentiments, at times centred on Ayodhya, where a Ram temple is being readied for consecration ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, Article 370 is both about Hindutva politics and national security. Or, that is the BJP-RSS narration that has found favour even outside the Hindi belt. The public mood over the Modi government's 'Surgical Strikes' on ISI-backed terrorist bases in Pakistan occupied Kashmir still prevails, even if to a lesser degree. Does the BJP as the ruling party have anything more to refurbish it all, is the question ahead of the Lok Sabha polls -- or, will one be required and justified? Until proved otherwise, even an INDIA combine will have to assume that the Congress will play a pivot role in the matter if it came to power. In government, the party will be torn between its commitment to Article 370 and the pragmatic approach to domestic and foreign policy hassles centred on the Kashmir issue. The former line will mean that it would be justifiably defending the Nehruvian legacy, which has become a source of criticism bordering on ridicule at the hands of the BJP rival through the past decades and more so in the past nine years of the Modi government. It will also be playing along with the continuing demand of the J&K allies. However in a pre-/post-poll scenario, what is the likely mood of other INDIA partners? Will anyone have any view other than restoration of the status quo ante ? Will either or both sides then want their views articulated first in the December 19 discussions, and then in a common INDIA poll manifesto, if it came to that? Independent of whichever party in an INDIA dispensation (if it came to that) gets the PM's post, home, external affairs and defence portfolios, their ideological position on the larger Kashmir issue, terrorism and larger national security and border disputes all would matter. For the Government of India as an institution, to revisit an already settled matter with every change of government is just not on, though other aspects of the issue may be considered and acted upon for its domestic dimensions. Of course, it can be argued that if the Modi government could abrogate Article 370, why can a successor government not restore the same? Then, of course, the new law and restoration too could be challenged in the Supreme Court, under a different set of facts and circumstances. There is a practical problem. Such a course would require a Constitutional Amendment, requiring two-thirds majority in both Houses of Parliament. Even assuming that the INDIA combine comes to power at the Centre next year, a two-thirds majority in the Lok Sabha could be way ofF the mark for them. In relative terms, it may be easier for the BJP, going by the past trends in 2014 and 2019 -- though there is a need to provide for 'anti-incumbency' in their case. Granted that the INDIA bloc can muster up a two-thirds vote in the Lok Sabha, what about the Rajya Sabha, where the BJP could hold the government hostage for a long time just as the rest were doing for the Modi government? It is difficult to imagine that non-INDIA, non-NDA parties will have a substantial number of seats in either House to be able to upset the apple-cart, as has been happening through the Modi regime. Still, the last-mile hiccup is this. As per precedents and court rulings, the creation of a new state by merging the present-day J&K and Ladakh, which were separated when Article 370 was abrogated, too may require a resolution from the legislatures of the two Union territories. Granting that there are going to be no elections there before the SC-fixed deadline of September 2024, the Government of India, through the good offices of the lieutenant governors (after sacking the present ones?), can choose that route to argue their case for getting a constitutional amendment passed without waiting for long. It is again theoretical, as to which will come first, the September elections or a two-thirds majority in the two Houses of Parliament? Or, neither of them in the immediate future? Yet, the Supreme Court has clearly ruled that Article 370 was only a 'transitional provision' due to 'war-time conditions' in J&K. So, restoration of the scrapped J&K Constitution earlier available under Article 370 may become unviable. Yet, re-merging the two Union Territories could still be a theoretical possibility -- a poor substitute, which the INDIA allies from those parts may be happy to do without. Under Article 3 of the Constitution, merger of two or more states/UTs or creation of two or three out one requires only the two Houses of Parliament pass a resolution by a simple majority. It does not tantamount to a Constitutional Amendment requiring two-thirds vote in the two Houses, as per Article 368. Better or worse, it may still be too early to predict this early the public mood in Buddhist-majority Ladakh for a re-merger.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'On hard cases like this one, the Supreme Court has only episodically stood against Parliament and the executive government.' 'I worry that this decision sets a precedent where President's rule is imposed in another state... and during the operation of President's rule, the state is fundamentally altered.' A month ago, on December 11, 2023, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Centre's decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, that bestowed special status upon the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The apex court also upheld the validity of the Union government's decision to carve out the Union Territory of Ladakh from the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, although it did not adjudicate upon the validity of the reorganisation of J-K into UTs. Holding that Article 370 was a temporary provision, the apex court ruled that J-K had no internal sovereignty and the concurrence of the state government was not required to apply the Indian Constitution to the state. Although the court held as invalid ( external link ) the Constitutional Order 272, that changed the meaning of 'J-K Constituent Assembly' to 'J-K Legislative Assembly' and 'J-K Government' as 'Governor', this conclusion did not affect the outcome of the judgment since it held that the recommendation of J-K Constituent Assembly was not necessary for the President to declare Article 370 as inoperative. Arghya Sengupta , founder and research director at the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, who also authored Hamīñ Ast: A Biography of Article 370 ( external link ), spoke to Rediff.com 's Utkarsh Mishra about the Supreme Court verdict against which several review petitions were filed on January 10, 2024. \"The Supreme Court is a largely conservative institution, interpreting a largely conservative Constitution. It was thus no surprise that it found a baseline of enhanced integration and unity underlying Article 370 and the overall relationship between J-K and India,\" says Sengupta. In your book Hamīñ Ast: A Biography of Article 370 , you wrote, 'Any justification that seeks to legitimise the nullification of Article 370 overlooks both the historical context of Article 370 as well as the legal text.' In this context, how do you see the Supreme Court's December 11, 2023 order in the case? Politically, four-and-a-half years after the nullification of Article 370 on the 5th and 6th of August, 2019, there was resignation to the fact that it is time for everyone to move on and chart a new future for Jammu and Kashmir. The judgment of the Supreme Court in the Article 370 matter appears to have done just that -- signalled to all parties that it is time to move on. Central to this moving on is its finding in the Chief Justice's judgment that the purpose of Article 370 was always to 'enhance Constitutional integration between the Union and the State of Jammu and Kashmir'. Once this was found to be the rationale for the provision, it is a logical inference that a move that ensures full and final integration of Jammu and Kashmir would be found wholly in line with that purpose. Yet, this is where the court fundamentally erred. The purpose of Article 370 was neither enhancing integration with India nor furthering autonomy of the state -- rather, if a single purpose is to be found ( that itself is a questionable premise, whether a provision is incapable of having more than one purpose ) it is that of collaboration -- that any decision on the future of the state of Jammu and Kashmir would have to be taken jointly by the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the people of the rest of India. That was both what the historical context of the formulation of Article 370 was as well as a plain reading of the legal text. The judgment of the Supreme Court turned both these on its head when it came to the conclusion it did. The Supreme Court held that the Constitutional Order 272, changing the meaning of 'J-K Constituent Assembly' to 'J-K Legislative Assembly' and 'J-K Government' to 'Governor' was invalid. Yet, it upheld the abrogation of Article 370, saying the recommendation of J-K Constituent Assembly was not necessary for the President to declare Article 370 as inoperative. How do you see it? And if the recommendation was not necessary, why did the government even go through the route of amending Article 367, it could simply have revoked the special status by a Presidential Order? The court's reasoning in this regard is curious and part of a larger trend of judgments from the Supreme Court where the foundations go in one direction and the conclusion in another. We found that in the case relating to Internet shutdowns in Kashmir, where the court waxed eloquent about the right to access the Internet being a fundamental right but failed to shape any meaningful remedy for the people of Jammu and Kashmir, leaving that decision ultimately in the hands of the Executive. Similarly in the marriage equality case, the court has written pages on the importance of equality and non-discrimination in the Constitutional framework, only to reject its applicability in that case. Something similar has happened here. The court has found that the substitution of the Constituent Assembly of J-K with the Legislative Assembly was bad in law because one cannot do indirectly ( through Article 367 ) what one cannot do directly ( through Article 370 ). That, in my view, is arguable, because the Union did have a strong case that now that the Constituent Assembly has not existed for over six decades, the voice of the people of Jammu and Kashmir is best represented by its legislators. The court strikes a republican blow by pointing out the distinction between a Constitution-making body and a legislative body and refuses to sanction this change. One would have expected such a court that places such stock on the will of the people to continue that strand of reasoning. But then in a curious turn, it completely negates the text of the provision itself that requires 'recommendation of the Constituent Assembly' for making any change to Article 370 and 'concurrence of the state government' for making any change to how the Constitution applies to J-K (in matters not in the original Instrument of Accession). This is not even how the Executive saw it! The basis for this is a classic case of circular logic. The recommendation of the Constituent Assembly is not needed because the effect of abrogation can also be achieved by an order applying all the provisions of the Constitution individually to J-K without modification. That order requires the concurrence of the state government. However, concurrence is only needed when the state constitution also needs to be amended. Since in this case, the state constitution also withers away, no concurrence is needed. Ergo, no recommendation is needed. I will explain this logic with a simple analogy -- you ask your barber to use a comb and a pair of scissors to cut your hair. The barber says, much to your dissatisfaction, that he can get the same result by using a hair clipper. When he goes to use the hair clipper, he finds that it is rusted and unclean. He now says that the hair clipper is rusted and unclean, so it is likely that the scissors too which were lying next to the clipper will be rusted and unclean and unfit for use. So he only uses a comb to cut your hair. Sounds bizarre that a barber can cut your hair with a comb alone? That's exactly how bizarre the logic is in saying that the President alone can nullify Article 370. This was a hard case and I can sympathise with the court trying to find a solution that is logically neat and practically workable. But it has sacrificed the former for the latter in a manner that is entirely disproportionate. The Supreme Court did not adjudicate upon the validity of the reorganisation of J-K into a Union Territory. However, it upheld the carving out of Ladakh as a Union Territory. Does that somehow contravene the provisions of Article 3? More important, does it open a Pandora's box where the Centre can undertake a similar exercise in any other state? It is understandable that the court did not get into the question of determining the legality of the reorganisation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The court has a doctrine that it does not answer academic questions and the assurance of the solicitor-general was that statehood would soon be restored rendering the question academic. The court could have kept this question open, but not adjudicating on it was a possible course for the court to take. I hope the solicitor-general remains true to his word, in keeping with the finest traditions of the court. Having taken this course, the court upholds the carving out of Ladakh as a UT because it states that the proviso to Article 3 that requires the views of the state legislature of J-K to be taken before a UT is created, is not applicable to this case. This is because the proclamation that imposed President's rule suspended the operation of the proviso. So no views have to be taken. I worry that this decision sets a precedent where President's rule is imposed in another state in the future, the same provision ( proviso to Article 3 ) is suspended, and during the operation of President's rule, the state is fundamentally altered in some way. The court could have prevented such a situation from arising in the future by either laying down this law as a matter of prospective overruling ( will not be permitted in the future ) or more boldly saying that the purpose of President's rule which is to restore Constitutional machinery in a state cannot entail changing that constitutional machinery to begin with. But it didn't do either. The Supreme Court ruled that the Constitutional set-up did not indicate that J-K retained sovereignty after acceding to the Union of India. It said that 'there was a clear absence in the constitution of Jammu and Kashmir to the reference of sovereignty and that the State of Jammu and Kashmir became an integral part of India is evident from Articles 1 and 370 of the Constitution of India'. But the constitution of J-K as well as the Presidential Order of 1954 clearly stated the way in which the Indian Constitution is applied to J-K. Why did the Supreme Court choose to ignore those provisions? This is a point on which there is a disagreement between the judgment of the Chief Justice and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul ( now retired ). The former holds that the state of J-K did not retain any internal sovereignty, whereas the latter holds that it did have the vestige of sovereignty, exercised through the Constituent Assembly of J-K. I think this question itself has been framed wrongly. It is not relevant for the determination of the case whether the state continued to have any sovereignty or not. Take any state in India -- it has the sole power to make laws on all matters in the State List. Do we say that the state is sovereign in these respects? No. That would be an odd way to describe the plenary powers of the state. Similarly, Article 370 and the fact of the constitution of J-K being formed by a Constituent Assembly of J-K should not be seen as elements of sovereignty or lack thereof. They need to be seen as part of a constitutional design of integration that mandated that it would take two hands to clap for the future of the state of J-K to be decided. Neither the Union of India nor the state of J-K alone was sovereign -- it was a case of collaboration, of joint action. Bringing sovereignty into the picture was conceptually confusing and did not take the judgment forward in any way. The court also said that 'Article 370 was a feature of asymmetric federalism and not sovereignty'. If that is so, shouldn't the abrogation of the Article go against the basic structure of the Constitution? What is the basic structure of the Constitution? It is what the court says it is. We know from Bommai's judgment that federalism is part of the basic structure of the Constitution. But what does federalism entail? Does doing away with asymmetries in the way in which the federal structure operates, violate the basic structure? There is no conclusive determination in the past from the Supreme Court on this matter. So there was no question of a basic structure violation in this case. However, in an essay in the festschrift to Nani Palkhivala, I had written that Article 370 itself had a basic structure -- that it would take two hands to clap. That was undone on 5th and 6th August 2019 in a manner not countenanced by the article. But as a conceptual matter, asymmetry in the federal arrangement is itself a fundamental feature of our Constitution. A symmetrically federal India was neither envisaged nor would it be conducive to the inherent diversity of our nation. A push for symmetry may end up creating more dissension than unity. You have explained in your book how in Md Maqbool Damnoo vs State of Jammu and Kashmir , the Supreme Court upheld they way in which explanations in Article 370 were changed to apply Article 249 of the Indian Constitution to the state. Do you think the court could have taken a different view in the present case? Overall, the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Article 370 case is a missed opportunity for the court. That opportunity was missed when the court failed to list the matter for four years, and it really points to why there must be greater transparency in allocation of cases by the Chief Justice of India. The judgment itself was on expected lines. On hard cases like this one, the Supreme Court has only episodically stood against Parliament and the executive government. On matters that are considered to be 'national interest' issues, it has never really been a bulwark of the kind people sometimes imagine it to be. To think that in the first place is to drink the Kool-Aid that has for long dominated scholarship about India in global academia. That has made everyone in the Indian legal system feel good about themselves, but is sadly far removed from the reality of inter-branch relations in India over time. The Supreme Court is a largely conservative institution, interpreting a largely conservative Constitution. It was thus no surprise that it found a baseline of enhanced integration and unity underlying Article 370 and the overall relationship between J-K and India. For now, we will all have to move on with this judgment as the law of the land. One can only hope that the scars will heal over time and J-K can again become ' hamin ast ' like Amir Khusro described it. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

The Joint CSIR-UGC-NET is a test conducted to determine eligibility for junior research fellowship and assistant professor and admission to PhD in science courses. The postponement comes two days after the National Testing Agency cancelled the UGC-NET examination within 24 hours of its conduct, saying the integrity of the exam had been compromised. \"The Joint CSIR-UGC-NET Examination June-2024 which was scheduled to be held between 25.06.2024 and 27.06.2024 is being postponed due to unavoidable circumstances as well as logistic issues. The revised schedule for the conduct of this examination will be announced later through the official website,\" the NTA said in a circular. Reacting to the development, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, in a post on 'X', said, \"Yet another NTA exam postponed. This time it is the CSIR-UGC-NET. Clearly, NTA has become Narendra's Trauma Agency for youth.\" The CSIR-UGC-NET exam is conducted twice a year -- June and December -- in five subjects, including Chemical Sciences, Earth, Atmospheric, Ocean and Planetary Sciences, Life Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, and Physical Sciences in computer-based format. It is accepted for admissions in all premier institutions offering PhD courses in these disciplines including IITs and Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) A sessions court in Pune on Friday granted bail to the father of the juvenile accused in one of the cases pertaining to the Porsche car crash in which two software professionals were killed in the city last month. The court also granted bail to five other accused, including the owner and managers of two bars, who were arrested for allegedly serving liquor to the underage patrons. On May 19, two IT professionals were killed in Kalyani Nagar here after their motorcycle was hit by a speeding Porsche car allegedly driven by the juvenile in an inebriated condition. The case caused a national uproar after the Juvenile Justice Board member L N Danwade gave bail to the accused on very lenient terms, including writing a 300-word essay on road safety. The police had registered three separate cases linked to the accident. The primary case pertained to the accident itself, while the other case involved the two bar establishments -- Cosie and Blak Club, as well as and the juvenile's father, who allowed him to drive the car despite knowing he had no valid license and that he was allegedly addicted to liquor. The case against the father and the bar owners and its staff was registered under sections 75 and 77 of Juvenile Justice Act and relevant sections of Motor Vehicle Act. While section 77 of JJ Act deals with supplying a child with intoxicating liquor or drugs, which was applicable to the owner and managers of the two bar establishments, section 75 of JJ Act pertains to punishment for cruelty to child. It applies to the father. As per the FIR, the juvenile's father, by giving him a car to drive, endangered his life. Advocate Prashant Patil, who represented the juvenile's father, confirmed that the court on Friday evening granted bail to him. The argument on his client's bail application took place 10 days ago, Patil said, adding he had told court section 75 of JJ Act is non cognisable and does not contain provision of arrest. While granting bail to the juvenile's father, court directed that he will abide by all conditions imposed on him and also cooperate with the police, Patil said. Adv S K Jain, who represented Pralhad Bhutda (owner of Cosie ), Sachin Katkar (manager of Cosie ) and Sandip Sangale, Nitesh Shevani and Jayesh Gavkar, all staffers at Blak Club Hotel, said the five had also been granted bail by the court. Jain said he argued in court that since section 77 of JJ Act is non-cognizable and there is nothing to be probed against his clients, they should be granted bail. The juvenile accused's father and mother are currently in judicial custody in the case pertaining to the alleged blood sample swamping of their son. Among those arrested in this case are Dr Ajay Taware, the then HOD of Forensic Medicine department of Sassoon General Hospital, Dr Shrihari Halnor, the chief medical officer of the hospital and staffer Atul Ghatkamble. Advocate Patil also said an application for bail for the juvenile's father and grandfather has been moved in the case pertaining to kidnapping and wrongful confinement of the driver. The argument will take place on June 25, he added. The juvenile is in an observation home till June 25. After he was given bail, police approached the JJB for a review of the decision amid national outrage. The JJB modified its order and sent the juvenile to an observation home.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The Centre on Friday operationalised a stringent law that aims to curb malpractices and irregularities in competitive examinations and entails provisions for a maximum jail term of 10 years and a fine of up to Rs 1 crore for offenders. Nearly four months after President Droupadi Murmu gave assent to The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, the Personnel Ministry on Friday night issued a notification, saying the provisions of the law will come into force from June 21. The move assumes significance amid a raging row over UGC-NET, 2024, exam's question paper leak. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday registered a case to probe the question paper leak of the exam conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA). Opposition parties have also alleged irregularities in the medical entrance exam NEET-UG, the results of which were announced by NTA on June 4. \"In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (2) of section 1 of the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024 (1 of 2024), the Central Government hereby appoints the 21st day of June, 2024, as the date on which the provisions of the said Act shall come into force,\" reads the notification. The notification of the Act comes just a day after Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan was asked when the legislation would be implemented. The minister had said the law ministry was framing the rules. The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Bill, 2024, was passed by the Rajya Sabha on February 9. The Lok Sabha passed it on February 6. President Murmu gave approval to the bill on February 12, turning it into a law. The Act aims to prevent unfair means in the public examinations conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), the railways, banking recruitment examinations and the National Testing Agency (NTA) among others. It has provisions for a minimum of three to five years of imprisonment to curb cheating and those involved in organised crimes of cheating will face five to 10 years of imprisonment and a minimum fine of Rs 1 crore. Before this legislation, there was no specific substantive law to deal with unfair means adopted or offences committed by various entities involved in the conduct of public examinations by the central government and its agencies. The Act is aimed at preventing organised gangs and institutions that are involved in unfair means for monetary gains and protects candidates from its provisions, Union Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh had said.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance's (INDIA) performance in Bihar in the Lok Sabha polls was affected as it made 'certain mistakes' there, including in ticket distribution, Communist Party of Indi-Marxist Leninist general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya has said. In an interview with PTI editors at the agency's headquarters, the Left party's leader did not rule out the 'Nitish Kumar factor' as also being a reason for the bloc's less than expected returns in the polls. Bihar Chief Minister Kumar's Janata Dal-United was in an alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal-Congress-Left 'Mahagathbandhan' grouping in Bihar and a constituent of the opposition INDIA bloc, but jumped to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) just before the 2024 general elections. The CPI-ML Liberation general secretary hoped INDIA bloc members the RJD, the Congress and Left parties, including his CPI-ML, will do better in the assembly polls in the state next year. While the BJP and its NDA partners JD-U, Lok Janshakti Party-Ram Vilas and Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular won 30 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state, the INDIA bloc could get nine. One was won by Independent candidate Pappu Yadav. The CPI-ML leader said in Purnea an Independent candidate -- Yadav -- won as the RJD refused to give the seat to the Congress. The CPI-ML had asked for the Siwan seat but the RJD fought from it and finished third with the JD-U winning it, said Bhattacharya, whose party won two seats -- Arrah and Karakat. \"Certain mistakes probably had a cascading effect. It affected a number of seats. To give you just one example in Purnea, Pappu Yadav has managed to win the seat. But it's unthinkable that an official candidate of the RJD holds less than 30,000 votes in this kind of a polarised election. The entire party throws the full weight behind that candidate,\" he said. Yadav had joined the Congress ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, but fought as an Independent after the RJD refused to give the seat to the Congress and fielded Bima Bharti, who could garner only 27,000 votes. \"Probably that has affected a whole number of seats, may be Araria, Supaul and Madhepura,\" Bhattacharya said. Likewise, the CPI-ML had a very legitimate and strong claim on Siwan and, \"I got the feedback from every source that with an ML candidate in the fray, we could have won Siwan\", he said. \"That could have probably ensured a number of seats in the southern commissionary -- Siwan, Chhapra and Maharajganj, may be even Gopalganj. So, these are some mistakes, probably avoidable mistakes, which cost us a few seats (in Bihar),\" Bhattacharya said. \"But more than that, I think we have to find out why we again couldn't do well in north Bihar. If you look at the assembly election results, our best performance was in south Bihar. Once again (in the Lok Sabha polls), our best performance has been in south Bihar,\" he said. Bhattacharya said but in north Bihar's Mithila, Champaran, Saran and Koshi, 'this is where I think, once again, the NDA has done much better\". \"So, we need to actually look at what really goes wrong there'. Not ruling out the 'Nitish Kumar factor', he said while it was expected that the JD-U or the Lok Janshakti Party-Ram Vilas may suffer losses and the BJP will remain unscathed, the results were different. \"It is the BJP that has suffered the biggest loss in Bihar,\" Bhattacharya said. In the 2024 polls, the BJP fought on 17 seats and won 12, down from 17 in 2019, while the JD-U contested on 16 seats this time and won 12, down from 16 in 2019. \"So, there are things where almost every pollster, including those who got UP right, didn't get Bihar right. Probably, it is the Nitish Kumar factor,\" he said. Asked about the INDIA bloc's expectations in the Bihar assembly polls next year, he said it is hopeful of a good performance. Bhattacharya pointed out that politics in Bihar is undergoing a generational change. \"So, a lot of work will have to be done to overcome this. Our next election, I do hope. Because Bihar is in a state of transition,\" he said. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Britain's wealthiest family, the Hindujas, have said they were 'appalled' by a Swiss court's ruling of jail terms for some members and have filed an appeal in a higher court challenging the verdict finding them guilty of exploiting vulnerable domestic workers from India at their villa in Geneva. In a statement issued on behalf of the family on Friday, lawyers from Switzerland stressed their clients -- Prakash and Kamal Hinduja, both in their 70s and their son Ajay and his wife Namrata -- had been acquitted of all human trafficking charges. They also dismissed media reports that any members of the family faced detention after court reports from Geneva said the four were sentenced to between four and four-and-a-half years in prison. 'Our clients have been acquitted of all human trafficking charges. We are appalled and disappointed by the rest of the decision made in this court of first instance, and we have, of course, filed an appeal to the higher court, thereby making this part of the judgement not effective,' reads the statement signed by lawyers Yael Hayat and Robert Assael and Roman Jordan. 'Under Swiss law, the presumption of innocence is paramount till a final judgement by the highest adjudicating authority is enforced. Contrary to some media reports, there is no effective detention for any members of the family,' they said. The lawyers also pointed out that 'it should also be recalled that the plaintiffs in this case had withdrawn their respective complaints after declaring to the court that they had never intended to be involved in such proceedings'. 'The family has full faith in the judicial process and remains confident that the truth will prevail,' they conclude. The statement followed a hearing in the Swiss city of Geneva after prosecutors opened the case for alleged illegal activity, including exploitation, human trafficking and violation of Switzerland's labour laws. The family members were accused of seizing the workers' passports, barring them from leaving the villa and forcing them to work very long hours for a pittance in Switzerland, among other things. Some workers allegedly spoke only Hindi and were paid their wages in rupees in banks back in India that they could not access. During the trial, prosecutors alleged the family spent more on their dog than on their servants. The family's legal team had countered the allegations and told the court the staff were treated respectfully and provided with accommodation. According to 'The Sunday Times Rich List' released last month, the United Kingdom-based Hinduja family once again emerged as the country's richest, with wealth estimated at around GBP 37.196 billion. They saw this tally increase over the previous year in the wake of the opening of the brand-new luxury OWO Raffles Hotel in the heart of London. The UK-based family's group of companies, headed by chairman G.P. Hinduja, operates in 48 countries and across several sectors -- automotive, oil and specialty chemicals, banking and finance, IT, cyber security, healthcare, trading, infrastructure project development, media and entertainment, power, and real estate.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The son of Union Agriculture Minister and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has said that after the landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections, 'entire Delhi is bowing down' before his father. Chouhan's son Kartikeya Singh made the statement while addressing a public meeting at Bherunda of Budhni assembly segment of Sehore district, on Friday. The video of the remark is being shared by the leaders of different parties. Chouhan won the recently-held Lok Sabha election from Vidisha seat in the state. State Congress chief Jitu Patwari took a swipe at this statement, saying that it means that Delhi is scared and that there is fear of dissent within the party. In his address, Singh told the people of Budhni assembly seat that they have done a wonderful job of sending a message. \"I have just returned after staying in Delhi. Earlier too, our leader (Chouhan) was popular as chief minister. But I don't know why it seems that he became more popular when he was not the chief minister,\" he said. \"Now, when our leader has gone after a huge victory, the whole of Delhi also bows down before him today. Entire Delhi also knows him, recognises him, respects him. Not just Delhi, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari if we count the top leaders then our leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan figures in the list,\" he said. Kartikeya Singh, an alumnus of University of Pennsylvania of US, also thanked the people of Budhni constituency supporting his father in the elections. \"It is said that there is a woman behind every successful man...But I will say that there are people in his area behind the success of a leader along with a woman,\" he said. Taking a swipe at Kartikeya Singh over his statement, Congress' Patwari said in a post on X, \"Shivraj ji's yuvraj (prince) is saying that Delhi is scared. This is 100% true. Because, the country is also watching the scared dictator carefully.\" \"There is fear of the voice of dissent within the party, rebellion of big leaders, coalition management, decreasing support to government and fear of shaking legs of the chair,\" he stated. After winning the Vidisha Lok Sabha seat by a margin of over 8.20 lakh votes, Shivraj Singh Chouhan was appointed as the agriculture minister in the Narendra Modi 3.0 cabinet. After winning the Lok Sabha election from the Vidisha seat, Chouhan resigned as an MLA from the Budhni assembly seat. It is likely that the bypoll for Budhni will soon be declared and Kartikeya Singh, being the son of Shivraj Singh Chouhan, is considered to be the natural choice for the BJP.

The development comes amid opposition parties objecting to the appointment of Bhartruhari Mahtab as the pro tem Speaker. Mahtab, a Bharatiya Janata Party member from Cuttack, Odisha was appointed as pro tem Speaker by President Droupadi Murmu under Article 95(1) of the Constitution to perform the duties of the Lok Sabha presiding officer till the election of the Speaker on June 26. A panel of chairpersons was also announced to assist the pro tem Speaker during the special session of Parliament for members of the new Lok Sabha to take oath. Sources from the opposition parties said the three opposition MPs -- Congress leader K Suresh, Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay, and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader T R Baalu -- who have been nominated to assist the pro tem Speaker are considering not being part of the panel. BJP members Radha Mohan Singh and Faggan Singh Kulaste are also part of the panel. Several Congress leaders have raised objections to Mahtab's appointment to the post even as K Suresh has served more terms in the House. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said Mahtab was picked because he has the longest uninterrupted tenure as a member of the Lower House. Rijiju said Suresh, though an eight-term MP, was not a member of the Lok Sabha in 1998 and 2004 and hence did not have an uninterrupted tenure in the lower house of Parliament. The Congress has accused the government of 'destroying parliamentary norms' by choosing seven-term MP Mahtab as pro tem Speaker instead of eight-term member Suresh.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The Bihar Police's Economic Offences Unit, which is probing the alleged National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Undergraduate) (NEET-UG) paper leak case, on Saturday claimed to have obtained reference question papers of the test conducted by National Testing Agency (NTA) and planned to compare these with documents recovered from a flat in Patna during a search operation last month. The EOU is also exploring the 'possibility of conducting narco analysis and brain mapping tests' of some arrested accused in the case, state police sources said. They also indicated that the Enforcement Directorate might investigate the money laundering aspect of the alleged irregularities in the medical entrance examination NEET, conducted by the NTA in May. \"We had requested the NTA for the reference question papers after we began the probe last month. Finally, they did the needful. We will tally these papers with partially burnt papers seized from a Patna flat last month. This exercise is likely to be done before a forensic examination of such documents,\" an EOU source said. Top officials of the EOU are likely to visit Delhi on Saturday to 'discuss certain aspects pertaining to the ongoing probe with the senior officials of the Union Education Ministry and other concerned wings', he said. \"Based on EOU's FIR, the Enforcement Directorate may probe the matter under the relevant sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The central agency is expected to identify proceeds of crime and initiate proceedings to attach properties belonging to the accused or suspects,\" said another source of the Economic Offences Unit. Commenting on this, Abhayanand, former director general of police (DGP), Bihar, told PTI , \"There is no doubt that grave offences have been committed in the NEET-UG 2024 exam. Prima facie, it appears that the paper was leaked evidence collected so far is also suggestive of the paper leak. The case must be probed under the provisions of the PMLA as black money is involved in it.\" It is also learnt that certain arrested accused in the case are 'providing conflicting statements or changing their statements during interrogation', the EOU sources said. \"Investigators are not satisfied with the statements of certain accused. Although they have been questioned several times, their replies are not convincing. Now officials are contemplating conducting brain mapping and narco-analysis tests. These scientific tests may provide certain fresh leads to investigators,\" one of the EOU sources said. The EOU had last month arrested 13 people as part of its investigation into the alleged paper leak in NEET-UG 2024 exam. ***** 6 held from Jharkhand's Deoghar The Bihar Police detained six people from Jharkhand's Deoghar district in connection with the alleged irregularities in NEET, an official said on Saturday. They were detained from a house near AIIMS-Deoghar in Devipur police station area on Friday night, he said. \"The Bihar Police gave us a tip-off. On our identification, they were taken into custody. All the suspects have been taken to Bihar,\" SDPO (Deoghar Sadar) Ritvik Srivastava told PTI . The suspects were allegedly living at the house of one Jhunu Singh, he said. They were identified as Paramjit Singh alias Bittu, Chintu alias Baldev Kumar, Kaju alias Prashant Kumar, Ajit Kumar, Rajiv Kumar alias Karu, all residents of Nalanda district of Bihar, and Panku Kumar, according to a statement issued by the Deoghar Police.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'It's such a mishmash of wonderful things, so many different cultures, subsections of society and weird histories.' UK-based artist-turned-film-maker Karan Kandhari was one of the first-time directors celebrated at the recent Cannes Film Festival. His film Sister Midnight , starring Radhika Apte, opened in the festival's Directors' Fortnight sidebar. In Sister Midnight , a quirky, at times deliciously funny and dark comedy, Apte plays Uma, a newly-married bride who moves to Mumbai to live with her husband Gopal (Ashok Pathak) in a small room by the side of the road. The marriage is in trouble from the beginning. Uma knows nothing about maintaining a home or cooking. The husband is almost always drunk and afraid of initiating sex. As time passes, Uma reveals her dark desires which give the film a wildly crazy twist. Apte is a delight to watch in the film. Screen Daily referred to Apte as 'sensational' in its review of the film. Born in Kuwait and educated in the UK, Kandhari uses an eclectic mix of world music in the film, including Cambodian songs from the 1960s. In another unconventional film-making style, he marries live-action with stop-motion puppets used for animals. While Sister Midnight has one Indian producer on board, Alex McAlex ( Kila ), and the Amazon Prime Web series Poacher ), the film is mostly funded by Film4 and the BFI. Recently, Anurag Kashyap and Resul Pookutty pointed out that nearly all the Indian films that played at Cannes this year, including the Grand Prix winner All We Imagine As Light , were funded from outside the country. The Indian government and film production houses gave no support to these films. Aseem Chhabra spoke to Kandhari a day after the film's premiere at Cannes, and there were two things he mentioned before the interview: \"Please be gentle with me\" and \"I am a little hungover from last night.\" He added: \"I don't live in India. The film happened to be set there. I am obviously Indian but I don't know much about the industry there or anything. So I am a bit of an outsider.\" Karan, even as an outsider, the film gives a feeling that you have a keen sense of life in Mumbai. I visited Bombay about 20 years ago, just after art school. I didn't really know the city. It has an intoxicating personality. It's such a mishmash of wonderful things, so many different cultures, subsections of society and weird histories. All these things clashing with each other that somehow it works. I was not being able to get the city out of my head. That was the initial seed for the film. The character then came to me but then it took another 10 years before that sort of wordless moment pops in your head. And then, it took another 10 years to get the film made. Can you talk about casting Radhika Apte? She's amazing in the film and I have never seen her this animated, this much fun. She's doing comedy, but it's not laugh-out-loud kind of comedy. How did you direct her? I was struggling for five years to find the right actor. I tried to look at films and TV shows to see who could do the role of Uma. I couldn't find anyone, until someone suggested I should meet Radhika Apte. So I checked a clip and as I was watching it, I was like, 'Oh my God, this woman is fearless.' I didn't look at anything else. I was already sold and based on that, we sent her the script. I was a little nervous when I went to meet her because if she had said no, I don't think I could have made the film. She was talking about stuff, all the things she was doing. She was scuba diving at that time. Then she just said, 'Yeah, I loved it. I want to do it.' So she was attached to the film for five years and we got to know each other. We would talk around the film because many times, it was about to get made and then it got delayed. When it got to actually doing the film, we did a lot of rehearsals. It started with just Radhika and me. She's obviously a prolific performer and has her own process. She has a very clear idea of how to work. Her approach was very intellectual, while I was trying to get her to be in the present because the film is very behavioral and has its own strange rhythm. Once she got it, she said, 'My God, I have never acted like this.' Radhika was so trusting, fearless and willing to be as silly as the film needed her to be. Was it difficult for Radhika since she has very few dialogues? For Radhika, it was very liberating. The role is made for her. What about your other cast members? I know you worked with Dilip Shankar for casting. But how did you find the supporting cast, especially Smita Tambe, Chhaya Kadam (both play Uma's neighbours) and Ashok Pathak? I call Dilip, Detective Shankar, because he works like a detective. I was looking for actors who could leave their intellect at the door and crawl into my strange way of doing things. So we saw lots of people. It was a drawn-out audition process, working through scenes together and trying to find actors who could slip into that humour and rhythm because it is a strange way to perform and not everyone is going to click into it. Tell us about the music you selected for the film. I have an amazing music supervisor who's worked with me since my shorts. She's my secret weapon. Her name is Chloe Savage. I don't have an intellectual answer for the choice of music. It was literally in my head as I was writing the film. So we pre-cleared everything. I think the best way I can describe the music is there is a playfulness in the way we juxtaposed things -- listening to Motorhead while Uma is running down a shack, or towards the end of the film, cutting to the Buddhist monastery with nuns and you have a Marty Robbins cowboy ballad playing. It just felt right. Also, it wasn't a conscious decision but we don't use any Indian music. I was listening to this beautiful Cambodian soul music from the 1960s which to me, shared a similar vocal style to Indian music. The film, in a sense, is a weird cultural collage. It's interesting when you said there is no Indian music. It just felt right. The Cambodian stuff, when it plays in the West and people can't identify it, because all of this culture belongs to the world. Why not mix it up? Was the animation there from the beginning? It was always in my mind that the animals should not be real. I wanted something that was slightly askew. Stop motion animation inherently has that quality, so you don't need to push it. Also, I am not a fan of things done digitally. A lot of the film is handmade and you can't fake light-hitting physical fur or feathers. So it was very important to have that tangible quality. What I like about the film is that while it is set in India and the actors are Indian, it is not an Indian film. The ethos and the mood is from everywhere. I am Indian but I think it's restrictive to say you are an Indian film-maker or a UK film-maker. This is the only other story I have in India. The next one is about a woman from North Shields, and it's partially set in Stavanger and Bergen ( both in Norway ), and then in Berlin. That is all I can say. I can tell you what it's called because I only seem to be able to think of movie titles that are based on Iggy Pop songs. Sister Midnight is named after an Iggy Pop song, and the next is called A Heartful of Napalm which comes from the Stooges and Iggy Pop lyrics for the song Search And Destroy . ( I'm a streetwalking cheetah with a heartful of napalm/I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb). Why Iggy Pop? He's my hero. I listen to a lot of music as I am writing. It's not necessary that music makes it into the film. I was also listening to Leonard Cohen and Patti Smith. And a lot of Bob Dylan. There's a sequence towards the end of film, when Radhika's character is being hunted by a mob. She jumps off the roof and this lightning strikes. A couple of minutes later, two electricians cut the wires the wrong way. They think she is a goddess. That came from Bob Dylan song called Drifter's Escape and it goes: Just then a bolt of lightning/ Struck the courthouse out of shape/ And while everyone knelt to pray/The drifter did escape. Are there any film-makers who have influenced you? Yes, John Walters, ( Jean-Pierre ) Melville, ( Yasujir≈ç ) Ozu. That's quite a span of film-making. Ozu was a big thing for me when I was younger. I learned the ability to observe and be still and humour also. Look at Good Morning about the two kids who go on a silence strike because they want their parents to buy them a television set. It is really funny. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) ' Sabra ka phal meetha nahi, Mirzapur 3 hota hai .' 'With Mirzapur 3 , we take the narrative to a whole new level.' The game for the Mirzapur throne is about to get more exciting in the third season of the highly anticipated Web series. To make the announcement of this power battle, Kaleen Bhaiya and Guddu Pandit had a face-off on Thursday, June 20, 2024, afternoon. Pankaj Tripathi, who plays the dreaded Kaleen Bhaiya , and Ali Fazal whose violent turn as Guddu, will power Mirzapur 3 , took centre-stage at the event. Other members of the cast -- Shweta Tripathi Sharma, Rasika Dugal, Vijay Varma, Anjum Sharma, Isha Talwar, Priyanshu Painyuli and Sheeba Chadha -- were also present. Mayur Sanap/ Rediff.com brings back some interesting tidbits from the launch. \"Wherever I go,\" says Co-Producer Farhan Akhtar, \"people ask me only three questions: One is, What are you doing here? Second is, When will Don 3 release? And third, When will Mirzapur 3 come? So I'm very happy that the show is finally happening.\" Mirzapur 's first season began streaming in 2018 to a critical reception, followed by Season 2 in 2020. So what happens next? The cast mostly remained tight-lipped but Ali Fazal disclosed that his character Guddu goes to extreme ends. \"I know I have justified a graph for this particular boy, who at the essence of it all, holds his innocence despite so much corruption around him,\" says Ali who garnered much national attention in Mirzapur 's first season before making waves overseas. \"A young boy, almost at an impressionable age, gets turned into all kinds of demons because of the circumstances in society, and he becomes what he becomes,\" says Ali. \"So yes, it has taken a lot out of me. I will always cherish it.\" The actors reveal what to expect in Season 3 \"In the first season,\" says Shweta Tripathi Sharma, \"Golu was a rasgulla . In the second season, she was an aag ka gola . In the third season...she is a bomb.\" Addressing the popularity of his character Kaleen Bhaiyya , Pankaj Tripathi says, \"We are just puppets, they are the masters. We only read lines that are given to us and we enact our characters to the best of our capability. If the show is successful, it is because of the fantastic team of all the creative people working on it.\" Vijay Varma gives us his spin to the story: \"Revenge is the main thing.\" So what can fans expect from Season 3? Director Gurmmeet Singh shares that the theme is \"relentless\" and the long wait for the show will be worth it when audiences watch it on Amazon Prime Video beginning July 5. \"We are excited as our audience who waited for three-and-a-half years for this new season,\" he says. \" Sabra ka phal meetha nahi, Mirzapur 3 hota hai . The stakes have gone notches higher and the canvas has surely become bigger. With Mirzapur 3 , we strive to build on the momentum and take the narrative to a whole new level,\" says Gurmmeet.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Virat Kohli, the iconic Indian batter celebrates his 35th birthday on Saturday. From his early days, leading India to an U19 World Cup victory in 2008 and making his international debut the same year, Kohli has consistently dominated headlines with his extraordinary batting prowess. Throughout his career, he has broken records, chased runs, and single-handedly won matches, earning a place among the cricketing greats. In Test cricket, Kohli has represented India in 111 matches, amassing 8,676 runs at an average of 49.29, including 29 centuries and 29 fifties, with his best score being an impressive 254*. He ranks as India's fifth-highest Test run-scorer, with Sachin Tendulkar holding the top position at 15,921 runs. Kohli's Test century count places him fourth among Indian batsmen and within the top 10 worldwide. Kohli stands out as India's most successful Test captain, leading the team to 40 wins, 17 losses, and 11 draws in 68 matches. His captaincy saw India clinch five successive ICC World Test Championship maces, consistently ending as the top-ranked side for five consecutive years. Under his leadership, India developed one of the most formidable Test pace attacks in history, featuring bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma, and Mohammed Siraj. In One Day Internationals (ODIs), Kohli's performance is nothing short of extraordinary. In just 288 ODIs, he has scored 13,525 runs at an astonishing average of 58.04, with 48 centuries and 70 half-centuries in 276 innings. His best score in ODI is 183. Currently, he stands as the fourth-highest ODI run-scorer worldwide and the second-highest for India, trailing only Sachin Tendulkar, who holds the record at 18,426 runs in 463 matches. Kohli is now chasing Sachin's record of 49 ODI centuries and 18,426 runs, and his exceptional fitness and form suggest he has a good chance of achieving this milestone. In ODI chases, he is a true ‚ÄòChase-Master‚Äô, amassing 7,794 runs at an average of 65.49 in 159 matches, with 27 centuries and 40 fifties. During successful run-chases, he has scored 5,786 runs at a jaw-dropping average of 90.40 in 102 matches, including 23 centuries and 25 fifties in 96 innings. Kohli is also the fastest to reach milestones from 8,000 to 13,000 ODI runs. In T20 Internationals (T20Is), he has scored 4,008 runs in 115 matches and 107 innings at an average of 52.73, including one century and 37 fifties, with his best score being 122*. He stands as the highest run-scorer in T20Is and has received numerous 'Man of the Match' (15) and 'Man of the Series' (seven) awards in the format. As a T20I captain, he has led India in 60 matches, securing 30 wins and maintaining a remarkable win-loss record. When we consider Kohli's overall international career, he has participated in 514 matches, accumulating 26,209 runs at an average of 54.03, with his best score being 254*. He has an incredible 78 centuries and 136 half-centuries in international cricket, making him the fourth-highest run-scorer worldwide and the second-highest for India, with Sachin Tendulkar topping the list at 34,357 runs in 664 matches. Kohli is known for thriving on the big stages and holds the distinction of being the only player to score 3,000 runs in ICC white-ball events. In 33 Cricket World Cup matches, he has scored 1,472 runs at an average of 54.51, with three centuries and 10 fifties. He is the fourth-highest run-scorer in the tournament's history. In T20 World Cups, Kohli tops the charts, scoring 1,141 runs in 27 matches and 25 innings at an impressive average of 81.50, with 14 fifties. A remarkable stat about Kohli's T20I batting is his exceptional performance in successful run-chases, where he averages 518 in nine matches, with seven fifties and just one dismissal. He has been a key factor in India's T20 World Cup successes. In ICC Champions Trophy matches, Kohli has scored 529 runs in 12 innings across 13 matches, boasting an average of 88.16, with his best score being 96, and accumulating five half-centuries. In 73 ICC event matches across 70 innings, he has scored 3,142 runs at an average of 66.85, with three centuries and 29 fifties. Kohli was a vital part of the Indian team that won the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, solidifying his legacy as a champion on the international stage. In the Indian Premier League (IPL), Kohli dons the colours of the Royal Challengers Bangalore. With 7,263 runs in 237 matches at an average of 37.24, he is the highest run-scorer in IPL history. His seven centuries hold the record for the most IPL tons. His incredible tally of 973 runs in 16 matches during IPL 2016, which included four centuries and seven half-centuries at an average of 81.08, remains a peak achievement in T20 cricket by an Indian. Kohli's accolades extend beyond the playing field. He was honoured as the ICC Men's Cricket of the Decade for 2011-2020 and has received two ICC Player of the Year awards, three ICC ODI Player of the Year awards, and one Test Player of the Year award. In 2018, he received India's highest sporting honour, the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award, cementing his status as a sporting legend. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'I would put my hand in the ground and have a little listen to what the mountain was doing.' 'Actually, it was still collapsing.' 'And there was a very real possibility that at some stage, without warning, the collapse could continue -- and continue across us, the people who were doing the rescue and also across to the men on the other side, who were being rescued.' Tunnelling professional Professor Arnold Edward Dix , 59, has just returned from his daughter's school in Monbulk, a farming town in the shadow of the Dandenong mountains, 42 km from Melbourne, in Victoria, Australia, where he spent about an hour recounting a Christmas story to her classmates. It was a true Christmas story. Not an imaginary one. His tale had nothing to do with grinches, nutcrackers, carols, a Polar Express, sugarplums or snowmen. It was a story of hope. A tale that showed \"We all might be different people, but in the end we all just want the best for our kids.\" A story with the message that \"Good People can do Kind Things, Great Things.\" Cheerful Dix, who looks and sounds a bit like a twinkle-eyed Santa himself, recounted a miraculous Christmas story about the wonderful rescue of 41 young men in Uttarakhand's Silkyara tunnel , without any loss of life, that illustrated, according to him, how we are all little people contending with the \"big forces\" out there, but we just have to stay positive, work together to find solutions. Like all tales with a universal message, it found instant resonance in faraway Australia and the children loved it. They cheered and clapped at the end of it. Ever since Dix got involved as a volunteer with the nail-biting Himalayan tunnel rescue, he, along with the rat miners Feroz, Munna, Rashid, Irshad, Naseem, Monu, Naseer, Ankur, Jatin, Devender, Saurabh, Waqeel, Hasan, have become international stars. He returned to a hero's welcome in Australia, with the country's prime minister, Anthony Albanese taking time out in parliament to celebrate him. He has been feted and interviewed wherever he went. The underground expert collected a tonne of Indian hearts when he was spied, tikka on his forehead, praying at a mountain shrine of Baba Boukhnag, heartily tucking into Indian vegetarian food and gamely and readily immersing himself, even spiritually, in our culture. Dix is quick to confess that the time he spent in Silkyara in the depth of the majestic, mysterious Himalayas was a soul-altering experience for him, where he learnt different, eccentric styles of problem solving, an alternative flabbergasting culture of management and about a kind of resilience, kindness and concern for human life he had not encountered before, that touched him deeply. A geologist and legal expert, who earned both his degrees at Monash University, Clayton, Australia, with various visiting professorships, Dix belongs to a not very large community of specialists in tunnelling, with his key area being troubleshooting and helping governments and he is the president of the Geneva-based International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association. \"I've never been in the midst of a process where it felt like India, as a country, all its agencies, the military and everything, had all got together and said, 'We're going to save the lives of these 41 men'. That was quite an experience,\" he tells Rediff.com 's Vaihayasi Pande Daniel in the first of a multi-part, exclusive, interview. What was it like coming to India and helping with this rescue? It made you quite a star. How has the entire experience changed you? What was your takeaway? Oh, that's an interesting ( question ). I found the whole experience almost enlightening. I know, it sounds a bit odd. I was really struck by the sophistication and maturity of the Indian sense of justice and fairness and of the value of a human life. I don't know if I'd really fully appreciated that before. I'd certainly seen how you shouldn't jump on ants or kill things and what have you. But I've never been in the midst of a process where it felt like India, as a country, all its agencies, the military and everything, had all got together and said, 'We're going to save the lives of these 41 men'. That was quite an experience. It's unlike what I find in many countries, when people are in trouble. They're not superstars. They're not Bollywood stars. They're not super-rich people. They're just like normal, hardworking people. And yet, the whole country just rallied around and ( said ) 'We're going to bring these kids home'. I really liked that. I found that a very high form of civilisation, a high form of humanity. I enjoyed being part of it. I understand it was quite a journey for you to get to the site of the tunnel collapse? Diwali started for me in New Zealand. I had the first call, after the incident, when I was in New Zealand. Then I got called when I was in Germany. I had something to do there. It was a bit urgent. Finally, when things weren't going so well, I was in Ljubljana, Slovenia. That's when the secretary and the chief engineer ( India's ministry of road transport and highways ) said to me, 'Look, can you get here?' Actually, it was quite hard to get there. I was in a kind of a remote part of Europe. You wouldn't think Europe has a remote part. It was like: 'Oh, yeah, we don't have a plane going today. But we've got one tomorrow' and then I had to get connections from Slovenia to the Middle East and a plane from the Middle East to, I think, Mumbai, from Mumbai, I had to get to Delhi and then from Delhi to Dehradun. From there, it was pretty easy because there was a helicopter. That was pretty cool. You arrived at the site on November 19 by helicopter? Yeeeaah! Which was fantastic. Because my name is Arnold. This was like what Arnold Schwarzenegger does in one of those movies. I got no muscles. I got no guns, but it was awesome to actually come into the Himalayas on, I think, a military helicopter. That was pretty much like a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Who was the person who contacted you first? The first person to contact me was India's chief engineer, Mr Gupta ( Rahul Gupta, Chief Engineer, MoRTH, New Delhi ). We just discussed strategies in the beginning. And then the next ( conversations ) were with him and the secretary of the whole federal department ( Anurag Jain ). The secretary then asked me to come. I said, 'Yes, of course'. It was as uncomplicated as that. He had an emergency, and we just kind of help each other like 'You're my friends'. It could have been my kids ( Australian underground workers ) who were stuck in there, because my kids also work in tunneling. I was like, 'Of course, I will come'. Of course, I just came as quick as I could. Did you get to know the 41 men after they were pulled out? It was a funny thing. Yes and no. A little bit. So, what happened was I was meant to, in fact, I was told immediately after they were pulled out ( on November 28, 17 days later ), I was to go to a helipad and get flown back to Delhi. I just felt that I had unfinished business. I kind of didn't do what I was told. Not kind of. I didn't do what I was told. And I snuck off with the SDRF rescue men ( State Disaster Response Force ). I was to be at the helipad. But actually, I ran off and went up the mountain where the main temple is for the god for that particular mountain. I had the best day but unfortunately, I made a lot of people a bit annoyed with me because a helicopter was waiting, and I never came. I thought I'd told them, but apparently my message didn't get through. They were a bit worried that maybe I'd fallen off a cliff or any of all the sorts of things that happen when you're in the Himalayas. The good news about all of that was: Even though I missed my helicopter, even though I had a great day up the mountain, even though that meant I couldn't get a helicopter so I had to get a car, even though that then delayed me another day, even though I missed my flight... But the flight that I did get had a whole heap of the men I rescued on it! They were on the flight with me, and we were all seated together. Actually, I had the best time. We all introduced ourselves to each other. And it was a really wonderful experience. It was obviously just meant to be. The funniest thing was the airline had put them in the exit rows. I thought that was really funny, next to the little door on the airplane. They'd never been on a plane before. When the airline hostess comes down to tell us like, 'Are we prepared to use the doors in an emergency?' I just start laughing. Like, I was telling the air hostess, 'Don't you know who these guys are? These guys have just burrowed out of a Himalayan mountain through a million tonnes of rock. You can assume that they're going to be able to open a little door onto the wing'. But the airline lady, she's getting angry with me. It doesn't matter how many times she tells me to shut up, I just keep on laughing at her and thinking it's very, very, funny. Anyway, so eventually I had to behave myself. Eventually they agreed that they would use the emergency door if in the unlikely event of an accident, blah blah blah. We said farewell in Delhi, and sort of wished each other goodbye. It was wonderful. It was a really charming and fitting end to an epic -- an epic rescue of almost god-like proportions. I couldn't have couldn't have written the story better than this reality. It was just fantastic. WATCH: Arnold Dix with members of the Silkyara rescue team The Australian prime minister was talking about how you went into the Uttarakhand tunnel and your wife was very scared that you might get trapped inside. What was it like on a day-to-day basis inside there? Well, it's a mountain. It's collapsing. So, we had the initial collapse. Speaking as an engineer now, and as a tunnel expert, it was quite clear from all the data that we were getting -- data from drone-based LIDAR surveys, from satellite LIDAR surveys, from traditional on-the-ground surveys -- that everything was still moving. We increasingly had data from the site, where the men were trapped, showing us that the roof was collapsing, particularly on the left side. So, we had collapse occurring on the left side, on the side the men were trapped. Plus, we had what looked like the early stages of collapse on the side that we were rescuing. I would always go right down to the avalanche, and literally put my hand in the ground, and just sit there and have a little listen to what the mountain was doing. Actually, it was still collapsing. And there was a very real possibility that at some stage, without warning, the collapse could continue -- and continue across us, the people who were doing the rescue and also across to the men on the other side, who were being rescued. It was very much a high-alert thing. You go in there. But you're listening to the rocks. You're listening to the sound of the cracks. You're watching for things falling from the roof. You're watching for rocks coming from where the avalanche had been. The good thing was that the best experts in the world were there -- like the Himalayan experts from India are just fantastic. And they come from the federal agencies, the state agencies, the army, the Indian coal agency, so many areas. Between us all, I think we were able to come to quite an informed view about the likelihood of it collapsing while we were there. Although we knew it was still collapsing, and we knew that there was a chance it was going to collapse at any moment, we were just on super high alert, because we knew we also had a rescue to complete. It was quite a balancing act. But an informed balancing act. Not a crazy balancing act. But we were going to do this , we were going to be calm, we were caring about our own well-being, we were making sure that people on the other side were going to be rescued. We were not going to jeopardise that, we were not going to cause another avalanche by doing something crazy. It was a quite informed and careful balancing act that we were performing.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Is India headed there again? asks Ajit Balakrishnan He was a stout, illiterate man, son of a butcher, struggling to earn enough to feed his 13 children by weaving handloom cotton in his tiny home when he suddenly hit on an idea that could increase his earning and feed his family. The idea was to make a small improvement in his spinning wheel such that it could, for the same effort. So, he put eight different spindles that were powered by a single wheel. This allowed him to produce eight threads in the same amount of time it previously took to produce one. He called this the spinning jenny, made a few of these contraptions, and earned a little money selling them to his neighbours. The year was 1764, the man was James Hargreaves, and he was in Lancashire, England. His invention triggered Samuel Crompton to invent the spinning mule and Charles Babbage to invent a weaving machine, thus triggering what we have come to know as the Industrial Revolution. It is this tiny invention, the spinning jenny, which had a cataclysmic effect on India s economy by reducing the number of workers needed to produce cotton cloth and thus created the impetus for the Indian Independence movement and was symbolised in the charkha symbol in the flag of that movement. What leaves me puzzled even after digging through many thousands of Web pages and books is this: If the idea of a spinning wheel with multiple spindles struck this lone man in Lancashire, why didn t a similar thought strike any one of the hundreds of thousands of cotton spinners in India at that time in the 1760s? Robert Allen, the distinguished economic historian, suggests the spinning jenny and the related Industrial Revolution occurred in Britain rather than in India because wages were exceptionally high compared to capital prices in Britain, so the jenny was profitable to use in Britain but not elsewhere. Since it was only profitable to use the jenny in Britain, that was the only country where it was worth incurring the costs of developing and using it, and that irrespective of the quality of their institutions or the progressiveness of their cultures the Indians would have not found it profitable to mechanise cotton production in the eighteenth century . Not inventing the spinning jenny and mechanised weaving and the other inventions that soon followed the steam engine, steam-powered locomotives, ships, and so on kept India imprisoned in the pre-industrial era and Indians had to wait for the British to colonise them and then teach them about such industrial things. Are there some equally disturbing things at work in India that might signal to us Indians that something wrong is under way? I can list a few and, please, dear reader, please list some others that are disturbing to you. We set up high-quality institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology, hoping that the students who graduate from there will innovate at a world-class level and bring India up to the level of the best in the world. But horror of horrors: Tuition businesses like those in Kota lure hundreds of thousands of students to attend coaching classes and game the IIT entrance examinations. And about 200,000 students take the IIT entrance test. Of those about 10,000 are given admission which means that 95 per cent go home disappointed. Then there are children who cannot make it to any of the top institutions such as IITs and Indian Institutes of Management and their parents send them to study abroad, paying Rs 50 lakh to Rs 60 lakh a year or more it is estimated that last year 450,000 went abroad to study. Let us look at another aspect of this puzzle. In the late 1980s, India had a small bunch of tech companies designing and building computers and related hardware under the protection of 100 per cent import duty on such items. Then, as Siddhartha Mukerji points out in his recent book India's Software Industry: Politics Institutions and Policy Shift : During 1991, NASSCOM (National Association of Software and Service Companies) lobbied with the government and for the first time secured income tax exemptions on the profits of software exports. Later, due to the pressure by NASSCOM, the government lowered the import duties from a high 114 per cent to almost zero, and all of the players designing and building computer hardware perished or switched to the business of providing services workforce to foreign companies. The shift from information-technology products to IT workforce services was complete from that day onwards. Now, we as a nation are proud that we supply workforce to the worldwide IT industry: Earning a gigantic $250 billion as revenue and employing more than 5 million young Indians no doubt a great step forward but letting United States-based tech giants own the IT product market. Surprisingly, Indian-origin people are now increasingly dominant as senior executives/chief executive officers of these American tech giants. Now, as the world swings into the era dominated by artificial intelligence, it looks like India's role will again be to supply workforce to the new set of United States-based tech giants like OpenAI, which are set to dominate the world. What if we discover that the AI wave will dispense with the need for a cheap tech workforce? More importantly, what is in India's political economy that drives us to seek IT services revenue rather than leading in IT products? The answer to that question may tell us why the spinning jenny was not invented in India and the Industrial Revolution did not start in India.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Venezuela struck twice in the space of 10 minutes in the second half to come from behind and earn a 2-1 victory over Ecuador in the Copa America on Saturday, getting their Group B campaign off to a winning start. Ecuador played most of the match with 10 men after their captain Enner Valencia was sent off in the 22nd minute for a high boot, but Jeremy Sarmiento smashed home just before halftime to put them in front. Both of Venezuela's goals came from substitutes. Jhonder Cadiz leveled the match in the 64th minute before Eduard Bello struck in the 74th to boost Venezuela's chances of reaching the quarter-finals. Cadiz pounced on Salomon Rondon's cushioned layoff in the following a quickly taken throw in to level the scores will a composed finish. Bello sealed victory for Venezuela 10 minutes later, smashing a rebound high into the net from close range after Rondon drew a save from Ecuador keeper Alexander Dominguez with a diving header. \"We fought until the end, even though we were without an important player very early,\" Ecuador midfielder Moises Caicedo said. \"It hurts to lose... (but) we have to keep going because there are two games to go. \"We have a lot of character to turn this around and we are going to fight until the end.\" Valencia was sent off after making contact with Jose Martinez's face. Ecuador's talisman and top international scorer initially earned a yellow for the challenge but the card was upgraded to a red after the referee was sent to the monitor by the video assistant. Valencia will be miss Ecuador's next group match against Jamaica on Wednesday as a result of the straight red card. Venezuela next face Mexico on Wednesday.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) While England already have one foot in the knockout round of Euro 2024 and can finish no lower than third in their group, they need to make their presence felt at a tournament that has seen optimism around them wither after two lacklustre games. England need to avoid defeat in Cologne to guarantee progress and will definitely top the group with a win. If Denmark fail to beat Serbia in the other Group C match, England will qualify regardless of their result against Slovenia. Slovenia will go through to the last 16 if they win. Supporters and pundits have levelled scathing criticism at Gareth Southgate's England side after their 1-0 win over Serbia and anxious 1-1 draw with Denmark that saw fans boo them off the pitch before the players beat a hasty exit from Frankfurt Arena. Southgate had some concerning post-game comments, pointing to the players' conditioning after long and gruellingly seasons. \"We are not pressing well enough, with enough intensity,\" he said. \"We have limitations in how we can do that with the physical condition. \"We cannot press as high up the pitch as we might have done in the qualifiers, for example,\" he added. \"And not keeping the ball well enough. It's as simple as that. We have to keep the ball better and build with more control. Then we will be defending less and we'll have more confidence.\" The biggest questions are around what changes Southgate will make after he went with the same line-up in both games for the first time in 16 matches. \"We felt the right thing to do against Denmark was to give confidence to the players we picked in the first game,\" he said. \"We had won the previous game.\" Southgate took off Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is struggling out of position in midfield, early in the second half against Denmark, and forwards Harry Kane, Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden followed some 15 minutes later. Slovenia were heading for their first victory at a European Championship when Serbia's Luka Jovic equalised seconds before the final whistle to snatch a 1-1 draw. \"We have proven that we deserve to be at Euro 2024,\" Slovenia manager Matjaz Kek said. \"Football can be really cruel. But I am convinced that this team will get its satisfaction.\" England's defence could have their hands full coping with Slovenia striker Benjamin Sesko, who has drawn comparisons to Manchester City's towering forward Erling Haaland. \"(England) know we have played two great games, they are not at their best, they're still great of course, but I think now is the best opportunity to play against them and show them the best we can,\" said Sesko, who turned down reported interest from Arsenal among other top clubs to extend his say with Leipzig. \"In every single position they have amazing players,\" he added. \"And what's more exciting is that we have a great team and we can show our skills against them ... I know we can surprise them. I am sure we are going to shine.\" To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

Final positions in the six groups are still up for grabs which determine potential opponents in the knockout stage. There are four places available in the last 16 for the best third-place finishers, which could lead to a situation of one or more teams going through with two points while another could miss out despite getting four points but finishing fourth in their group. If teams are level on points, they will be split on head-to-head record, goal difference, then goals scored, then disciplinary points, then their qualifying ranking. Group A - Germany are through and assured of a top two finish in the group. They can secure top spot if they do not lose to Switzerland. - Switzerland can qualify for the last 16 if they do not lose to Germany or Scotland fail to beat Hungary. They can win the group if they beat Germany. - Scotland will make it through with a win against Hungary and a Switzerland defeat by Germany, providing they overturn the goal difference disparity. - Hungary must beat Scotland to have a chance of reaching the last 16 on one of the best third place finishers. Group B - Spain have reached the last 16 and will finish as group winners thanks to their win over second-placed Italy. - Italy must avoid defeat by Croatia to finish as runners-up in the group. They will be out if they lose and Albania beat Spain. - Albania can finish as runners-up if they beat Spain and Croatia beat Italy. They will be out if they lose and Croatia win. - Croatia can also finish as group runners-up if they beat Italy and Albania do not win against Spain. Croatia will be out if they draw and Albania do not lose. Group C - England will be through if they do not lose to Slovenia or if Denmark fail to beat Serbia. England can top the group with a win or even a draw if Denmark do not win. England cannot finish lower than third. - If Denmark beat Serbia they will be through. If the Danes and Slovenia both draw, they will finish second and third via goal difference etc. Denmark will be out if they lose and Slovenia do not. - Slovenia can make the last 16 by beating England. They will top the group if they win and Denmark do not. If they win or draw and the result is matched by the Danes, they will be split on goal difference etc. - Serbia can also qualify by beating Denmark and if Slovenia do not win against England. Serbia will be out if they lose or if they draw and Slovenia do not lose. Group D - The Netherlands will finish in the top two if they do not lose to Austria. They can top the group if they win and France fail to beat Poland. They can also win the group with a draw if France lose to Poland. - France will qualify in the top two if they avoid defeat. If France and the Dutch have the same result, they will be split on goal difference etc. - A win for Austria over the Dutch will give them a top two finish in the group. Austria can top the group if they win and France do not. - Poland are already eliminated and cannot reach the last 16. Group E For the first time in European Championship history, all four teams - Romania, Belgium, Slovakia and Ukraine - are level on three points after two games. All of them can finish in any position and each team can progress or be eliminated. Group F - Portugal have secured their place in the last 16 with top spot in the group. - Turkey need to avoid losing against the Czech Republic to finish as group runners-up. - Czech Republic can finish second and qualify by beating Turkey. A draw may be enough but they will go out if they lose. - Georgia can progress as runners-up by beating Portugal and if Czech Republic also win against Turkey - they will also need to overturn the goal difference. They go home if they lose or if they draw and Turkey do not beat Czech Republic. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

The second set was a much more one-sided affair, with Draper making no mistake in snapping Alcaraz's 13-match grass winning streak, as the Briton's family proudly watched from the stands. \"It was a really tough match. I knew coming out here that Carlos is the defending champion, he won Wimbledon, he's an amazing talent. I knew I had to come out here and play really well, and luckily I did that,\" Draper said. \"I've got my grandad here in the Under Armour - he's just turned 80!

AITA approved his choice and paired him with Balaji. Nagal had enhanced qualification chances by winning the Heilbronn Challenger earlier this month as he broke into the top 80 of the ATP singles rankings. The Heilbronn victory was Nagal's second Challenger title this season, having prevailed in the Chennai Challenger earlier this year. The 26-year-old Nagal has been making the waves since the start of the 2024 season as he qualified for the main draw of the Australian Open, where he made it to the second round with an upset win over then world number 37 Alexander Bublik. He had also qualified for the main draw of the Indian Wells Masters and Monte-Carlo Masters, the ATP 1000 events. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) George Russell put Mercedes on pole position for the Canadian Grand Prix by the blink of an eye on Saturday after setting exactly the same time as Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Triple Formula One World champion Verstappen missed out on pole because he set his time of one minute 12.000 seconds after his British rival in a drama-filled qualifying session at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. Mercedes signalled they were going to be a threat for pole earlier on Saturday when Lewis Hamilton, a seven-times winner in Canada, posted the top time in final practice with Russell close behind in third. Rain, which had disrupted both practices on Friday, returned for the first two phases of qualifying but the skies cleared and the sun began to appear in time for the last-10 shootout that ended in a dead heat. Russell will start on pole for the first time since Brazil 2022, joined on the front row by Verstappen who is chasing a Canadian Grand Prix hat-trick. \"I've missed this feeling,\" Russell said. \"Excited for tomorrow, first step done but now obviously we've got our eyes on that win. \"The car has been feeling amazing since we brought some upgrades to Monaco, we have really been in that fight now. So we're going for it tomorrow.\" Russell's pole provided yet another sign that Red Bull's domination is waning. After Verstappen's run of eight consecutive poles extending back to last season, three different drivers have started from the front in the last three races. If Russell can follow up his pole with a victory on Sunday he would also become the fourth different winner in the last four. DANGEROUS THREAT Red Bull and Verstappen will not be waving the white flag, however, and the Dutchman showed that his team are still a threat. \"I think overall we still had a good qualifying,\" summed up Verstappen, who tops the drivers standings 31 points clear of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. \"The whole weekend has been still a bit tricky for us, but to be P2, I‚Äôd take it,\" he added. \"Going into qualifying I would have definitely taken that. \"That it was that close at the end makes it really exciting for tomorrow as well.\" Verstappen will not be getting much help from Mexican team mate Sergio Perez, who turned in an uninspired effort and will start well back in 16th. Perez's day was not as bad as Ferrari's with Leclerc, a winner two weeks ago in Monaco, and Carlos Sainz stumbling out in the second phase and starting 11th and 12th respectively. \"For sure when you are 11th and 12th you are not happy,\" said Ferrari team principal Frederic Vasseur. \"It's tight. \"At the end of the day Perez is 16th and for one or two tenths you can be out.\" Sauber's Zhou Guanyu, who crashed early in two of the three practice sessions, paid dearly for his lack of track time and finished bottom of the results sheet. It will be Alpine's Esteban Ocon starting last on Sunday, however, the Frenchman taking a five-place grid penalty for colliding with team mate Pierre Gasly in the last race in Monaco.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Red Bull's triple World champion Max Verstappen completed a Canadian Grand Prix hat-trick of victories on a wet, wild and tricky Sunday at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal. Verstappen, who started on the front row alongside Mercedes pole sitter George Russell, stayed clear of trouble on a day of constantly changing conditions, snatching the lead from McLaren's Lando Norris on the final pit stops. The Dutchman then grimly hung on to claim his sixth victory from nine races this season and the 60th of his Formula One career. It was another brilliant drive from the 26-year-old who dealt with a track switching back-and-forth from wet to dry, pit stop battles and challenges from McLaren and Mercedes while wrestling with his Red Bull's suspension. After Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and Williams's Alex Albon came together, bringing out the safety car for a second time, Verstappen pulled away on the restart and finished 3.879 seconds ahead of Norris while Russell won a nail-biting last-laps duel with team mate Lewis Hamilton to complete the podium. \"Not easy but we did it,\" said Verstappen over the team radio. \"We had to be on top of our calls and I think, as a team, it went really well today. \"I think we pitted at the right time and of course the safety car worked out nicely for us but even after that I think we were managing the gaps quite well. \"I love it, that was a lot of fun. Those kind of races you need them once in a while.\" The win will certainly provide a confidence boost at Red Bull which has recently seen challenges to the team's once unquestioned dominance. In the three races before Canada, Red Bull had managed one win as the battle for the drivers' and constructors' titles tightened. But the team returns to Europe back in control of both, with Verstappen opening up a 56-point advantage over Ferrari's Charles Leclerc at the top of the drivers' standings while Red Bull moved 49 clear of Ferrari for the constructors' crown. Both Ferraris failed to finish on Sunday, with Sainz losing control of his car on the wet track and hitting the barrier while Charles Leclerc retired after struggling with an engine issue.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Lando Norris put McLaren on pole position for the Spanish Grand Prix on Saturday with Red Bull's triple Formula One world champion Max Verstappen alongside on the front row. Verstappen had taken provisional pole with a time that looked hard to beat, and went faster with his final effort, but Norris took it to another level to end the session 0.020 quicker than his Dutch rival. The pole was only the second of the Briton's Formula One career, the last coming at the Russian Grand Prix in 2021. \"It was pretty much a perfect lap. You know when you are on a good lap and you are getting excited,\" Norris said after setting a time of one minute 11.383 seconds. \"It has been close all weekend but really it was about a perfect lap and that is what I did today.\" Championship leader Verstappen had set the standard with a lap of 1:11.673 as his first effort and improved the time on his second run to an impressive 1:11.403. \"I was quite happy in qualifying. I got a nice (aerodynamic) tow from Checo (team mate Sergio Perez) in Q3 (the final phase) but unfortunately it was not enough,\" he said. \"That's how it goes sometimes, but overall we can still be happy with that performance and it's all to play for tomorrow.\" Norris was the fourth different driver on pole in the last four races, another sign of the battle between the top teams getting ever closer and Red Bull's dominance being steadily eroded. The pole was also a boost for McLaren whose day started with unwanted drama when their paddock hospitality unit caught fire, with one team member taken to hospital as a precautionary measure. Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton was third fastest and team mate George Russell fourth. \"Slowly the car is crafting into a racing machine with which we can hopefully fight the guys in front,\" said seven-times world champion Hamilton. \"George did a great job as well so, hopefully, tomorrow we can apply the pressure on the guys in front.\" Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, preparing for a home race, filled the third row. Pierre Gasly boosted struggling Alpine's morale with seventh place on the grid for the Renault-owned team and Perez was eighth but will drop three places due to a grid penalty carried over from Canada. That will lift Alpine's Esteban Ocon to eighth with McLaren's Oscar Piastri ninth and Aston Martin's home hero Fernando Alonso 10th. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Twice champion Andy Murray has not yet made a decision on his Wimbledon participation, Britain's Davis Cup captain Leon Smith said just hours after the ATP announced that the 37-year-old will miss the grasscourt major after back surgery. The professional men's tour‚Äôs governing ATP has since deleted its post on social media platform X. Murray withdrew from this week's Queen's Club Championships due to the injury while trailing 4-1 in the first set of his second-round match with Jordan Thompson on Wednesday, having beaten Alexei Popyrin in his 1,000th tour-level singles contest. The ongoing issue was aggravated by Murray's participation in this year's French Open. \"He obviously went through a procedure yesterday (Saturday)and you have to wait and see now,\" Smith told the BBC. \"My understanding is no decision has been made and let's hope for the best for Andy.\" Murray, a three-times Grand Slam champion, has yet to confirm whether he will play at Wimbledon. \"After an operation on a spinal cyst, Andy Murray is sadly out of Wimbledon,\" the ATP had said earlier on Sunday. \"Rest up and recover Andy, we'll miss seeing you there.\" Reuters has contacted the ATP for comment. Murray breathed new life into his career after having hip resurfacing surgery in 2019 but has struggled to make the latter stages of the top tournaments and also had to deal with an ankle injury sustained at the Miami Open in March. The Scottish double Olympic gold medallist had previously said that he was unlikely to continue playing next season, and it would be a fitting end to his glittering career if he bowed out at the All England Club or the Paris Games. Wimbledon runs from July 1-14, while the tennis competition at the Olympics will begin on July 27. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Images from the Euro 2024 Group A match between Switzerland and Germany, in Frankfurt, on Sunday. Striker Niclas Fullkrug scored a dramatic stoppage time equaliser as hosts Germany rescued a point after a 1-1 draw with Switzerland on Sunday to seal top spot in Group A and maintain their momentum going into the last-16 of Euro 2024. Swiss forward Dan Ndoye had threatened to spoil the party with a first half opener, but Germany, who had already sealed a knockout place before kickoff, are now on a seven-game unbeaten run stretching back to November and kept plugging away until the equaliser eventually came through Fullkrug‚Äôs header. The home side had a goal disallowed and several penalty appeals rejected by Italian referee Daniele Orsato, and it looked to be a frustrating night before Fullkrug finished one of their 18 attempts at goal in a feverish atmosphere in Frankfurt. It denied the Swiss what would have been a second win over Germany in 22 competitive matches dating back to 1959, but their passage through to the last-16 is also secure. Germany top the pool with seven points from their three games, two ahead of Switzerland, while Hungary (three points) must wait to see if they will advance as one of the best third-placed teams following a 1-0 win over eliminated Scotland (one). \"Of course, we would have liked to win the game and to play great football,\" Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan said. \"But I think you also need games like that during a tournament. And that can also be a real strength for the next games, hopefully.\" Germany thought they had the lead on 17 minutes when Robert Andrich‚Äôs shot from 30-yards somehow beat Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer at his near post but the latter‚Äôs blushes were spared when the goal was ruled out for a foul by Jamal Musiala. Instead it was the Swiss who scored just before the half-hour mark. Musiala was bundled off the ball in midfield and when Remo Freuler was found on the left-hand side of the box, his low cross was turned into the roof of the net by Ndoye. The home side created numerous chances as they camped in the Swiss half, but after Kai Havertz had wasted several, Fullkrug rose highest to head in David Raum‚Äôs cross in the 92nd minute and preserve their unbeaten start to their home championship. \"I think when you see the Germans celebrating, we can be proud of ourselves,\" Swiss captain Granit Xhaka told SRF . \"It's not easy against a team like that. Nevertheless, the late equaliser hurts. \"Everyone fought for each other and ran for each other. We have to push ourselves to the limit. Then we can beat anyone. We have taken the first step and are now looking forward to the round of 16.\" Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann picked the same starting XI for the third game in a row, but will be forced into at least one change for the last-16 after Jonathan Tah picked up a second yellow card of the group stages and will be suspended. Whether Havertz did enough to keep his starting place remans to be seen, with Germany looking more threatening when Fullkrug came on to score his 13th international goal in 19 caps, only six of which he has started.

Seven times world champion Lewis Hamilton was third for his first podium appearance of the season with Mercedes team mate George Russell fourth on a sunny afternoon at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya. The Dutch driver extended his championship lead to a hefty 69 points, with Norris moving up to become the triple world champion's closest rival and also taking a bonus point for fastest lap. Norris paid the price for a slow start, dropping to third into the first corner after squeezing Verstappen onto the grass while Russell rocketed past from the second row to take them both and lead the field. \"I did a bit of rallying. I think we slowed each other down,\" commented Verstappen afterwards. Verstappen, who had started alongside Norris on the front row, was leading by lap three and could then build a buffer and take control. \"I think what made the race was the beginning,\" he said. \"I took the lead ... and made that first stint where I could eke out a gap a little bit. \"After that we had to drive kind of a defensive race. Lando and McLaren were very quick today ... I think we did everything well, we drove quite an aggressive strategy but luckily it played out to the end.\" Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fifth, after taking the chequered flag just 0.3 behind Russell, and team mate Carlos Sainz sixth in front of his home crowd. McLaren's Oscar Piastri was seventh, Red Bull's Sergio Perez eighth, with Alpine duo Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon taking the final points. The win was Verstappen's seventh in 10 races so far this season, and 61st of his career. He now has 219 points to Norris's 150 and Leclerc's 148. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Images from the Euro 2024 Group A match between Scotland and Hungary at Stuttgart Arena, Germany, on Sunday. Hungary snatched a 100th-minute winner to beat Scotland 1-0 and put themselves in contention for a last-16 spot at the European Championship while condemning the Scots to yet another failure at a major tournament. Kevin Csoboth's breakaway goal with almost the last kick of the match ensured Hungary finished third in Group A with three points while Scotland, yet to reach the knock-out phase of either the Euros or World Cup, end in last place on two points. Hungary must wait to see whether they will qualify for the last 16 in one of the places reserved for the best four third-placed finishers. Their progress now rests on results from other groups going their way over the next three days. However, for now Marco Rossi's side will revel in their dramatic victory that rescued their hopes just as they thought they were heading home. The match was a scrappy affair, with both teams struggling to exert any kind of control despite each being desperate for a win to continue their stay in Germany. Steve Clarke's Scotland did dominate possession in the opening 25 minutes but could not fashion any clear-cut chances. Indeed, they had no shots at all in the first half despite having 61% of the ball. They ended the match without a shot on target. Hungary, meanwhile, grew into the game and began threatening on the break and making quick transitions, with captain Dominik Szoboszlai in particular threatening from set pieces. The midfielder's free-kick to the far post in the 41st minute was met by an unmarked Willi Orban but his poor header clipped the top of the bar from close range. Che Adams had Scotland's first shot shortly after the break but he blasted it over. The game was paused for a lengthy period in the 68th minute after a horrible clash between Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn and Barnabas Varga from another Szoboszlai free-kick. Varga appeared to be knocked out cold and needed urgent treatment, and Hungary players erected blankets around him as a screen while they looked in distress, with Szoboszlai in tears. The forward was carried off the field on a stretcher to applause from the crowd. He was taken to Stuttgart Hospital, the Hungarian Football Federation said, adding that he was in a stable condition. \"That gave us that extra bit, obviously we don't ever want to see that on a football pitch but thankfully he's conscious now,\" Hungary midfielder Callum Styles said. Scotland had a strong appeal for a penalty dismissed in the 79th minute when substitute Stuart Armstrong ran on to the ball in the box but fell under contact from Orban. However, the referee did not consider it a foul. The game become more chaotic as both teams sought a winner. Gunn did well to save from Szoboszlai's shot at the near post in the first minute of stoppage time, while Csoboth struck the post a minute later from the right when bearing down on goal. Scotland rushed forward and McTominay slid in at the near post to meet a low cross but the ball missed the target. It was from a Scottish corner that Hungary turned into a rapid counter-attack up the pitch. A long cutback across the box fell to Csoboth who slotted the ball in, sending Hungary fans delirious and players from their bench running over in celebration. Scotland could only look on dejected as their bid to make history ended in dramatic fashion to the latest goal ever scored at a European Championship in regulation time.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) A third-minute goal from Christian Pulisic set the United States on their way to a 2-0 victory over Bolivia in their Group C opener at the Copa America on Sunday. Folarin Balogun added the second shortly before half-time and while the tournament hosts pushed for more goals in the second half they were unable to add to their tally. \"The message to the team is it's always important to win your first game,\" US coach Gregg Berhalter said. \"We talked about progressing our performance, improving our performance throughout the tournament, so I think it was a good starting point.\" The US were aggressive right from the start against Bolivia, who have just one win in their last 31 Copa America matches. A missed opportunity by Balogun in the first 20 seconds was soon forgotten when Pulisic scored a spectacular goal from the edge of the box, beating Bolivian keeper Guillermo Viscarra. It was Pulisic's 30th goal in 69 international matches. His first came against Bolivia in May 2016. The US doubled their lead in the 44th minute when Pulisic found Balogun and the striker ended his six-match goal drought in international matches with a low shot into the bottom corner. The hosts continued their onslaught with Ricardo Pepi, who came on as a substitute in the 65th minute, denied four times by Viscarra. \"We tried to recover but of course, after the goal in minute three, it all went down the hill,\" Bolivia coach Antonio Carlos Zago told reporters. \"We should have competed a bit more, but we need to be aware that we had the host team in front of us. They are a strong national team and I am really happy with the effort made by the players.\" The US next face CONCACAF rivals Panama on Thursday in Atlanta, while Uruguay will take on Bolivia in New Jersey. Uruguay have it easy against Panama Maximilian Araujo, Darwin Nunez and Matias Vina scored as Uruguay beat Panama 3-1 in their Group C match in Florida later on Sunday. Uruguay's win saw them move level with the United States on three points. The US beat Bolivia 2-0 in the day's other Group C match. Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay, who have won the Copa America a joint record 15 times, were rewarded for their blistering early pace when Araujo fired home a sublime curling effort from the edge of the area in the 16th minute. Panama grew into the match after the break and wasted several chances to get themselves back into the contest. Jose Fajardo blasted an effort wide in the 52nd minute after a defensive error by Mathias Olivera, while Jose Rodriguez tested Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet with a ferocious shot from range. Asked what he said to his team at halftime, Panama coach Thomas Christiansen told reporters: \"I told them they have to be fearless. \"That they have to increase their level of confidence. That they are capable to do what they did in the second half. And after the goal, like Uruguay, we generated opportunities.\" Uruguay were on the ropes for much of the second half but Nunez, who had already missed a string of chances, settled their nerves in the 85th minute with a coolly-taken volley into the bottom corner after a rebound dropped kindly for him. In a frenetic spell during stoppage time, Vina rose highest to head home Uruguay's third from a set-piece before Michael Amir Murillo netted a consolation goal for Panama after cutting back onto his left foot and curling his shot past Rochet. Uruguay's all-time leading scorer Luis Suarez, 37, was an unused sub. Uruguay next face Bolivia in New Jersey on Thursday, while Panama take on the United States in Atlanta.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Global consumer preferences can be influenced through music, films, literature, yoga and sports because they create interest and a sense of familiarity that can help our businesses to access foreign markets, suggests T N C Rajagopalan. India's soft power is set to go up a notch or two with the T20 cricket World Cup being held this month. In turn, that can help trade and investment. Soft power is the ability to connect with others through culture and moral authority that can help influence their attitudes, and over a period of time their behaviour to get the desired outcomes. It is a matter of building trust and establishing a positive image and reputation. Sports can play as powerful a role as culture in doing so. During the freedom movement, the non-violent protests by Mahatma Gandhi and millions of his followers caught the attention of the world in a positive way. Our policy of non-alignment and principles of peaceful co-existence at the height of the Cold War also gained a lot of respect during the initial years of independent India. Of late, yoga is being popularised in all parts of the world. Our software professionals and people settled abroad have vastly enhanced our image. Our film songs, Raj Kapur's Awara and other movies in Soviet Union, the films of Amitabh Bachhan and Shah Rukh Khan in West Asia, Rajnikant's Padayappa and other movies in South East Asia and Japan, and Aamir Khan's Dangal in China gained enormous popularity and created plenty of goodwill for India. Widely respected cricketers like Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble and Virat Kohli have generated enough positive vibes towards India that our diplomats have been able to build on. Till recently, only Britain and its erstwhile colonies played the game. However, the result oriented T20 format that lasts for only about three-and-a-half hours and played in the evening hours has got more countries interested. The WCT20 this year is an important event because 20 countries are participating in the tournament and for the first time 16 matches, including the high profile India-Pakistan match, were played in the United States. It is a great opportunity to improve the connections with the people in the richest country of the world and Canada. Cricket is included as one of the sports in the 2028 Olympics to be held at Los Angeles. The spread of the T20 format has increased the opportunities for our franchises, cricketers, coaches, umpires, commentators, support staff and curators who prepare the pitches. With a strong positive image among the people in various countries, it is easier to attract foreign investment. Cultural appeal coupled with political values such as respect for rule of law and human rights build trust, which is important for investors. Global consumer preferences also can be influenced through music, films, literature, yoga and sports because they create interest and a sense of familiarity that can help our businesses to access foreign markets. Personal connections through educational exchange programmes, cultural interactions, sporting links and travel also help develop a favourable view of the country. Soft power through culture, sports, yoga etc, however, can go only so far. Stability of economic policies, respect for rule of law and human rights, responsible policies towards sustainability and environment, a credible judicial system, a well-educated and skilled manpower and a favourable perception of fair play by the Executive etc are also important factors that influence businesses in various countries in a positive way.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The Budget should use the extra RBI surplus to better effect, suggests A K Bhattacharya. Now that Nirmala Sitharaman has returned to the ministerial portfolio she held for the last five years, the Union finance ministry has got down to its most important task -- preparing the Budget for 2024-2025. An Interim Budget was presented by her on February 1 earlier this year, but that was only a vote-on-account, seeking Parliament's approval for incurring a specified amount of expenditure till such time as the full year's Budget is presented by a new government and approved by Parliament. Unlike a few of the previous Interim Budgets, Ms Sitharaman refrained from making any policy announcement or taxation changes, honouring convention and staying on the path of correctness. Now, as she gets ready to prepare the full Budget for the current year, what should be her key concerns? Undoubtedly, the macroeconomic circumstances under which the forthcoming Budget will be prepared are looking healthier than what prevailed when the Interim Budget was presented. Retail inflation is under control, even though it is still above the government-mandated target of 4 per cent. Gross domestic product or GDP grew by 8.2 per cent in 2023-2024 and is expected to grow by 7.2 per cent in the current year. Foreign exchange reserves are comfortable at over $640 billion. The current account deficit was well under control at 1.2 per cent of GDP in the first three quarters of 2023-2024 and may even be lower than 1 per cent for the full year, according to some estimates. There are, however, worries on the exports front, with merchandise goods exports falling marginally last year and service exports losing their earlier momentum. With geopolitical tensions showing no signs of subsiding, international commodity prices, particularly those of crude oil, could be another cause for concern. But, overall, the Budget for 2024-2025 can benefit from reasonably sound fundamentals of the Indian economy. There is yet another positive boost for the 2024-2025 Budget that comes from recent developments. The Reserve Bank of India's surplus transfer this year would be 133 per cent more than what was originally expected. The total transfer estimated at Rs 2.1 trillion will create an additional fiscal headroom of almost 0.37 per cent of GDP. Should the government use the extra receipt to reduce its fiscal deficit, or increase investment to add to the country's infrastructure capacity, or provide tax incentives to revive consumption demand, or take steps to create more jobs at the lower end of the employment market? The efficient husbanding of resources by the government last year has meant that the fiscal deficit for 2023-2024 has been brought down to 5.6 per cent of GDP, against the Budget estimate of 5.9 per cent. This should make the task of reducing the deficit to 5.1 per cent, as projected in the Interim Budget, relatively easy. Indeed, the finance ministry can aim at a sharper reduction to achieve the 4.5 per cent target earlier than 2025-2026 and outline a new glide path for meeting the optimum target of 3 per cent over the next few years. The big policy options that need to be exercised by the next Budget is whether it should focus only on reducing the deficit this year or use the available resources to address other pressing needs of the economy, such as investments, employment creation and boosting consumption demand. A mixed approach would be ideal. The second upside for this year's Budget may come from unexpected quarters. From July 2022 to June 2024, the government's goods and services tax (GST) compensation cess revenue is likely to be around Rs 2.7 trillion, which is the amount the Centre had borrowed from the RBI on behalf of the states to meet their revenue losses during the Covid months. While the states ceased to get any compensation cess benefits from July 2022, the Centre has been collecting that amount to help it repay the loans. Details of the actual repayment liability on this account are not available, but it is likely that the full repayment will be completed before the end of March 2025. This will offer an opportunity for the government in two ways. The finance ministry could remove the GST compensation cess (at present the cess is applied to non-merit goods like tobacco products, aerated water and motor vehicles at different rates) or subsume a part of it in the revised rates for such products. Ideally, the cess should be removed, and this exercise should be aligned with the overall long-pending GST rate rationalisation to reduce the multiplicity of rates and increase the revenue neutral rate for the GST regime. The second benefit could be to use the removal of the compensation cess for reducing the overall GST incidence on products and services and boost demand. Going beyond the Budget options, there is a major reform that the finance ministry could undertake by introducing greater transparency in Budget presentation. All Budgets presented after general elections have relied on the revised estimates of the preceding year, which were presented in the interim Budget. However, by the time the full Budgets are presented, the finance ministry has access to the provisional numbers for the previous year, even though they are unaudited. Notably, in a few of the Budgets for pre-election years, the differences between the numbers given in the revised estimates and the provisional estimates have been quite significant. For instance, in 2008-2009, the provisional estimate for total revenue receipt was 3 per cent lower than what was given out in the revised estimate. And the government's capital expenditure in the provisional estimate was 8 per cent lower than the corresponding number in the revised estimate. In 2013-2014, the government's net tax revenue in the provisional estimate was 2.4 per cent less than it was in the revised estimate. The variations reached excessively high levels in 2018-2019, when the provisional estimate was 9.6 per cent lower than the revised estimate for total revenue receipt, 11 per cent lower for net tax revenue and 6 per cent lower for total expenditure. In most of these cases, these differences did not make a major impact on the final fiscal and revenue deficit numbers. But the variations in revenue and expenditure figures meant that any reading of the economy based on those numbers would have been misleading. More importantly, the full Budget estimates presented for the election year made comparisons that were patently inaccurate. The Budget documents would provide numbers on revenue and expenditure only under the heads of Budget estimate and revised estimate, even though sharply divergent figures based on the provisional unaudited estimate would be available with the government. The differences between the provisional figures and the revised estimates for 2023-2024 have not been sharp (the former numbers have been 1 per cent more than the revised estimate), but the finance minister could be more transparent if the Budget provides the provisional numbers as well, along with the revised estimates, so that a more accurate reading of the government's revenue collections and expenditure pattern could be possible. That decision would be another step towards imparting greater transparency to Budget-making. Feature Presentation: Aslam Hunani/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live!

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Technology giant Apple Inc has pushed the pedal on exporting iPhones from India by racking up exports valued at over $2 billion in the first two months of the current financial year (FY25), according to the data provided by vendors to the government. This accounts for 81 per cent of the country‚Äôs total production of iPhones worth $2.6 billion. In May, Apple repeated its performance of April and once again crossed $1 billion of iPhone exports. An Apple Inc spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. The commitment under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for the three Apple Inc vendors in FY25 is to hit a production value of $10.2 billion (including exports). They have achieved 25 per cent of that target in just two months. So far in FY25, Apple‚Äôs leading vendor Foxconn Hon Hai has contributed 65 per cent of the total exports, Wistron 24 per cent, and the remaining 11 per cent has come from Pegatron. All three iPhone vendors are participants in the smartphone PLI scheme, and have just begun the fourth year of the five-year scheme. Apple, which has the world‚Äôs largest global value chain (GVC), closed FY24 in India with a total iPhone production of $14 billion in free-on-board (FOB) value. The market value of these iPhones would be approximately $22 billion, depending on the cost of logistics and local taxation. In FY24, Apple exported $10 billion worth of iPhones, which accounted for 70 per cent of the FOB value of the year‚Äôs production. Rapidly growing iPhone exports pushed up India‚Äôs mobile phone exports to $15.5 billion in FY24. This constitutes a nearly 40 per cent increase from the $11.1 billion mobile phone exports in FY23. Electronics exports, led by mobile phones, have also climbed from sixth spot in FY23 (with an export value of $23.6 billion) to fifth in FY24, clocking $29.1 billion ‚Äî which is an increase of 23 per cent over the previous year. In FY24, iPhone exports constituted 35 per cent of India‚Äôs total electronics exports and 65 per cent of its total mobile phone exports. Apple has continuously expanded its production and exports from India over the last three years, crossing $1 billion exports each month during non-peak periods of April and May. Usually, Apple‚Äôs production for India sales peaks ahead of the festive season between July and October, and the new iPhone model is usually launched in the country in September. Its exports peak from October to December as the Indian factories get ready to supply iPhones to Western markets during Black Friday, Thanksgiving, and the Christmas and New Year festivities.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The ministry of information and broadcasting (I&B) on Wednesday held an inter-ministerial meeting with various departments to discuss issues regarding revenue sharing between Big Tech companies and digital news publishers, according to sources. The meeting ‚Äî chaired by I&B Secretary Sanjay Jaju ‚Äî invited senior officials from the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA), Competition Commission of India (CCI), ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity) and departments of promotion of industry and internal trade, legal affairs and consumer affairs. ‚ÄúWe have only had preliminary discussion to develop an understanding of the issue at hand and whose purview these matters would fall under,‚Äù a senior official said. The government has been approached by digital news publishers regarding abuse of dominant position by Big Tech players in ad-revenue share agreements, sources said. The discussion comes in the backdrop of the draft digital competition Bill proposed by the MCA. The Bill was drafted on the suggestions of an expert committee constituted to look into the need for ex ante regulations for Big Tech companies. Favouring the ex ante regulations, the Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) had said large digital enterprises indulge in non-transparent data and revenue sharing policies, search and ranking preferencing. They are into bundling, tying and collecting user data to improve their own products, allowing bidding on keywords, leading to infringement of registered trademarks, among other issues. ‚ÄúCCI should have pre-factum power for checking abuse of dominant position by large digital enterprises before revenue-sharing agreements are entered into with news publishers,‚Äù DNPA had said. Sources, however, said that the unfair competition issues between news publishers and technology companies may require a separate framework. Taking into account numerous representations by industry associations raising serious concerns on the proposed digital competition Bill, Meity also called for a meeting with MCA and various industry associations to discuss the matter. The meeting is expected on Thursday. Concerns have been raised by several industry representatives on the pitfalls of the proposed digital competition Bill. According to a report by Reuters, a US lobby group, representing tech giants Google, Amazon and Apple, has asked India to rethink its proposed EU-like digital competition law. It argued regulations against data use and preferential treatment of partners could raise user costs. The proposed Bill requires digital companies to notify the CCI that it fulfils to qualify as a Systemically Significant Digital Enterprises (SSDE) based on the criteria set in the Bill. Such enterprises would have to establish transparent and effective complaint handling and compliance mechanisms. They have to report and operate in a fair and transparent manner with end users and business users, according to the draft Bill. SSDEs cannot directly or indirectly favour its own products, services, or lines of business, or those of related parties. They can‚Äôt use or rely on non-public data of business users operating on its core digital service. Issues at hand To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) As the job markets open up, top IT services firms may look at a tiered strategy in which they hire entry-level talents at higher salaries, amid a major technological shift, say HR analysts. About five years ago, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Accenture, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant, and Capgemini, among others, were the companies who had formulated this strategy. \"IT services companies were losing talented freshers to MNCs and differentiating the engineers based on assessments has given them the ability to financially bucket these grads into different pay packets. \"This allowed them to hire highly skilled and in some cases freshers from premier colleges at higher pay brackets,‚Äù said Kamal Karanth, founder and CEO, Xpheno, a specialist staffing enterprise. A fresher joining the IT services sector gets anywhere from Rs 3.25 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh per annum. Freshers who get selected through this tiered framework can get salaries that range from Rs 6.25 lakh to Rs 12 lakh per annum. With the campus hiring in the slow lane, hiring under this tiered framework has also taken a hit, but campus placement heads and HR specialists that Business Standard spoke to opined that with artificial intelligence and new-age technologies in focus, this strategy will now become the core focus area. Emails sent to players such as TCS and Wipro remained unanswered. The trend started as digitisation started to become the buzzword and clients started asking for skills that were higher than what IT firms were generally hiring for. ‚ÄúA decade ago, most of the engineering hiring done by the IT services was largely plain vanilla type of hiring. \"Again from a skill point the projects that IT services handled were also application development management type that entailed Java, Testing, SAP or Oracle. \"This started to change when the buzz of digitization started. \"Clients would also say that they do not want the same plain vanilla engineering talent skill sets. \"Over the years, software development also started to undergo changes,‚Äù explains S Pasupathi, COO, HirePro. This is when the companies started to relook at their strategy. So either they went to Tier-I colleges, but then they would not get the day one placement slot or within the same campus there would be a different stringent cut-off based on a different test to identify these students. Another reason why this was launched was the competition coming from global capacity centres (GCCs), startups, and MNCs who also began to visit campuses. ‚ÄúThese firms would pay a higher level of salary for a fresher, which was Rs 7 lakh. So the top talent started to move there,‚Äù said a head of HR operations in a mid-tier IT services firm. Neeti Sharma, CEO Teamlease Digital believes that as a strategy, differential salary at fresher level, even in a slow hiring market has not lost its relevance. ‚ÄúEach of these categories under the differential salary comes with different salary levels, educational level as well as aptitude,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúWe have seen that people hired through these funnels, the stickiness of these employees increases. \"We have seen that the attrition in this hiring goes down by 8-10 per cent,‚Äù she added. In the case of talent, this works for the freshers as well, since those who get hired through this route get a clear growth potential for them as well as a clear career road map. Though this was launched in 2019-2020, those hired through this tiered structure formed 20-30 per cent of the total fresher hiring that was being done by the companies. V Samuel Rajkumar, director (career development), VIT Vellore, says that of the total students hired over the last two to three years, almost 20 per cent were hired through this tiered framework at the campus. In 2024 Accenture handed 181 offers for freshers from VIT for the role of Advanced Engineering with a package of Rs 11.89 lakh. In 2023 it was 201 offers, and 289 offers in 2022. Likewise, TCS gave offer to 324 students under the Digital category at VIT in 2024 with a CTC of Rs 7 lakh and 104 offer in Prime category with CTC of Rs 9 lakh. In 2023, TCS had given 418 offers under the Digital Category at VIT. Pasupathi believes that going ahead, as the market opens the focus will be on hiring through this tiered framework. The ratio of such hiring already touched a ratio of 30:70, which is likely to change over the years. To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Equity investments by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) in the Indian market have shown a mixed trend over the past six months. While foreign investors withdrew money in two months during this period, including April, domestic institutions remained consistent and were net buyers. Cumulative flows by FPIs during this period amount to Rs 75,000 crore, while those of DIIs are 2.4 times higher, totalling just under Rs 1.8 trillion. Instances of withdrawals for domestic investments have been few, with negative flows or outflows recorded in only four months out of the past 28. In April, FPIs turned sellers due to the rise in crude oil prices and US bond yields. Given that institutional investors have substantial holdings in midcap and largecap companies and their actions play a major role in price trends, Business Standard examines the S&P BSE 200 group of stocks in which the two investor categories have shown the most confidence. The 10 stocks on this list have witnessed at least four consecutive quarters of an increase in shareholding by FPIs or DIIs, respectively. In the FPI list, except for Mankind Pharma, the shareholding of foreign investors is higher than 20 per cent. For the DII group of stocks, the highest shareholding is in Voltas at 40 per cent, followed by Delhivery at just under 20 per cent. Additionally, except for Star Health & Allied Insurance Co, most stocks have delivered strong double-digit returns in the past year, with Indus Towers leading the pack with gains of 129 per cent. Supreme Industries Riding on strong demand, Supreme Industries delivered a 41 per cent volume growth in the pipe segment in the January-March quarter of 2023-24. The segment accounted for over 80 per cent of the company's overall volumes. Given the robust demand traction, it has guided for overall volume growth of 20 per cent, with the pipe segment expected to grow by 25 per cent in 2024-25. Geographic expansion through brownfield projects and setting up new plants at Patna and Vijayawada are key positives. YES Securities is bullish on Supreme s growth prospects, given healthy demand from agriculture, infrastructure, and plumbing segments, coupled with a focus on expanding market share via adding more stock-keeping units, finding newer applications (such as gas distribution), and increasing its distribution network. Indian Hotels Company The management of hospitality major Indian Hotels Company is eyeing double-digit growth in revenue per available room for 2024-25 on a high base, led by the opening of 25 new hotels that can add 3,500 rooms, and new businesses growing at over 30 per cent year-on-year. The uptrend in the hospitality industry, according to Motilal Oswal Research, is expected to continue, with all-India demand growth likely to be 10.6 per cent from 2023-24 (FY24) through 2026-27 (FY27) compared to supply growth of 8 per cent. Revenue and operating profit of the company are expected to grow by 13 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively, during FY24-27. Growth, according to JM Financial Research, will be led by a robust development pipeline (80 per cent of which is asset-light), strong traction in new brands, and expansion into newer categories/businesses. Mankind Pharma One of the leading domestic pharmaceutical majors, Mankind Pharma is the fourth largest in terms of value and third largest in volume share of the Indian market. The company s focus on increasing its share of chronic drugs is expected to boost its gross margin. Growing its presence in diabetes, respiratory, central nervous system, and urology, among others, is expected to help take the chronic share rise to 50 per cent in the long term from 35 per cent in the nine months of 2023-24. JP Morgan has an overweight stance on Mankind, given a higher revenue growth forecast in the domestic business aided by thrust from modern trade, e-commerce, and hospital channels and guidance of double-digit growth in exports. New launches in the US can potentially offset declines in one-off opportunities, and pricing growth in domestic business is expected to remain healthy in 2024-25 despite no pricing growth in the National List of Essential Medicines portfolio. Indus Towers The successful follow-on public offer and efforts to raise debt by Vodafone Idea (Vi) have removed a key overhang on the recovery of dues for Indus Towers, which offers its telecommunication towers on a rental basis to Vi and Airtel. IIFL expects Vi to raise its mobile broadband location count from the current 170,000 to 250,000 over the next two years. It expects Indus to garner 80 per cent of the same, which should boost its tenancy ratio to 1.95 times from the current 1.7 times. A key trigger would be the resumption of dividend payment, which was suspended due to Vi s receivables issue. If Indus reinstates its dividend policy of paying out 100 per cent of its free cash flow, the same could translate into a dividend yield of about 6 per cent. Delhivery The company is a market leader in India s business-to-consumer express division (outsourced pie) with a market share of 21-22 per cent, nearly twice that of the nearest competitor. Delhivery is better placed than peers, given its low customer concentration risk of less than 15-16 per cent, scale and reach in T.ier-II and Tier-III cities (18,500 pincodes), and has the lowest cost advantage, says Elara Securities. A healthy balance sheet with a cash surplus of Rs 4,600 crore as of September 2023 to fund working capital and growth is an added positive. While the thrust on its own logistics service is likely to impact volumes in the near term, operating leverage and the sustenance of incremental gross margins around 50 per cent in transportation could lead to breakeven at the net profit level in 2024-25, says Emkay Research. Ashok Leyland After strong growth in the medium and heavy commercial vehicles industry over the past three years with an annual growth of 18 per cent, some moderation is likely in the near term. However, positive macros and continuing infrastructure spends should sustain growth in 2024-25. Within commercial vehicles, categories such as bus, tractor-trailer, and tipper are likely to do well, says Nuvama Research. An added demand trigger for Ashok Leyland is defence orders, which are expected to take the revenues from that vertical from Rs 300 crore in 2022-23 to about Rs 800 crore in 2023-24, estimate analysts. Net pricing is expected to stay healthy in the near term, given the price hike of 1.5-2 per cent by the sector and stabilising average discounts. This is positive for the company which is eyeing a mid-teen margin ahead of the current 11-12 per cent levels. Voltas Voltas indicated that its volume growth in room air conditioner (RAC) was 71 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2023-24 (FY24) and it has been gaining market share in the quarter (FY24 share expected at 22 per cent) after losing share over 18 months. Motilal Oswal Research believes that RAC is a long-term structural story, given the low penetration level in India, rising income levels, and thus, aspiration of middle-income group and rising heatwaves across the globe. UBS Research believes that Voltas has successfully reworked its supply chain in the RAC segment, further optimising its cost structure. With reducing costs, it will be difficult for new entrants to match Voltas, leading the industry into the early phases of consolidation and potential market-share gains for Voltas, says the foreign brokerage. FSN E-commerce Ventures (Nykaa) Nykaa s pre-quarter update for the fourth quarter (Q4) indicates sustained momentum for the beauty and personal care segment with gross merchandise value (GMV) growth at 30 per cent and fashion GMV growth in the high twenties. Overall, GMV growth has been strong and crossed 30 per cent after three quarters (on a high base of 36 per cent last year). The performance is relatively superior to other discretionary companies, given the sustained demand weakness in Q4, says Axis Capital. With competitive intensity moderating and working capital stabilising (at a higher level), a key driver ahead shall be margin delivery, says Nuvama Research. The brokerage has built in a 400-basis point operating profit margin expansion from 2023-24 through 2025-26. Key levers for the company include a revival in advertising income, moderation in marketing spends, and operating leverage. Cholamandalam The non-banking financial company has delivered its best-ever payouts, collections, and profitability in the fourth quarter of 2023-24. Net income was 41 per cent year-on-year while net profit was up 24 per cent over the year-ago period. Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company is a well-managed franchise and has displayed agility in moving across segments to grow ahead of the industry with no major asset quality issues, says Centrum Research. Repricing of automobile loans will help offset a higher cost of funds and support steady net interest margins, while return on assets can rise 20 basis points from 2023-24 (FY24) through 2025-26 (FY26), says Jefferies Research. Earnings are expected to rise at an annual growth of 30 per cent during FY24-26, estimate analysts. Over 70 per cent of analysts polled by Bloomberg are bullish on the stock; their target price indicates over 10 per cent upside potential. Star Health & Allied Insurance Co Star Health & Allied Insurance Co is the largest private standalone health insurance company in the country and has the largest retail health insurance share based on gross written premium (GWP). In 2023-24 (FY24), the company s retail health market share stood at 33 per cent. The company highlighted that the GWP growth in FY24 was a result of strong retail health insurance demand that the company capitalised on through one of the largest agency networks, its strong digital channel sales, and collaborations with banks and financial institutions. Loss ratios improved 356 basis points sequentially to 64.1 per cent as the impact of price hikes kicked in, and seasonal illnesses abated, driving the normalisation of loss ratios. Investments in preventive health checkups also helped loss ratios. Nuvama Research says it is enthused by Star Health s improving commentary and focus on growth, with targeted improvement in loss ratios. Seventy per cent of the analysts covering the stock have a buy rating on the insurer. Disclaimer: This article is meant for information purposes only.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Plug-in hybrids have two engines and the electric part has a much larger battery than in the regular hybrids. Car companies, led by the Japanese, are pushing the Indian government to look at hybrids in the interim if it wants to reduce carbon emission. Just over a year ago, the march of electric cars around the world seemed unstoppable. Sales were on an upswing and the general expectation was that they would soon dominate the passenger vehicle industry, supplanting internal combustion engines (ICE). How things have changed. In 2023, electric car sales slowed down and hybrid cars threatened to steal electric's thunder. According to S&P Global, the penetration of all categories of hybrids has gone up from 9 per cent globally to 11 per cent in 2023 and is neck-and-neck with electric cars, though the latter are marginally ahead at 12 per cent, compared to 10 per cent in 2022. In the United States, hybrid sales in 2023 were 1.4 million and overtook electric cars, which sold 1.2 million. Globally, sales of plug-in hybrids grew faster, going up by 43 per cent in 2023, compared to a 28 per cent increase for electric cars. Plug-in hybrids have two engines and the electric part has a much larger battery than in the regular hybrids. As the name suggests, plug-in hybrids require to be plugged into an electric socket to charge their battery. A regular hybrid gets its battery (smaller than in plug-ins) charged by the gasoline engine -- the two complement each other -- and regenerative braking. Plug-in hybrids in China grew by 85 per cent in 2023, while electric vehicles grew by 70 per cent. In India, the popular hybrids, such as Toyota Hyryder and Maruti Suzuki's Grand Vitara, do not require to be plugged in. The global trend towards hybrids is now visible in India, where they are being seen as an essential bridge to EV land. \"India will take a long time for 100 per cent electric cars. However, to reduce carbon emission, we have to go in the interim for an alternative, which complements electric cars and that is hybrids, which will replace ICE cars,\" Maruti Suzuki Chairman R C Bhargava, a vocal advocate of hybrid cars, said in an earnings call a few days ago. Going by the trend, the government's earlier target to have a 30 per cent penetration of electric cars by 2030 looks like a tall order. New estimates put the penetration from as low as 15 per cent to 23 per cent. That is why car companies, led by the Japanese, are pushing the Indian government to look at hybrids in the interim if it wants to reduce carbon emission. Bridge to EV Bhargava said in the earnings call that Maruti was working on technology with which hybrid models will give more mileage than their existing ones, which are based on Toyota technology. And they will also be available in the smaller, cheaper cars. Last year, according to S&P Mobility, hybrids were 1.75 per cent of all passenger vehicle sales in India, while pureplay battery-operated electric cars were 2 per cent. However, in the first three months of this year, hybrid sales have surpassed electric. \"In India, during the transition period to EVs, hybrids serve as an ideal solution, anticipated to maintain their relevance for almost a decade before electric vehicles begin to dominate. This is partly due to India's inherent advantages for EV adoption,\" says Puneet Gupta, Director, S&P Global. S&P global estimates that pureplay battery electric vehicles in India will increase their penetration to 23 per cent by 2030. By that time, hybrids would go up to 9 per cent -- to 11 per cent if small hybrid cars come in, as Bhargava promises, with a lower price tag. The global market for electric passenger vehicles is concentrated in three areas: China, US, and Europe, which accounted for 95 per cent of global electric sales last year. China alone was 60 per cent. In contrast, India's electric car market share is 2 per cent. Of course, electric is ideal, especially if more and more of the charging is done through renewable energy, but its adoption is stymied. Lack of enough charging stations on roads or in housing complexes across the country, combined with range anxiety, deter consumers. India's new Electronic Mobility Promotion Scheme, which provides subsidies for electric vehicles, does not support electric cars, only electric two- and three-wheelers. Building small, affordable electric cars, which have the potential to sell in large volumes, is still a technological challenge. Taxing matter Electric cars attract a goods and services tax (GST) rate of 5 per cent. Hybrid cars attract 28 per cent GST, but the cess takes the total tax incidence to 43 per cent, unless it is a small car. ICE cars attract the same GST, but the cess takes the total to up to 50 per cent, varying according to the size of the body and engine. This could change. Roads and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari has proposed to the finance ministry that the GST on hybrid cars be reduced to 5 per cent. This, if approved by the GST Council, will push up hybrid penetration manifolds, according to S&P Mobility. Bhargava agrees that this would lead to a big bump-up in hybrid sales. However, the proposal worries global companies that are looking to introduce plug-in hybrids in India. They say light hybrids, which have a smaller lithium battery, are just ICE vehicles providing better mileage, as the bulk of the driving is still on gasoline. Questioning electric There are critics, global and Indian, who doubt whether electric cars would help in reducing carbon emissions significantly in the near term. Maruti Suzuki has said that charging stations in India, powered by energy from coal, not renewable sources, will only generate additional carbon emissions, neutralising the impact of electric cars. So, the focus should be on changing that. A study by Goehring & Rozencwajg, a natural resource investor, says despite the noise on Norway's successful model for electrification of cars, the country forks out $4 billion on electric vehicle subsidies annually, as much as it does for building highways and maintaining public infrastructure, which has a big financial impact. Goehring & Rozencwajg also points out that despite all the action on the electric front in Norway -- 20 per cent of all vehicles on the country's roads and 80 per cent of new vehicles are electric -- gasoline demand has gone down by only 4 per cent. That is because Norwegians are reluctant to give up their ICE cars even after they have bought an electric. Two-thirds of car owners in Norway have at least one ICE vehicle, and they continue to use it. Some political groups say electric cars are elitist and favour high-income families. That may be debatable, but the role of hybrids as a bridge to electric may be less so.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Since 2008, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency is running a star rating programme, under which electric equipment are rated according to their efficiency. This in turn helps the consumers save electricity. Intense heat has pumped up the sale of cooling equipment across the country. There has been a record spike in sales of air conditioners and refrigerators. There are new users coming from smaller towns and rural areas, apart from incremental demand from the existing urban consumers. According to the World Energy Outlook 2023, AC ownership in the country has tripled since 2010 to reach 24 units per 100 households. Along with space cooling, these sectors are now pushing India's electricity demand. Thanks to the increase in residential cooling, new 'high electricity demand' hours have emerged during the evening time, which was earlier only during office hours. With ACs, fridges, and space cooling becoming necessities, there are now concerns about their impact on the environment. Environment experts have repeatedly pointed out that ambient heat increases as more cooling equipment is installed. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are the main chemical gases used in coolants, are proven beyond doubt to be causing ozone layer depletion. India has a star rating programme for efficient electrical equipment and is a signatory to the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol for phase down of HFCs. But the spike in use of cooling equipment will inevitably cause more warming. Growing cooling landscape Space cooling now accounts for nearly 10 per cent of the country's electricity demand, which is now 21 per cent higher than its share in 2019. By 2050, household AC ownership in India is projected to increase nine-fold, leading to a nine-fold increase in energy demand for cooling, said a report by Delhi-based iForest, which has been at the forefront of building an action plan against environmentally harmful cooling chemicals. \"In room air conditioners, India's household penetration is around 8 per cent. Our market size will be around 11 million this year,\" said B Thiagarajan, managing director, Blue Star. \"China's market size is around 90 million. Now, India is the fastest growing market and India will also exceed China by 2045-2050,\" adds Thiagarajan. He pointed at a developing trend in AC purchases. \"The ( AC consumption ) growth in India is driven by an aspirational middle class. Over 90 per cent of ACs sold is to first time buyers. Around 65 per cent are bought by Tier 3-4-5,\" points out Thiagarajan. \"Over 50 per cent are through consumer finance -- this is broadly the profile of the Indian AC buyer. They are not going to afford a five-star air conditioner; they will afford only a three-star air conditioner or a two-star air conditioner,\" explains Thiagarajan. The lower the star rating, the less efficient and more environmentally hazardous the AC. An iForest survey of businesses in 2021 had indicated predominant use of HFC. While businesses showed an intention to move to natural refrigerants, none were using HC or CO2 refrigerants, while some were using NH3 and water as refrigerant. 'Penetration of natural refrigerant-based cooling and not-in-kind technologies in the market remains limited,' said the report. The report also noted that India was in the third stage of refrigerant transition. 'The phase out of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFC ) is complete. The hydrochlorofluorocarbons are expected to be phased out in India by 2030. 'Simultaneously, with a freeze in 2028 under the 'Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol', with no ozone depletion potential but with large global warming potentials, are set for a phase-down in India,' it said in a report titled Promoting Green Cooling in India and the Global South . Stars on your ACs Since 2008, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency is running a star rating programme, under which electric equipment are rated according to their efficiency. This in turn helps the consumers save electricity. The programme advertises how more energy efficient equipment help save power bills. High-rated equipment is also safer for the environment. The star rating metric keeps getting stringent, which the industry feels is a great marker of the Indian cooling market. \"Since 2008 onwards, every two or three years they have been tightening the label. Therefore, what you see today what is a one- or two-star rating was earlier a four- or a five-star,\" says Kamal Nandi, business head and executive vice president, Godrej Appliances. \"This whole collaboration between industry and government to bring out more energy efficient products is a continuous process and this will continue,\" Nandi adds. Godrej, he said, was continuously bringing out more green and energy efficient technologies. \"The effort -- from both industry side and government side -- is to bring greener technologies and to bring in more and more energy efficient products and this will happen.\" For consumers, there are campaigns for higher energy efficient products, both online and at store level. There are also calculators to show the payback when you pay a premium to buy a five-star rated appliance, how that premium is recovered in two years or so. But, Nandi adds, though the industry believes there should also be incentives for the consumers to adopt similar equipment. Higher star-rating equipment is costlier. \"We have been proposing to the government to bring in some sort of incentive for consumers to adopt the highest or the higher energy rated products like a four-star or five-star.\" As a country India was doing well in maintaining the green standards in the cooling industry, Thiagarajan says. \"I am of the view that we will be leading the world in terms of greening. I don't think we should burden the consumer by saying you should buy only five-star because the developed countries use it 24 hours, 365 days,\" he explains. 'Developed countries use air conditioners that are outdated. India that way has been demonstrating its commitment,' he says. Turning the debate over the Kigali agreement, Thiagarajan says Indian industry would be way ahead in its commitments and that would be solely because of market competition. He, however, is of the view that Indian market should get some grace time, compared to the developed world. \"I am of the view that this industry will do it ahead of time, because competition will force you. No one will wait, they will go ahead and launch it. \"I am telling my team that by 2030, we should have it ( targeted reduction on HFCs ),\" Thiagarajan says. While the industry dons more stars, it is time consumers counted them too. Feature Presentation: Ashish Narsale/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'The demand for housing is always increasing, and so is housing shortage.' New Delhi-based PNB Housing Finance will restart its corporate business after three years, its managing director and chief executive officer, Girish Kousgi , tells Harsh Kumar / Business Standard in an interview. The company, he says, will grow at a pace faster than the industry average. What is the future of the housing finance market in India? The real estate cycle is about 7-8 years. The demand for housing is always increasing, and so is housing shortage. With the government's focus on housing, the housing finance sector will only grow. Our focus is also going to be on growth and on the profitable segments. What is the plan for PNB Housing Finance's corporate business? We are planning to restart our corporate loan business this year after a gap of three years. There was a lot of stress on the corporate book, so about three years ago, we took a call to stop doing additional business. We have worked on resolving this and have brought down the NPAs (non-performing assets) to as low as about 3 per cent (in financial year 2024) from about 33 per cent as on March 2022. There were sales through ARCs (asset reconstruction companies), certain accounts were written off, and in some accounts, builders came forward for settlement. So, there were multiple strategies. Our focus on the corporate side will be in terms of the overall portfolio mix (retail included). At its peak, corporate will be less than 10 per cent. Currently, our corporate book is a little over Rs 2,000 crore. Our main focus will be on the retail business, and within that, mostly in the affordable and prime segments. What is your growth outlook for the company? We are looking to grow our retail book by 17 per cent, and disbursement will be 24 per cent of our book. Between December and March, we have opened 100 branches; so now we are at 300. This year, we plan to open another 50. If you look at our asset quality, our retail NPA is 1.45 per cent. By the end of the year, we are looking to bring it down to 1.1 per cent. How do you see PNB Housing standing amid rising competition in the housing finance market? See, there is a huge demand in the housing finance business - in all categories: super luxury, luxury, mid-segment, and affordable. We are present in three of the four segments: affordable, prime, and emerging. We are not there in the super-prime segment. We see demand in all the segments. So, we will be able to grow at a much faster pace. The industry will grow at about 13.5 per cent, and we should grow at about 17 per cent. What is your view on the Reserve Bank of India's draft guidelines on infrastructure financing? It is a draft. I don't think it should have any major impact. But in terms of provisioning, it is great. Scheduled commercial banks are expan-ding their reach in the housing finance market. Does that impact you? Yes, to a certain extent. Typically, banks are present in the prime and super-prime segments. We are not there in super-prime. In prime, there will be some overlap. Otherwise, on the affordable side, not too many banks are that aggressive. Last year, we grew more than 11 times in the affordable segment.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'When you look at reviving private sector capex, I don't think there's a better story than steel.' Tata Steel has a lot on its plate -- restructuring the business in the United Kingdom, expanding capacity back home, and keeping an eye on the balance sheet. \"On a year-on-year basis, we expect Ebitda per tonne in India to be reasonably flat but the volumes higher,\" Tata Steel Managing Director and CEO T V Narendran tells Ishita Ayan Dutt / Business Standard in a video interview. Steel spot spreads have improved and the blast furnace relining in The Netherlands, which was dragging the performance, is complete. Do you expect a better Q1? The blast furnace in The Netherlands went on stream only in the first week of February. So we didn't have the full quarter of supplies. To that extent The Netherlands Q1 will be better than Q4. The UK will not be because it had a one-off benefit of about ¬£50 million, which will not be there. In India, we expect Ebitda ( earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ) per tonne to be a little lower though the spreads have improved a bit because it's a quarter where we have a lot of shutdowns. So the volumes in Q1 will be less and hence the fixed cost gets distributed over a smaller volume. On a year-on-year basis, we expect Ebitda per tonne in India to be reasonably flat but the volumes higher. We will have 1.4 million tonnes net addition. In The Netherlands, Ebitda should be much better. In the UK, it will be negative but less than last year because the second half of the year will be Ebitda neutral or Ebitda positive. So overall, for Tata Steel, it will be better than last year. What is the status of the grant-funding agreement with the UK government? There were many finer points which were being worked out and now it is concluded. It's gone to the government, which will run through the process to approve it. We are in the final stages of it. With the UK headed for general elections, is there any risk to the agreement? We don't see that as a derailing factor. The closure of the heavy end is irrespective of who is in power simply because the assets have become end-of-life. You are investing ¬£750 million in the UK project over and above the restructuring cost. Will that impact expansion plans in India? The money needs to be spent over three-four years. So we don't expect that to derail growth plans in India. We must not forget that a lot of the support has been given to Europe when Tata Steel was much smaller. When we acquired Corus, we were 4 million tonnes ( mt ). Now we are 20 mt and going to 25 mt. So the India business, which generates all the cash, is getting bigger. And the UK, which was in some sense, drawing in the cash was 10 mt and is now 3 mt. So supporting the UK on a lower magnitude is easier than in the past. So where do we see Tata Steel in terms of capacity in the next two to three years? The Kalinganagar unit will have fully expanded and the Ludhiana plant will be ready. Bhushan Steel will go from 5 mt to 7 mt, Kalinganagar from 8 mt to 13 mt, and Neelachal from 1 mt to 5 mt. And if we find the operating model working in Ludhiana, we can quickly set up another two-three electric arc furnaces. So we may not complete all the expansion of 40 mt by 2030, but we will be well on our way at all the sites. Will imports into India weigh on expansion plans? Not yet, but if it sustains for another six months or so, it will hurt the domestic industry. When you look at reviving private sector capex, I don't think there's a better story than steel. Each is spending Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 15,000 crore ( Rs 100 billion to Rs 150 billion ) a year to expand. What is your capex for FY25? About Rs 17,000 crore ( Rs 170 billion ), of which around 75 per cent will be in India. Feature Presentation: Rajesh Alva/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live!

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'China is struggling to get out of its property bubble.' 'Japan took 35 years to walk out of its equity bubble.' 'Bubbles can be difficult to forecast.' The coalition setup won't impede the government's reforms agenda, which is driven by will and intent and not parliamentary majority, says Ridham Desai , chief equity strategist India, Morgan Stanley. In an interview with Samie Modak / Business Standard on the sidelines of the Morgan Stanley India Investment Forum, Desai says commitment towards fiscal consolidation and a push for infrastructure, manufacturing, and deeptech will be the key aspects to watch out for in the Union Budget. We saw a lot of volatility last fortnight. Will markets be stable now? Investors were a bit nervous on the day of the results, as they thought that running a coalition government might prove to be a problem. But what you've seen in terms of evidence over the past few days is not an issue. This is really a continuation of Modi 2.0. Also, the coalition setup does not really impede much of the economic agenda as it doesn't require a majority in Parliament. This is more about the will and intent of the leadership of the country. What to look for in the Union Budget? We should look for a reiteration of the message in February that the government is heading for strong fiscal consolidation and we'll borrow less than last year. We'll get a reaffirmation that that is going to be focus on select infrastructure sectors, like railways, where there's still more work to be done. We will get some indications about the government's commitment to manufacturing. I also think the government will reiterate its commitment to deeptech. Which themes will benefit from the government's push? One is that you want to buy from private sector lenders. They're going to get strong mid-teen loan growth. Two, the corporate sector will have space to start investing, which means that industrials will do well. We expect the government to continue to push forward on improving India's share of global exports. So manufacturing will gain a share of the economy over the next five to 10 years. A plethora of sectors have the focus of the government; it may be in the form of production-linked incentive scheme or goods and services tax rationalisation or faster approvals. These are defence, electronics, food processing, even laboratory-grown diamonds and renewables. Three, the government will continue to push social infrastructure, which includes getting the poor new homes, water, or toilets or health care facilities. India's energy consumption is set to rise quite sharply over the next 10 years. We are going to see a shift in the source of this energy consumption. Today, the bulk of it is fossil fuel; incrementally, it will be non-fossil; the entire renewable space, and I dare say, nuclear, will get a lot more attention. Have valuations in some of these sectors -- defence, for instance -- gone overboard? Yes, there will always be a few stocks that overreach. Then they'll correct, and then they'll give you a fresh opportunity. We focus on the themes and then get down to stock selection. On an aggregate market level, the India story is still priced at about halfway through this earnings cycle. Earnings could continue to compound at a rate of 20 per cent over the next four or five years. Some stocks may be a bit ahead of their earnings outlook; others are lagging behind. So that timing call is best left to how portfolio managers look at it. Have you set any Sensex targets? We have a Sensex target of 82,000 for next June. In fact, the Sensex will deliver fewer returns than earnings growth. Our equity strategists around the world are not very bullish on the equity asset class, and Indian markets don't operate in isolation. But my base case is that India continues to do well relative to the rest of the world. The absolute number hinges on how the aggregate world markets do, which we are not so constructive on. Which sectors are you underweight in? We are typically underweight in global-facing sectors and defensives, as we think local cyclicals will do well. What are some of the major global headwinds? There are actually multiple headwinds, which are not just global. One is, of course, that India does not have the same growth impulse from the world that China had when it was growing, as the world has aged since then and has a lot more debt. The other conundrum for India is that China has a lot of excess capacity -- way beyond its domestic demand. A lot of it will come into the global markets, and India will have to deal with that Chinese pricing pressure. China's currency will also depreciate, so that will add to the pressure that Indian companies may face as they try to gain share in global exports. Back home, we still have a lot of supply-side reforms to do. We have done a lot of work on physical and social infrastructure. But there's work to be done in the judiciary, bureaucracy, health care, education, and farming. There may be skill shortages as India tries to grow its manufacturing sector. Some of these capacity shortfalls will have to be addressed before India can aspire to lift its potential growth rate. If we are successful in doing that, my growth forecasts will turn out to be quite conservative. India recently hit the $5 trillion market capitalisation (mcap) milestone. When do you think we will cross $10 trillion? In our Blue Paper published in November 2022, we projected India's mcap to cross $10 trillion by 2031. However, at some point, you will get into a bubble because stocks don't trade in a linear fashion and markets tend to get ahead of themselves. I just hope that we don't get a bubble too soon. China is struggling to get out of its property bubble. Japan took 35 years to walk out of its equity bubble. Bubbles can be difficult to forecast.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'This is a good time to restructure your portfolio because the sectors and stocks that performed in the last bull market may not perform as much now.' On January 24, after four days of sharp selloff from 18,350 on January 18 to 17,150 on January 24, independent market expert Ambareesh Baliga had told Rediff.com that he was expecting Nifty to reach 16,000 levels if tensions between Ukraine and Russia continued to escalate. Exactly a month later on February 24, Nifty is looking down at the 16,000 mark as it closed the day at 16,250, a huge 4.78 per cent cut in the benchmark index, as markets the world over tanked weighed down by Russia's military invasion of Ukraine. As crude oil hovered around 98 dollars per barrel level in international markets and the US dollar rose 1.2 per cent against the Indian rupee, the markets also worried about India's balance of payments account, the fiscal deficit target set by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for fiscal 2022-2023, inflation and the rise in interest rates. As the Nifty and Sensex crashed almost 4.8 per cent on February 24, Prasanna D Zore/ Rediff.com spoke with Ambareesh Baliga and Deven Choksey of K R Choksey to take stock of how India is poised to weather this storm. Here's what they said. Deven Choksey: 'If the markets don't hold this level ( 16,350 ), then we can easily see another 400-500 point fall' Do you look at Thursday's selloff as panic selling or there is more to come in the days ahead as world figures out how the Russia-Ukraine conflict plays out? We have seen a global fall and it is bound to happen that markets react to a variety of factors with different intensity. Markets react to crude prices, war, uncertainty, differently. So, markets reaction is very relative in nature. Definitely, investors, big or small, would play it safe in such an environment, so this kind of fall is naturally expected. One will have to wait and watch how the situation pans out in Eastern Europe. Do you see this panic abating in the days ahead or will it escalate further? My point is that if this war/invasion with/of Ukraine doesn't translate into a global war situation even after ( US and Western ) sanctions ( on Russia ), then I think this panic will settle down. Importantly, if war doesn't escalate then sanctions in themselves don't mean anything. So, markets will settle down. God forbid, if this war happens, then too India is in a position to attract significant amount of money from global investors because they will then find huge value in Indian markets at a cheaper price. Whichever situation you look at it, according to me, there is no need to panic; let the situation settle down. What impact could this conflict have on India's macro economy and hence on Indian equity markets? Whatever negative impact our economy faces will be transitory in nature. Higher inflation, higher cost of production, higher possibility of interest rate hikes, everything will be transitional. Where will the markets settle down in this situation? I can't say exactly how long the markets will take to settle down ,but this won't last permanently. Currently, the surge ( in panic ) has happened, but it will have to settle down. Any key levels to watch out for in the days ahead? 16,350 was an important level, which broke today ( Thursday, February 24 ) as the markets closed around 16,250. If the markets don't hold this level ( of 16,350 ), then we can easily see another 400-500 point fall. I think this is a possibility. If markets settle down around after another 400-500 point fall, where should investors look at for value buying? In every correction that we have seen this year, investors are seeing value because fundamentals of businesses haven't changed. Will this conflict cast any shadow on the LIC IPO? Too early to say anything ( about the LIC IPO ). Let us allow things to settle. Ambareesh Baliga: 'If you are looking to buy Rs 100 worth of stocks you should buy stocks worth Rs 20 NOW' When we spoke on January 24, you had said we could reach 16,000 levels on Nifty if tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue. We are almost close to that level. What next? It is likely to break 16,000 now and move towards 15,000. Now, looking at the situation and the way things are it is unlikely to get resolved in the next two-three days. It will take a while longer, which means that tomorrow if we open lower, and most probably we will open lower, then I think we could see panic selling. One can say today ( Thursday, February 24 ) was a day of bloodbath, but we did not see the panic which we normally see in situations like these. Based on the developments we could see panic selling either tomorrow or on Monday. What factors could help this panic to abate? Difficult to say, but as of now if the tensions in Eastern Europe were to settle down in the next seven to 10 days one could see some semblance of calm ( in the markets ) then. If tensions escalate, then no one knows where we could be headed to. We can see even lower ( than 15,000 ) levels. As of now, one hopes that the situation will return to normal sooner and tensions will de-escalate. What impact could this conflict have on India's macro-economic indicators? We are going to see its impact on the Indian currency, interest rates, inflation and that's the reason the markets reacted ( today ). If oil goes towards 110 ( US dollars per barrel ) and possibly 120 ( US dollars per barrel ) if tension escalates further, then that will have an impact on our balance of payments because we import 85 per cent of our crude requirements. At the same time, exports too will suffer because of geo-political tensions. Of course, our forex reserves are much better than what we had during the Gulf crisis ( US invasion of Iraq in January 1991 ) and even a decade ago. That will in fact lead to rise in inflation and interest rates, and we are already in that sort of a situation; even though the RBI has postponed the rate hikes ( during its monetary policy meeting on February 10 ), they would still look at it in their next meeting. We also don't know, looking at the situation, what will happen to the LIC IPO. If tensions escalate, it could get a bit difficult for the LIC IPO. If government postpones it, then you miss FY22 target ( of garnering divestment revenues and fiscal deficit ) because we are still short of Rs 64,000 crore, which was expected to come from LIC. If panic sets in and we head for another bout of selling which sectors and stocks could provide bunker-like protection to investors? Sectors like pharma, autos to a decent extent because that is domestic market business, infrastructure plays and to a certain extent FMCG sector because I don't really see domestic consumption or manufacturing getting affected so much. What's your advice for retail investors now? If investors have cash in hand, they should utilise the next fortnight or three weeks to buy because this is an opportunity to buy and expect things to settle down. Our experience of past several decades tell us that whenever tensions like these happen, markets settle down in some time. End of the day, across the globe, nobody really wants situation to deteriorate further. Don't wait for the bottom. If you are looking to buy Rs 100 worth of stocks you should buy stocks worth Rs 20 NOW. In case you don't have cash to deploy, then this is still a good time to restructure your portfolio to ride the next move because the sectors and stocks that performed in the last bull market may not perform as much now. If tensions further escalate, would we be heading towards March 2020 COVID-19 lows? No. I think we have moved quite ahead of that already. To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live!

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Having exposure to international funds and gold is a must for those who have foreign currency-denominated goals, suggests Sanjay Kumar Singh. If your child is headed to a university in the United States soon and you have to pay her fees in the coming days, then the recent depreciation of the rupee from the 72-plus level in March to 75-plus in April to Rs 77.69 in the opening trade on Tuesday, May 17, 2022, would have left you worried. The bigger cause for worry, however, is the tendency of the rupee to depreciate against the US dollar over the long term. Over the past 10 financial years, on average, the rupee has depreciated at a compounded annual rate of 4.7 per cent against the dollar (between 2011-2011 and 2020-2021). Today people have multiple goals that will require them to spend in foreign currencies --children's higher education, foreign travel, purchase of house abroad, and so on. Clearly, they need to build a portfolio that can safeguard them against the trend of currency depreciation. High inflation differential Why does the rupee keep depreciating against the dollar over the long term? Says Abheek Barua, chief economist, HDFC Bank: \"India keeps losing trade competitiveness due to the higher inflation rate in our economy vis-a-vis that of our trading partners.\" While the US usually runs a low inflation rate (two per cent or less), in India it is much higher. The Consumer Price Index (Industrial Workers)-based inflation has averaged 6.7 per cent over the past 10 financial years. The rupee depreciates due to this erosion in competitiveness. Barua explains that the depreciation would have been higher, but for the fact that the Indian markets receive robust capital inflows. Invest in international funds The best way to deal with this issue is to have a geographically diversified portfolio, that is, hold dollar assets. \"Build a simple portfolio comprised 50:50 of a Nifty index fund and an S&P 500 index fund,\" says Avinash Luthria, a Sebi-registered investment advisor and founder, Fiduciaries. Not only will investing abroad give you the benefit of geographical diversification, holding dollar-based assets will also make your portfolio less susceptible to currency risk. The US market has been in a continuous bull run since 2009, making many investors wonder if it is prudent to invest in it anymore. \"Stagger your entry into a US fund by taking the systematic investment plan ( SIP ) route. Also, do not go just for the big-tech stocks, which have appreciated the most but take more diversified exposure,\" says Vishal Dhawan, chief financial planner, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors. Investing in a broad, globally diversified equity fund is another option. \"It is difficult for investors in India to know which country or theme will do well in the future. With a global fund, they can entrust this task to expert fund managers,\" says Ajit Menon, chief executive officer, PGIM India Mutual Fund, which runs the PGIM India Global Equity Opportunity Fund. Menon informs that their fund tries to capture new themes that are catching on across the globe -- on-demand economy (video streaming, education on-demand, etc), cloud-based technology, data security, e-commerce, digital payment services, robotics and automation, and health tech. For international funds to have an impact, they must make up at least 15-20 per cent of an investor's equity portfolio. LRS route for evolved investors Investors may also take the liberalised remittance scheme (LRS) route, which allows them to invest up to $250,000 abroad annually per person. They would have to open an account with one of the brokerage platforms that enable Indian investors to invest directly in markets like the US. The key attractiveness of this route is that the investor gets more options in terms of the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and stocks he can choose from. \"However, the tax-related compliances become more complicated,\" says Luthria. Only bigger, more sophisticated investors should opt for this route. Take exposure to gold Having an exposure to gold can also help investors counter the rupee's depreciation. The international price of gold is determined in dollars. The Indian price of gold is derived from the international dollar price. Suppose that you have one dollar worth of gold. And one dollar equals, say, Rs 75. Even if the rupee depreciates from 75 to 80, with the gold that you hold you can still buy one dollar. However, like all commodities, gold too witnesses prolonged up cycles and down cycles. So, invest in the yellow metal for the long term and limit exposure to 10-15 per cent of portfolio. Direct investors: Understand the nuances Generally, a depreciating rupee benefits exporters while affecting importers adversely. Those who run direct stock portfolios need to dig deeper to understand the impact of currency depreciation on their holdings. \"Some companies import certain raw materials and export a part of their finished goods, so the net impact on them is not high. Many hedge their net foreign exchange exposure, protecting them from wild movements in the short term. Some companies have pricing power, given the nature of their product and favourable industry structure, and are able to revise pricing to adjust for adverse currency movements,\" says Jatin Khemani, founder and chief executive officer, Stalwart Investment Advisors, a Sebi-registered independent equity research firm. He adds that instead of generalising the impact, investors need to understand each company's business model. \"Look at how the financials moved in the past when the currency behaved wildly. That will help you understand how resilient the business model is,\" adds Khemani. Ankur Kapur, managing partner, Plutus Capital, a Sebi-registered investment advisory firm, adds: \"The IT sector is likely to be a net gainer. In the case of pharma, chemicals, and paints, all of which import inputs, the impact will depend on how much they export or can raise prices. Build a portfolio diversified across sectors so that the currency impact is mitigated.\" To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Keep sufficient funds in your bank account until the cheque is cleared. Cheque bounce is back in the news with three cases making the headlines. A court in Maharashtra's Thane district sentenced a businessman to rigorous imprisonment for three months and directed him to pay double the bounced amount. A metropolitan court punished a man in Gujarat with a one-year jail sentence. The Sikkim high court recently ruled that offences under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act can be compounded at any stage. What is a cheque bounce? Cheque bounce or 'dishonour of cheque' occurs when a drawee is unable to withdraw money using a cheque due to certain limitations. It is covered by the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act), 1881, which aims to deter the issuance of cheques without sufficient funds in the bank account, and provides legal remedy to the aggrieved party. Insufficient funds Section 138 of the NI Act mentions two reasons for cheque bounce. Tushar Agarwal, advocate, Supreme Court of India, says, \"First, there is insufficient money in the account. Second, the cheque amount exceeds the arrangement the account holder has with the bank.\" The second reason refers to the cheque amount being higher than the account's withdrawal limit. Over time various other reasons have emerged. Signature or number mismatch : A cheque can be dishonoured if there is a discrepancy between the drawer's signature on the cheque and the specimen signature available with the bank. Pratyush Miglani, managing partner, MVAC Advocates & Consultants, says, \"This is done to avert fraudulent activities like forgery.\" A number mismatch may arise if the cheque number entered in the MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) code line doesn't correspond with the pre-printed cheque number. Expired or damaged cheque : A cheque is usually valid for three months from the date of issuance. If presented after this period, it is not honoured. The bank may also declare a damaged or mutilated cheque as invalid. Miglani says, \"Essential elements like the date, payee's name, amount, and signature must be legible and undamaged for successful processing.\" Stop payment instruction: The issuer may have instructed the bank to stop the payment due to reasons like a dispute, suspicion of fraud, loss of the cheque, or change in circumstances. Legal consequences Cheque bounce is a criminal offence under Section 138 of the NI Act Suhael Buttan, counsel, SKV Law Offices, says, \"The sentence can be for up to two years; a fine, which can be extended to twice the amount covered by the dishonoured cheque; or both.\" Anushkaa Arora, principal & founder, ABA Law Office, adds, \"Bail can be secured when the matter is pending in lower court. Post-conviction the chances of bail become bleak.\" Regarding legal notice, Abhinay Sharma, managing partner, ASL Partners, points out, \"The receiver of the bounced cheque can send a legal notice to the issuer within 30 days of receiving the bounce memo from the bank.\" Sections 143A and 148 have been inserted through recent amendments. Buttan says, \"These sections give the trial or the appellate court the right to direct payment of interim compensation during the trial and deposit of a certain minimum sum in an appeal by the drawer of cheque against conviction.\" The Sikkim high court recently ruled that offences under Section 138 of the NI Act can be compounded at any stage. This means the parties can enter into a compromise and settle the matter out of court. Proceed with caution Keep sufficient funds in your bank account until the cheque is cleared. Fill all details correctly. If there is any doubt, verify with the bank that your signature hasn't changed. Also avoid overwriting. If availability of funds is an issue, communicate with the payee and resolve the matter instead of issuing the cheque. Use the Sikkim high court's recent ruling to compromise and settle out of court. M Barve, founder, MB Wealth Financial Solutions suggests making online payments. Landlords can use cheque bounce laws to their advantage. \"Take one or a few signed cheques in advance. The stringent consequences of bounced cheques will ensure you get the rent on time and there is no default.\" Check bounce: Fallout can be expensive The bank may charge the issuer a penalty, which can range from Rs 50 to Rs 750 If the cheque amount is not paid within the stipulated time, the receiver may be entitled to claim interest on the cheque amount The issuer's credit score could take a beating This can make it difficult to obtain credit in the future Feature Presentation: Ashish Narsale/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live!

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Passenger vehicle wholesales in India witnessed a marginal growth in May on account of high base effect and muted demand due to general elections. The overall passenger vehicle dispatches from companies to dealers stood at 350,257 lakh units last month as compared to 335,436 in the same month a year ago, registering a growth of 4 per cent. Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) said its total domestic passenger vehicle sales rose marginally to 144,002 units last month from 143,708 units in the year-ago period. The company saw year-on-year dip in sales of entry level and compact cars last month as against May 2023. Utility vehicle sales, including that of Brezza, Grand Vitara, Ertiga, S-Cross and XL6, however, rose to 54,204 units last month as against 46,243 units a year earlier. \"It has been discussed that growth this year will not be very high. It will be in single digit because of the high base effect. \"Secondly, there were elections and the scorching temperatures also had an impact on the overall sales in May,\" MSI senior executive officer (marketing & sales) Partho Banerjee told reporters. He further said: \"We are very hopeful that we will start seeing the green shoots coming with the election results coming in. \"I think things will turn around.\" Banerjee noted that the company is going to introduce a limited edition trims of its entry level cars -- Alto K10, S-Presso and Celerio -- in order to rejuvenate the small car segment. The Dream Series edition trims of the three models will be launched at a price point of Rs 4.99 lakh (ex-showroom), he said. \"Based on the feedback of our target customers we have come up with an edition in which we are mostly focusing on the utilities and convenience features,\" Banerjee said. Sales of Maruti Suzuki's mini segment cars, comprising Alto and S-Presso, declined to 9,902 units last month from 12,236 units in May 2023. Rival Hyundai Motor India reported a 1 per cent year-on-year increase in domestic dispatch of vehicles to dealers last month. The company's wholesales rose to 49,151 units in May as compared to 48,601 units in May 2023. Hyundai Motor India COO Tarun Garg said that the sales growth this financial year is anticipated to remain in low single digit range. \"In April also the industry grew by around 1.5 per cent ...so April plus May the industry growth should be around 2-2.5 per cent over same period last year,\" he noted. Tata Motors said its passenger vehicle sales, including electric vehicles, in the domestic market, were up 2 per cent at 47,075 units as compared to 45,984 units in the year-ago month. Mahindra & Mahindra on the other hand reported a robust 31 per cent year-on- year increase in passenger vehicle dispatches last month at 43,218 units. It had sold 32,886 units in May 2023. Toyota Kirloskar Motor reported a 24 per cent year-on-year increase in total wholesales in May at 25,273 units as compared to that of same month last year. Kia India said its total wholesales increased 4 per cent year-on-year to 19,500 units in May. The automaker had dispatched 18,766 units to dealers in May 2023. \"So far in this year, we have been aggressive in introducing new competitive variants of our models, which has contributed significantly to our sales,\" Kia India senior VP and head sales & marketing Hardeep Singh Brar said. With a robust network expansion strategy in place, the company shall continue to grow in the rest of the year and cross 1 million domestic sales milestone soon, he added. MG Motor India reported a 5 per cent dip in wholesales at 4,769 units in May compared to the same month last year. The company had dispatched 5,006 units to dealers in May 2023.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Automakers dispatched over 3.47 lakh passenger vehicles to dealers in domestic market in May, recording an year-on-year growth of 4 per cent over same month last year, industry body SIAM said on Tuesday. The overall passenger vehicle (PV) dispatches from companies to dealers stood at 3,47,492 units last month, as compared to 3,34,537 units in May 2023. The dispatches were the highest ever for the month of May so far, driven by robust offtake of utility vehicles. Maruti Suzuki sold 1,44,002 units last month, as against 1,43,708 units in May 2023. Hyundai Motor India dispatched 49,151 units in May, as compared to 48,601 units in May 2023. Mahindra & Mahindra sold 43,218 units last month, as against 32,886 units in the year-ago period. All the segments -- passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, two-wheelers and three-wheelers have posted growth in May, as compared to the same month last year, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) President Vinod Aggarwal said in a statement. \"Passenger vehicles have only witnessed a moderate growth, primarily owing to a high base effect of the previous year,\" he noted. Two-wheeler sales rose 10 per cent to 16,20,084 units last month, as compared to 14,71,550 units in the year-ago period. Three-wheeler dispatches rose 15 per cent to 55,763 units in May, as against 48,610 units in May 2023. \"With expectations of above normal monsoon and continued emphasis on economic development by the new government, as it pursues its goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047, the auto industry is optimistic of steady growth in 2024-25 as well,\" Aggarwal stated. Elaborating further, SIAM director general Rajesh Menon said PV dispatches last month were the highest ever in May so far. Two-wheelers saw a growth of 10 per cent last month but still remains lower than 2017-18 levels of May, he said. \"Domestic sales of three-wheelers in May 2024 grew by 14.7 per cent compared to May 2023, posting the highest-ever sales in May,\" Menon said.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'The scheme excludes tractors, light commercial vehicles, and medium and heavy commercial vehicles.' Chennai-based Murugappa Group-promoted Tube Investments of India (TII) is expanding its presence in the electric vehicle (EV) market by entering the small commercial vehicle (SCV) and tractor segments. About six months after launching its three-wheeler, it has already captured a 35 per cent market share in South India, says Arun Murugappan , executive chairman of TII. In an exclusive interview with Shine Jacob / Business Standard , Murugappan discusses the EV road map, semiconductor plans, and the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India III (FAME III) wish list. You are the makers of iconic cycles like BSA and Hercules. What led to your foray into EVs? TII was originally 90 per cent dependent on the automotive industry. We decided to diversify into other businesses and chose four areas: medical, EVs, contract development and manufacturing organisation, and electronics. In EVs, we decided to move forward with four platforms and formed a subsidiary called TI Clean Mobility. Under this, we have already launched three-wheelers and 55-tonne trucks. The two additional segments we plan to launch are SCV and tractor. SCV will be launched by the end of the second quarter, around August or September. The tractor launch will take a bit longer. I am happy with the performance of our three-wheelers. It has been five to six months since we started selling these three-wheelers, predominantly in South India, and we already have a market share of close to 35 per cent in the region. Why are you betting big on SCVs? There is a strong push for electrification in last-mile delivery. SCVs are easily manoeuvrable in the city and can cover 150-200 kilometres on a single charge. We believe that 25-30 per cent of these SCVs will be electrified by 2030. To achieve this target, annual penetration needs to be between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. In the SCV segment, Tivolt Electric Vehicles, a venture of Murugappa Group and a subsidiary of TI Clean Mobility, is preparing to introduce its electric SCV under the brand Montra Electric. We plan to offer a full range of vehicles below 3.5 tonnes. Over the next 13 to 18 months, the entire range will be available in the market. We have a production capacity of about 50,000 units per year. From the policy side, what support do you require as the majority of these segments are excluded from the FAME subsidy? The FAME scheme excludes tractors, light commercial vehicles, and medium and heavy commercial vehicles. These vehicles are top polluters, and 50 per cent of commercial vehicles fall into these categories. We have approached the Government of India through the National Highways Authority of India to include these segments in the FAME category. The government aims for 70 per cent of all electric three-wheelers to be electrified. The main challenge is the charging infrastructure, which requires both government and private participation. We need a common charging standard and a proper scrappage policy. Also, incentives should be provided for SCVs to reduce the price gap with internal combustion engine vehicles. Murugappa Group was one of the first groups in the country to foray into EV two-wheelers way back in 2008, but then you exited the business. How different is the EV segment and your preparations this time? In 2008, we were ahead of our time. I wasn't involved in that project. This time, our products have undergone extensive testing, and we are confident they will be successful. We have made focused efforts, formed a separate company, and hired the best people in the field. This is the first time we have become an original equipment manufacturer through our three-wheeler launch. We are investing Rs 3,000 crore in the EV business. We aim to produce best-in-class products in all four categories. Currently, we have no plans for two- and four-wheelers. What are your plans for battery and semiconductor supply? For batteries, we have partnered several companies and will set up a battery packing plant in Coimbatore by the end of this year. For semiconductors, CG Power and Industrial Solutions has obtained a licence in Sanand. We will leverage CG Power's expertise. The unit will be operational in 2025-26, with investments of around Rs 7,600 crore. We have a technical partner in Renesas Electronics Corporation. What is your strategy for trucks, and what response are you getting for them? Tractors will take some time because the battery needs to last for several hours. We are working on extending battery life and hope to launch tractors by the beginning of next year. Currently, we are using trucks in the cement and steel industries to transport materials from mines to factories. The main issue with trucks is the high capital expenditure. We are working on reducing the cost of trucks. Feature Presentation: Aslam Hunani/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'We are expected to grow at above 28 per cent this year, higher than the industry.' Shriram Life Insurance Company, a joint venture between Shriram Group and South Africa-based Sanlam Ltd, is betting big on the rural market, from where it gets about 45 per cent of its business. Casparus J H Kromhout , managing director and chief executive officer, talks to Shine Jacob / Business Standard about its growth road map, rural market penetration, and expansion plans in the lower-income population at the company's office in Chennai. Overall life insurance penetration in India is hardly 3-4 per cent now. How do you look at this? There is a lot of focus on it now, with the regulator in the past few years putting emphasis on it. We are seeing some movement, but penetration is still quite low, and the opportunity is big. India is a country of countries in many ways, and each of the states is extremely large. Even though it has grown, there is still a lot that can be done because India is below the world average. In South Africa, from where I come, life insurance penetration is closer to 12 per cent. The focus in India is still on people in the higher-income segment. There is a bit more awareness now, but life insurance is still seen mostly as a tax-saving alternative. If you look at penetration in the lower-income segment, it is significantly less. As an industry, we have a big job to reach out to more families and get them covered. Whether it is finance or insurance, Shriram focuses on communities that typically do not get covered by the mainstream. According to reports, Private life-insurance firms are expected to grow 9-12 per cent in FY24. How do you see your growth? Profits are very good, and we are investing very significantly in capacity for business development. Life insurance is a face-to-face activity, and the tough job for anybody is to sell it to people. We are expected to grow at above 28 per cent this year, higher than the industry. Around 45 per cent of our business comes from rural India. The focus for us is retail business, and that's where we are seeing growth. Last year, we had 24 per cent growth. What is the impact of the new norms on taxing the total returns on high-value life insurance policies on your company? We are in a segment where we cover more families with lower premiums. We are in a segment where only a few customers are able to spend more than Rs 5 lakh on insurance premiums. We are trying to cover the aam aadmi , and the large segments of society. Percentage-wise, such high-end customers will be insignificant for us and will be in decimals, if at all. The average annual premium for the industry is Rs 60,000-70,000, whereas for us it is around Rs 20,000. Now, we are number seven in terms of the number of policies that we serve, but the premium size is much lower. So, for us, there is no impact of the base effect following the change in norms. We are protected as a company. You have a 45 per cent share in the rural market, one of the highest in the industry. What will be your strategy? The rural population in India is 65-70 per cent of the total. It is much more difficult to reach rural customers. We are committed to this market. With Shriram Group, we have a large customer base in the rural market, where cross-selling of the life insurance business can happen. Their life is not protected for additional money for the families, if something happens. We have reached out to them. Our strategy will be to continuously increase the access that we have through Shriram Group. We create business models that are unique and technology-driven in rural areas -- feet-on-street models. Where do you like to see the rural market after three years? I want the share of the rural market to cross 50 per cent. We will be growing quite fast. We are seeing over 20 per cent growth year-on-year as a plan towards 2030. At present, closer to 50 per cent claims are coming from the rural market. Our claim settlement ratio was around 97.4 per cent in FY23, up from 95 per cent in FY21. This financial year we are targeting around 98 per cent. We are on a par with the top players and are focusing on a sector in which risk and mortality are higher.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The governor made it clear that the RBI is aware of what's happening and acts accordingly, but doesn't make a noise about that, points out Tamal Bandyopadhyay. Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das, a cricket aficionado, wants all who bat on the banking and non-banking finance turf, and the stakeholders, to play long term -- like Rahul Dravid. That's his message to the entire financial sector, delivered at Business Standard 's BFSI Summit in Mumbai last fortnight Dravid, often called 'Mr Dependable' and 'The Wall', signifies the three Cs that are essential ingredients for success -- commitment, consistency and class. He stood out for his hard work, never-say-die spirit, and a super-cool temperament against all odds. Governor Das expects these qualities from the players in the financial sector. The 70-minute fireside chat with him that ended the two-day mega show touched upon quite a few sensitive issues, and the governor did not shy away from explaining how the banking regulator looks at them. For instance, the RBI has been closely watching the business model of banks. A few bankers and sector analysts often wonder whether that's a regulator's job. Shouldn't that be left to the bankers themselves? The governor's answer is clear: The RBI doesn't get down to the nitty-gritty of the business models, but it continuously evaluates whether the model is sustainable. For instance, if a bank depends on a mix of just corporate loans and unsecured loans, it could invite trouble for itself. It must have a bouquet of loan products (including home loans, auto loans et al ) to avoid concentration risks. Similarly, if a bank is into retail loans in a big way and supports that with money sourced from wholesale deposits, it may face problems (interpretation is mine). India's banking sector, particularly private banks, has been finding it extremely difficult to attract and retain talent. In private, a few say the RBI could be more liberal in clearing the salary and perks of bankers. \"Even if we want to pay a handsome bonus to our employees, there are many restrictions,\" they say. The governor is aware of the problem of attrition; he has pointed this out to the banks and left it to them to tackle the HR issue. But he doesn't agree with the perception of the RBI being unfair in approving bankers' salary and perks. The salary of a public sector bank employee is typically determined by an industry-wide wage settlement, brokered by the Indian Banks' Association, while the government norm determines the managing directors' and executive directors' pay packages. The RBI comes into the picture only for the packages of the whole-time directors of private banks. It objects to the proposed package only when it finds it too high for a bank that is too small and/or not doing well. In other words, the perks and salary of top bankers should be in sync with the performance and size of the banks they head. The governor has made it clear that the regulator is alert and aware of what's happening in the sector and acts accordingly, but doesn't make a noise about that. Why? The explanation is somewhat similar to what Ananth Narayan, whole-time member of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, discussed in his speech on the first day of the summit. He spoke about 'Type-1' and 'Type-2' errors of a regulator. In this context, 'Type-1' errors could be the regulator missing certain misconducts of banks that are detrimental to their health. If the regulator goes to town with this, it runs the risk of misinterpretation of its action, which could play havoc with the system. After all, banks deal with public money. That's a 'Type-2' error. Das implicitly said the RBI knows what's happening in the banking system and takes actions accordingly -- but this is done quietly, below the radar. To rectify certain mistakes, it doesn't want to take steps that can be more disruptive and cause systemic problems. The governor also emphasised the importance of governance for a sustainable growth. A bank cannot grow with weak governance, for long. Kicking off the summit, veteran banker and the uncrowned king of retail banking in India, K V Kamath, highlighted the health and resilience of the banking sector -- the best in the past five decades. They are well capitalised and the level of bad loans of the industry is very low. They are also earning good interest income as credit offtake continues to be high. He pointed out that a committee (headed by him) had recommended the restructuring of loans worth Rs 9 trillion of 26 sectors post-Covid, but the banking system restructured only Rs 45,000 crore worth of loans since the Indian economy has been on a firm growth path. Bosses of private banks discussed a subject that has been the talk of the town -- should banks become technology companies? Should the techies run them? The consensus is: No. Banks must remain banks as the business is subject to strict regulations. Beyond technology, which the banks are riding on, banking is all about compliance, underwriting and risk management, and trust is key to the business. Yes, they need to understand technology and use it to move ahead, and that can be done by forging partnerships with fintechs, forming tech subsidiaries or having techies on the payroll, but a banker must be in the driver's seat. They also say there is a digital bank within every bank. Both private and public sector banks feel the good time is here to stay. They don't agree that there are cracks in retail and unsecured loan segments. Even if there are minor issues, the banks are well equipped to tackle them. State Bank of India Chairman Dinesh Khara, too, belongs to this camp. Exuding confidence, he said the country's largest lender (it has a little over 20 per cent share of the banking industry) does not have any concern over the quality of assets and is well equipped to face any challenges. Incidentally, SBI, one of the top 50 banks globally by assets, is readying to roll out version 2.0 of YONO ('You only need one'), its integrated digital banking platform, in nine months. Of its 480 million customers, 70 million are on the YONO platform and 97 per cent of SBI's transactions don't happen in its branches. YONO intends to become a 'primary digital bank of choice' in the coming years. Finally, all banks are aware of the war for deposits that has been on for quite some time now. The assets under management of the mutual fund industry in September rose to nearly Rs 48 trillion, one-fourth of the banking industry's deposit base. The savings community has started exploring different assets to park their surplus money. But the bankers don't think offering higher interest rates is the only way to attract money. Bundling products, making the bank a one-stop shop for all financial needs, and caring for customers are the key to deposit mobilisation. Yes, they are talking about customer engagement and not business targets. Neglected for long, customers finally seem to be ready to take centre stage in Indian banking.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'SUV is a very intensely fought category, unlike hatchbacks and cars.' In line with the industry trend, Tata Motors unveiled the updated versions of its popular sports utility vehicles -- the Safari and the Harrier. Speaking on the sidelines of the launch in Chennai, Shailesh Chandra , managing director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, spoke to Shine Jacob / Business Standard about the future of SUVs, the electric vehicle industry, and other issues. You have come up with new versions of the Safari and the Harrier. What was the thought behind launching their diesel models only? This segment is about 16,000 units a month. Diesel vehicles account for nearly 80 per cent of the sales. There is a high preference for diesel, at least in the high-end SUV segment. So, we focused on diesel ( SUVs ) because people love them due to a very good torque performance and high fuel efficiency. We realise that petrol will also grow and it gives you a more affordable price point. Therefore, we have started the development of a 1.5 litre GDi engine. It will not be coming in the near future and may take beyond one year. About 52 per cent of the passenger vehicles sold in September were SUVs. Do you think the trend will continue? We have been hovering around 18 to 23 per cent share. This ( SUV ) is a very intensely fought category, unlike hatchbacks and cars. It also depends on the number of launches by players. For six-seven quarters, we were number one in this category. Our focus has been that each of our SUVs is on the top in its respective category. The Punch is number one in its category; the Nexon is number one in its category and among all SUVs; and then you have the Harrier-Safari combo, which is number two. All are doing well. We will come up with the Curvv and the Sierra in both EV and ICE ( internal combustion engine ) categories in 2024 and 2025, respectively. You are focusing a lot on EVs, but facing competition too. How are you seeing the market growth? We have strong potential. With competition, our market is also growing. We would always be at a growth rate of above 50 per cent. Last year, on average, we sold 11,000-12,000 EVs a quarter. In the last two quarters of this year, we saw sales of 19,000-20,000 units each. Sales have grown despite rising competition. The focus on charging infrastructure will be crucial. The government should also make a push. What steps are being taken to tide over EV infrastructure bottlenecks? We are in discussions with the government, so that OMCs ( oil-marketing companies ) and other players are pushed to install about 22,000 chargers they were planning to come up with. Going forward, we will see a lot of very long-range vehicles. If you are able to unleash common chargers for different residential complexes, that should also give a lot of comfort. What is your strategy for localisation of EVs? Tiago localisation was at 60 per cent and we got a PLI ( production-linked incentive ) certificate for that. Our aim is that we should not stick to what is the requirement of PLI, but keep enough headroom. We are also aware that the group is also investing into cell manufacturing through Agratas Energy Storage Solution. That will be a big thing, so deeper localisation is the way forward for us. In the first quarter of the calendar year, Tata Motors' sales numbers were high. However, they seem to be coming down. What are the reasons for this? In the first quarter, our market share was around 14 per cent. We had been selling around 140,000 cars a quarter, which we did in Q2 as well. We were impacted during the quarter as we brought down the production of the Nexon, Harrier and Safari deliberately because we were transitioning to new models. The Nexon, which had been selling 16,000 units, was brought down to 8,000. The Harrier-Safari combine also sold around 4,500 units, which was brought down to around 2,200 units. However, other cars compensated for this. Punch sales went up from 10,000 to 14,000 during the quarter, and the Altroz went up from 6,000 to 8,000. On the other hand, the Tiago and the Tigor sustained their numbers. There is no fall in volume, but there is a fall in market share because of the loss of outgoing models, which I think should come back.= What do you think the updated versions of the Harrier and the Safari mean for Tata Motors as a company? The Safari is an iconic brand. In 2021, we thought we should reimagine this brand so that it continued as a modern SUV. On the other hand, the Harrier is based on the D8 platform from Land Rover and started a new trend in the SUV segment in 2019, where it brought the aesthetics, stance and in-cabin experience closer to what you get in high-price SUV or a premium SUV, appealing to the young achievers. Since then, both these products have been doing very well and we have sold around 165,000 units. They have become better in every aspect -- technology, comfort, and safety. A lot of comfort features are there, but what has gone to the next level is safety. Feature Presentation: Rajesh Alva/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Finally, some good news for the Indian startup ecosystem. After four consecutive half-year periods of declining funding since 2022, the first half (H1) of 2024 has shown an upward trend compared to the second half (H2) of 2023. According to the India Tech Semi-Annual Funding Report H1 2024 by Tracxn, Indian technology (tech) startups raised $4.1 billion in H1 2024, marking a 4 per cent increase from $3.96 billion in H2 2023. However, this represents a 13 per cent decrease compared to the $4.8 billion raised in H1 2023. India, which ranked as the fourth-highest-funded country globally in the tech startup landscape, slipped a position as China advanced in the pecking order in terms of raising higher funds. China raised a total of $6.2 billion in H1 2024, becoming the third-highest funded country. In H1 2023, India had surpassed China to be the third-highest fundraising country globally. Although China raised more funds, the total number of funding rounds for the period was 327, lower than India‚Äôs 540. Additionally, the number of first-time-funded companies in India, at 168, was higher than China‚Äôs 159. The US continued to lead in overall funding volumes, followed by the UK. Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn, commented, ‚ÄúDespite four consecutive half-year periods of declining funding since H1 2022, we are now showing signs of stabilisation and an upward trend. \"India‚Äôs robust performance as the fourth-highest-funded country in the tech startup ecosystem is encouraging. \"From emerging developments in retail and enterprise applications to pioneering advancements in financial technology (fintech), Indian startups are transforming industries and driving economic growth.‚Äù The funding landscape across different stages showed varied trends: seed-stage funding increased to $455 million, up by 6.5 per cent from H2 2023 but down 17.3 per cent from H1 2023. Early-stage startups maintained steady funding of $1.3 billion, consistent with H2 2023 but 28 per cent lower than H1 2023. Late-stage funding rose to $2.4 billion, marking a 3.8 per cent increase from H2 2023, although it experienced a slight 1.3 per cent drop compared to H1 2023. Despite these challenges, H1 2024 witnessed eight funding rounds surpassing $100 million, including Flipkart‚Äôs $350 million Series J round led by Google, Apollo 24'7‚Äôs $297 million private equity round, and Meesho‚Äôs $275 million Series F round. The leading sectors in terms of performance in H1 2024 were retail, enterprise applications, and fintech. Funding in the retail sector increased by 32 per cent, reaching $1.63 billion in H1 2024 compared to $1.23 billion in H1 2023. The enterprise application sector raised $933 million in H1 2024, a 10 per cent decrease from the $1.04 billion raised in H1 2023. In the fintech space, funding dropped by 50 per cent, from $1.45 billion in H1 2023 to $726 million in H1 2024. In H1 2024, three unicorns emerged, a notable increase from zero in H1 2023, along with 33 new additions to the soonicorn club. The number of initial public offerings also rose to 17 in H1 2024, from six in H1 2023 and 12 in H2 2023. Bengaluru led in total funds raised during this period, followed by Delhi and Mumbai. The overall top investors in H1 2024 were Accel, Blume Ventures, and Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA). In the seed stage, Venture Catalysts, Z Nation Lab, and WeFounderCircle were the top investors. Peak XV Partners, Alpha Wave Global, and Saama Capital were the most active early-stage investors in H1 2024. DST Global, Epiq Capital, and UC-RNT Fund led late-stage investments in H1 2024.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The number of fresh formal jobs generated in a month increased to a seven-month high in April, signalling a recovery in the formal labour market in the country, according to the latest monthly payroll data released by the Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) on Thursday. In April, the number of new monthly subscribers under the Employees‚Äô Provident Fund (EPF) sequentially increased by 18.77 per cent to 887,438 from 747,146 in March. Previously, in September 2023, 950,527 fresh formal employees had joined the EPF. The EPFO data is considered crucial as only the formal workforce enjoys social security benefits and is protected by labour laws. Of the total 887,438 new EPF subscribers in April, the share of young people belonging to the 18-28 age group declined to 65.5 per cent (581,106) from 66.74 per cent in the preceding month. This is crucial because subscribers in this age group are usually first-timers in the labour market, thus reflecting its robustness. Additionally, the share of women among the total new subscribers increased to 28.1 per cent (249,254) during the month, compared to 26.8 per cent (199,998) in March. Meanwhile, the net payroll additions ‚Äî calculated by taking into account the number of new subscribers, the number of subscribers that exited, and the return of old subscribers to the social security organisation ‚Äî increased by 31.94 per cent to 1.9 million in April from 1.44 million in March. However, the net monthly payroll numbers are provisional in nature and are often revised sharply the following month. That is why the new EPF subscriber figure is considered more reliable than net additions. ‚ÄúThe payroll data highlights that approximately 1.45 million members exited and subsequently rejoined EPFO. \"These members switched their jobs and rejoined the establishments covered under the ambit of EPFO and opted to transfer their accumulations instead of applying for final settlement, thus safeguarding long-term financial well-being and extending their social security protection,‚Äù said the labour ministry in a statement. However, data from the private agency Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), which conducts its own Consumer Pyramids Household Survey, showed that the labour markets worsened in April as the unemployment rate in India increased to 8.1 per cent from 7.4 per cent in March. ‚ÄúThe unemployment rate recorded an uptick in April alongside a fall in the labour participation rate (LPR) as well as the employment rate. \"LPR in India inched down to 40.9 per cent in April from 41.1 per cent in the previous month,‚Äù CMIE said in a statement. The monthly payroll data released by the EPFO is part of the government‚Äôs effort to track formal-sector employment by using payrolls as an instrument. Since April 2018, the National Statistical Office has been bringing out employment-related statistics in the formal sector, sharing data from September 2017 onwards, using information on the number of subscribers under the EPF scheme, the Employees‚Äô State Insurance scheme, and the National Pension System.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Ambuja Cements‚Äô announcement that it would acquire Hyderabad-based Penna Cement Industries could be the Adani Group company‚Äôs first step for wider inorganic expansion, according to analysts. Citing media reports, analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equity said Adani Group was preparing a war chest of $3 billion to acquire cement companies and become a leader in the sector in three to four years. Saurashtra Cement, Vadraj Cement, and the cement business of Jaiprakash Associates are companies the group could seek. ‚ÄúWe believe that further acquisitions are indeed possible considering Ambuja Cement‚Äôs strong balance sheet,‚Äù said the brokerage in a note with a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô rating for the company and a target price of Rs 767. Ambuja Cements‚Äô share on Friday (June 14) hit a record high of Rs 690 on the BSE, rising 3.8 per cent in intraday trade. It ended 1.9 per cent higher at Rs 677 apiece as against a 0.24-per cent rise in the benchmark BSE Sensex index. Ambuja said on Thursday (June 13) it has entered into a binding agreement to acquire Penna Cement at an enterprise value of Rs 10,400 crore (cash consideration), mainly funded through internal accruals. The deal is expected to be completed in three or four months, subject to regulatory approvals. Penna has operational capacity of 10 million tonnes (mt): 90 per cent in Andhra Pradesh and Tela¬≠ngana and the rest in Maha¬≠rashtra. The company has a clinker capacity ‚Äî a key metric in the cem¬≠ent industry ‚Äî of 7.3 mt. Penna has an up¬≠coming grinding capacity of 4 mt and clinker capacity of 3 mt in Jod¬≠hpur, Rajasthan. The plant is expe¬≠ct¬≠ed to be operational in 6-12 months. Ambuja had a nationwide market share of 13-14 per cent in FY24, but it was just 5-6 per cent in Southern India. The Penna acquisition would help Ambuja improve its market share in the South by 700-800 basis points (bps), said analysts at Emkay Global. When capacity additions are completed (20 mt by FY27), the company‚Äôs nationwide market share could improve by 200-250 bps, they said. ‚ÄúWith Penna‚Äôs acquisition, Ambuja Cements will move to the top-three players‚Äô group in the Southern market. \"Besides, the acquisition reinforces the company‚Äôs strong position as growing pan-India market leader,‚Äù said analysts at Jefferies. They have a 'buy' rating with a Rs 735-target. The increasing market share of major companies may further squeeze smaller players, leading to more mergers and acquisitions. Ambuja Cements aims to have a manufacturing capacity (consolidated) of 140 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by FY28 from 78.9 mtpa now. It is running expansion projects of 20 mtpa across regions to reach 100 mtpa capacity by FY26. The company‚Äôs Board has appr¬≠oved a 2.25 mtpa clinker unit in Mundra in Gujarat and 17 grinding units (2.4 mtpa each) at different places in the country (including 4 mtpa proposed at Godda, Jhar¬≠kh¬≠and). Land acquisitions and statut¬≠ory approvals for these projects are in progress. Ambuja Cement‚Äôs consolidated sales volumes in FY24 grew around 8 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) to 59.2 mt. Its cement capacity utilisation stood at 82 per cent compared to 81 per cent in FY23. To¬≠tal capital expenditure (standalone) stood at Rs 2,000 crore in FY24 compared to Rs 2,100 crore the year before. ‚ÄúWe believe this acquisition will help Ambuja Cements move closer to its long-term growth target of 140 mt capacity by CY28. \"Additionally, capacity augmentation would strengthen its position in India, likely making it a key beneficiary of demand prospects. \"However, due to the teething issues at Penna Cement plants and the regional mix, which would tilt towards the surplus market of South India, the acquisition may be margin-dilutive in the medium term,‚Äù according to analysts at Elara Capital. ‚ÄúGiven the competitive intensity in South India in the medium term, the asset may earn return ratios similar to cash yield and thus, may be EPS-neutral. We reiterate ‚Äòaccumulate‚Äô rating with a target price of Rs 655,‚Äù they said. To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The GST Council on Saturday decided to tweak tax rates on items, including accommodation services for students and solar cookers, and took a host of taxpayer-friendly measures including waiver of interest and penalty for demand notices issued in the first three years of GST rollout. Briefing reporters after the 53rd GST Council meeting, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Council has recommended to roll-out the biometric-based Aadhaar authentication of registration applicants on pan-India basis in a phased manner. This will help check fraudulent registration done to avail input tax credit and evade taxes. To reduce litigation, the Council decided to fix a monetary limit for tax officers to file appeals before the GST Appellate Tribunal, the High Court and the Supreme Court at Rs 20 lakh, Rs 1 crore and Rs 2 crore, respectively. It also recommended reduction of the quantum of pre-deposit required to be paid by taxpayers for filing of appeals under Goods and Services Tax (GST). The maximum amount of pre-deposit for filing appeal with the appellate authority has been reduced from Rs 25 crore CGST and SGST each to Rs 20 crores CGST and SGST each. This will help ease cash flow and working capital blockage for the taxpayers. \"The 53rd GST Council meeting has taken a number of decisions on trade facilitation, easing compliance burden and giving relief to taxpayers in terms of easing compliance,\" Sitharaman said. The minister said the next meeting of the GST Council will be held in August in which the Group of Ministers (GoM) on GST rate rationalisation under Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sumant Chaudhary, will give a presentation on the status of the work and aspects covered by the panel and work pending before the panel. \"What was decided in the Council is, when we meet in the next GST Council meeting we will start a discussion on rate rationalisation... There will be a presentation by the GoM irrespective of whether the report is draft... and then Council will start the discussion on rate rationalisation in the next meeting in August,\" Sitharaman said. The GST Council on Saturday recommended to exempt Accommodation Services of up to Rs 20,000 per person per month from GST. This is subject to the condition that these services are supplied for a minimum continuous period of 90 days. \"It's primarily meant for students,\" Sitharaman said. In a taxpayer friendly move, the Council has decided to waive interest and penalties for demand notices issued under Section 73 of the CGST Act (for cases not involving fraud, suppression or wilful misstatement) for the fiscal years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, if the full tax demanded is paid by March 31, 2025. GST, which subsumed 17 local taxes and cesses, was rolled out on July 1, 2017. As per the CBIC data, mobile phones and many household items including TV, refrigerator, washing machine and AC have become cheaper post GST. It has reduced burden on household income and improved affordability. The Council also decided to refer the standing committee's recommendation to exempt GST on fertiliser and cut rates on raw materials to the GoM on rate rationalisation. Currently, GST is levied at 5 per cent on fertilisers, while its raw materials like sulphuric acid and ammonia face 18 per cent tax. Also the Tax Collected at Source (TCS) rate for e-commerce suppliers has been cut from present 1 per cent to 0.5 per cent, which will ease the financial burden on the suppliers making supplies through e-commerce platform. Besides, services provided by Indian Railways to the general public, namely, sale of platform tickets, facility of retiring rooms/waiting rooms, cloak room services and battery-operated car services as well as intra-railway transactions would be exempt from GST. GST Council has prescribed a uniform rate of 12 per cent on all milk cans meaning steel, iron, aluminum which are irrespective of the use. The Council also recommended a uniform GST rate of 12 per cent on all carton boxes and cases of both corrugated and non-corrugated paper or paper board, which in particular, help the apple growers of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. All types of Sprinklers, including fire water sprinklers, will attract 12 per cent GST. Solar Cookers, whether it has a single or dual energy source, too will attract a 12 per cent tax. The Council also decided that GST anti-profiteering provisions will have a sunset date of April 1, 2025. Current cases and investigations with regard to profiteering complaints will be handled by the Principal bench of GST Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT), instead of the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Also, the time limit to avail input tax credit w.r.t. any invoice or debit note through any GSTR 3B return filed up to November 30, 2021 for FY 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21, has been fixed at November 30, 2021. Sitharaman said less than two per cent of the total 58.62 lakh taxpayers under Central GST administration has been sent tax notices and the intention of the government is to make GST assessees life easier by reducing compliance requirements. \"I want to reassure the assessees that our intent is to make GST assessees life easier, we are working towards less and less compliance. ‚ÄúOn behalf of the CGST, notices are not being sent left, right and centre. ‚ÄúOnly 1.96 per cent of all active tax assessees have been sent notices from Central GST,\" Sitharaman said.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) India's second richest person Gautam Adani received a total remuneration of Rs 9.26 crore in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, lower than most industry peers as well as his own key executives. Adani, 61, drew salary from only two out of the 10 companies in his ports-to-energy conglomerate, annual reports of the 10 listed entities of the group showed. His remuneration for 2023-24 from the group's flagship firm Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) included Rs 2.19 crore salary and perquisites, allowances and other benefits worth Rs 27 lakh. The total remuneration of Rs 2.46 crore was 3 per cent more than the previous financial year, according to AEL's 2023-24 annual report. Besides, he drew Rs 6.8 crore from Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd (APSEZ). Adani's salary is lower than heads of almost all large family-owned conglomerates in India. While the richest Indian, Mukesh Ambani has been foregoing his entire salary since Covid-19 broke out prior to which he had capped his remuneration at Rs 15 crore, Adani's remuneration is much lower than telecom czar Sunil Bharti Mittal (Rs 16.7 crore in 2022-23), Rajiv Bajaj (Rs 53.7 crore), Pawan Munjal (Rs 80 crore), L&T chairman S N Subrahmanyan and Infosys CEO Salil S Parekh. Adani, who is worth USD 106 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, has been jostling with Ambani for the spot of the richest person in Asia. He became the richest Asian in 2022 but lost that position after a damning report by US short-seller Hindenburg Research wiped out almost $150 billion of market value of his group stock at its lowest point last year. He regained the top spot on two occasions this year but again ceded the position to Ambani. Ambani is ranked 12th on the world's richest list with a networth of $111 billion. Adani is ranked 14th. Adani's younger brother Rajesh got Rs 8.37 crore, including Rs 4.71 crore commission on profit from AEL, while his nephew Pranav Adani drew Rs 6.46 crore, including Rs 4.5 crore commission, the annual report showed. Gautam Adani did not draw any commission from AEL but got Rs 5 crore from APSEZ. The remuneration from APSEZ included Rs 1.8 crore salary and Rs 5 crore commission that will be payable in 2024-25 fiscal, the company's annual report said. His son, Karan earned Rs 3.9 crore from APSEZ. Gautam Adani's brother, nephew and son did not draw salaries from more than one company. Vinay Prakash, key executive and director on AEL board, received a total remuneration of Rs 89.37 crore. Group CFO Jugeshinder Singh got Rs 9.45 crore salary. The group's renewable energy firm, Adani Green Energy Ltd CEO Vneet S Jaain was paid Rs 15.25 crore while Adani Total Gas Ltd (ATGL) CEO Suresh P Manglani earned Rs 6.88 crore. Adani Wilmar CEO Angshu Mallick got Rs 5.15 crore. \"We reported an average remuneration increase of 12 per cent for employees, excluding key managerial personnel (KMPs), with a slightly higher increase of 5.37 per cent for KMPs,\" the AEL annual report said. S B Khyalia, CEO of Adani Power got Rs 5.63 crore. To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) As many as 458 infrastructure projects, each entailing an investment of Rs 150 crore or above, were hit by a cost overrun of more than Rs 5.71 lakh crore in May this year, according to an official report. According to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), which monitors infrastructure projects worth Rs 150 crore and above, out of 1,817 projects, 458 reported cost overruns and 831 projects were delayed. The total original cost of implementation of 1,817 projects was Rs 27,58,567.23 crore, and their anticipated completion cost is likely to be Rs 33,29,647.99 crore, which reflects an overall cost overrun of over Rs 5,71,080.76 (20.70 per cent of original cost), the ministry's latest report for May 2024 showed. According to the report, the expenditure incurred on these projects till May 2024 is Rs 1,707,190.15 crore, which is 51.3 per cent of the anticipated cost of the projects. However, the number of delayed projects decreased to 554, provided the delay is calculated on the basis of the latest schedule of completion, it added. Of the 831 delayed projects, 245 have overall delays in the range of 1-12 months, 188 have been delayed for 13-24 months, 271 projects for 25-60 months, and 127 projects for more than 60 months. The average time overrun in these 831 delayed projects is 35.1 months. Reasons for time overrun, as reported by various project implementing agencies, include land acquisition, environmental clearance, financial issues, contractual/internal issues, manpower shortage and litigation issues.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'With new projects and recently awarded projects kicking in, capital expenditure should only increase going forward.' The Centre is considering a 5 to 10 per cent increase in capex deployment for highway development in the country in the upcoming Union Budget for 2024-2025, according to senior government officials. The ministry of road transport and highways was allocated Rs 2.72 trillion for capital expenditure in the interim Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in February. At that point, the spending on highway construction was pegged at 2.9 per cent higher than the revised estimates of 2023-2024. Experts believe the amount is reasonable, given the high base the highway budget is operating on due to back-to-back bumper hikes in the previous two financial years. As of May, the highway ministry has already absorbed over Rs 57,000 crore (Rs 570 billion) of its allocated capital spending budget for the ongoing fiscal, which is approximately 22 per cent of the total. Over the past few years, capital-intensive ministries have been asked by the finance ministry to front-load their expenditure to meet targets. Since 2020, most infrastructure ministries have overshot their capex targets. \"The capital expenditure so far is being done on projects that were awarded in the past few years. With new projects and recently awarded projects kicking in, capital expenditure should only increase going forward,\" a senior official pointed out. Deliberations will go on in the run up to the Budget, he added, but it is reasonable to expect a 5 to 10 per cent hike in highway capex. The highway ministry will look to start awarding new projects and projects pending in the first phase of the Bharatmala Pariyojana, the ministry's flagship Rs 5 trillion programme, the cost estimates for which have risen to Rs 10 trillion due to delays in land acquisition and other factors. The plan has now been subsumed under a new Vision 2047 Cabinet note by the highway ministry. The plan, currently being deliberated at the Union cabinet level, will entail spending of Rs 20 trillion for the ministry to meet its targets under the Viksit Bharat 2047 document a government-wide initiative to identify sector-wise gaps and improve on them to make India a developed country by 2047. The vision now is not just to look at national highways as number of kilometres, but quality as well, Highway secretary Anurag Jain had told reporters in February. According to ministry data shared by officials earlier this year, highways with four lanes and more have increased by 2.5 times to 46,720 kilometres over the last 10 years, while those with two lanes or less have halved to 14,350 kilometres, which are now only 10 per cent of the total highway network.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Mumbai-based developers Macrotech Developers (Lodha) and Oberoi Realty have emerged as top gainers among largecap realty stocks over the past month, with gains ranging from 29 per cent to 33 per cent. Strong ongoing sales trends in Mumbai‚Äôs core market, record bookings in the January-March quarter, and healthy guidance for 2024-25 (FY25) have propelled these companies, which derive the majority of their revenues from India‚Äôs financial capital. They have outperformed peers such as DLF and Godrej Properties, which have delivered low-to-mid single-digit returns during this period. A near-term catalyst has been a 22 per cent rise in housing units registered in Mumbai for May, totalling 12,000 units ‚Äî the highest for the month in 12 years. A slight increase in average ticket size resulted in a 24 per cent rise in the overall value of registered units to Rs 17,200 crore. From January to May, registrations reached 60,819 units, marking a 17 per cent increase over the previous year, with sales by value up 2 per cent to Rs 81,000 crore. Analysts Parvez Qazi and Vasudev Ganatra of Nuvama Research believe that buoyant sales will continue, driven by robust business development targets, increased launches supported by improved cash flow, stabilised interest rates, diversification, and market share gains. They anticipate that organised developers based in Mumbai, including Macrotech Developers (Lodha), Oberoi Realty, Godrej Properties, and Sunteck Realty, will benefit from strong housing sales in the city. The recent sales performance and outlook for the larger Mumbai-based players have been robust. Lodha reported its best-ever quarter in March in terms of bookings, reaching Rs 4,230 crore ‚Äî a 40 per cent increase year-on-year (Y-o-Y) ‚Äî supported by 5 million square feet (sq. ft) of launches. The company closed 2023-24 (FY24) with bookings of Rs 14,500 crore, consistent with management guidance. For FY25, Lodha expects bookings of Rs 17,500 crore, reflecting a 20 per cent Y-o-Y growth driven by volume increases from new launches and modest price adjustments. Business development initiatives and construction spending are expected to increase significantly during FY25, while the company maintains its guidance of less than 0.5x net debt-to-equity, 30 per cent margins, and a return on equity of 20 per cent by 2025-26 (FY26). IIFL Securities maintains an ‚Äòadd‚Äô rating with a target price of Rs 1,250, foreseeing sustained increases in land pricing and infrastructure development at Palava City benefiting future cash flows and the net asset value of the company. Following a steady FY24, Oberoi Realty has established a strong asset base poised for monetisation over the next few years. The company has expanded its development portfolio, including the Gurugram project (14.8 acres) and Mumbai/Thane properties such as Adarsh Nagar, Worli (620,000 sq. ft), Tardeo (260,000 sq. ft), and Pokhran Road (6.24 acres), with a gross development value ranging from Rs 13,000 crore to Rs 15,000 crore. In the near term, Oberoi Realty is expected to launch its Pokhran Road project, driving volumes in FY25, with additional launches planned for FY26, including the Tardeo Redevelopment Project, Gurugram, and Adarsh Nagar. Analysts Rahul Jain and Tanvi Tambat of Elara Capital highlight that Oberoi Realty has an estimated unsold inventory of Rs 18,000 crore in high-velocity micromarkets like Goregaon and Borivali, providing earnings visibility for the next four years based on the FY24 pre-sales run rate. They also note the company‚Äôs financial prudence, evident in its strong balance sheet and industry-best net gearing ratio of less than 10 per cent. Elara Capital maintains a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô rating with a target price of Rs 2,350 per share. To get such articles in your inbox Moneywiz Live! More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Bengal can be the game changers of 2024.' \"Welfarism only works when it is backed by bharosa [ trust ] -- and bharosa is Narendra Modi along with a combination of factors like cultural and muscular majoritarianism,\" notes political commentator Rasheed Kidwai . \"The challenge for INDIA is the prime ministerial face: Modi versus who? If the alliance targets Modi, they are doomed and if they don't, he gets away with everything, therefore, it is a difficult conundrum for the INDIA alliance,\" Kidwai tells Rediff.com 's Archana Masih . What is the Congress's future in North India? Is resurrection even possible? The result was not as expected by the Congress, but the party can draw heart from the fact that it has held onto its vote share in the Hindi Heartland. The states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh comprise over 90% majority community, unlike Bihar, West Bengal or UP which has a sizable minority population. The Congress has got 40% vote share from this majority population. The BJP has benefited at the expense of votes lost by other parties [like the Bahujan Samaj Party] . Although this is a cause of concern, it shows that the roots of the Congress are intact in this region. How does this likely impact the Congress' performance in 2024 because it fared abysmally in these states in 2019? The Congress had won these three states in the 2018 assembly election, but six months later conceded 62 out of 65 Lok Sabha seats to the BJP. In the worse-case scenario, the Congress can lose three more seats, and the BJP can gain three seats if it does very well. The situation remains bleak for the Congress in 2024 in the Hindi heartland, similar to 2014 and 2019. But the win in Telangana, which has 17 Lok Sabha seats, opens up the possibility for the Congress to pick up 10+ seats in 2024 from Telangana. In Parliamentary democracy, MPs elect the prime minister, but in 2014 and 2019, the PM got 282 and 300 MPs elected to Parliament on his own strength. And now that trend appears to have moved to the state elections as well. The prime minister has shown that he has the ability and influence to even get MLAs elected. The common thread in these states was Narendra Modi -- not welfare schemes like Ladli Behna. The chief ministers of Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan were also recklessly pursuing welfare and pro-women policies, but it did not help them return to power. Such welfarism only works when it is backed by bharosa [ trust ] -- and bharosa is Narendra Modi along with a combination of factors like cultural and muscular majoritarianism. It is a package. India is a personality driven polity. During the golden era of the Congress, there was no dearth of quality Opposition, but they could not match up. They were stalwarts like Ram Manohar Lohia, Jyoti Basu, Charan Singh, Chandrasekhar, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L K Advani, but they could not pin down Indira Gandhi, except post-Emergency in 1977 through a coalition, but by and large Mrs Gandhi remained formidable. She could outsmart them. Similarly, in today's time, there is no dearth of good leaders like Nitish Kumar, Mamata Banerjee, Sharad Pawar and others, but they are not a match for Mr Modi. You spoke about the Opposition. What options does the INDIA alliance have if it wants to arm itself against the BJP going into 2024? The INDIA alliance is not poorer or weaker by the outcome of the state election results. Telangana has given them a hope of gaining around 10 seats in the Lok Sabha 2024. The alliance needs to get their act together. They need to function as co-equals. The Congress cannot play the dominating partner. Historically, India's coalition politics has always had a dominant partner -- in the UPA, it was Congress; in the NDA, it was the BJP. However, the idea of co-equals is easy in theory, but difficult in practice. The second challenge for INDIA is the prime ministerial face: Modi versus who? If the alliance targets Modi, they are doomed and if they don't, he gets away with everything, therefore, it is a difficult conundrum for the INDIA alliance. The inability to come up with seat sharing agreement dented their chances in these assembly elections. The INDIA alliance is also plagued by egos and conflicting voices emerging from 28 different parties. Firstly, they need a seat-wise, nation-wide alliance backed by data, not the whims and fancies of different leaders. Data science and strategists like Sunil Kanugolu can help them figure out who is best suited to contest from individual constituencies. They need a consensus on 80%-90% Lok Sabha seats. The alliance should have a common social media policy and authorised spokespersons. Udhaynidhi Maran's comment had an impact on traditional, conservative, Hindus who have a strong sense of association with Sanatan Dharma. It is difficult to discipline 28 parties, but members should be actively discouraged from making such statements. The alliance has experienced leaders like Sharad Pawar, Nitish Kumar, Mamata Banerjee, Sitaram Yechuri who understand politics and can look at issues dispassionately. They should have an active team on the ground comprising Akhilesh Yadav in UP, Tejaswi Yadav in Bihar, Stalin in Tamil Nadu, etc. Leaders like Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, Nitish Kumar and Sharad Pawar should provide heft in establishing cohesiveness among the partners. There needs to be a quick response mechanism. For example, the Sanatan Dharma remark went unattended. Meanwhile, the NDA speaks in the same voice on all social, economic, cultural issues, whereas the outlook of the INDIA alliance is very diverse. However, this diversity also gels with the civilisational ethos of the country where diversity is welcomed. Some of the parties in the INDIA alliance were partners of the NDA in 2019 and are now on the opposite side of the BJP. How will this impact the outcome of the 2024 election? Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Bengal can be the game changers. Maharashtra has 48 seats -- the BJP along with united Shiv Sena won 42 seats in 2019. This time the Shiv Sena [UBT], Congress and NCP have the potential to reduce the NDA tally by half. Bihar: The BJP-Janata Dal-United alliance won 39/40 seats. This time, the JD-U, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress are in a coaltion which will enhance their collective potential. Bengal: The BJP won 18/42 seats. Mamata has the capacity to reduce it to a single digit in 2024. Karnataka: The BJP won 25/28. The Congress has the potential to reduce it to a single digit in 2024. The southern states, along with other states in north-western, central, eastern India have the potential to reduce the number of seats for the BJP. The Congress should look at expanding Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra to Odisha, Bengal, Bihar and the North East. Therefore, the yatra that he intends to do from east to west will carry some hope for them, but it has to have effort. The Congress and the INDIA alliance also need a composite outlay to deal with communalism. India's civilisational ethos is diverse and accommodative. It is do-able and this counter-narrative can be shaped. The southern and eastern states are accepting it, so they can find a solution in north India also. The alliance needs ideological fine tuning. They need to be sure footed. Feature Presentation: Aslam Hunani/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

In 2023, the BJP romped home with 54 MLAs against 35 from the Congress, a huge 50 per cent drop from its showing in the 2018 election. \"The Congress and top leaders made no attempt to mingle among the people two-three days before polling day. There were no big rallies of Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi before polling day. They ( Rahul Gandhi and the top Congress leadership ) will have to climb down from their ivory towers,\" Dr Tewari tells Prasanna D Zore/ Rediff.com . Among all the defeats, isn't the Chhattisgarh loss the most surprising for the Congress? It is surprising of course. Even the exit polls got this one ( state ) wrong. Everybody had predicted an easy win for the Congress in Chhattisgarh. It nevertheless, offers an opportunity for introspection, especially, for those who have lost power. They ( Congress ) should introspect why they lost so badly despite doing so much good work for the people. What worked for the BJP? The biggest gain for the BJP is the astounding victory that people of the state handed to them. Narendra Modi is the BJP's biggest and most powerful leader. Nobody has been able to dent his clean image. The Opposition is doing all it can to link him with such activities ( corruption ), but they have failed to even make a small dent on his clean image. He has also got a very efficient team of leaders working under him. The voters have undergone a huge change in the way they vote. The voters are more educated today. Gone are the days when victories were obtained by bribing voters at the last moment or promising them the moon and freebies. Along with promises the voters today are also looking at a politician's image and Narendra Modi ranks right there at the top. Their ( Congress 's) leader ( Rahul Gandhi ) seems to have learnt nothing despite being in politics for almost 20 years now. Any person, after spending over 20 years in any school or institution, would shine like the Kohinoor ( diamond ). Look at the rise of Narendra Modi and look at Rahul Gandhi's graph. He ( Rahul Gandhi ) should have learnt so much in the last 20 years. But give him a mic and he begins to talk without thinking about its consequences. During an election, even the smallest mistake made by a politician attains huge proportion. Rahul Gandhi must focus now on building a solid team which would at least give him a good speech when he holds the mic in his hand. Whatever a person's stature, if he realises his follies, accepts them and makes efforts to improve upon them then he still can offer a formidable challenge to Narendra Modi. You have been repeating the same mistake since the last 20 years as a result of which you are being rejected by the people time and again. The BJP also fielded 47 new faces in the state. Did that help? One must always remember that the respect people have for their elected MPs and MLAs start dwindling once they start losing a couple of consecutive elections. I am not disrespecting the experience such leaders, have but I firmly believe that all the leaders who have crossed 50 and who are unable to win elections should start working for the party in an advisory role. These leaders should hand over the reins of the party to the youth. Just consider the morale of the youth in your party who has been toiling for decades when they see that a few leaders, just because they have political mai-baap ( godfathers ) backing them, are getting tickets to contest the election despite defeat-after-defeat. In the BJP, change happens quietly; even if a senior leader is sidelined, nobody raises an eyebrow and accepts the decision. In the Congress, if you try to bring even a small change at the local level, then the party is faced with rebellion from here to Delhi. While the Congress has won Telangana, it must not ignore how the BJP has increased its MLAs manifold. The best thing about the BJP is that once they decide to contest election from a state where they do not have a strong presence their entire team descends upon the state with all their might. But Bhupesh Baghel has been quite a popular chief minister in the state. Being from Chhattisgarh, I can tell you that Bhupesh Baghel made for an excellent chief minister. His work for the people is noteworthy. When the results started swinging towards the BJP, I was quite stumped. But Baghel ji too must introspect the reasons for the BJP's huge victory margin in this election. But then he can only do that much. Interestingly, in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, the BJP went to the hustings without declaring their chief ministerial face compared to the Congress. Despite this shortcoming, if the people of Chhattisgarh voted heavily against the Congress and in the BJP's favour, then the credit must go Narendra Modi. The Congress and its overall leadership must try to figure out what is it that attracts the voters towards the BJP. I think it is time for the Congress to change its leadership. The way the Congress's top leadership has failed to win the confidence of people in critical Hindi belt states like Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan now, and in Uttar Pradesh for almost three decades now is shocking. These leaders, for some reason, are not able to win people's trust. These leaders have closed their eyes and ears to the public. They still consider themselves above the common people resulting in Congress getting alienated from the people. One definitely got an impression before the election that the Congress would definitely win Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Congress and top leaders in these two states made no attempt to mingle among the people two-three days before the polling day. There were no big rallies of Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi in these states before polling day. They ( Rahul Gandhi and the top Congress leadership ) will have to climb down from their ivory towers and mill around with the common masses. What went wrong for Congress in Bastar which voted for Congress in 2018? The tribals of Bastar seem to have voted for BJP. Why? I have always stood by the opinion that the law and order of any state should always follow the rightful legal path; it should not depend on circumstances or change for select few. The Congress did win sympathies of Bastar's tribals ( in the 2018 election ) after their leadership was killed in the region in 2013 ( 25 senior Congress leaders, including Nand Kumar Patel, Vidya Charan Shukla and Mahendra Karma were killed by Maoists in Bastar in 2013 ). When the Congress came to power in 2018 they did pussy-foot with the Naxals instead of taking them head on. The Congress should have shown spine in dealing with the Maoists in Bastar. Like, people would always say that Article 370 will never be abrogated in Kashmir; that it is a Constitutional guarantee given to the Kashmiris. But if you are firm on your decision then there is nothing that can stop you. People don't look at the Congress leadership as firm and decisive as much as they consider Narendra Modi to be firm and decisive. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'When he was sidelined in the INDIA bloc, it was was the turning point because it badly hurt Nitish's ambition.' 'After that, he decided to damage INDIA by changing sides.' Three days after Janata Dal-United President and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar thanked Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi for conferring the Bharat Ratna, the country's highest civilian award, posthumously on veteran Socialist leader Karpoori Thakur , he dumped the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan that included the Congress and Left parties, and aligned with Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. Bihar's BJP-JD-U government was sworn in on Sunday evening. Till last week, senior JD-U and RJD leaders repeatedly refuted any rift, differences and heartburn in the Mahagathbandhan. This correspondent was the first to report in December that Nitish Kumar was planning to dump the Mahagathbandan and return to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. What provoked Nitish Kumar to return to the NDA, which he dumped in August 2022? JD-U sources tell me that Nitish was angry after he was not named convenor or the prime ministerial candidate of the Opposition bloc INDIA. Nitish had convened the first meeting of Opposition leaders in Patna in June 2023, which led to the formation of the INDIA bloc in Bengaluru in July 2023. \"For Nitish, what matter most is his self interest and ambition, neither ideology nor ethics,\" confides a senior JD-U leader clearly unhappy with his leader's latest political somersault. \"His decision to join hands with the BJP may surprise many, not us. It was on the cards and expected.\" INDIA leaders, he explains, had frustrated Nitish by their behind the scenes politicking not to name him the bloc's convenor or its prime ministerial candidate for the Lok Sabha election. Nitish, he says, has been ready since last year to play an innings in national politics and for that he had mobilised Opposition parties and worked successfully to unite them. \"But when he was sidelined in the INDIA bloc, it was the end of his dream. This was the turning point because it badly hurt Nitish's ambition,\" the JD-U leader adds, \"After that, he decided to damage INDIA by changing sides.\" A political observer in Patna claims Nitish Kumar made up his mind to move to the NDA after viewing the BJP mobilisation over the Ram temple. JD-U leaders and Bihar ministers, close to Nitish, were already in touch with BJP leaders who were working to convince Nitish that the JD-U would not repeat its 2019 Lok Sabha election performance (16 seats) in 2024 with the Mahagathbandhan in a polarised condition. Senior JD-U leaders K C Tyagi and Bihar ministers Sanjay Jha, Ashok Choudhary, Vijay Kumar Choudhary convinced Nitish to change sides after the INDIA bloc extinguished his convenor ambitions, this commentator adds. \"Had he been named INDIA's PM candidate as he expected, Nitish could have take the political risk. But he realised better gains contesting the Lok Sabha elections along with the BJP. Taking into account this weakness of Nitish, the BJP used the service of two Constitutional post holders to convince him to join the NDA,\" claims the political observer. In January 2023, Nitish had declared that he would prefer to die rather than join hands with the BJP. Earlier, in the state assembly, he proclaimed, ' Mitti mein mil jayenge lekin BJP ke saath nahi jayenge ', an identical sentiment. Nitish Kumar may also have been irked by RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav's insistence that his younger son Tejashwi Yadav be promoted as chief minister at the earliest. Last year, Nitish himself announced that he wanted Tejashwi to replace him and that the 2025 assembly polls would be contested under the younger Yadav's leadership.\" According to a senior RJD leader, Lalu had laid down a condition to Nitish -- when the JD-U left the NDA and formed the Mahagathbandan in Bihar in August 2022 -- that Tejashwi would be made chief minister when Nitish moved to national politics. But Nitish was not ready to step aside. JD-U sources say Lallan Singh -- who resigned as JD-U national president on December 29 -- and senior party leader and Bihar minister Bijendar Yadav opposed their party rejoining the NDA on the ground that its political credibility would hit a new low if it did so. The BJP's top leadership in December, these sources say, invited Nitish to rejoin the NDA and contest the 2024 poll together to win all of Bihar's 40 Lok Sabha seats. The BJP leadership, these JD-U sources add, has offered Nitish over a dozen Lok Sabha seats, two Rajya Sabha seats and a governor's post for one of his nominees.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The finance minister's assertion that industry should not expect any spectacular announcements in the 2024 interim Budget suggest that the electoral imperatives of more tax concessions or higher expenditure on welfarist programmes could be far less pronounced than they were before the 2019 interim Budget, expects A K Bhattacharya. In the run-up to the presentation of the interim Budget for 2024-2025, two major issues have come under scrutiny. One pertains to the scope and size of the fiscal space that the Union government currently enjoys in financing its expenditure plan for the next couple of years. The second issue is about the nature of the government's political imperative for announcing any fresh expenditure plan to secure the much-needed electoral dividends during the forthcoming general elections. It will be instructive to assess both the issues even as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prepares to present her first interim Budget. Growth assumptions are critical inputs for framing the government's fiscal consolidation strategy. The First Advance Estimates (FAE) of India's gross domestic product (GDP) was released last week, placing the nominal size of the economy for 2023-2024 at Rs 296.58 trillion, showing a growth rate of 8.9 per cent. This was a huge deceleration. The nominal size of the economy in 2022-2023 had grown by over 16 per cent. But despite a relatively low rise in nominal GDP in 2023-2024, the Centre's net tax revenues have maintained a growth rate of over 17 per cent (April-November 2023). This implies that tax buoyancy has improved. What's more, it appears the target of 11 per cent net tax revenue growth for the full year of 2023-2024 is set to be exceeded. On the expenditure side, the Centre's revenue as well as capital spending has seen a perceptible slowdown in recent months. In the first half of 2023-2024, revenue expenditure grew by almost 10 per cent. But by the end of November, this growth rate slowed to 3.5 per cent. Clearly, revenue expenditure growth is being gradually aligned to what had initially appeared to be an ambitious full-year target of 1.4 per cent. Capital expenditure too had grown by 43 per cent in the first half of 2023-2024, but slowed to 31 per cent for the April-November period of the current year. This is even lower than the annual growth of 36 per cent projected for the full year. Even though there will be some additional expenditure pressure in the last three months of the year because of the extension of the free food grain scheme and other social welfare programmes, there are reasons to believe that the fiscal deficit target of 5.9 per cent of GDP will be met during the current year. Non-tax revenues will be more than the Budget projections and should be able to make good the shortfall in the government's disinvestment proceeds. A lower nominal growth rate of 8.9 per cent for 2023-2024, compared to the Budget premise of 10.5 per cent, could exert some extra pressure on government finances, but given the revenue buoyancy and slowing expenditure growth, the stated fiscal deficit target appears achievable. Where the low nominal growth rate of 8.9 per cent for 2023-2024 will cause concern for the Budget makers is in its potential impact on the assumptions for 2024-2025. Remember that Ms Sitharaman in the last few years has displayed an admirable degree of conservatism in projecting the government's revenue and expenditure growth, apart from introducing transparency in accounting by including in the Budget all expenditure that earlier was kept out of Budget calculations. The last few years have seen no recourse to such off-Budget spending. But now, a relatively low nominal GDP growth projection could become a constraint. The interim Budget for 2019-2020 was helped by an unusually rosy nominal GDP growth projections of over 12 per cent for 2018-2019. Based on that number, the interim Budget five years ago had assumed a nominal economic growth of 11.5 per cent for 2019-2020. Indeed, the full Budget for 2019-2020 had raised the nominal economic growth projection to 12 per cent, even though the Second Advance Estimates had brought down its GDP growth rate for 2018-19 to 11.5 per cent. As it turned out, the actual nominal GDP growth rates in 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 were 10.6 per cent and 6.4 per cent, respectively. The consequences of such over-optimism were evident in the final fiscal deficit numbers for 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. Against a Budget Estimate of 3.3 per cent for each of the two years, the actual deficit turned out to be 3.4 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively. This slippage took place even after the Budget numbers had resorted to the unhealthy practice of off-Budget expenditure. The finance ministry today is a lot different from the finance ministry of 2019. The FAE indicating a nominal GDP growth of only 8.9 per cent for 2023-2024 will naturally restrain the current finance ministry from projecting a significantly higher nominal size of the Indian economy in 2024-2025. Recent reports suggest that the finance ministry may settle for 10.5 per cent nominal growth for 2024-2025. Improved tax buoyancy might, nevertheless, help the Centre project a decent double-digit revenue growth for 2024-2025, but this may not be enough to both step up its capital expenditure and bring down the fiscal deficit. If the Centre must bring its deficit down from 5.9 per cent of GDP in the current year to 4.5 per cent by 2025-2026, the available fiscal space is limited. A reduction of 1.4 percentage points in the next two years will be a challenging task. Note that despite healthy revenue growth in the post-Covid years (2022-2023 and 2023-2024), the government had to spend more, and its fiscal deficit could contract by only 0.8 percentage points in these years. The challenge ahead could get more complicated because of the general elections that would be held in May 2024. The big question is whether the political leadership will push the finance ministry to loosen its purse strings in the days before the polls, through higher expenditure allocations and tax giveaways in the interim Budget. However, the finance minister's assertion that industry should not expect any new spectacular announcements in the interim Budget and the ruling party's electoral victory in the recent assembly elections suggest that the electoral imperatives of more tax concessions or higher expenditure on welfarist programmes could be far less pronounced than they were before the interim Budget in 2019. That could well pave the way for a fiscally prudent interim Budget for 2024-2025. If that happens, the ruling party's growing political capital could at last create the base for robust economic reforms in the days ahead. With less baggage or burden of concessions and populist schemes, the full Budget for 2024-2025, to be presented after the elections, could build on the current tax buoyancy through steps to widen the tax base and by expediting non-tax revenue flows with a renewed focus on asset monetisation and privatisation.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'My understanding is that by the time President Xi Jinping came for the Chennai summit [2019], he had already instructed his army to undertake the action in Galwan in the summer of 2020.' If there is a diplomat who deeply understands the intricacies and complexities of India-China relations, it is Ambassador Gautam Bambawale . India's former ambassador to China, Ambassador Bambawale served four tenures in China in his nearly 35 years in the Indian Foreign Service. He speaks fluent Mandarin and is an expert on China. He is only one of three Indians this century to have served India's ambassador to China and Pakistan -- Ambassador Vijay Nambiar and Ambassador Shiv Shankar Menon being the others. Four years after the Chinese offensive in Galwan as India-China relations remain in very bad shape, he feels the relationship will continue to deteriorate unless the Chinese untie the knot. \"The Chinese thought they could muscle their way in, but India's military-politico-diplomatic response has been very good,\" Ambassador Bambawale tells Rediff.com 's Archana Masih and Nikhil Lakshman in a multi-part interview. Four year after the Galwan offensive, have you deciphered the reasons why the Chinese incursion took place in Eastern Ladakh? One of the factors behind China's offensive action in Eastern Ladakh was the asymmetry of power between China and India. Chinese GDP in the summer of 2020 was about 17 trillion dollars; India was about 3.5 trillion dollars. Therefore, the power differential between the two countries was sizable enough for them to meet the necessary condition to be assertive. The Chinese thought they could muscle their way in, but India's military-politico-diplomatic response has been very good. Therefore, we have been able to keep China at bay. What are some of the political steps that helped keep China at bay? The ban on Chinese foreign direct investment in 5G and on mobile apps are some examples of the right political response by India. External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar has said that India-China relations are in a bad space and will not improve unless China takes some measures. After India conducted the nuclear tests in 1998, the Chinese had said: 'The one who ties the knot has to untie it'. At that time, India had tied the knot when then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee wrote a letter to ( then US ) President Bill Clinton explaining the reason behind the tests. This time, the Chinese have tied the knot and they must untie it. The relationship cannot move ahead unless they do so. The Government of India has stood firm and should continue to remain steadfast. The firmness is also evident on the border. The Northern Army Commander has said that our troops have remained on the frontline even through the winter. There was recent news about two clashes that took place between the troops on the LAC. Therefore, India has to stay firm -- politically, diplomatically and militarily. Do you think the foreign minister has rightfully called out China, something that has not been done before? It is a fact. Anyone who does not say so is delusional because the relationship is in very bad shape. India-China ties have deteriorated and will continue to deteriorate unless the Chinese do not untie the knot. Do you think China will make any effort to untie the knot? I don't think they will. It will continue to deteriorate and that is where we are unfortunately. Diplomacy means speaking the truth and Dr Jaishankar is right in telling the country that India-China relations are in a bad place . You were pivotal in negotiating the Wuhan Agreement five years ago and had foreseen better India China relations. When you served as India's ambassador in China, did you get the feeling that winds were changing? The first informal summit between India and China was in Wuhan in April 2018, and second was in Chennai in October 2019. My understanding is that by the time President Xi Jinping came for the Chennai summit , he had already instructed his army to undertake the action in Galwan in the summer of 2020. This can give us a sense of how Xi thinks. Wuhan was seen as a big breakthrough in India-China relations. How did it resolve the Dokalam standoff? Dokalam was one of the series of incidents that brought home to India that India-China and the world had changed. The old rubric for India-China relations which had been put together by Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China in December 1988 had served us well, but that template was no longer tenable. The two summits were an attempt to initiate a new rubric or template so that India-China relations could continue to move forward despite the difficulties and tension. It was evident that it would need more than just two rounds of meetings between the leaders to arrive at a new rubric. Unfortunately, Xi Jinping had already made up his mind militarily by the second summit. The basis of a good relationship is peace on the border, but since China moved its troops in forward positions in 2020, the relationship could not move forward. Today, there are hardly any government to government meetings between India and China except the military talks at the border -- or on the sidelines of international summits. A plethora of interactions had been planned, but that has fallen by the wayside. This breakdown is impacting other areas like FDI. The Government of India has put stringent security considerations into Chinese investments in India. India has ensured that Chinese investment goes through several hoops and layers before it is approved - and a lot hasn't been approved. Trade hasn't been cut down because certain imports go into our own exports and the government has been practical. Were any concessions made in Wuhan to resolve the Dokalam crisis? There was no question of concessions at all. Dokalam had been resolved earlier. The effort in the two summits was to find a way to handle the relationship and move forward, but it did not get a chance. Do you think the relationship started deteriorating long before that? Former Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran wrote that Indian diplomats had noticed a change in the Chinese attitude from 2012 itself. Many of us saw it. We definitely felt there was a possibility of the Chinese getting aggressive, not only with India but with other countries as well. Their position in the world was strengthening because of the size of their economy and the asymmetry of power between them and other countries, including India. India needs to reduce this asymmetry -- economic, technological, scientific and military - and increase its comprehensive national power. Since the relations between the two countries are in poor shape and expected to deteriorate further, what is the possibility of reverting to status quo ante pre 2020? The action taken by China in Eastern Ladakh changed the status quo . According to newspaper reports there are certain patrolling points and routes that the Indian Army cannot patrol anymore because the Chinese are sitting at those junctions. Since there is no agreed boundary, you should not ask whether India has lost territory or whether China has lost territory. You must ask whether the status quo has changed and the answer is yes. India should stick to its position of demanding a restoration of status quo ante and continue talks after that.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Thousands of Yoga enthusiasts and practitioners assembled at the iconic Times Square in New York for day-long sessions of the ancient Indian practice on the eve of the commemoration of the International Day of Yoga. The Consulate General of India in New York along with the Times Square Alliance hosted special yoga sessions at Times Square Thursday, the day of the summer solstice, as yoga enthusiasts geared to celebrate the International Day of Yoga, marked every year on June 21. Amid heat advisories in place for the New York area, which experienced temperatures as high as 93 degree Fahrenheit (33.8 degree Celsius) during the day, people from all walks of life and nationalities arrived early morning and rolled out their yoga mats in the heart of the popular New York City destination. Yoga instructor and Breath Meditation teacher Richa Dhekne, who has over two decades of experience as a volunteer and faculty member with the Art of Living Foundation, led the yoga and meditation session hosted by the Consulate General of India in New York. Several other yoga teachers and experts led various meditation, exercises and breathing sessions throughout the day at Times Square, as thousands participated in the day-long activities. \"As you can see, we have yoga participants from several nationalities, and this is going to go on for the entire day today,\" Consul General of India in New York Binaya Srikanta Pradhan said. Pradhan said they were expecting about 8,000-10,000 participants and added that the theme of the 2024 Yoga Day is 'Yoga for Self and Society'. \"I'm sure this is going to inspire everybody participating here today, and around other different parts of the United States,\" Pradhan said. The Consulate said in a post on X 'celebrated the 10th International Day of Yoga at the iconic @TimesSquareNYC!' 'The day-long celebration of Solstice at @TimesSquareNYC featured seven yoga sessions, in which about 10,000 people from across nationalities participated, showcasing the widespread enthusiasm for yoga in the city,' it added. Pradhan greeted the participants, highlighting the benefits of Yoga for both physical health and spiritual well-being, as well as its role in promoting harmony with nature, the Consulate said on X. Officials and staff from the Indian Consulate as well as members of the diaspora joined the yoga session. The Consulate, along with partner associations, held several yoga sessions in the lead-up to Yoga Day, including one at Bryant Park near the famous New York Public Library as well as a special yoga session for women at Central Park that was led by Swami Brahmanishthananda.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) It is possible to be blind to this and pretend to carry on as if nothing has happened but that will not change the reality, asserts Aakar Patel. India's new government has a new Cabinet which is the old Cabinet. The ministers for home, finance, foreign and defence will be the same. These four are considered the most important by the government, which classifies them as comprising the committee on security. And so once again it will be Amit A Shah, Nirmala Sitharaman, S Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh. Road and highways will again by managed by Nitin Gadkari, railways will be run again by Ashwini Vaishnaw, commerce and industry again by Piyush Goyal, law again by Arjun Ram Meghwal. Even where portfolios have been shifted, ministers have been retained and readers will not be unfamiliar with names like Kiren Rijiju, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Giriraj Singh and so on. Some famous names are gone, like Smriti Irani and Rajiv Chandrasekhar, at least for now, but this is because they lost in high-profile contests. No reason has been given for moving around those ministers who have been retained but shifted, but presumably this has been done to accommodate allies like the Telugu Desam (civil aviation), Janata Dal-Secular (steel), Janata Dal United (micro, medium, small industries), LJP (food processing), Shiv Sena (ayurveda and Yoga). Or done to bring in former BJP chief ministers like Shivraj Singh Chauhan of Madhya Pradesh (agriculture) and Manohar Lal of Haryana (housing). Overall it resembles not so much a new cabinet as one that has undergone a minor reshuffle. In the old days, when most newspapers reported news, this would have been reported 'below the fold' as it were, meaning not on the top half of the newspaper. The question is why does 3.0 look like 2.0? The obvious reason is that there is nothing to change because everything is going well. Change is necessary only if there is a need to correct course, and because the BJP won the election, there is no such need. But defeat, meaning sitting in the Opposition, would have meant no BJP Cabinet at all so perhaps it is unclear what the middle ground would be in such a line of thinking and what conditions would trigger change. It is unlikely then that 'all is well' is the reason. What else could it be? One possibility is that there is weak bench strength, that there are not enough talented individuals in the party to be given the important jobs and the prime minister is stuck with the small set he has. This is not the likely reason because under this prime minister, the PMO functions as a mini Cabinet and intervenes on critical issues as the defence, finance and foreign ministries know. There is a third possibility and that is the reluctance or inability to concede that something has in fact gone wrong. The prime minister made a speech in the Lok Sabha on February 5 that has been uploaded on his YouTube channel. As he concludes it, he says the following: 'Mr Speaker, normally I don't get into the issue of numbers. But I have observed the mindset of the nation. It will certainly take the NDA beyond 400, but it will also definitely ( avashya ) give the BJP 370 seats.' At this point the treasury benches are thumped and the chant of 'Modi! Modi!' rises. The prime minister repeats: '370 seats for the BJP and beyond 400 for the NDA'. The thumping and chanting continues. As we now know, this did not happen. The BJP did not get 370 and it did not even get 270. For the first time in his career, the prime minister is leading a minority government. Is this a defeat? If you look at the Opposition and its voters they are behaving as if they have won. The fact that the new government is shaky and dependent on external support is not lost on them. As Yogendra Yadav has said, the acceptability and prestige that was there in the last decade is gone. The invincibility is gone and gone forever. For this very reason many of the BJP's supporters and especially the prime minister's following remain despondent. Externally things have changed. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is again expressing itself on issues concerning the government's functioning after a decade of silence. The NDA partners are asserting themselves. It is possible to be blind to this and pretend to carry on as if nothing has happened but that will not change the reality. The voter has told the prime minister he is less popular than he was in 2019 and less popular in 2014. The voter has also told him that it is okay with an NDA government but not a BJP one. To pretend we are still in February is to lie to oneself. There is no question that the performances of key ministries, including finance and perhaps even home, were the reason for the defeat. Carrying on without change is to continue with the damage. But who in the party can tell him that? Not those who are returning to their positions surrounding him. Not those who know they will be punished for speaking the truth. For those who are opposed to the BJP, this being in denial is not a bad thing because nothing good will come of it as the coming months will show. The world does not change itself to align with one's delusions. Aakar Patel is a columnist and writer and you can read Aakar's earlier columns here .

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Rival governments in Tamil Nadu expend the most on social welfare schemes, especially targeting women and youth and children, but that money comes only by selling more liquor. There is always the specious plea, which has been peddled very many times in the past, that without licensed liquor, drinkers would go after hooch and there could be more hooch tragedies and hooch deaths. No one is convinced, but no one can dispute it either, comments N Sathiya Moorthy. A noticeable aspect of this week's hooch tragedy at Karunapuram and neighbourhood villages in the hilly terrain of central north-west Kallakurichchi district is that no critic of Chief Minister M K Stalin's DMK government has demanded total prohibition. Their demands and the government's response to the tragedy have followed the template model that is not unique to the southern state. A sample: The state government suspended the district police superintendent and a few other police officers down the line and also transferred the district collector, when their presence on the spot might have helped in coordinating relief and response measures. Then it ordered the transfer of the ADGP and SP, prohibition wing, without assigning them alternate posts. Stalin has ordered a judicial probe, by retired high court Judge B Gokuldas, with the predictable three-month period for him to submit his report. Any future extension for the probe under the Commissions of Inquiry Act will also depend on the mood of the media and the masses, the people's readiness to forget the tragedy early on, and move on to other spicy developments. For their part, the political Opposition too has reacted on equally predictable lines. Opposition AIADMK Leader of the Opposition and predecessor CM, Edappadi K Palaniswami, after visiting the affected families, has demanded Stalin's immediate resignation, taking up moral responsibility for the failure of the civil administration in general and the police force in particular. Since the exit of the Congress regime as far as 1967, successive Dravidian chief ministers, starting with the late C N Annadurai, have retained the home portfolio. Stalin, like his late father and chief minister M Karunanidhi, is no exception. The state government has moved the mandatory criminal investigations into the incident from the local police to the Crime Branch-CID operating across the state. The AIADMK Opposition has joined some individuals and has moved the Madras high court for ordering a CBI probe, claiming that the local police and CB-CID were manned by personnel from the same force under the same uniformed leadership, too. Maintaining the same line but making it even more political, state BJP President K Annamalai has written to Union Home Minister Amit A Shah, demanding a CBI probe. It is not that Annamalai, a former IPS officer, did not know that under the law, CBI probe into crimes unconnected with the Union government requires request from or consent of the state government concerned. Alternatively, only the high court of the Supreme Court could order one. Not the one to miss an opportunity when one presented itself, Annamalai has also called for a state-wide protest against the Stalin dispensation and focused on the hooch tragedy. Any AIADMK announcement, or those by other non-INDIA/anti-INDIA political parties or combines, too will be on similar lines, for similar purposes. Among the current crop in the Opposition just now, the PMK alone has been demanding total prohibition across the state, every now and again. The party is taking on the ruling DMK in the Vikravandi by-election in neighbouring Viluppuram district for the BJP-NDA, and is sure to use the hooch tragedy in the adjoining district as a major campaign point. So will actor-politician Seeman's NTK, with the mainline AIADMK Opposition having announced a by-poll boycott this time. If the ruling party/combine thought that they could effectively use the revived budget session of the state assembly to snub the divided Opposition over the Lok Sabha poll drubbing of theirs, it is not to be. The hooch tragedy is going to dominate the daily discourse in the House through the short session. If at the end of it all, the divided Opposition had found common cause in the hooch tragedy to bring them closer way ahead of the state assembly polls due in 2026 summer, the DMK has only itself to blame. Yet, it can breathe easy in the fact that no critic of the government has laid the blame for the tragedy at the doorstep of any specific DMK leader or minister, at least so far. All that the AIADMK has said thus far is that their local MLA had repeatedly written to the government authorities, cautioning them of an impending calamity of the kind, but to no avail. A section of the local media, not seen as friendly to the present day rulers, has also attributed the previous SP seeking voluntary retirement to alleged political pressure brought upon him while dealing with hooch-makers, distributors and sellers. Non-political and apolitical critics of the government system as a whole and the DMK dispensation in particular have asked why Stalin did not visit the tragedy scene, as is customary, but despatched only his minister-son Udayanidhi, in the company of a few senior colleagues, to pay condolences to the dead and offer solace to the affected families. Some cheeky social media posts lacking taste claimed that Stalin had used the tragedy to promote his son further in the political administration of the state. But it is another criticism against the state government that matters the most. Significantly, no political party or leader has spelt out those lines but social media posts have questioned the morality and propriety of the chief minister announcing Rs 10 lakh compensation to the families of every dead victim of hooch. The question is being asked is how and why the government thought it fit to pay for the hooch dead from the tax and other revenue collections that go mostly from non-drinkers. There is also a sociological anxiety that the continued act of the state government paying high compensation to hooch victims while depriving more needy victims of other social evils can have a deleterious effect on community-living. Comparisons too will be made of governmental compensation for flood and cyclone victims, and those in fire tragedies, especially in match and cracker factories. In extreme cases, there is the temptation to believe in the abuse and misuse of governmental grace and generosity. It is in this midst that mild voices have begun to be heard about the need for total prohibition in the state. It may or may not pick up momentum, and a lot of it may also depend on the Madras high court observations, at times obiter dicta that have no binding force on the government, especially. Already, social media has begun addressing questions at social activists, political commentators and film actors who had posted views and demands critical of the previous AIADMK government on a host of issues -- but are supposedly stone-deaf and colour-blind to the incumbent regime. It is also such voices that in particular have questioned the high compensation for hooch victims. This societal double play is unquestionable, yes. But that applies to everyone, big and small, then as now. The late journalist, satirist and moralistic political commentator, Cho S Ramaswamy, was once known to have been a director of a liquor-manufacturing company identified with the AIADMK under J Jayalalithaa. He supposedly quit the post only after his association became public knowledge. In the same vein, social media activists this time round have specifically begun questioning the so-called left-extreme social groups that launched long and relay-like protests across liquor shops across the state through the long run-up to the 2016 assembly elections when Jayalalithaa was chief minister. These groups, mostly with women activists in the frontline, co-opted local women in their protests, which at times turned violent, especially if the local police acted in defence of the liquor shops all of which were/are owned by the state government, then as now. During the state-wide protest, 60-year-old Sasi Perumal, a Gandhian and prohibition activist from Salem, died while carrying the message atop of a mobile tower in Kanyakumari district. That did not deter either the protestors or the government, which however promised the Madras high court to cut down on the number of shops in a gradual manner. This has not happened after a purportedly promising start. It is against this background that every liquor tragedy, hooch or otherwise, in the state has triggered a host of public demands for total prohibition -- only to die a natural death until the next one. The Kallakurichi tragedy is no different. The reasons are many but two of them need special mention and attention. One, it was in present day Tamil Nadu, C Rajagopalachari as the short-serving premier of the Madras Presidency (1937 to 1939) in the pre-Independence British Raj, introduced prohibition on a trial basis in his native, undivided, Salem district, and also parts of present day Andhra Pradesh that were then part of the presidency. It was the policy of the Indian National Congress to which he then belonged and also the personal wish of Gandhiji. The situation changed only after the DMK came to power, especially under the post-Annadurai regime of Karunanidhi. The government claimed that lifting of prohibition became necessary in the early 1970s as a short-term measure to shore up the state's revenues and also to check against hooch tragedies of the kind. Between then and now, the alternating governments of the DMK and breakaway AIADMK have kept blaming the other for the easing the liquor/prohibition policy, and for hooch tragedies, depending on whoever was in power at the time. This time round, it is the bane of the DMK and Stalin, so to say -- but none of them has found an alternative to 'liquor revenues' that have been mounting over the years and decades, and whose contributions to the state budgets too have been shooting up, year after year. The second and more important reason for the common man's desire for a liquor-free environment is the embarrassingly unique record of Tamil Nadu being the only state where the government runs liquor stops -- and the government alone runs liquor shops and bars -- other than those licensed in star-hotels. At least the AIADMK cannot escape the blame for Jayalalithaa as chief minister for 'nationalising' liquor procurement and sales through public sector TASMAC (the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation). For the past two decades, all liquor shops in the state are owned by TASMAC and all serious and pun-intended writing on drinks and the drunk refer to liquor shops only as 'Tasmac', whether in Tamil or English. Even while criticising Jaya for the nationalisation policy and the corruption it had led to -- like with sand-mining, also under her care -- successive DMK governments, including the present one, has done precious little to reverse or even alter the course. The question of total prohibition does not arise, as all political parties have come to believe that there is no alternative to revenue building. Ironically, rival state governments expend the most on social welfare schemes, especially targeting women and youth and children, but that money comes only by selling more liquor, especially to their own men-folk. There is always the specious plea, which has been peddled very many times in the past, that without licensed liquor, drinkers would go after hooch and there could be more hooch tragedies and hooch deaths. No one is convinced, but no one can dispute it either. Today, the situation is such that actor-politician Vijay, who launched the Tamizhaga Vetri Kazhagam earlier this year, with the promise to contest all 234 assembly seats in the 2026 elections, too has not talked prohibition, after visiting the Kallakurichi tragedy victims. Whether he will do it in the coming months, especially in his manifesto for the 2026 polls, too is a remote question. This despite the fact that many of his fans and expected voters are young to middle-aged women, whose livelihood and lifestyle is what hooch tragedies and liquor-flows, legal or otherwise, end up hurting, and beyond redemption and recovery.

They did not take a single article of the J&K constitution and merged it with the Indian Constitution. \"Had they done it, the people of Kashmir would have felt that the Government of India has taken something from our constitution too while abrogating Article 370,\" Sanjay Tickoo , president of the Kashmiri Pandits Sangharsh Samiti, tells Syed Firdaus Ashraf/ Rediff.com . The concluding segment of a three-part interview: Why has India not been able to win the hearts of Kashmiri Muslims? Nobody can win the hearts of Kashmiri Muslims by danda ( stick ). You have to accommodate them. You have to feel their pain. You cannot deny the human rights violation of State actors. And similarly, the majority of Kashmiri Muslims in Kashmir should not deny the human rights violation by non-State actors. We Kashmiris living in Kashmir are victims of both the State as well as non-State actors. But I see a very contrary Kashmir Valley to what you are saying. Youngsters are going to coaching classes. Unicorns like Physicswallah have arrived in Kashmir and the youngsters want peace. Kashmiri Muslims have always studied hard and this is true especially after 1990. They saw how Kashmiri Pandits survived outside the Kashmir Valley only because of their educational qualification. Taking that cue in every Kashmiri Muslim house, parents force children for education and they spend money on education. Therefore, you see these Allen and Physicswallah in Kashmir. Secondly, people only see Lal Chowk and Dal Lake where you see tourists and think that is normalcy. Normalcy does not come in that fashion, it comes from the heart. And let me tell you, Kashmiri Muslims will never ever forget the abrogation of Article 370. They can forget the killings, rapes but they will never ever forget the abrogation of Article 370. There was nothing in Article 370 but for me too as a Kashmiri, it was a privilege to be a Kashmiri in India because of Article 370. I had my own flag and my own constitution of J&K. The central government made only one mistake while abrogating Article 370. They did not take a single article of the J&K constitution and merged it with the Indian Constitution. Had they done it, the people of Kashmir would have felt that the Government of India has taken something from our constitution too while abrogating Article 370. They did not take anything from us, snatched away everything from us and imposed everything on us. What must India do to win the hearts of Kashmiris? They have given subsidies for so many years to J&K. India is giving subsidies to every state in the country. You cannot claim that India will become a number one economy by given 5 kg ration to 80 crore people. You cannot win hearts by the Ujjwala scheme. You will win my heart only when I feel I am safe in Kashmir and I have been accommodated by the central government. When India has failed Kashmiri Pandits, how can they win over Kashmiri Muslims? When Prime Minister Modi came for a rally in Kashmir in March 2024, why were government employees made to attend the rally compulsorily? Why did the BJP fail to get three candidates for parliamentary elections in Kashmir? The BJP claims they have eight lakh cadres in the Kashmir Valley so why can't they contest elections from Kashmir? I want to know the answer. The BJP has a reported tie-up with the Apni Party in Kashmir Valley so they did not put up their own candidates. At the end of the day, the lotus, which is the BJP's election symbol, will not bloom in the Kashmir Valley. You sound tired of everything that is happening in Kashmir today. Yes, because nothing is moving on the ground. Politicians are running the business in the Kashmir Valley now. In fact, everyone is doing business in Kashmir. Be it Kashmiri Pandits, Kashmiri Muslims, bureaucrats or name anybody. Everybody is doing business in Kashmir. And nobody is concerned about the future generation of Kashmiris who will live in Kashmir. Kashmiri Muslims are not endorsing the pain of Kashmiri Pandits and Kashmiri Pandits are not endorsing the pain of Kashmiri Muslims. In an ideal world they should have endorsed each other's pain on the international level. This would have given weightage as a Kashmiri. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) For the last four years since abrogation of Article 370, Kashmir-based political parties have been struggling to forge an alternate narrative to the one forcibly snatched from them. The BJP is bound to go hammer and tongs at them now that their armoury is reinforced with the Supreme Court judgment, notes Mohammad Sayeed Malik, the veteran commentator on Kashmir affairs. Linking the Supreme Court's momentous decision , finally burying the Kashmir-related Article 370, with its historical perspective, it becomes crystal clear that the Sheikh Abdullah-led Kashmiri leadership had been taken up the proverbial garden path by 'New Delhi' during the crucial period of negotiations over division of powers between the centre and the state during early 1950s. They fell for a tantalisingly wrapped package mistaking it for a prize-trophy. They made a fatal blunder: Not looking into the intrinsic worth of guarantees and commitments being gifted to them in return for popular endorsement of the state's accession to the Indian Union against the run of events on the subcontinent in 1947 and mobilising a popular uprising against the tribal invasion from Pakistan. The myth of the state's 'semi sovereign' status somehow lasted for 76 years until the apex court pricked the balloon and tersely ruled against its perpetuation. The court also held that Jammu and Kashmir ruler (Maharaja Hari Singh) had surrendered his sovereignty along with the accession, like rulers of other nearly 500 states. It held that the existence of J&K's separate constituent assembly (1951-1956) or its decisions were not binding on the President of India under whose authority Constitutional orders governing the state-Centre relationship were being issued from time to time. That is how J&K had sustained a separate constitution and a separate flag until August 5, 2019 when the BJP-ruled central government bulldozed it, downgraded the state and divided it into two separate Union Territories -- J&K and Ladakh. The Delhi Agreement of 1952, between Sheikh Abdullah and the central government was the first formal demarcation of authority between the Centre and J&K state. Sheikh Abdullah's dismissal from power and arbitrary arrest shortly thereafter (1953) permanently tilted the balance of power at the state's expense. Areas of central jurisdiction multiplied after Sheikh's exit and Article 370 became a virtual a one-way tunnel. This truth was reflected in the torrent of central laws extended to supposedly 'autonomous' J&K state. The Supreme Court's interpretation that Article 370 in relation to J&K had been conceived as a temporary/transitional mechanism 'in atmosphere of war' is, at the best, a partial fact. By the time Article 370 was evolved (1949-1950) the war atmosphere triggered by the tribal invasion had subsided and the constitutional mechanism for transfer of power from the maharaja to a popular government headed by Sheikh Abdullah had been meticulously put through. It was during this period that the state constituent assembly was elected, a framework of Centre-state relationship was being devised and socioeconomic measures of far reaching implications were being implemented under the constitutional/legal protection of Article 370. But for this legal safeguard the land reforms and other measures like protection of 'state subject' privilege could have been nullified through judicial intervention. Obviously, an arrangement intended to serve 'in war atmosphere' only couldn't have been stretched as far as Article 370 was to usher such far reaching changes across the board. Failure of the state leadership (1940s-1950s) to secure a permanent set of guarantees and rest assured with temporary/transitional commitments turned out to be fatal flaw when the arrangement was challenged legally and constitutionally. The Supreme Court's unanimous decision to bury the temporary/transitional Constitutional proviso after it had existed for over seven decades is unquestionable. Politically, the story is no less intriguing. It was no secret that after Sheikh's dismissal in 1953, even Jawaharlal Nehru was aiming at getting rid of Kashmir's special constitutional status. Whenever questioned, his favourite explanation used to be ' ghiste, ghiste ghis jaye ga ' (Article 370 will wear itself out through gradual wear and tear). The post-1953 torrential inflow of central laws into J&K rendered Article 370 virtually hollow from inside and its statutory existence was just nominal. No doubt even this hollow contraption served the political purpose of demarcating the nationalists from the separatists within the state's political format. Post-August 5, 2019, the mainstream part of the arena, broadly identified with the National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party and the Congress remains bereft of a marketable (alternative) political agenda, resulting in desertion and poaching by NDA-blessed new local outfits. The Gupkar Alliance was an expedient arrangement to tide over the immediate challenge faced by the beleaguered mainstream groups. Now that the Supreme Court verdict has removed that fig leaf they would be hard put to assemble some kind of politically saleable platform. Survival of the Gupkar Alliance itself is at stake now. Interestingly, for the last four years since abrogation of Article 370, Kashmir-based mainstream parties have been struggling to forge an alternate narrative to the one forcibly snatched from them. On the contrary, the Bharatiya Janata Party is bound to go hammer and tongs at them now that their armoury is reinforced with the Supreme Court's judgment and also its psychological advantage goes to them exclusively. The BJP is making no secret of its long-nursed ambition to get into power and rule the country's only Muslim-majority state/UT. That explains the unduly long delay in holding assembly polls even when conditions on the ground seem to be fairly suitable for holding assembly elections. Ironically, no one finds any issue with preparing to hold the 2024 parliamentary poll along with the rest of the country. But the hesitation to also go for the all-important assembly elections is being deflected under one pretext or another. For unexplained reasons, the Supreme Court has skirted the politically ticklish issue of downgrading J&K state and breaking it up into two Union Territories. 'We did not go into this issue' because the central government had vaguely committed to restoring J&K's statehood. It ought to have been addressed with the seriousness that it merits as it is of great emotional value to the people of the erstwhile state across the board. Their expectations were belied. The over 475 page court judgment relates, directly or indirectly, to numerous other issues which would continue to be debated for a long time to come. For instance, the proposal mooted by one of the five judges that a ' Truth and Reconciliation Commission ' be set up to go into post-1989 developments in Kashmir notably mass migration of the Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley and its possible resolution. It is a multi-layered multi-dimensional issue that has far defied attempts at resolution. Also it continues to feed communal rancour with ugly projections.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Such a course would require a Constitutional Amendment, requiring two-thirds majority in both Houses of Parliament. Even assuming that the INDIA combine comes to power next year, a two-thirds majority in the Lok Sabha could be way off the mark for them, observes N Sathiya Moorthy. It may no more be an election issue for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre as the party may want to believe and also want the nation to believe. But Monday's Supreme Court verdict upholding the abrogation of Article 370 can become a thorn in the flesh for the anti-BJP Opposition INDIA combine, beginning with their upcoming seat-sharing talks in Delhi on December 19. The reasons are not far to seek. The INDIA combine partners from J&K would want a unified stand against the abrogation despite the Supreme Court verdict. It they do not seek a review or a larger bench (for which the chances may be less than for the other), they may want the combine to swear by restoring status quo ante if they came to power. The J&K partners in the INDIA combine too know the complications, but they cannot but be seen as making the demand on the combine. The latter cannot be seen as side-stepping the same, either. The chances of the alliance appointing a high-level experts' committee and report back at the next meeting may be an immediate way out, but that is not going to end the agony in some, anguish in others and anxiety in a few more. The reasons are not far to seek. If the Samajwadi Party, for instance, took objection to the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's Lok Sabha member, Dr Senthil Kumar, branding the traditional 'Hindi belt' as a ' gaumutra belt' because it hurts majority Hindu sentiments across the country, especially in north India, it may have to agree to consider similar sentiments pervading a reopened discourse on Article 370. It pertains to 'Hindutva nationalism' of the BJP kind, which overlaps with the very same Hindu vote-bank of the BJP, whatever be the religious sentiments that influence the north Indian voter in public. If anything, even more than Hindu religious sentiments, at times centred on Ayodhya, where a Ram temple is being readied for consecration ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, Article 370 is both about Hindutva politics and national security. Or, that is the BJP-RSS narration that has found favour even outside the Hindi belt. The public mood over the Modi government's 'Surgical Strikes' on ISI-backed terrorist bases in Pakistan occupied Kashmir still prevails, even if to a lesser degree. Does the BJP as the ruling party have anything more to refurbish it all, is the question ahead of the Lok Sabha polls -- or, will one be required and justified? Until proved otherwise, even an INDIA combine will have to assume that the Congress will play a pivot role in the matter if it came to power. In government, the party will be torn between its commitment to Article 370 and the pragmatic approach to domestic and foreign policy hassles centred on the Kashmir issue. The former line will mean that it would be justifiably defending the Nehruvian legacy, which has become a source of criticism bordering on ridicule at the hands of the BJP rival through the past decades and more so in the past nine years of the Modi government. It will also be playing along with the continuing demand of the J&K allies. However in a pre-/post-poll scenario, what is the likely mood of other INDIA partners? Will anyone have any view other than restoration of the status quo ante ? Will either or both sides then want their views articulated first in the December 19 discussions, and then in a common INDIA poll manifesto, if it came to that? Independent of whichever party in an INDIA dispensation (if it came to that) gets the PM's post, home, external affairs and defence portfolios, their ideological position on the larger Kashmir issue, terrorism and larger national security and border disputes all would matter. For the Government of India as an institution, to revisit an already settled matter with every change of government is just not on, though other aspects of the issue may be considered and acted upon for its domestic dimensions. Of course, it can be argued that if the Modi government could abrogate Article 370, why can a successor government not restore the same? Then, of course, the new law and restoration too could be challenged in the Supreme Court, under a different set of facts and circumstances. There is a practical problem. Such a course would require a Constitutional Amendment, requiring two-thirds majority in both Houses of Parliament. Even assuming that the INDIA combine comes to power at the Centre next year, a two-thirds majority in the Lok Sabha could be way ofF the mark for them. In relative terms, it may be easier for the BJP, going by the past trends in 2014 and 2019 -- though there is a need to provide for 'anti-incumbency' in their case. Granted that the INDIA bloc can muster up a two-thirds vote in the Lok Sabha, what about the Rajya Sabha, where the BJP could hold the government hostage for a long time just as the rest were doing for the Modi government? It is difficult to imagine that non-INDIA, non-NDA parties will have a substantial number of seats in either House to be able to upset the apple-cart, as has been happening through the Modi regime. Still, the last-mile hiccup is this. As per precedents and court rulings, the creation of a new state by merging the present-day J&K and Ladakh, which were separated when Article 370 was abrogated, too may require a resolution from the legislatures of the two Union territories. Granting that there are going to be no elections there before the SC-fixed deadline of September 2024, the Government of India, through the good offices of the lieutenant governors (after sacking the present ones?), can choose that route to argue their case for getting a constitutional amendment passed without waiting for long. It is again theoretical, as to which will come first, the September elections or a two-thirds majority in the two Houses of Parliament? Or, neither of them in the immediate future? Yet, the Supreme Court has clearly ruled that Article 370 was only a 'transitional provision' due to 'war-time conditions' in J&K. So, restoration of the scrapped J&K Constitution earlier available under Article 370 may become unviable. Yet, re-merging the two Union Territories could still be a theoretical possibility -- a poor substitute, which the INDIA allies from those parts may be happy to do without. Under Article 3 of the Constitution, merger of two or more states/UTs or creation of two or three out one requires only the two Houses of Parliament pass a resolution by a simple majority. It does not tantamount to a Constitutional Amendment requiring two-thirds vote in the two Houses, as per Article 368. Better or worse, it may still be too early to predict this early the public mood in Buddhist-majority Ladakh for a re-merger.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'On hard cases like this one, the Supreme Court has only episodically stood against Parliament and the executive government.' 'I worry that this decision sets a precedent where President's rule is imposed in another state... and during the operation of President's rule, the state is fundamentally altered.' A month ago, on December 11, 2023, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Centre's decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, that bestowed special status upon the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The apex court also upheld the validity of the Union government's decision to carve out the Union Territory of Ladakh from the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, although it did not adjudicate upon the validity of the reorganisation of J-K into UTs. Holding that Article 370 was a temporary provision, the apex court ruled that J-K had no internal sovereignty and the concurrence of the state government was not required to apply the Indian Constitution to the state. Although the court held as invalid ( external link ) the Constitutional Order 272, that changed the meaning of 'J-K Constituent Assembly' to 'J-K Legislative Assembly' and 'J-K Government' as 'Governor', this conclusion did not affect the outcome of the judgment since it held that the recommendation of J-K Constituent Assembly was not necessary for the President to declare Article 370 as inoperative. Arghya Sengupta , founder and research director at the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, who also authored Hamƒ´√± Ast: A Biography of Article 370 ( external link ), spoke to Rediff.com 's Utkarsh Mishra about the Supreme Court verdict against which several review petitions were filed on January 10, 2024. \"The Supreme Court is a largely conservative institution, interpreting a largely conservative Constitution. It was thus no surprise that it found a baseline of enhanced integration and unity underlying Article 370 and the overall relationship between J-K and India,\" says Sengupta. In your book Hamƒ´√± Ast: A Biography of Article 370 , you wrote, 'Any justification that seeks to legitimise the nullification of Article 370 overlooks both the historical context of Article 370 as well as the legal text.' In this context, how do you see the Supreme Court's December 11, 2023 order in the case? Politically, four-and-a-half years after the nullification of Article 370 on the 5th and 6th of August, 2019, there was resignation to the fact that it is time for everyone to move on and chart a new future for Jammu and Kashmir. The judgment of the Supreme Court in the Article 370 matter appears to have done just that -- signalled to all parties that it is time to move on. Central to this moving on is its finding in the Chief Justice's judgment that the purpose of Article 370 was always to 'enhance Constitutional integration between the Union and the State of Jammu and Kashmir'. Once this was found to be the rationale for the provision, it is a logical inference that a move that ensures full and final integration of Jammu and Kashmir would be found wholly in line with that purpose. Yet, this is where the court fundamentally erred. The purpose of Article 370 was neither enhancing integration with India nor furthering autonomy of the state -- rather, if a single purpose is to be found ( that itself is a questionable premise, whether a provision is incapable of having more than one purpose ) it is that of collaboration -- that any decision on the future of the state of Jammu and Kashmir would have to be taken jointly by the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the people of the rest of India. That was both what the historical context of the formulation of Article 370 was as well as a plain reading of the legal text. The judgment of the Supreme Court turned both these on its head when it came to the conclusion it did. The Supreme Court held that the Constitutional Order 272, changing the meaning of 'J-K Constituent Assembly' to 'J-K Legislative Assembly' and 'J-K Government' to 'Governor' was invalid. Yet, it upheld the abrogation of Article 370, saying the recommendation of J-K Constituent Assembly was not necessary for the President to declare Article 370 as inoperative. How do you see it? And if the recommendation was not necessary, why did the government even go through the route of amending Article 367, it could simply have revoked the special status by a Presidential Order? The court's reasoning in this regard is curious and part of a larger trend of judgments from the Supreme Court where the foundations go in one direction and the conclusion in another. We found that in the case relating to Internet shutdowns in Kashmir, where the court waxed eloquent about the right to access the Internet being a fundamental right but failed to shape any meaningful remedy for the people of Jammu and Kashmir, leaving that decision ultimately in the hands of the Executive. Similarly in the marriage equality case, the court has written pages on the importance of equality and non-discrimination in the Constitutional framework, only to reject its applicability in that case. Something similar has happened here. The court has found that the substitution of the Constituent Assembly of J-K with the Legislative Assembly was bad in law because one cannot do indirectly ( through Article 367 ) what one cannot do directly ( through Article 370 ). That, in my view, is arguable, because the Union did have a strong case that now that the Constituent Assembly has not existed for over six decades, the voice of the people of Jammu and Kashmir is best represented by its legislators. The court strikes a republican blow by pointing out the distinction between a Constitution-making body and a legislative body and refuses to sanction this change. One would have expected such a court that places such stock on the will of the people to continue that strand of reasoning. But then in a curious turn, it completely negates the text of the provision itself that requires 'recommendation of the Constituent Assembly' for making any change to Article 370 and 'concurrence of the state government' for making any change to how the Constitution applies to J-K (in matters not in the original Instrument of Accession). This is not even how the Executive saw it! The basis for this is a classic case of circular logic. The recommendation of the Constituent Assembly is not needed because the effect of abrogation can also be achieved by an order applying all the provisions of the Constitution individually to J-K without modification. That order requires the concurrence of the state government. However, concurrence is only needed when the state constitution also needs to be amended. Since in this case, the state constitution also withers away, no concurrence is needed. Ergo, no recommendation is needed. I will explain this logic with a simple analogy -- you ask your barber to use a comb and a pair of scissors to cut your hair. The barber says, much to your dissatisfaction, that he can get the same result by using a hair clipper. When he goes to use the hair clipper, he finds that it is rusted and unclean. He now says that the hair clipper is rusted and unclean, so it is likely that the scissors too which were lying next to the clipper will be rusted and unclean and unfit for use. So he only uses a comb to cut your hair. Sounds bizarre that a barber can cut your hair with a comb alone? That's exactly how bizarre the logic is in saying that the President alone can nullify Article 370. This was a hard case and I can sympathise with the court trying to find a solution that is logically neat and practically workable. But it has sacrificed the former for the latter in a manner that is entirely disproportionate. The Supreme Court did not adjudicate upon the validity of the reorganisation of J-K into a Union Territory. However, it upheld the carving out of Ladakh as a Union Territory. Does that somehow contravene the provisions of Article 3? More important, does it open a Pandora's box where the Centre can undertake a similar exercise in any other state? It is understandable that the court did not get into the question of determining the legality of the reorganisation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The court has a doctrine that it does not answer academic questions and the assurance of the solicitor-general was that statehood would soon be restored rendering the question academic. The court could have kept this question open, but not adjudicating on it was a possible course for the court to take. I hope the solicitor-general remains true to his word, in keeping with the finest traditions of the court. Having taken this course, the court upholds the carving out of Ladakh as a UT because it states that the proviso to Article 3 that requires the views of the state legislature of J-K to be taken before a UT is created, is not applicable to this case. This is because the proclamation that imposed President's rule suspended the operation of the proviso. So no views have to be taken. I worry that this decision sets a precedent where President's rule is imposed in another state in the future, the same provision ( proviso to Article 3 ) is suspended, and during the operation of President's rule, the state is fundamentally altered in some way. The court could have prevented such a situation from arising in the future by either laying down this law as a matter of prospective overruling ( will not be permitted in the future ) or more boldly saying that the purpose of President's rule which is to restore Constitutional machinery in a state cannot entail changing that constitutional machinery to begin with. But it didn't do either. The Supreme Court ruled that the Constitutional set-up did not indicate that J-K retained sovereignty after acceding to the Union of India. It said that 'there was a clear absence in the constitution of Jammu and Kashmir to the reference of sovereignty and that the State of Jammu and Kashmir became an integral part of India is evident from Articles 1 and 370 of the Constitution of India'. But the constitution of J-K as well as the Presidential Order of 1954 clearly stated the way in which the Indian Constitution is applied to J-K. Why did the Supreme Court choose to ignore those provisions? This is a point on which there is a disagreement between the judgment of the Chief Justice and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul ( now retired ). The former holds that the state of J-K did not retain any internal sovereignty, whereas the latter holds that it did have the vestige of sovereignty, exercised through the Constituent Assembly of J-K. I think this question itself has been framed wrongly. It is not relevant for the determination of the case whether the state continued to have any sovereignty or not. Take any state in India -- it has the sole power to make laws on all matters in the State List. Do we say that the state is sovereign in these respects? No. That would be an odd way to describe the plenary powers of the state. Similarly, Article 370 and the fact of the constitution of J-K being formed by a Constituent Assembly of J-K should not be seen as elements of sovereignty or lack thereof. They need to be seen as part of a constitutional design of integration that mandated that it would take two hands to clap for the future of the state of J-K to be decided. Neither the Union of India nor the state of J-K alone was sovereign -- it was a case of collaboration, of joint action. Bringing sovereignty into the picture was conceptually confusing and did not take the judgment forward in any way. The court also said that 'Article 370 was a feature of asymmetric federalism and not sovereignty'. If that is so, shouldn't the abrogation of the Article go against the basic structure of the Constitution? What is the basic structure of the Constitution? It is what the court says it is. We know from Bommai's judgment that federalism is part of the basic structure of the Constitution. But what does federalism entail? Does doing away with asymmetries in the way in which the federal structure operates, violate the basic structure? There is no conclusive determination in the past from the Supreme Court on this matter. So there was no question of a basic structure violation in this case. However, in an essay in the festschrift to Nani Palkhivala, I had written that Article 370 itself had a basic structure -- that it would take two hands to clap. That was undone on 5th and 6th August 2019 in a manner not countenanced by the article. But as a conceptual matter, asymmetry in the federal arrangement is itself a fundamental feature of our Constitution. A symmetrically federal India was neither envisaged nor would it be conducive to the inherent diversity of our nation. A push for symmetry may end up creating more dissension than unity. You have explained in your book how in Md Maqbool Damnoo vs State of Jammu and Kashmir , the Supreme Court upheld they way in which explanations in Article 370 were changed to apply Article 249 of the Indian Constitution to the state. Do you think the court could have taken a different view in the present case? Overall, the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Article 370 case is a missed opportunity for the court. That opportunity was missed when the court failed to list the matter for four years, and it really points to why there must be greater transparency in allocation of cases by the Chief Justice of India. The judgment itself was on expected lines. On hard cases like this one, the Supreme Court has only episodically stood against Parliament and the executive government. On matters that are considered to be 'national interest' issues, it has never really been a bulwark of the kind people sometimes imagine it to be. To think that in the first place is to drink the Kool-Aid that has for long dominated scholarship about India in global academia. That has made everyone in the Indian legal system feel good about themselves, but is sadly far removed from the reality of inter-branch relations in India over time. The Supreme Court is a largely conservative institution, interpreting a largely conservative Constitution. It was thus no surprise that it found a baseline of enhanced integration and unity underlying Article 370 and the overall relationship between J-K and India. For now, we will all have to move on with this judgment as the law of the land. One can only hope that the scars will heal over time and J-K can again become ' hamin ast ' like Amir Khusro described it. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday reached out to Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay on the eve of the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, amid a face-off with the Opposition INDIA bloc over the appointment of Bharatiya Janata Party leader Bhartuhari Mahtab as the pro-tem Speaker. Rijiju's meeting with Bandyopadhyay came against the backdrop of the Opposition alliance's decision to pull out its members from the panel of chairpersons that will assist Mahtab in conducting the proceedings of the Lok Sabha till the election of the Speaker on Wednesday. Bandyopadhyay, who was among the three Opposition members named to the panel of chairpersons in the Lok Sabha, told Rijiju that he would be unable to join the panel and stuck with the decision taken by the INDIA bloc. \"Met Sudip Bandyopadhyayji, leader of All India Trinamool Congress Parliamentary Party. Sudip da has a long-standing Parliamentary career and he is known for his calm and dignified conduct in the Parliament. The 18th Lok Sabha will hugely benefit from his experiences,\" Rijiju said on X. Earlier, President Droupadi Murmu had appointed Mahtab, a seven-term Lok Sabha member from Cuttack, as the Pro-tem Speaker. The President had also named Kodikunnil Suresh (Congress), TR Baalu (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam), Radha Mohan Singh and Faggan Singh Kulaste (both BJP) and Bandyopadhyay to the panel of chairpersons to assist Mahtab. The Congress had taken objection to Mahtab's appointment, contending that the claim of eight-term member Suresh, a Dalit leader, was overlooked. The INDIA bloc has said opposition leaders Suresh, Baalu and Bandopadhyay will not join the panel of chairpersons as a mark of protest. Rijiju has asserted that Mahtab has had seven uninterrupted terms as a Lok Sabha member, making him eligible for the post, while Suresh lost elections in 1998 and 2004 which makes his current term the fourth straight one in the lower house. Earlier, he was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1989, 1991, 1996 and 1999. The Congress kept up the attack on the BJP on Sunday with senior leader Jairam Ramesh terming the ruling party as anti-Dalit. \"If this argument is adopted, then why has Ramesh Chandappa Jigajinagi, a BJP MP who is also in his seventh consecutive term, not been considered? Is it because he is a Dalit like Suresh,\" Ramesh, the AICC General Secretary incharge of Communications, posted on X. BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla responded to the post, saying the Congress should make Suresh the Leader of Opposition. \"If you are so concerned about the political career of Shri Kodikunnil Suresh, I would urge you to make him the Leader of the Opposition and the CM face of the UDF for the 2026 Kerala elections. Why stress so much for a temporary position?\" he said on X. The BJP spokesperson also said that the majority of the victims in the Tamil Nadu hooch tragedy were from Scheduled Castes and the Congress should ensure justice for them too. \"Also majority of those 56 who died in Kallakurichi in the illicit hooch tragedy are from the SC community! How about some Nyay for them by asking MK Stalin ji to sack his excise minister,\" he said. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'The NEET-PG is the only exam for admission to MD, MS and PG Diploma courses.' 'Many doctors take time off from work to prepare for it, while others study during their long hospital shifts.' Over 200,000 students, who registered to appear for the now postponed National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-post graduate (NEET-PG) examination on Sunday, June 23, 2024, are uncertain on the road ahead for them. This comes after the entrance exam for postgraduate courses in medical and allied sciences got postponed barely 10 hours before it was scheduled to start. While the health ministry stated that a fresh date for the examination will be announced at the earliest, candidates feel that the decision to postpone the exam just 10 hours before its start is very harsh. Highlighting the difficulties being faced by candidates, a doctor said many of them had centres in cities far away from where they live. \"Some had even reached there after travelling for 15 to 18 hours and suddenly the announcement came last night,\" the doctor said. Another aspirant said: \"The NEET-PG is the only exam for admission to MD, MS and PG Diploma courses. Many doctors take time off from work to prepare for it, while others study during their long hospital shifts.\" Several candidates that were to give the exam may weigh options to study abroad for postgraduate medical courses. \"While I had no plans to move abroad for my MS after what happened during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, many doctors may do so,\" a candidate said. The postponement of NEET-PG also put a spanner for candidates planning to undertake post-MBBS Diplomate of National Board (DNB) courses. According to an information bulletin released by the National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) in April, the merit list of NEET-PG 2024 was to be utilised for admission to various post-MBBS DNB, post-MBBS Direct 6-year DrNB courses and other NBEMS diploma courses. \"The NEET-PG exam has already faced multiple date changes. Initially set for March 3, the paper was postponed to July 8 in January this year. Shortly after, the date was again moved to June 23. Now, just a day before the exam, it has been postponed again\", the candidate added. The Union health ministry on Saturday announced its decision to postpone the NEET-PG entrance examination, scheduled to be held on June 23. It called it a 'precautionary measure' in the wake of the recent allegations on the integrity of certain competitive exams. 'Taking into consideration the recent incidents of allegations regarding the integrity of certain examinations, the ministry has decided to undertake a thorough assessment of the robustness of processes of the NEET-PG entrance examination for medical students,' the ministry said in a statement. The postponement of NEET PG 2024 comes amid controversy in several entrance examinations of alleged paper leaks. It is the second major examination to be postponed this month after the Joint CSIR UGC-NET exam. The latter is conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), which is already facing anger over irregularities in the NEET-UG exam and cancellation of the UGC-NET due to a leaked exam paper on the darkNet. On Saturday night, the centre removed NTA chief Subodh Kumar Singh and placed him on 'compulsory wait.'

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'I have serious doubts about the longevity of the NDA government and the longevity of the 18th Lok Sabha itself.' Political economist Parakala Prabhakar was one of the few commentators in India who had predicted before the elections that the Bharatiya Janata Party would not get more than 240 seats! And he was bang on! In his interview to Rediff.com , Prabhakar -- who is married to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman -- had said, \" Modi fatigue has set in, and the BJP is in for huge punishment by the electorate. \" \"There is no point in pretending that things are what they were before. No, they have changed. The sooner the government and people in power recognise the shift in the ground, the better for them,\" Prabhakar tells Rediff.com 's Shobha Warrier in the concluding segment of a two-part interview: You know Chandrababu Naidu very well having worked with him for many years. Do you think he will continue to support Narendra Modi? Remember the TDP ( Telugu Desam Party ) walked out of the NDA ( National Democratic Alliance ) government in 2018. That was done because the Centre was not ready to give special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Now, in order for Mr Naidu to continue with the NDA and support the government, he will have to tell the people, 'This is what I got in lieu of support', and that cannot be anything other than special category status. So, there will be enough pressure on him from the people of the state to get the special category status. If Andhra Pradesh is given special category status, Bihar will ask. And many other people also will ask. So, you need to have a sensible Union government which accommodates all these demands. They have taken a very strong stand against giving special category status in 2018. Now, they have to go back on that. Now that you spoke about going back on the stand taken earlier, do you think we will not hear about Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan or Hindu Rashtra for some time? Times are different now. They might make some noises here and there, but you have to remember that none of their allies are ideological allies. I have my doubts about them going along with the BJP on such issues and issues like Gyanvapi or Mathura. Will the BJP have the courage to go ahead with Gyanvapi or Mathura now that they have lost Faizabad where the Ayodhya Ram temple is? Is it not symbolic of people speaking against the kind of politics they were indulging in? Yes, there is a very clear message from the verdict; that no more of the Hindu-Muslim, Musalman, Mangalasutra kind of politics, and concentrate on the issues that affect people. If the BJP and the government do not recognise that mandate, and move as though nothing has changed, I think they are going to get a huge backlash. What will happen to the Electoral Bond scam, the PM Cares controversy and the latest stock market controversy now that they are back in power? The reason why they want to stick to power is that if an Opposition government comes into power, all these things will be unearthed. They will be probed, and they will be in a deep soup. There are scams starting from the Rafale deal to Pegasus to Electoral Bonds to PM Cares to the stock exchange. People have calculated that the discrepancy in the difference between the official income of the BJP and the expenditure in terms of building so many swanky offices all over the country, is close to Rs 60,000 crores ( Rs 600 billion ). Do you feel the scams were not discussed or debated in the country because the mainstream media did not perform its duty? The so-called mainstream media have become another department of the information and broadcasting ministry. It's like the DAVP ( Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity ). That's the reason why a lot of people's pent-up anger came through the independent media. I have always maintained that in this election, the fight was between Narendra Modi and the people of India, the BJP and the people of India and the NDA and the people of India. The people of India have spoken very loudly, and they have totally dejected this kind of politics in spite of the control of the media, in spite of no level playing field, in spite of the control of the Election Commission, in spite of jailing chief ministers, in spite of freezing the accounts of the main Opposition party... Imagine for a while, if it were a level playing field, things would have been very, very drastically different. Looking at the results, do you feel the people of India are basically secular in nature? If you want to draw an analogy from economics and markets, you see when the markets get over heated, they get corrected. Similarly, the Indian polity has undergone a process of correction. The people have pulled the BJP back into the political centre from when it was trying to change the trajectory to far right. Your final thoughts? The first message of the election is, Indian people have very clearly said, 'We do not want to go down the road of Hindutva, Hindi, Hindu, Hindu Rashtra kind of politics. We want a life where we live together with everybody. And India belongs to everybody. Don't drag us down the road of majoritarian, fascist and dictatorial kind of politics.' The second message is that people want the government to focus on livelihood issues, employment, price rise, rural distress, farmers' issues, etc. The third message is, the Modi magic has vanished. The fourth message is, there is no point in pretending that things are what they were before. No, they have changed. The sooner the government and people in power recognise the shift in the ground, the better for them. Finally, my forecast is, I have serious doubts about the longevity of the Modi government, longevity of the NDA government and the longevity of the 18th Lok Sabha itself.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The Special Task Force (STF) of the Uttar Pradesh Police on Sunday arrested six members of a gang, including a staff of a printing press, for their alleged involvement in leaking the examination paper for the posts of review officers and assistant review officers. The arrests were made in Prayagraj, the STF said in a statement. The exam, conducted by the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC), was held across the state on February 11. The state government cancelled the exam on March 2, following reports that the paper was leaked. Those arrested are -- Sunil Raghuvanshi, a resident of Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh and a printing press worker, Subhash Prakash, a resident of Madhubani in Bihar, Vishal Dubey and Sandeep Pandey (residents of Prayagraj), Amarjeet Sharma, a resident of Gaya (Bihar), and Vivek Upadhyay, a resident of Ballia. A laptop, six mobile phones and five blank cheques were seized from them, the STF said. Prior to this, 10 people were arrested in this connection. A case under sections 419 (punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (punishment for forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will etc.), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 34 (common intention), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender) of the IPC has been lodged at the Civil Lines police station in Prayagraj. Charges under the Uttar Pradesh Public Examination Act, 1998 and Information Technology Act have also been slapped on the arrested accused, police said. The STF also said that during interrogation of the arrested accused, it was found that the question paper of the said examination was leaked in two ways. First, this question paper was leaked from the examination centre itself on the day of the examination on February 11 at around 06.30 am before the commencement of the examination by scanning it with the help of mobile phones by Kamlesh Kumar Pal alias KK, Dr. Sharad Singh Patel, Saurabh Shukla, Arun Singh and Arpit Vineet Yashwant, who looks after the examination work of Bishop Johnson Girls School and College Prayagraj. All five have already been arrested by the UP STF and sent to jail in this connection, they said. The second way in which the said question paper was leaked was from the printing press. Sunil Raghuvanshi, an employee of the press, was involved in this, the STF said. On February 3, Raghuvanshi was present in the press on the pretext of repairing the machine. Upon getting an opportunity, he came out of the press with his drinking water bottle and brought the question paper out by hiding it inside, they said. He took the question paper to his house and kept it there. He informed Vishal Dubey about this and Dubey told Rajiv Nayan Mishra alias Rahul and Subhash Prakash. After this, it was decided among these people that on February 8, they will gather at Komal Hotel with the candidates and solvers. The question paper will be solved by the solvers in the hotel itself and the candidates will be made to read it. Rajiv Nayan Mishra alias Rahul and his gang members had fixed Rs 12 lakh each from each candidate, they said. On February 8, as per the pre-planned plan, Vishal Dubey first reached Komal Hotel along with Sandeep Pandey. After this, Sunil Raghuvanshi reached there after getting 06-06 photocopies of the question paper. Following reports of the paper leak, the Uttar Pradesh government on March 2 cancelled the preliminary exam conducted on February 11 for the recruitment of review officers (ROs) and assistant review officers (AROs). Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had then directed that the exam be conducted again within six months. The STF was assigned the task to investigate the matter.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Ms Swaraj was a conscientious woman who understood suffering and pathos and attempted in her inimitable way to mitigate them, recalls Rup Narayan Das. Today (June 24) when the United Nations observes the 'International Day of Women in Diplomacy', it is propitious to recall the indelible imprint of the late Sushma Swaraj, who was India's external minister during Narendra D Modi's first tenure as prime minister, for her ingenious use of Twitter as a tool to mitigate men and women in distress. Foreign Policy magazine in 2016 included Ms Swaraj in the list of 15 global leaders for fashioning a novel brand of Twitter diplomacy. Others on the list included, among others, then German chancellor Angela Merkel, then US secretary of state Hilary Clinton, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and then UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon. Foreign Policy noted that when around 10,000 Indians working in Saudi Arabia faced a 'food crisis' in 2016, Ms Swaraj tweeted about the issue to six millions of her followers on social media. She posted information for the migrants about rations provided by the Indian embassy in Riyadh, claims for unpaid wages and transportation to India by the government. The week-long campaign produced the desired result. Earlier through her twitter handle Ms Swaraj reached out to Indians stranded in Yemen, and also Indians who lost their passports abroad. Stories of her twitter outreach abound. In a heart warming gesture while she was recuperating at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi after her kidney transplant, she tweeted that she had asked for a report from the Indian consulate in Dubai about an Indian national who had walked long distance to get a court order to return home. In June 2016, she rescued charity worker Judith D'Souza after she was kidnapped in Kabul. When a man tweetd that his sister, a flight attendant, was held in Saudi Arabia by traffickers, she coordinated with local authorities there to free her. In June 2016 at her behest her office brought home a 12-year-old boy from Bangladesh six years after he was kidnapped. In October 2017, she came to the aid of a Pakistani national by granting him a medical visa for a liver transplant at a hospital in Delhi. The Pakistani national, Hamid Ali, had put out a series of tweets tagging Ms Swaraj requesting a medical visa. On the morning of March 10, 2019, when an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed shortly after take off in Addis Ababa, there were four Indians among the 157 dead, she used Twitter to reach out to family members. Ms Swaraj was not only an outstanding parliamentarian, she was a conscientious woman who understood suffering and pathos and attempted in her inimitable way to mitigate them. On one occasion she chose to attend her house maid's marriage ceremony. She explained her gesture carried a powerful social message that the maid had excess to powerful people which would deter any harm to her. Her genteel nature and mannerism disarmed the Opposition and endeared her to all cutting across party lines. At a time when China attempted to impose its footprint in South Asia in an aggressive way to out space India, she very meaningfully noted while China is the big brother, India is the elder brother. The observation that women tend to engage more eagerly in transformative, rather than self-serving, leadership resonated well in Sushma Swaraj's persona. Data amply demonstrate that when women serve as Cabinet ministers or in high Constitutional positions or in statutory bodies they introduce progressive legislation relating to social protection, education and economic empowerment. Dr Rup Narayan Das is a former senior fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses and also the Indian Council of Social Science Research. The views expressed are personal. Feature Presentation: Rajesh Alva/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) As the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha is set to begin today, INDIA bloc leaders decided not to sit in the Speaker's chair to assist the pro-tem Speaker during the oath-taking ceremony of newly elected MPs. The Congress and other opposition parties are disappointed that seven-time MP Bhratruhari Mehtab was made the pro-tem Speaker instead of eight-time Congress MP K Suresh. Meanwhile, President Droupadi Murmu on Monday administered oath to Mahtab as 'speaker pro-tem' of the newly-constituted 18th Lok Sabha. A seven-time MP, Mahtab, along with a panel of chairpersons is tasked with running the proceedings of the Lok Sabha on Monday and Tuesday when winning candidates will take oath as members of the 18th Lok Sabha. On Wednesday, he will preside over the House when a new Speaker will be elected. Congress leader K Suresh said that there is an eighth-term MP in the House, but a seventh-term MP has been appointed as pro-tem Speaker. \"We are claiming that an eighth-term MP should be the pro-tem Speaker...They have done wrong, and now the whole country is criticising the decision of the BJP government,\" K Suresh said. Congress MP Hibi Eden said that the NDA government has violated all the traditions and customs. \"There are certain customs related to the Parliament of India, and it is always the senior-most member, irrespective of the party, who is given the opportunity to become the pro-tem speaker. It is merely a matter of two days, but it is the respect given to the member, whichever party he/she is from,\" Eden said. \"Unfortunately, a Dalit member, who is an 8-time MP from Kerala has been denied the right to become the pro-tem speaker. This shows the attitude of the NDA government towards the Dalit and the oppressed community of this country. They have violated all the traditions and customs... Even though this session is hardly for 8 days, it should have been in consensus with the opposition because we are representing almost 45 per cent of the country,\" he added. The first session is expected to be stormy as the opposition is likely to corner the BJP-led NDA government on the election of the Speaker on June 26, discussions regarding allegations of paper leaks in NEET-UG and UGC-NET, and a row over the appointment of the pro-tem Speaker. The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha is set to commence on June 24, starting with the oath-taking ceremony for the newly elected legislators. The election of the Speaker is scheduled for June 26. President Droupadi Murmu is expected to address Parliament on June 27. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'There might be some internal tussles that can be expected between any two persons in any party.' 'But I do not see any tussle which might weaken the possibility of dictatorship.' Why did Uttar Pradesh, known as a Bharatiya Janata Party fortress, defeat the BJP this time? Three eminent citizens of the state, who have been active in public causes all their lives, tell Jyoti Punwani about the discontent that media pundits missed. The legendary Professor Roop Rekha Verma , former VC of Lucknow University and tireless fighter for secularism and women's rights, tells Jyoti why the results in UP, where the BJP suffered a humiliating loss of seats, make her happy, but not euphoric. 'There is nothing which makes us believe that the old guard will reform itself, that it will be a little shy of doing the horrendous things which they have done to the country and to its people, that they will start attending classes in the nursery of the democratic and pluralistic history of India,\" says Professor Verma. The second of a three-part series: Did you expect these results in UP? I wished for such results, not only in UP but in many other states too! But expecting so was difficult at that moment. Expectation is reasoned hope, and the reasons for hoping for such results looked very uncertain at that time. Despite the ground reports of a desire for change, there were sufficient ifs and buts to douse one's hope. In the last few elections, ground reports did not tally with the results. Many factors play a role in the actual outcome: Appreciation or disapproval converting into votes; voters' lists; actual vote counts; and above all the conduct of the Constitutional electoral and judicial institutions. There were solid grounds for the erosion of trust in these institutions. Burdened with the past experiences of a decade, I felt like I was in a surrealistic world where every law and every institution could be openly subverted and there would be no door left to knock at. In such a situation, one needs courage even to hope. And I admit that I did not have that courage. But, yes, there were increasing evidences to give an inkling of the possibility of a better mandate. And that gave some in civil society hope to keep working for a change. What do you ascribe these results to? Several things. Foremost, an alternative narrative focusing on the common people's issues. The dominant narrative set by the present government was focused on religious identity and pitching these identities against each other. This narrative flowered into several other divisive identities of geography, tribe, caste, etc. The intoxicating propaganda of conflict between these identities overshadowed the real miseries of life and succeeded in confusing the people in rationally prioritiSing their needs. The alternative narrative launched by INDIA partly succeeded in clearing the fog and helped people set their priorities in a reasoned direction. It helped them to see through the game of divide and rule. It also helped them partly understand the changing face of a welfare State becoming a corporate state. Also, the Alliance maintained its bonds skillfully, despite very many tricks to break it. This gave hope to people because the Alliance appeared trustworthy. Another reason seems to have been that the Alliance appeared as a collective which would have internal checks and balances, whereas on the other side there was mostly one individual alone, Mr Modi, who was neither consistent nor relevant to the real problems of the masses. On the contrary, the leaders of Alliance, specially Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav, sounded sincere and well-meaning. In addition, this time, civil society was a little more active on the ground than on previous occasions. These results came as a surprise to most of the media; even psephologist Yogendra Yadav didn't predict such a defeat. Is it that people didn't speak to the media? It is almost impossible for anyone to be precise on such matters, especially when the field of investigation is vast and complex. I received hundreds of videos of very poor people from different backgrounds describing how their lives were destroyed by Mandir-Masjid politics. The so-called mainstream media no more reaches such segments of the public. It is the cluster of alternative media which is free from the stranglehold of the government, but has a smaller reach, that exposes the more authentic reality. The people were willing to talk. Only, the media had to find them. Rajnath Singh's victory margin has also been greatly reduced in Lucknow. Any reason for the fall in his popularity? I think it was the air of new hope generated by the Alliance, specially its welfarist manifesto, plus the pro-people promises and narratives, which presented a good challenge to most of the BJP candidates in UP. The duo of Rahul-Akhilesh were almost charismatic. Also, their narrative and promises sounded more meaningful than the BJP's. This has to be seen in the context of the BJP's consistently broken promises and their overconfidence, resulting in total neglect of people's voices. What's the atmosphere like in Lucknow after the result? Is it relief, do ordinary people, and also grassroots activists, feel they can breathe? Sadly no. Because there is no change in the government either at the state level or at the Centre. The results have been better but not radical enough to throw out the present government. There is nothing which makes us believe that the old guard will reform itself, that it will be a little shy of doing the horrendous things which they have done to the country and to its people, that they will start attending classes in the nursery of the democratic and pluralistic history of India. So, no breathing space for activists yet. The costs of activism and expressing people's Mann ki Baat are likely to remain high and deep. How real is the Yogi-Modi rift? To me it seems to be only a bogey. There might be some internal tussles and power strife that can be expected between any two persons in any party or group. But I do not see any tussle which might weaken the possibility of fascism and dictatorship. Both have grown in the same kind of nursery and both strengthen each other's agenda. Do you think the Samajwadi Party will be able to act as an effective Opposition? Yes, I do think that the SP can play the effective role of the Opposition in UP. To keep getting people's support, the leaders will have to be watchful on several fronts. A. They must keep their flock together. There will be every effort to break the party and buy the members' loyalty. B. They must ensure that their new MPs keep nurturing their constituencies and do not disrupt their contact with the masses. C. In the assembly as well as in Parliament, they must continue to fight for the rights of the poor, the marginalised, Dalits, minorities and women.

He also said that the 18th Lok Sabha begins on Monday with a resolve of building a 'Shreshtha Bharat' and 'Viksit Bharat'. Addressing the media in Parliament complex at the beginning of the first session of the new Lok Sabha, Modi asserted that his government will take everyone along in fulfilling the aspirations of the people. Modi also noted that Emergency's 50th anniversary falls on June 25, and described it as a \"black spot\" on India's democracy when Constitution was discarded. Welcoming new MPs, he said the 18th Lok Sabha commences with a dream of building a developed India by 2047. People expect good steps from the opposition but it has been disappointing so far, he said while expressing hope that it will fulfil its role and maintain democracy's decorum. India needs a responsible opposition and people want substance not slogans. They want debate, diligence not disturbance in Parliament, he said in a jibe at the opposition. The prime minister noted that 65 crore voters participated in the just-held parliamentary elections and it was for the second time since independence that a government was chosen for a third consecutive term. The occasion came after 60 years, he said. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Australia Test opener Steve Smith has batted away criticism of his promotion to the top of the order, suggesting doubters take a look at the statistics. Long settled at number four in Australia's test setup, Smith replaced long-serving opener David Warner for the West Indies series, prompting some scepticism from pundits about his ability to handle the extra bounce and swing on offer from the new ball. After scores of 12 and 11 not out in the first Test in Adelaide, and six in his first innings at the Gabba, Smith carried his bat with an unbeaten 91 in a losing cause in Brisbane. \"There was a lot of commentary around I‚Äôd failed in two or three innings or whatever it was,\" Smith told reporters in Melbourne on Wednesday. \"I had a not out and two low scores. And now I think I‚Äôm averaging 60 as an opener.\" \"I didn't really read too much into it. It was just another position. I've batted against a new ball numerous times coming in early.\" Smith will be back down to number four for the opener of the one-day series against West Indies starting in Melbourne on Friday, and will lead the hosts in Pat Cummins's absence. With Warner also retired from the one-day format and Mitchell Marsh to miss out, Smith will lead a much-changed side from the outfit that won last year's World Cup in India. Wicketkeeper-batsman Josh Inglis will partner Travis Head at the top of the order, with all-rounder Cameron Green promoted to number three. Western Australian paceman Lance Morris is poised to make his international debut while uncapped Queensland quick Xavier Bartlett may also feature. Smith, 34, said his role would be to teach the new faces \"the ropes\". \"I think it‚Äôll be a good series, and hopefully we can see some of these new players start off their international career as well,\" he added.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) \"Cricket is turning into baseball,\" Punjab Kings skipper Sam Curran aptly summed up his team's T20 world record run chase of 262 against Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL in Kolkata on Friday. Led by Jonny Bairstow's incredible hundred, Punjab Kings set the new world record for the highest run chase in the history of T20 cricket as they went past KKR's 261/6 with eight wickets and eight balls to spare. \"Very pleasing. Most importantly the win, cricket has turned to baseball isn't it? We're delighted with the two points,\" Curran said at the post-match presentation ceremony. \"We had a tough few weeks as a team. Forget about the scores, we deserved this victory.\" Asked about the massive scores being put up by teams this IPL season, Curran said, \"Loads of different things, guys can hit balls for long periods of time, the coaches, training, the dew, dot balls become wide after reviews and you get the extra ball. \"Stats are going out of the window. For us, it's all about the small moments. With the ball also we hung in there.\" Speaking about Bairstow's unbeaten century and Shashank Singh belligerent innings, he said, \"Really pleased for Jonny, he's been on tour for a long time and was eager to score. \"Shashank, wow, he was promoted to No. 4 and he's been our find of the season. We've to enjoy the small wins, although this was a big win coming to Kolkata.\" Player of the Match Bairstow said his aim was to whack the ball as far as possible and the opening partnership of 93 in six overs was crucial for the visiting side. \"We got off to a good start and that was key. They got a flier themselves thanks to Sunil so we knew we had to go ballistic in the powerplay,\" Bairstow said. \"When you've to chase 200-plus you've to take risks in the powerplay. (How to approach such a chase?) Try and whack it as hard as possible (laughs). It was a case of if it's in your area you go after it. We wanted to lose as few wickets as possible. The Englishman praised Shashank for the manner in which has been batting this season and in this match. \"Shashank has done it all season, a lovely guy and special player. To have someone like him coming in and do that is unbelievable. His knowledge, he's not young either, he's nice and calm, full credit to him the way he came out and hit it cleanly.\" PBKS bettered South Africa's 259/4 against West Indies in March last year. In the IPL, Rajasthan Royals held the previous record for chasing down 224 against KKR at Eden Gardens recently, equalling the record they had set against then Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) in 2020 in Sharjah. KKR captain Shreyas Iyer said, \"The way the batters batted was tremendous. So much you ask of them and they delivered. Both teams played tremendously. You have to go back to the drawing board and see where you went wrong. \"Not defending hurts but it's a great lesson for the players,\" Iyer said. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran shared an opening stand of 118 before Gulbadin Naib took over to drive Afghanistan to a 21-run win over Australia in St Vincent on Saturday and keep alive their hopes of reaching the Twenty20 World Cup semi-finals. This was a historic first ever victory for Afghanistan over Australia in international cricket. A win for Australia would have sent the 2021 champions and India into the last four, but even a second hat-trick in as many matches from Pat Cummins was not enough to keep their unbeaten record at the tournament intact. Half centuries from Gurbaz and Zadran helped the Afghans rack up 148/6 in their 20 overs, before their bowlers dismissed the Australians for 127 on a tricky Kingstown track. Naib claimed 4/20 and Naveen-ul-Haq bagged 3/20, but it was the third century partnership of the tournament from Gurbaz and Zadran that laid the foundation for a win that also kept Bangladesh alive. \"We've waited for a long time (for this),\" said man-of-the-match Naib. \"It's a big moment for our nation and our people. I have no words, but thanks to the fans who supported us in our career and cricket journey ... thank God we finally beat Australia. It's a great achievement for Afghanistan. \"We have achieved many things in the last 10 years, but this is big.\" India top Group 1 on four points, ahead of Australia and Afghanistan on two, with Bangladesh alone in last place, with none. India and Australia face off in St Lucia on Monday, while the Afghans stay in St Vincent to play Bangladesh in the final Super Eight match later that day. Australia skipper Mitchell Marsh won the toss and sprang a couple of surprises by sending the Afghans in to bat and naming a team with left-arm spinner Ashton Agar in the bowling line-up in place of Mitchell Starc. In the early overs it looked like the Australian bowlers would suffocate the Afghans, but the lack of a breakthrough wicket allowed Gurbaz and Zadran to settle in and accelerate through the middle overs. Crisp batting and hard running from the Afghans put the pressure back on the Australians, who made uncharacteristic fielding errors under the Arnos Vale Ground lights. The pair reached their half-centuries before Marcus Stoinis finally separated them in the 16th over, when Gurbaz mistimed a shot to David Warner at deep square leg to depart for 60. Spinner Adam Zampa removed Azmatullah Omarzai (2) and Zadran (51) in the following over and paceman Cummins sent back skipper Rashid Khan cheaply with the final ball of the 18th over. Karim Janat and Naib followed with the first two deliveries of the 20th over as Cummins became the first bowler to take two hat-tricks at a T20 World Cup. He would have taken four wickets in a row had Warner held onto a reasonably straightforward catch running in from deep point to dismiss Nangeyalia Kharote. \"They got 20 runs too many,\" admitted Marsh. \"To be honest, they played a really good game of cricket. We were outplayed tonight ... It was an off-night in the field and we own that.\" Afghanistan made the best possible start with ball in hand with Naveen bowling Travis Head for a duck in the opening over and having Marsh caught in the deep for 12 in the third. Warner followed for three off Mohammad Nabi's first delivery to leave the Australians struggling on 32-3 in the final over of the power play, before the Afghans heaped more pressure on their opponents by removing Stoinis and Tim David. The explosive Glenn Maxwell gave Australia some hope with a battling 59 off 41 balls, but his dismissal by Naib, thanks to an acrobatic catch by Noor Ahmad, all but sealed the fate of the former champions. \"I learnt from the batting innings on how to bowl,\" added Naib, who also took a low diving catch to dismiss Ashton Agar. \"Thanks to Rashid for trusting me, it's a team effort, Rahmanullah, Zadran and also Naveen for the momentum.\" To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'When the scores are low, we had an off-one in the field. But yeah, got to give credit where credit is due and Afghanistan were pretty good.' Captain Mitchell Marsh feels Australia tend to perform best with their backs against the wall, adding that the former champions will bounce back strongly from the loss to Afghanistan and bring their A Game against India on Monday. Australia were handed a 21-run defeat by Afghanistan in their Super Eights fixture Kingstown, jeopardising their chances of qualifying for the semi-finals. Marsh and Co. now will have to win their final Super Eight match against India by a healthy net run rate to reach the last four stage. \"It's a big game, it will be against India obviously and it's a must-win game. I think if you look back at the short history of this team, I know for a fact that it brings out the best in our guys. So, the boys will certainly be up and about for it,\" Marsh said at the post-match press conference. \"Yeah, I think that's really clear for us. It's all about trusting ourselves. We've got a good bunch of people and I believe our best is up there with the best. So, we need to bring that in a couple of days' time and move forward pretty quickly,\" he added. The loss broke Australia's eight-match winning streak in T20Is with Marsh calling it an \"off\" day. \"First things first, recover. We have a lot of belief in our group. We are a very good cricket team. Yes, tonight we had an off night but I guess there's also a positive in the fact that in 36 hours we go again.\" It was the Afghans first-ever win over Australia in international cricket. Afghanistan had lost all six of their previous meetings, including four ODIs. They had come close to defeating Australia during the ODI World Cup last year but a spectacular performance by Glenn Maxwell had denied them that joy. \"Afghanistan were really good and they outplayed us and they deserved to win that game. \"There's a lot of things you can look at, the reality is there're small margins here. When the scores are low, we had an off-one in the field. But yeah, got to give credit where credit is due and Afghanistan were pretty good.\" Marsh acknowledged that Afghanistan have developed into a dangerous side in world cricket. Rashid Khan and his men had defeated Australia's trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand in the group stage earlier. \"Obviously, they're a good side. And they're not an Associate nation, they're a very good cricket team who play against the best all the time and they have improved a hell of a lot over the last few years. \"We know certainly in these conditions that they are a big danger team. Like I said before, they outplayed us tonight and credit to them.\" Australia were guilty of dropping as many as five catches against Afghanistan. The men from Down Under had looked off-colour in the group game against Scotland as well. \"Look I think we don't want too many off nights in the field but I also believe that at our best we're an unbelievable fielding side. So, it's easy to look at tonight and yes it was disappointing but ultimately, we have 36 hours to turn it around and I still believe that our best is very good in the field.\" \"We certainly pride ourselves on our fielding. Can't question the boys putting in the work. I think it's no different to any other skill set. \"We put in the work, we didn't execute in the field tonight and ultimately it played a part in us losing the game.\" To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'I feel like we are so lucky to be here giving this happiness to people back home. We hardly see these kind of events back home where they could celebrate and enjoy those moments. That's something which really, really satisfies me.' Glenn Maxwell's breath-taking double hundred denied a distraught Rashid Khan forty winks during the ICC ODI World Cup in November last year, but the Afghanistan skipper can now be happily awake after settling scores with Australia for that mind-numbing defeat in Mumbai. Afghanistan kept their semi-final hopes alive with a well-earned 21-run win against Australia, and it will certainly heal the scars of that that forgettable night in Mumbai, when Maxwell struck an unbeaten 201 to help the Aussies recover miraculously from 91 for 7 and chase down 292. ‚ÄúI think I can sleep better now. But that was a night which didn't let me sleep. The game kept coming into my mind,‚Äù Rashid said at the post-match media conference, recollecting that epic fightback by a hamstrung Maxwell, who hit 21 fours and 10 sixes. ‚ÄúDefinitely, I didn't sleep the whole night (on November 7, 2023) and I feel like tonight because of the happiness, I won't be able to sleep. That's how happy the whole team is,‚Äù said a visibly happy Rashid. The spinner then tried to provide an elaborate perspective to what the victory meant for a war-ravaged, Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, where their cricket team's biggest win is an escape from daily hassles. ‚ÄúIt's a massive win for us as a team, as a nation. It's not just like a bilateral game. It's a World Cup game, and definitely in a World Cup, you're beating the best side. It's a great achievement. And you're (Australia) the winners of the 2021 World Cup. ‚ÄúSo, beating a team like that, I think it always gives you so much energy and doesn't let you sleep as well,‚Äù he said. Having beaten New Zealand at the group league stage, Afghanistan's win also kept Group 1 in Super 8 alive. If India beat Australia on Monday, then all Afghanistan would need is a simple win over Bangladesh to make it to their maiden semi-final at a global event. ‚ÄúAnd I mentioned earlier, cricket is the only source of happiness back home. That's the only source left in Afghanistan where people could celebrate. And if we keep that source away from us as well, I don't know where Afghanistan will remain. \"I feel like we are so lucky to be here giving this happiness to people back home. We hardly see these kind of events back home where they could celebrate and enjoy those moments. That's something which really, really satisfies me,‚Äù Rashid, one of the prominent global ambassadors of his country, said. The only issue Rashid sidestepped was Australia's continuous refusal to host Afghanistan for a bilateral series because of its government's policy of not engaging in any sporting ties with a nation that doesn't allow its women to take part in sports. ‚ÄúWish we could do something, and wish that was a kind of solution for it, we would have been happy, but I don't know what's the solution for that. ‚Äú....Some things, government, and political things, I don't know much about these things and I don't like it as well. So, I have no answer for this, but my only thing always in my mind is I love to play against the big teams.‚Äù A regular member of the Adelaide Strikers in Australia's Big Bash League, Rashid chose to remain politically correct, speaking about the love showered on him whenever he plays Down Under. ‚ÄúWhenever I go to Australia in Big Bash, I think I have got so much love and support from the fans there. They have given me so much love. Even in the 2022 World Cup, when we were playing in Adelaide against Australia, I got more support than them. ‚ÄúEvery city I go to, huge amount of support is there and people love giving me so much love, especially during the tough days in 2019 when my dad passed away. ‚ÄúSo, that was the hardest moment for me. The amount of love and support I got from everyone in the team, and also from the fans, I call them a family,‚Äù he concluded. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan can finally look forward to sleeping better after Saturday's T20 World Cup win avenged last year's loss to Australia in the 50-overs version. Cramped-up Glenn Maxwell's incredible double-century helped Australia snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in November, leading to Afghanistan falling just short of qualifying for the semi-finals. But a 21-run win in Kingstown, Afghanistan's first in the Super Eight stage, has reignited their hopes of making history by qualifying for a World Cup semi for the first time. \"I can sleep better now, I think,\" Khan told reporters. \"That game kept coming in my mind ... Maxi, the way he played that night, took the game away from us and I didn't sleep the whole night. \"Tonight, because of the happiness I won't be able to sleep. That's how happy the whole team is and the whole country is. It's a massive win for us, as a team, as a nation. \"Cricket is the only source of happiness back home, we all know that. And I feel like we are so lucky to be here giving happiness to the people back home.\" Afghanistan, third in Group One with two points and trailing Australia on net run rate, have a shot at finishing in the top two and making the semis if they beat bottom side Bangladesh on Monday when Australia play leaders India, who have four points. Rashid showered praise on his teammate Gulbadin Naib saying that the all-rounder just used his experience in the game. Gulbadin Naib was named the Player of the Match after he bagged four wickets and gave 20 runs in his four-over spell at an economy rate of 5.00. He picked up some crucial wickets in the game as he removed Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Tim David and Pat Cummins from the crease. Speaking at the post-match press conference, Rashid said that it was not easy for Gulbadin to bowl in the first innings. \"It wasn't easy for him to bowl from that end, where that strong wind and a bowler like him, it's pretty hard. But he just used his experience, and he has been playing for Afghanistan for long. So, I think that experience really help us today and that's how you keep those big players for the big games and he honestly got the opportunity he delivered,\" Rashid said. The Afghan skipper said that they got an upper hand in the game after the openers played a 118-run partnership in the first innings. \"I think the advantage went to us because we had that perfect 100-run partnership. In a wicket like this, I think it's always a wicket of 130-140. If you have a good bowling lineup, we have seen a few games before as well,\" he added.

Photograph: Afghanistan Cricket Board/XIn a stunning upset, Afghanistan defeated Australia by 21 runs in their ICC T20 World Cup Super Eights clash at Kingstown on Sunday. This marks Afghanistan's first-ever victory over Australia in international cricket. The Afghan batting innings got off to a strong start thanks to a superb 118-run partnership between Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran. Despite some tight bowling from Australia, including a hat-trick by Pat Cummins, Afghanistan managed to post a respectable total of 148 runs on the board. Australia's chase began disastrously, with the team losing three wickets for just 32 runs. Glenn Maxwell provided some hope with a fighting half-century, but wickets at crucial junctures by Gulbadin Naib put Australia firmly on the back foot. Naveen-ul-Haq also impressed with his bowling, picking up three wickets. Eventually, Australia were bowled out for a mere 127 runs, handing Afghanistan a historic victory. Following the match, Australian batsman Usman Khawaja took to social media to congratulate Afghanistan on their well-deserved win. \"Well done Brother. Better team on the day. You boys are an inspiration for so many back home and abroad. So sad we can't see you all play in Australia,\" tweeted Khawaja. This result throws Group 1 wide open, with both Afghanistan and Australia tied on points with a win and a loss each. The fate of both teams will depend on the outcome of the remaining matches in the group. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) A lot has been written about Dommaraju Gukesh, but have you wondered about how it is to be the parents of a genius and budding World Champion. Dommaraju Gukesh's historic win at the Candidates Chess Tournament in Toronto wasn't just a triumph for the young chess player, it was a testament to the unwavering support and sacrifices made by his parents. As Gukesh prepares for his historic world title challenge, the world can't help but acknowledge the silent heroes behind the prodigy: Dr Rajnikanth and Dr Padmakumari, who sacrificed their own routines and comfort to nurture a champion, discovers A Ganesh Nadar . Gukesh's chess journey began in 2013 with a simple one-hour class three days a week. \"In 2013 I enrolled him in a chess class and he used to go for an hour on three days a week. He started playing weekend tournaments as his chess teachers said he was good,\" recalls Dr Rajnikanth. Initially, it didn't disrupt the family's routine much, with Dr. Rajnikanth taking only Saturday leave for weekend tournaments. However, things changed in 2014 when Gukesh entered week-long rating tournaments. This marked the beginning of a significant shift in their lives. Dr Rajnikanth, a busy ENT surgeon, had to adjust his schedule, becoming a visiting surgeon at the hospitals he previously worked at full-time. Recalling the days before Gukesh became a chess prodigy, Dr Rajnikanth says, \"I used to attend conferences all over India. I was a visiting surgeon in multiple hospitals. My day started at 7 am and used to end at 11 pm. I used to take an hour break for lunch\". Dr Padmakumari, an assistant professor of microbiology, faced a different challenge. Gukesh, a consistent class topper, was missing school due to tournaments. To support his passion while ensuring his education wasn't compromised, the family made a bold decision. \"We decided that if he does well in chess he can carry on playing and if not he will go back to school\". Velammal school, where Gukesh studied, agreed to a unique arrangement: He would attend only for exams, focusing on chess during the rest of the year. This was a gamble, a year-long trial to see if Gukesh could excel in both. Dr Padmakumari stepped up further, taking on extra work when her husband and son were traveling. She clocked in overtime and covered shifts for colleagues who needed leave. Her dedication ensured the family's financial stability while Gukesh pursued his chess dreams. \"Travel was becoming very expensive as we now had to travel abroad to play games. My wife was working to not only support the family at home but also for our travel and stay abroad,\" Dr Rajnikanth said. While Gukesh received some cash awards and support from his school, significant financial assistance remained a challenge until some time ago. In 2019, after returning from a tournament in Gibraltar, Gukesh and his father visited five-time World Champion Viswanathan Anand. \"He was kind enough to invite us to his house, he and Gukesh were discussing the games my son played in Gibraltar and Anand was suggesting some different moves that he could have played.\" Anand advised Gukesh to take a break and told him that it would help. Gukesh's dedication and the unwavering support of his parents paid off. He not only excelled in his chess endeavours but also cleared his exams, proving that his academic brilliance wasn't compromised.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The IPL is synonymous with power-hitting and high-profile auctions, but its history is also stained by controversy. From match-fixing scandals to fiery player clashes, drama seems to be an unwelcome but constant companion to the league. This year's edition is no different. While on-field battles have been thrilling, off-field events have kept things interesting, to say the least. Umpiring decisions sparked debate, passionate owners overstepped boundaries, and even a legendary player's future became a subject of speculation. So, did these controversies add spice to the competition, or did they leave a bitter taste? The hot button moments of IPL 2024... Captain Booed Hardik's return to Mumbai Indians as captain didn't go as planned. Fans at the season opener in Ahmedabad booed him at the toss, a sign of discontent that continued in Hyderabad and Mumbai. This negativity coincided with MI's poor start, losing their first three matches. Pandya's individual performance remained a concern. His batting (216 runs) and bowling (11 wickets) fell short of expectations. A low point came when M S Dhoni of Chennai smashed him for three consecutive sixes in a crucial final over. Even Virat Kohli intervened, urging the Wankhede crowd to cheer for Pandya instead of booing him. Mumbai Indians Coach Mark Boucher acknowledged the negative impact of the booing on Pandya's performance. 'It wasn't great hearing the boos,' Boucher stated, expressing sympathy for the captain. He recognised the fan reaction as a factor affecting both Pandya and the team's overall performance. This tumultuous season ended with Mumbai finishing last for the second time in three years, leaving the MI management with questions to address regarding Pandya's captaincy and the overall fan sentiment. Behave! Mumbai Indians fans at the Wankhede stadium booed their new captain, Hardik Pandya, as he walked out for the toss against the Rajasthan Royals in their IPL 2024 match. Commentator Sanjay Manjrekar introduced Pandya and called for a 'big round of applause'. However, the atmosphere turned hostile as the crowd erupted again in boos instead. Manjrekar then urged the crowd to 'behave'. This incident marked a unique moment in IPL history, with home fans booing their captain for the first time. Public Spat? Sanjiv Goenka, owner of the Lucknow Super Giants, faced a torrent of criticism online after a video captured him apparently reprimanding LSG Captain K L Rahul following the loss to the Sunrisers Hyderabad. The viral video showed an animated Goenka conversing with a subdued Rahul on the field after the match. This public exchange sparked outrage among fans, many of whom believe such discussions should be held in private to maintain team morale and respect for the captain's authority. Kohli's Fury Virat Kohli's dismissal against the Kolkata Knight Riders on April 21, 2024, became a major talking point. Dismissed for 18 runs, Kohli believed the delivery from Harshit Rana was a no ball due to its height. The controversy stemmed from Kohli's position at the crease. Though the ball reached his waist at the point of contact, Kohli was standing well outside his crease. The new IPL Hawk-Eye technology for no-balls considers the ball's trajectory if played from the popping crease. Using this technology, the third umpire ruled the delivery legal as it would have dipped below Kohli's waist if played from the correct position. Despite the explanation, Kohli contested the decision, with footage capturing his heated exchange with the umpires. His frustration continued as he left the field. RCB Captain Faf du Plessis acknowledged the debatable nature of the call, highlighting the rule's complexity. 'It was a tough call. While Virat and I felt the ball was high, the rules are clear,' Faf noted. 'These decisions will always leave one side unhappy.' Controversial Catch Sanju Samson found himself at the centre of a contentious umpiring decision during the Rajasthan Royals game against the Delhi Capitals. Samson's innings was cut short when Delhi's Shai Hope took a catch at the boundary. Replays showed Hope's foot may have brushed the boundary rope, potentially saving Samson. Despite the close call, the third umpire ruled Samson out. Unhappy with the decision, Samson initially walked off the field before returning to discuss it with the on-field umpires. The dismissal proved costly as Rajasthan Royals fell short of their target. Later, Samson was fined 30 per cent of his match fees for dissent. Owner's Outburst Cameras captured Delhi Capitals Co-Owner Parth Jindal celebrating Sanju Samson's dismissal with a passionate 'Out hai !' as Samson argued with the umpires. This animated display divided fans online, with some appreciating his enthusiasm and others criticising it as poor sportsmanship. The story took a turn after the match. Jindal, all smiles during a chat with Samson and RR Owner Manoj Badale, revealed on social media that he was actually 'extremely worried' about Samson's form. He explained that his outburst stemmed from the threat Samson posed to Delhi's victory, not a lack of respect. A War Of Words A media spat erupted between Virat Kohli and commentator Sunil Gavaskar. Kohli took a swipe at critics over his strike rate, sparking a debate about handling external pressure. After scoring 70 off 44 balls, Kohli took a veiled swipe at his critics, claiming he ignores 'outside noise'. Gavaskar countered, pointing out that commentators only questioned Kohli's strike rate when it dipped below expectations. 'Commentators have no agenda,' Gavaskar clarified. 'We analyse what we see on the field, offering insights based on experience.' Dugout Dilemma In a bizarre turn of events during the Mumbai Indians' match against Punjab Kings, Tim David and Batting Coach Kieron Pollard were penalised for sending signals to batter Suryakumar Yadav from the dugout. This violation of IPL's no-communication rule came after Yadav was declared out. Adding to the confusion, the match saw several contentious calls. One included a wide call in MI's favour, despite the ball seemingly being playable by David. The biggest controversy erupted in the 15th over when Yadav, after a wide-ish delivery from Arshdeep Singh, received signals from the dugout to review the dismissal. This blatant disregard for the rules resulted in a penalty, though the review itself overturned the decision to a wide. Heads or Tails? IPL 2024 has been marred by a strange controversy surrounding the coin toss. It began when Royal Challengers Bangalore Captain Faf du Plessis hinted at foul play during RCB's game against the Mumbai Indians. This allegation stemmed from a blurry social media video showing MI Skipper Hardik Pandya flipping the coin high and Match Referee Javagal Srinath's subsequent handling of it. Rumours swirled online, accusing Srinath of manipulating the coin to favour Mumbai. Despite lacking concrete evidence, the controversy intensified. Broadcasters responded by zooming in on the coin during subsequent tosses, including those involving RCB. Blocking Blunder A rare twist unfolded in the CSK-RR match. Ravindra Jadeja, attempting a second run with his partner, was given out for obstructing the field. Miscommunication led to Jadeja being stranded in the middle of the pitch. The Royals capitalised, throwing to the wicket-keeper. While aiming for the bowler's end, the ball hit Jadeja's body. The Royals' appeal for obstructing the field reached the third umpire, who reviewed the incident from various angles. After careful deliberation, the third umpire deemed Jadeja out, believing he was aware of the throw's trajectory. Clearly frustrated, Jadeja (contributing a mere 5 runs off 6 balls) expressed his discontent as he departed the field. He exchanged words with the on-field umpire, highlighting the debatable nature of the dismissal. Mental Health Break RCB All-Rounder Glenn Maxwell prioritised his mental and physical health by taking a break from IPL 2024. The decision came after a string of low scores. Maxwell struggled to find form in the first six matches, managing only 32 runs. He proactively approached Captain Faf du Plessis and the coaching staff, requesting to be dropped from the playing XI for the clash against Sunrisers Hyderabad. It wasn't Maxwell's first time prioritising his well-being; he took a similar break in 2019 to manage his mental health. 'For me, it was a straightforward decision,' MaxI shared. He acknowledged feeling the pressure to perform and recognised the potential for a downward spiral if he continued to struggle. Despite a strong lead-up to the IPL season, Maxwell expressed frustration with his recent performances. He emphasised the importance of a positive contribution and, with RCB's then position in the table, felt it was the right time to step aside and allow another player an opportunity. He returned to action on May 4 against the Gujarat Titans and delivered a commendable bowling performance, picking up 1 for 28 from three overs. A Legend's Future M S Dhoni's future with the Chennai Super Kings remains shrouded in mystery after their IPL 2024 campaign ended in a heartbreaking loss to RCB. While Dhoni hasn't made any official announcement, speculation is swirling that the CSK legend may have played his last IPL game. His emotional reaction after getting dismissed in the final over, chasing an improbable target, fuelled these rumours. A section of fans believe Dhoni's valiant 25 off 13 balls was a fitting and emotional end to his IPL career. They point to the similarities with his international retirement, which also came after a heartbreaking World Cup loss in 2019. Many others urge Dhoni to continue for at least one more season. They argue that a player of his calibre deserves a proper farewell, not one marked by disappointment. Former CSK cricketer Robin Uthappa believes Dhoni will return for the 2025 season, stating, 'He will come back roaring for sure.' Blasting Broadcasters Rohit Sharma is furious with Star Sports, accusing the broadcaster of prioritising ratings over player privacy. Sharma took to X to express his outrage after private conversations were aired during games. 'It's become extremely intrusive,' Sharma wrote. 'Cameras record our every move, even private conversations with friends and colleagues during practice or matches.' He slammed Star Sports for airing these conversations despite his explicit request not to. 'This constant need for exclusive content and chasing views and engagement will ultimately break the trust between fans, cricketers, and the sport itself.' Two separate incidents seem to have triggered Sharma's outburst. A clip emerged (later deleted) of him chatting with old friend and mentor Abhishek Nayar during the KKR-MI game. Another clip showed Sharma at the Wankhede stadium, clearly requesting a cameraperson to stop recording audio. Despite his plea, a portion of the conversation, with muted audio in between, was still aired. Will this spark a broader discussion about player privacy in cricket?

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Srinivas Bhogle and Purnendu Maji present Rediff.com 's Most Valuable performances of IPL 2024 Another IPL is over. With a MVPI of 1055, Sunil Narine was comfortably the most valuable player of IPL 2024. The story of this IPL is revealed if we look at the top 20 on the MVPI table (Table 1): Eight of the top 10 have a strike rate over 150; and 13 out of the top 20 have a strike rate over 150. The average strike rate of the top 10 is 171.1; the average strike rate of the top 20 is 163.5. These are incredible numbers. We are seeing a paradigm shift in how T20 will be played in the future. A corollary of such a shift is that the Orange and Purple caps are no longer the best indicators of the IPL's best batter and best bowler. The batter's run aggregate must be coupled judiciously to the strike rate; likewise, the bowler's wicket tally must be coupled with the economy rate. Fortunately, the Rediff MVPI calculation already employs such a coupling. So, using the same calculation, we can also identify IPL 2024's five most valuable batters (Table 2), and the five most valuable bowlers (Table 3). The toppers of Tables 2 and 3, we would like to argue, are the more deserving winners of the Orange and Purple Caps respectively. Best Performing Players in IPL 2024 MVPI: Most Valuable Player Index = Sum of batting, bowling and fielding points. Run outs are counted as 1 (wicket) for a direct hit, and 0.5 (wicket) if the fielder is an equal participant in a run out dismissal. Table 2 lists the 5 Most Valuable Batters in IPL 2024 obtained by coupling the run tally and strike rate criterion; Table 3 lists the 5 Most Valuable Bowlers obtained by coupling the wicket tally and economy rate. 5 Most Valuable Batters Of IPL 2024 Kohli's Batting Points (763.5) are only marginally higher than his runs (741), because his strike rate is just above par. This table shows that Kohli would still have comfortably won the 'modified Purple Cap'. To calculate the batting points we assume a par strike rate of 150. 5 Most Valuable Bowlers Of IPL 2024 To calculate the bowling points (Bowl Points), we assume that every wicket is worth 18 points, and every bowler is expected to concede 9 runs per over. So, Bumrah obtains 360 points for his 20 wickets, but also gains 130.5 points more because his economy rate of 6.5 is so much lower than the par of 9 runs per over.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Smriti Mandhana waltzed to a characteristically elegant 90 to form the crux of India's six-wicket win in the third and final women's ODI against South Africa, marking their 3-0 series clean sweep in Bengaluru, on Sunday. Mandhana, whose innings came off 83 balls (11x4), had efficient support casts in Shafali Verma (25), Priya Punia (28) and Harmanpreet Kaur (42, 48b, 2x4) as India went past the target of 216 without exerting themselves much. The hosts made 220 for four in 40.4 overs, after South Africa were restricted to an underwhelming 215 for eight despite skipper Laura Wolvaardt's solid 61 (57b, 7x4). Though she failed to make a third hundred on the bounce, the knock underlined the way Mandhana dominated this ODI series, scoring 343 runs at an average of 114.33. The 27-year-old was once again composed in the middle, and played some typically graceful shots around the Chinnaswamy stadium. The pitch was smoothened out during the chase and the SA bowling was anything but threatening, giving the Indian vice-captain ample time to pursue her game without an iota of pressure. On view were those trademark shots that make her batting a sight for the sore eyes -- swivel pulls, cover drives, straight drives and those late taps that touch the rope after teasing the third man fielder. However, Mandhana's batting partners too deserved a pat on their backs for producing little yet polished knocks. Shafali helped her make 61 runs in 11.5 overs for the opening wicket, while Priya, who is playing an ODI for the first time since 2019, assisted her in amassing 62 runs in 66 balls for the second wicket. Skipper Harmanpreet was fluent during the unbeaten third wicket stand that was worth 54 runs. But the vociferous, highly-partisan crowd that touched 15000 could not see a popular Mandhana century, as her attempt to sweep left-arm spinner Nonku Mlaba ended in the hands of Ayabonga Khaka. Earlier, skipper Laura Wolvaardt made an assured fifty but South Africa suffered a batting meltdown after a strong start to finish with an underwhelming 215 for eight against India in the third and final women's ODI in Bengaluru on Sunday. Wolvaardt (61, 57b, 7x4) and Tazmin Brits (38, 66b, 2x4, 1x6) stitched 102 runs off 119 balls for the opening wicket after batting by choice, and SA looked set for a big total that could have given them a chance to register a consolation win. India have already taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series. Both Wolvaardt and Brits were comfortable against Indian bowlers even though there was a hint of varied bounce, which was evident when pacer Pooja Vastrakar beat the defence of Sune Luus (13) with a delivery that stayed close to her ankle. However, the SA openers found a way to tackle that, as they hardly opted for aerial shots and collected their runs more pragmatically with singles, twos and the occasional power shots. Brits's six off left-arm spinner Radha Yadav over mid-wicket following a little shimmy down the track was the lone moment of explosion. At the other end, Wolvaardt maintained a strike-rate over 100 without ever really taking undue risks. The tourists crossed the 100-run mark in the 18th over but their fortunes turned around when pacer Arundhati Reddy pulled off an excellent return catch to dismiss a set Wolvaardt. Arundhati later produced an even better caught and bowled effort to jettison Anneke Bosch as India twisted the knife through SA's batting unit under Arundhati (2/36) and off-spinner Deepti Sharma (2/27), who was hard to score off. South Africa also had their own indiscretions to blame for the downfall. Brits and Nondumise Shangase (16) charged out for non-existing singles to get run out just when they were looking to upshift the gears. From a lofty 102 for no loss in 19.5 overs, South Africa lost the next eight wickets for 113 runs as India placed themselves firmly on course for a 3-0 series clean sweep.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) IMAGES from the Super Eight Match of the T20 World Cup, played between England and USA, in Bridgetown, Barbados, on Sunday. Pacer Chris Jordan grabbed a sensational hat-trick in his birthplace before captain Jos Buttler's blitzkrieg as defending champions England stormed into the semifinals of the T20 World Cup with a 10-wicket mauling of USA in Barbados on Sunday. Making a comeback in place of Mark Wood, Jordan (4/10) mopped up the USA tail by claiming four wickets in five balls, including the hat-trick, in the 19th over as the Americans folded for 115 in 18.5 overs after England opted to bowl. Buttler then blazed away to a 38-ball 83 not out as England completed the chase in 9.4 overs to become the first team to make the semifinals of the showpiece. During his scintillating knock, Buttler smashed seven sixes and six fours, including hitting five maximums in a Harmeet Singh over to leave the USA bowling bruised and battered. Earlier, the 35-year-old Jordan, who was born and grew up in Christ Church, Barbados, began the penultimate over dismissing a well-set Corey Anderson for 29 with a low full toss. After surviving the next ball, Ali Khan found his off stump knocked over before Jordan went on to dismiss Nosthush Kenjige and Saurabh Netravalkar off successive deliveries to pick the first hat-trick for England in T20Is. Jordan had figures of 4/10 from his 2.5 overs. Jordan also became only the second bowler in T20 World Cup history to pick four wickets in a single over. \"We summed up the conditions pretty well... Rashid set up the game for us. Points first and foremost,\" said Jordan. Curtis Campher of Ireland was the first to pick four wickets in a single over against the Netherlands during the 2021 edition in Abu Dhabi. It was Sam Curran (2/13) who triggered the collapse by dismissing Harmeet Singh (21; 17b) in the final delivery of the previous over as USA suffered a stunning collapse, losing five wickets in six balls for no run. Earlier, Adil Rashid took a miserly 2/13 in four overs to set up the game as he also returned with the player-of-the-match. \"Always nice to come here and bowl. It also helps when the bowlers are keeping it tight from the other end. With the wind you got to assess from which end you will bowl,\" said Rashid. Andries Gous flicked Reece Topley towards fine leg for a six but two balls later, hit the ball straight to Phil Salt at deep square leg while attempting a similar shot. USA faced some nervous moments in the day's second over as Steven Taylor survived a run out after giving up hope of returning back to the crease in time. It would have been over for him if Liam Livingstone's throw had hit the stumps. At the other end, Nitish Kumar top-edged a fast delivery from Jofra Archer that flew over deep third man for a maximum. Nitish played a lovely shot over mid on for a boundary off Topley and in the next ball, the Canadian-born 30-year-old produced a clean hit over long-on for a six. Curran was brought in as first change and he delivered in his first over, cutting short Taylor's stay in the middle thanks to an excellent catch by Moeen Ali at backward point. Taylor's dismissal marked Curran's 50th wicket in T20 Internationals. Skipper Aaron Jones quickly got off the mark by steering one through the third man region for a four as USA ended powerplay at 48 for two. Buttler handed the ball to Rashid, who has been having a pretty good tournament, and the leg-spinner began his spell by conceding only two runs. Rashid did what was expected of him in his second over, bowling out Jones with a beautiful googly to deny the USA captain a chance to face Archer, his childhood friend and school-mate. The two grew up together in Barbados, dreaming of playing international cricket for West Indies before going on to represent their adopted countries. Having dried up the boundaries, England tasted success again when Rashid employed his effective googly to cut short Nitish's promising stay. Nitish struck two sixes and a four. Livingstone had Milind Kumar caught behind as USA slipped to 88 for five at the end of the 14th over. The 100 came up in the 17th over as Corey Anderson and Harmeet Singh tried to prop up the USA innings. USA had a productive 18th over as they got 14 runs off Curran after a six a four by Harmeet, who was however dismissed in the last ball that brought their downfall.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) England captain Jos Buttler, who played a whirlwind 38-ball 83-run knock, on Sunday said he pressed the accelerator button while chasing a modest 116-run target to give themselves a chance to top the Super Eights Group 2 en route to the semifinals of T20 World Cup. Pacer Chris Jordan (4/10) grabbed a sensational hat-trick in his birthplace before Buttler's blitzkrieg as England stormed into the semifinals with a 10-wicket mauling of USA. \"We give USA a lot of respect and we talked about if, if we brought our intensity, we would be too good. Once we got in a few overs, we tried to target this side with the wind,\" Buttler said at the post-match presentation ceremony. Buttler praised leg-spinner Adil Rashid (2/13) and Liam Livinstone (1/24) for their efforts with the ball. \"Adil was fantastic and Livi bowled brilliantly in tandem, it's difficult when you are not bowling in one game and then suddenly you bowl 4 overs, credit to him for being ready.\" The England skipper also lauded the effort of comeback man Jordan, who mopped up the USA tail by claiming four wickets in five balls, including the hat-trick, in the 19th over as the Americans folded for 115 in 18.5 overs. \"We have great options, today we wanted to bring in CJ (Jordan) to bring depth to our batting and a World Cup hat-trick is a great effort. I have been feeling good all year to be honest.\" \"I feel I'm hitting the ball well and it's on me to look after my own game, as much as I'm the captain, I'm one of the 11 and I have got to do my job,\" he said. USA captain Aaron Jones said it was hard for them in the Super Eights stages but promised to come back stronger in the future. \"Hard game to get to grips to be honest. We did not have a good last two games, something for us to talk about when we go back to USA but that's how it goes. Looking forward to playing more big teams,\" he said. \"Wicket was a bit sticky, (Adil) Rashid very experienced, very good bowler. Our shot selection was not good, we knew he was the danger man. Something to look into and we definitely will come back harder.\" \"It's very good for us, this is our first World Cup, lot of people did not think we will be here playing against England, West Indies and the big boys.\" \"Hopefully this will open the eyes of the American public. We've got a lot of calls and messages of support during this World Cup. I see us getting bigger and better from here,\" he added. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'If I'm bowling well, it transfers to my batting and vice versa.' One cricketer who has defied expectations at the T20 World Cup so far is Hardik Pandya. After a lacklustre IPL season with the Mumbai Indians, where his form dipped and his team finished last, Hardik has risen to the occasion in the World Cup. In five innings, Hardik has not only taken eight wickets but also scored a crucial knock against Bangladesh on Saturday. His unbeaten 50 off just 27 balls helped propel India to a strong total of 196/5, ultimately leading them to a commanding 50 run victory. This all-round brilliance earned him the Player of the Match award. Following a long injury layoff after the 2021 T20 World Cup, questions lingered about Pandya's bowling ability. During his captaincy stint with the Gujarat Titans, he opted not to bowl on several occasions, raising concerns about potential fitness issues. The ongoing World Cup has seen a different Pandya. He has consistently bowled his full four over quota, silencing those doubts. Former India head coach Ravi Shastri addressed these concerns directly with Pandya in a post match conversation. 'One year I didn't bowl, otherwise, I've bowled for every team. It has become much of a topic of Hardik Pandya's bowling,' Hardik said in a video posted by ICC. 'There's a lot of hard work that I need to do to fire on all cylinders. It gives me extra opportunity to contribute to the team and lifts my confidence. If I'm bowling well, it transfers to my batting and vice versa.' To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

The 35-year-old became the first player to take a hat-trick for England in Men's T20Is. The 19th over highlighted the dominance of the English bowling attack against the US. Jordan's first wicket of the game came on the first ball of the 19th over, dismissing Corey Anderson for 29 runs. He then completed his hat-trick by taking three consecutive wickets in the third, fourth, and fifth balls of the over, removing Ali Khan, Nosthush Kenjige, and Saurabh Netravalkar. Jordan spearheaded the English bowling attack, picking up four wickets and conceding just 10 runs in his three-over spell, boasting an economy rate of 3.50. In the first inning, Jos Buttler-led Team England chose to field after winning the toss, a decision that paid off. The English bowlers dominated from the outset, restricting the US batting lineup to 115 runs. Nitish Kumar stood out for the US, scoring 30 runs off 24 balls, including one four and two sixes, before Adil Rashid dismissed him in the 11th over. Corey Anderson contributed 29 runs from 28 balls, hitting one six, but his innings ended in the 19th over when he attempted to hit a low full toss from Jordan over long-on, only for Harry Brook to take the catch.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Images from the T20 World Cup Super Eight Group 2 match between the West Indies and South Africa, in Antigua. South Africa pulled off a thrilling three-wicket victory over the West Indies via the Duckworth Lewis method in a rain-affected Super 8 Group 2 match of the T20 World Cup to snatch a berth in the semi-finals, at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, in North Sound, Antigua, on Monday. Put in to bat, the West Indies rode on Roston Chase's 52 off 42 balls after a bad start to post 135 for 8. In reply, South Africa were 15 for 2 in two overs when rain stopped play. The match was truncated by three overs, South Africa being set a revised target of 123 in 17. The Proteas chased that target down in 16.1 overs to knock the co-hosts out and qualify for the last four stage unbeaten, winning seven from seven. South Africa, in pursuit of 136, lost openers Reeza Hendricks (0) and Quinton de Kock (12) for only 15 before heavy rain stopped proceedings. Star all-rounder Andre Russell (2/3) removed both. In the process, he became the West Indies' highest wicket-taker with 29 wickets across all editions of the T20 World Cup, eclipsing Dwayne Bravo, who had 27 scalps. Russell bowled the second over, got a faint leg side edge off Reeza Hendricks and had him caught behind by Bicholas Pooran. He finished the over with the crucial wicket of Quinton de Kock, who holed out to Sherfane Rutherford at deep backward square leg. Par score at the five-over mark was 37 runs and the Proteas arrived there at 41/2, thanks to back-to-back boundaries from Tristan Stubbs in the fifth over. Alzarri Joseph struck with just his second delivery, forcing a mistimed drive from Aiden Markram (18 off 15), providing the hosts much hope. But an expensive over from Gudakesh Motie, four boundaries for 20 runs, tipped the scales back in South Africa‚Äôs favour as Stubbs and Heinrich Klaason launched an assault. Joseph then removed Klaason (22 off 10), but Stubbs‚Äôs presence make it look comfortable for the Proteas, until the right-hander tried to go over long-on and was out for 29 off 27. Roston Chase then stepped in and took two wickets for six runs off two overs, giving the West Indies a slim chance at the death.,/P> When Joseph bowled the third-last over, the requirement became 13 off 12. With the match again on a knife‚Äôs edge, Marco Jansen and Rabada - the two that earlier collided in the field - were the cricketers at the crease looking to become the heroes. A crucial boundary on the seventh-last ball got the requirement to five from six, with Obed McCoy then stepping up to bowl the final over. Jansen swung with everything he had off the first delivery. The all-rounder smashed one back over McCoy‚Äôs head, which cleared the rope and sealed victory for the Proteas, with five balls to spare. Earlier, Tabraiz Shamsi led South Africa's fine bowling performance as they dismissed the West Indies cheaply. The left-arm wrist spinner took three wickets for 27 runs as the co-hosts were restricted to 135 for 8. Roston Chase's 52 off 42 balls was the only bright spark in the West Indies innings. South Africa won the toss and decided to field first. It was a must-win match for both teams as only one of them could join England in the semi-finals. As expected, skipper Aiden Markram handed Marco Jansen the new ball and the pacer immediately struck, having Shai Hope caught by Tristan Stubbs for a first-ball duck. In the next over, Markram decided to bowl himself and tasted success, tempting Nicholas Pooran, who skied one down the ground and Jansen took a well-judged catch. Jansen should have had another wicket in his second over. Roston Chase hit a delivery high, but Anrich Nortje was unable to hold on to a tough chance. The batter made the best of the 'life' and he and opener Kyle Myers launched a fightback, his six off the last ball of the sixth over taking the West Indies to 47 for 2 at the end of the powerplay. Another Mayers six in the eighth over proved costly for the Proteas, as Jansen and Kagiso Rabada collided awkwardly, both attempting to take the catch on the boundary. Play was briefly halted as Jansen appeared to be badly hurt. He was taken off. Till the collision Rabada did not bowl. Mayers and Chase took the West Indies to 62 for 2 by the end of the tenth over. Their partnership ended at the fag end of the 12th, as Mayers was out for 35 off 34 balls, caught by Stubbs off the bowling of Shamsi. Thereafter, South Africa were in control as Rovman Powell (1 off 2) and Sherfane Rutherford (0 off 4) fell in consecutive overs, before Shamsi ejected Chase (52 off 42, including 3 fours and 2 sixes) at the start of the 16th over. Russell came in and hit two huge sixes in the 17th over before attempting a quick single and was run-out by Nortje, just short of his crease. That dismissal, in a way, saw Nortje make up for dropping Chase. Rabada was handed the ball in the 18th over and did well to have Akeal Hosein caught and bowled. Alzarri Joseph, hit Rabada for a six, while scoring 11 off 7, as the West Indies finished with 135 for 8, 11 runs coming off the final over. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) \\ India face their biggest test of the T20 World Cup when they clash against Australia in their final Super 9 match at the Darren Sammy Stadium in Gros Islet, Saint Lucia, on Monday, June 24l 2024. The two teams have gone through a contrasting few days in the lead-up to the match. While India eased past Bangladesh by 50 runs to close in on the semis, Australia's hopes are hanging by a thread after they were shocked by Afghanistan. India had all their flaws ironed out in their emphatic victory against Bangladesh. Rohit Sharma (23) and Virat Kohli (37) got back among the runs to give India a flying start in the Powerplay, while Shivam Dube also scored an useful 34 with three huge sixes to secure his place in the team. Hardik Pandya provided the flourish at the end with a blazing knock of 50 from 27 balls as India finally showed their might with the bat, posting a huge 196/5 in their 20 overs. Pandya and Kohli also hit three sixes each as the top six Indian batters all bagged at least a six each. In all, India had 13 sixes in their innings -- the most by their batters in a T20 World Cup beating the previous record of 11 sixes against England in the T20 World Cup in 2007. After struggling in the group stage games in the US, India's batters have enjoyed the flat pitches in the Caribbean, with totals of 181/8 against Afghanistan and a total of around 200 against Bangladesh. On the other hand, Australia's batters were bowled out for 127 as they crashed against Afghanistan's pacers on a tricky pitch at Kingstown, St Vincent. Not only was their batting below-par their bowlers also struggled to leave their mark on a helpful pitch as Afghanistan's openers put on a match-clinching stand of 118 runs in 15.5 overs. That was Australia's first ever loss to Afghanistan in international cricket and it makes their task of progressing to the semi-finals very difficult. Australia face a tough must-win match against the in-form Indians. If Australia lose the match they face the prospect of getting knocked out if Afghanistan beat Bangladesh in their Super 8 game. What will also make Australia nervous is that the weather forecast for the match is not encouraging with rain predicted to play a part. Even if Australia beat India by a small margin, they could lose out on the semis if Afghanistan get a big win against Bangladesh. For India, their main aim will be to continue the winning run and finish top of the group. If India beat Australia and take top place in Group 1 of Super 8 they will face England in the semis, while a defeat which sees them finish second could pit them against the in-form South Africans, the only other unbeaten team in this World Cup apart from India. India (with a net run rate of +2.425) also need be aware that a heavy defeat in their final Super 8 match could see them miss out as Australia and Afghanistan could inch ahead of them in the net run rate. Barring any injuries, India would be expected to continue with their winning combination in the crucial game against Australia, which is also must win for them. With Rohit and Kohli getting some form back along with Dube, things are only looking better for them. The bowling line-up has been India's big strength in this World Cup. Jasprit Bumrah has been by far the best bowler of the World Cup, claiming 10 wickets in five games at an economy rate of 3.42 while his bowling partner Arshdeep Singh has been quite effective with the ball, taking 12 wickets -- the most by an Indian bowler so far in this tournament. Unbelievably, Bumrah has picked twice the number of wickets than boundaries he has conceded -- four fours and a six in 19 overs bowled so far! Hardik Pandya has been the key player for India with both bat and ball. Along with the crucial fifty against Bangladesh, Pandya has done an excellent job with the ball in the middle overs with eight wickets at an economy rate of 6.47. Wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav has proved to be a handful for the opposition batters ever since coming into the team for the Super 8 stage, with five wickets in two games. Axar Patel (4 wickets in 5 games) and Ravindra Jadeja (1 wickets in 5 games) have stuck to their task of keep things tight in the middle overs. But Australia have prove to be the big thorn in India's flesh in big games. India suffered a double blow at the hands of Australia last year, losing in the finals of the World Test Championship and the ODI World Cup. Even though they suffered a reverse against Afghanistan, Australia have enough match winners in their teams to bounce back. Travis Head loves batting against India, while David Warner would be keen to leave a mark with the bat in his final T20 World Cup, while the middle order comprises of the dangerous trio of Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis. Australia are likely to bring back Mitchell Marsh for the crunch game against India after making the mistake of leaving him out against Afghanistan. Pat Cummins has been in amazing form with the ball with back-to-back hat-tricks, while Adam Zampa has been the best spinner in the World Cup with 13 wickets from six games. Probable XI : Rohit Sharma (captain), Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant (wicket-keeper), Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh.

Here's the first of the seven steps that will follow in the weeks ahead Step 1: Building Your Akshaya Patra (The Inexhaustible Pot) for Everyday Needs Hey Rohan, feeling overwhelmed by the thought of early sukoon (peace)? Vijay Uncle here, with a secret weapon: The Bhagavad Gita! This ancient guide to life holds the key to not just conquering the battlefield of Kurukshetra, but also the financial battlefield of early sukoon . Think of Arjuna facing the Kaurava army. He needed not just a steady supply of food for the war, but also readily available resources for unforeseen situations -- a broken chariot wheel, a sudden attack on his camp. Similarly, you need a safety net for life's everyday challenges -- a broken phone screen, a car repair, or even that unexpected birthday gift for a close friend. That's where the Bhagavad Gita steps in, guiding you to build your very own Akshaya Patra (The Inexhaustible Pot). The First Path: Building Your Akshaya Patra The Bhagavad Gita emphasises the importance of fulfilling one's Dharma (duty). Your first financial Dharma is to create your Akshaya Patra -- a readily accessible pool of money you can use with a click of a button or a debit card. This acts as your financial shield, protecting you from small, everyday expenses and allowing you to focus on your long-term savings meant for early sukoon . Here's how the Gita's wisdom applies to your Akshaya Patra: Building Your Akshaya Patra in Action Maximising Your Akshaya Patra The Power of Small Savings Building your Akshaya Patra might seem daunting at first. But remember, the Bhagavad Gita teaches us the importance of Karma (action). Every small step, every rupee saved, contributes to your financial well-being. Here are some strategies to make small savings a habit: Remember, Rohan, building your Akshaya Patra is the foundation for your early sukoon journey. It's your shield against unexpected expenses, allowing you to make informed financial decisions and pursue your retirement dreams with confidence, the Bhagavad Gita reminds us. The Next Step: Conquering Debts (Except Home Loan) with Krishna's Kritya Nash (Action-Destroyer) Technique Watch out for this space!

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'Those trying to use these funds for quick gains should avoid them due to risk of being late to the party.' The manufacturing theme is currently favoured by investors, as is evident from the spate of new fund offers (NFOs). HDFC Mutual Fund's recent NFO for its manufacturing fund raised Rs 9,563 crore, the third-highest collection ever for an NFO. NFOs by Baroda BNP Paribas and Mahindra Manulife Mutual Fund are on. Seven fund houses, with total assets under management of Rs 25,645.5 crore, already offer these funds. Multiple tailwinds As major economies aim to derisk their supply chains by adopting the China+1 strategy, India has an opportunity to emerge as a preferred manufacturing hub. The government has been focusing strongly on manufacturing. \"It aims to increase manufacturing's contribution to GDP from 17 per cent to 25 per cent in the next three to four years, through initiatives like production linked incentives and Atmanirbhar Bharat, aimed at substituting imports and promoting exports,\" says Renjith Sivaram, fund manager-equity, Mahindra Manulife Mutual Fund. According to Jitendra Sriram, senior fund manager, Baroda BNP Paribas Mutual Fund, \"Besides viability gap funding via PLI schemes, OSAT ( outsourced semiconductor assembly and test ) and DLI ( design-linked incentives ) are steps being taken to promote manufacturing.\" Sriram adds that the government has been investing in roads, railroads, airports and metro rail to reduce logistics costs and enhance manufacturing's competitiveness. This theme could become a major wealth creator. \"A growing working-age population, rising domestic demand, the right government policies, and strategic investments can help manufacturing reach its full potential,\" says Lalit Kumar, fund manager, ICICI Prudential Manufacturing Fund. Sivaram points out that low corporate tax rates for new manufacturing units are in place. The shift from a majority to a coalition government may not have a significant impact. \"Themes like power, railways, and defence are likely to remain strong regardless of government changes,\" says Nitin Arora, fund manager, Axis Mutual Fund. Key sub-themes Consumption : While the entry-level market's growth remains uncertain, premiumisation is thriving. \"The share of SUV sales has risen from 10 to 12 per cent to 50 per cent, with continued double-digit growth. In real estate, larger brands are selling more properties,\" says Arora. Investment : Strong investment is getting reflected in capital goods companies' earnings and order books. \"Power deficits are increasing, necessitating investment in transmission, distribution, and generation. Power capex is part of a long cycle, spanning five to seven years,\" says Arora. He adds that solar and wind are also seeing heavy capex. Net exports : Post-PLI, India has emerged as a net exporter of mobile phones and integrated into Apple's supply chain. Indian cable and wire companies are benefiting from renewed capex in the US. Valuation concerns Valuations are currently high, with B2B businesses trading at B2C valuations due to scarcity premium (limited number of players) and strong growth. A manufacturing fund could struggle if the theme falls out of favour. \"Like any other thematic fund, this, too, would face concentration risk,\" says Abhishek Kumar, a Sebi-registered investment advisor and founder, SahajMoney. Should you invest? Investors with a long horizon and aggressive risk appetite may consider them. \"Those trying to use these funds for quick gains should avoid them due to risk of being late to the party,\" says Kumar.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) India is not a land of lakes like many other countries that have over 200,000 lakes (think Canada, Russia, Finland), but the lakes we have are some of the prettiest in the world. It's hard to choose which of our 180 lakes has the most unparalleled beauty. After much thought, we bring you Ten Of The Best! Any of these lakes are havens for nature lovers, photographers, travellers, and adventure seekers. Whether it is for a fun picnic, fishing or just chilling, there are many ways to unwind and relax in the company of nature at the lakes we have chosen. So go ahead make tracks to them. Sissu Lake, Himachal Pradesh If you just so happen to find yourself in the neighbourhood of Manali, then popping into the town of Sissu is a great idea. Thanks to the Atal Tunnel (the longest tunnel at an altitude above 10,000 feet), it's easier to reach this quaint little town via the 9-km engineering marvel on the Manali-Leh highway. Sissu Lake is the major attraction here which is nestled at an altitude of over 12,000 feet near the foothills of the Spiti-Lahaul mountains of Himachal Pradesh. This gorgeous lake is a man-made water body surrounded by picturesque Himalayan peaks and the Chandra river gushing nearby. If you are a trekking enthusiast, short hikes will lead you to various monasteries, temples of the Lahaul region. Sissu is also a wonderful place for stargazing, river rafting, and camping. How to reach : Sissu is well connected by road, and the most common route is through Manali, located 40 km away. From there, hire a taxi or use public transportation to reach the town. Changu Lake, Sikkim Changu Lake, locally called as Tsomgo Lake, is certainly an excellent option for a day trip if you are in Gangtok. This glacial lake is sure to refresh your spirits with its quiet setting. Take a yak ride, munch on delicious local snacks, have a tot of cherry brandy, hike up a little to see the lake from a height or simply relax near the calming waters -- the choice is yours. How to reach : Changu Lake is located on the Gangtok-Nathu La road, about 38 km away from the main taxi stand in Gangtok. Reserved or shared taxis are easily available. Lonar Lake, Maharashtra Lonar Lake is an absolutely must visit for its unique geological features and charm. This lake was formed thousands of years ago due to meteorite impact, creating a crater that eventually filled with water to form the lake we know today. The interesting aspect of this lake is that it has both saline and alkaline water with high mineral content, which makes it one of its kind in the world. The lake was in the news recently when its emerald green water turned pink, reportedly due to increased salinity in the water. This destination has much to offer history buffs as there are several ancient temples and ruins nearby. How to reach : Lonar is well connected by road, with Aurangabad being the most accessible node at 140 km. Tulian Lake, Jammu and Kashmir Tulian Lake is an absolute magnet for those interested in hiking, and it also one of the easiest and yet rewarding trekking experiences in Kashmir. The journey can be completed in a single day, which takes you to 12,000 feet through thick forests, verdant meadows, and delightfully pretty valleys. With some incredible colouration (from turquoise and sky blue to pale green!) as well as its take-your-breath-away glacial mountain views, Tulian will definitely leave you yearning for more. How to reach : One can either hike up or take a pony ride from Pahalgam, which is 16 km away. Agastya Lake, Karnataka Stunning temples, giant hills, and mysterious caves all go towards making Agastya Lake a spectacular site with a roll-off-your-tongue-lovely name (how nice and exotic to say you went to Agastya for your summer hols). The rock-cut steps near the popular Bhoothanatha temple have serene vistas of the lake. It is also a perfect spot to enjoy a unforgettable sunset after roaming around the lake and surroundings. In addition to its scenic magnificence, the place is also notable for an archaeological museum, which sits right near the lake and gives overview of the historical significance of Badami. How to reach : The lake is located in Badami town in the Bagalkot district of Karnataka. It is merely a kilometre from the main chowk in Badami. Naini Lake, Uttarakhand The low-key, relaxed atmosphere of Nainital encourages a similarly no-rush break at its famed Naini Lake. Spend your morning basking in the sun near the lake. Try out activities like kayaking, canoeing, nature walks, or fishing. At sundown join the locals in the bustling markets. The lively street near the lake is dotted with food stalls, souvenir shops, cafes, restaurants and more. Hop over to any of the vibrant cafes of the town or sample local delicacies. The possibilities are endless in this cute little lake town. How to reach : The lake lies right in the centre of Nainital town. Pichola Lake, Rajasthan Udaipur has been nicknamed the city of lakes and the most famous among them is Pichola Lake. Wherever you go in Udaipur you are surrounded by sparkling blue water and the rugged Aravali Hills. Spend your time whatever way your heart desires, be it boating, walking around the lake, or simply find a spot at any caf√© overlooking the Pichola. Savour the tranquillity of a magical Udaipur sunset; it's unmissable! How to reach : The lake can be reached by autorickshaws, taxis, or on foot from the main bus stand in Udaipur; it's about 3 km away. Chandra Tal, Himachal Pradesh Higher up the barren mountains of Himachal Pradesh, at 14,000 feet, lies the glacial lake of Chandra Tal, which is one of the most sought-after places to visit in the Spiti valley. The craggy landscape and tall snow-capped peaks certainly add to the dramatic appeal of the alpine lake. If you are feeling adventurous, get onto any of the small hiking paths that will allow you to scale the surrounding heights for flabbergasting dekko s of the lake's blue hues. Earlier tourists could pitch their tents at the rim of Chandra Tal, but now it is forbidden by law for the rightful ecological reasons. If you wish to stay overnight, there is a designated camping spot 2 km before the lake where tent accommodation and meals are available. The lake remains inaccessible during the winter as the surrounding area gets a thick blanket of snow. Summer is the time for witnessing the lake in its full glory. Since this is a high altitude region, be mindful of AMS (acute mountain sickness) symptoms like dizziness, nausea, fatigue, headaches. How to reach : One can hire a private car or jeep from Manali, which is at 110 km. A majority of the journey is off-roading and it is advisable to have an experienced driver. The road ends at the 'base camp' of Chandra Tal. One has to complete the remaining 1.5 km on foot to reach the lake. Periyar Lake, Kerala Tucked inside Periyar National Park, the Periyar Lake is an artificial water body formed by damming the Periyar river. The peaceful misty forests of the Western Ghats and still waters make this lake extremely popular amongst tourists. Do not miss a boating experience that takes you through curvy waterways with mesmerising peeks of the jungle. How to reach : From the Kumily bus stand, the main entrance of the Periyar Tiger Reserve is about 2 km away. No private vehicles are allowed beyond this point. The forest department bus takes you inside the sanctuary near the lake. Kodai Lake, Tamil Nadu One of the major draws of Kodaikanal is the star-shaped Kodai Lake for its several enticing activities like fishing, paddle boating, and bird watching. Walk on the pathways around the lake and take in its scenic saundarya . How to reach : The lake is located just 3 km from the Kodaikanal bus terminal. Local taxis are available.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Hotel rooms, usually in the range of Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 a night during the peak season, are now available for Rs 7,000 to Rs 10,000 a night. It is 42 degrees Celsius in Jaisalmer -- not the most pleasant time to visit the golden city of Rajasthan, known for its yellow sandstone structures. Yet, some are skipping the hills for its luxurious heritage havelis. The summer discounts make them a cool destination. Step into Suryagarh, where average room tariffs range from Rs 48,000 to Rs 55,000 a night during the peak winter season. But this is summer, an off-season period for the hotel, which had remained closed every previous summer. However, this year, the establishment has decided to slash the tariff to Rs 15,000 to Rs 16,000 a night. The luxury destination is also offering patrons a host of summer deals. Valid only until July, the offers include discounts on the spa, food and beverage options, and unique experiences like a lakeside sundowner in the 'haunted' city of Kuldhara. While many travellers flock to the hills or fly out of the country during summer, some choose to brave the heat to experience a slice of luxury. Udaipur, the city of lakes in Rajasthan and home to several luxury destinations, was among the top 20 most searched domestic destinations according to MakeMyTrip's summer travel trends report for 2024. \"While we used to shut down Suryagarh in the summer as flights to Jaisalmer stopped, we realised that people would still come if they had the option. We are currently seeing an occupancy of almost 50 per cent this year at the hotel, which is very encouraging,\" says Siddharth Yadav, vice-president, MRS Group of Hotels. The group's other property in Bikaner, Narendra Bhawan, is also witnessing travellers getting a sneak peek at the luxurious experiences the converted haveli from 1969 has to offer. \"Travellers across India are now looking for unique experiences. We usually see people from Punjab and Delhi opting to arrive in Bikaner just for a weekend during the off-season to experience luxury like never before,\" says Himanshu Bhargava, general manager at Narendra Bhawan. Hotel rooms at the Bhawan, usually in the range of Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 a night during the peak season, are now available for Rs 7,000 to Rs 10,000 a night. The boutique hotel offers discounts at its award-winning spa and on food and beverages, all valid only until July before the summer wanes. While the Bhawan is usually sold out in the winter months, occupancy falls to 40 to 50 per cent in the summer months. \"I have always wanted to take my mother to the spa at Narendra Bhawan, but it is difficult to manage a booking during the peak season,\" says Neha Mishra, who visited the property two days earlier last month. \"While convincing her to travel to Bikaner in the summer was difficult, travelling during the off-season gave us many advantages, including that it was very economical,\" she adds. The Neemrana Fort Palace in Jaipur is also drawing travellers with its summer offers. The property, dating back to the 15th century, is usually sold out during the winter months. With slashed tariffs and discounts on facilities like the spa, camel rides, and vintage car rides valid only until June 30, the establishment is seeing an occupancy of 50 to 60 per cent in the summer, said an executive at the hotel. \"During the peak season, travellers can expect accommodation rates at Neemrana Fort Palace to rise by 8 per cent, reflecting the increased demand.\" says Bharatt Malik, senior V-P of air and hotel business at Yatra Online. \"Similarly, Ananta Spa & Resort in Pushkar experiences a more pronounced hike, with prices shooting up by 13 per cent compared to off-season rates, and The Ananta Udaipur seeing a hike of 12 per cent,\" says Malik. \"This seasonal adjustment underscores the popularity of these destinations during peak travel times,\" he adds. Memorable and unique experiences are priorities for Indian travellers. \"Now more than ever, the Indian traveller is actively seeking out memorable experiences and willing to move beyond the traditional holiday seasons -- braving the heat in this case -- to seize an opportunity to experience something unique,\" said an executive at Narendra Bhawan.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) India, with its immense splendour and diverse landscape, offers oodles and oodles to see. How do you choose where to go and what to skip?. While the most sought after tourist destinations may boast unique natural beauty, sadly, some of them are on the verge of losing their charm, mainly due to too many visitors and a lack of proper tourist infrastructure to support the burgeoning numbers. We have listed 10 such places that don't really match up to their hype anymore, unless the authorities get their act together and prevent their ruin, like how, uniquely, the Tamil Nadu government is issuing for e-passes for those wanting to head to Ooty. Meanwhile, the good news is: We have one or two clever substitutes or alternatives for each of these places. Not Shimla but... Perennially overcrowded, expensive and constantly under repair, the capital of Himachal Pradesh no longer offers one as grand a trip as one would hope for. The difficulties of taking a decent photograph without being photo-bombed by an intrusive tourist tells you a lot about the sorry saga around there. Worry not. For a lovely Himalayan getaway, without the crowds typical to Shimla, head to the nearby town of Narkanda, which is barely a few hours' drive away. Folks can easily, unhindered by the multitudes, walk around a town full of greenery and dream-like snowy scenes during winter. Exploring ancient temples and apple orchards further adds to the enjoyment. How to reach : Narkanda is 60 km away by road from Shimla, the nearest airport and railhead. Not Manali but... If you're looking to have a peaceful time in the company of barf -clad mountains, Himachal Pradesh posseses heaps of attractive hamlets that are better than a lot of the not -off-the-beaten-track places. There's no earthly reason to burn a hole in your pocket on those costly stays or waste you trip waiting in long traffic queues in Manali. Solang Valley, Rohtang Pass, Atal Tunnel... These are some of the popular and equally avoidable tourists haunts near an avoidable town that's always packed with taxis, not to mention the pollution levels during the peak season. Instead of having a pleasant break you will end up feeling cranky. Instead, take an excursion to the villages of Sethan or Naggar that offer plenty of activities possible in a more serene locale. The hotels and homestays are cheaper and you will get a taste of real pahadi hospitality. How to reach : Naggar is 22 km by road from Kullu, the nearest airport and also 22 km by road from Manali. Sethan is nearly 15 km by road from Manali. Not Lonavala but... As the monsoon arrives, Lonavala is flooded with day-trippers from the neighbouring cities of Mumbai and Pune. Sure, the scenic hill station offers alluring views of the Western Ghats. But what about the traffic snarls, extreme commercialisation and so little bang for your buck, with not enough activities. Aati hai Khandala? Nahin, nahin . Don't let Lonavala be a dampener to your vacation mazaa . Cross this destination off your list and instead go to Kolad or Matheran, where you can spend your time enjoying a variety of outdoorsy stuff. Matheran has many enchanting waterfalls and thrilling trekking escapades. And you know what you won't miss? The mud, keechad and ruts created by tyres in this four-wheeler-free green zone (two-wheeler and six-wheeler free too). Kolad, on the other hand, has ops for river rafting, ziplining, canoeing that will add adventure to your monsoon sabbatical. How to reach : Matheran is 83 km by road from Mumbai. Kolad is 121 odd km by road or train from Mumbai. Not Munnar but... Known near and far for its sprawling tea plantations, mist and super hilltop lookouts, Munnar draws both backpackers and lots of noisy families. But the sad reality is that this popularity has led to loads of commercialism, excess traffic on every road in town and an environmental degradation of the surroundings. Munnar suffers too because the local infrastructure is inadequate to cope with the exploding tourism. Vagamon, another pretty hilly Kerala town, in Idukki district, 75 km from Kottayam, has similar foggy, breathtaking countryside around and you pay less for a more authentic and gratifying travel experience, including a peek at India's longest glass cantilever bridge. Not many journey to Vagamon and it is wonderfully bereft of selfie-takers, rowdy sightseers and crass commercial mistreatment. How to reach : Vagamon is 100 km by road from Kochi, nearest airport and railhead (at Ernakulum). Not Leh but... Enjoying the rugged gorgeousness of Leh has always been on top of many travellers' bucket lists. The skyrocketing visitor arrivals and unplanned development in the region have dented its magic. Each year, the videos of irksomely serpentine lines of cars/SUVs/jeeps etc, waiting to enter Leh and Ladakh, surface online raising concerns about the unruly tourism in the high Himalayas. Spiti would be an awesome replacement to Leh, thanks to a similar terrain and less jostling. There are abundant attractions in the Spiti Valley area worth visiting. Key Monastery and Chandra Taal, for instance, are a few of the top spots for taking in the majesty of this beauteously barren land. How to reach : Spiti is 235 km away by road from Shimla, the nearest airport and railhead. Not Gulmarg but... From afar, Gulmarg looks charming. The rolling green meadows and snow-capped peaks are plenteously picturesque. But most visitors are not as impressed with the tourist facilities. Pony rides, snow adventures are overpriced. Food as well as stay options are limited and pricey. Ditch Gulmarg and travel to other sundar regions of Kashmir like the Bangus Valley and Gurez Valley. Tranquil. Extremely enthralling. These parts will offer better pics for your travel albums and social feeds. How to reach : Bangus Valley is 100 km from Srinagar, the nearest airport and railhead. Gurez Valley is 125 km from Srinagar. Not Mussoorie but... Crisp mountain air and enticing hill-station vibes might be the main raison d'etre for choosing Mussoorie for a holiday. Memorable environs you will find. But serenity not. Try nearby Chakrata or Dhanaulti for true quietude. They are steadily becoming favourites amongst the really ardent travellers. Water, mountains and evergreen forests together are the perfect formula for finding your 'me-time' in nature. How to reach : Chakrata is 81 km by road from Mussoorie. Dhanaulti is nearly 59 km by road from Mussoorie. The closest railhead and airport from Mussoorie is at Dehradun 36 km away. , Not Darjeeling but... Everyone has heard of Darjeeling and the fun you can have. Tea estates. The toy train. Rangeet Valley ropeway. Shopping on Chowrasta. Happy Valley Tea Factory. Streetside momos. Snow leopards in the zoo... The fame of these sites is precisely why locals give the town a wide berth, especially in summer when it's chockablock with what seems like every tourist in the world. Most areas of the town are dirty and unmaintained and it is also overpriced for no good reason. For a better feel of the neighbourhood, head to Kalimpong to savour the Gorkha heritage and Buddhist culture. If you are looking for calm, relaxed surrounds, then Mirik or Manebhanjan (also spelled Maneybhyanjang), which are within 40 km radius of the bustling town of Darjeeling, are ideal picks. How to reach : Kalimpong is 51 km by road from Darjeeling and 77 km from Bagdogra, the nearest airport. Manebhanjan is 81 km by road from Bagdogra and 25 km by road from Darjeeling. Mirik is nearly 40 km by road from Darjeeling and 45 km by road from Bagdogra. Not Alleppey but... Massive crowds, high-priced houseboats and pushy street vendors often easily destroy the lure of this Kerala hotspot. Give it an ekdum miss and check out Kumarakom, some 30 km away from Alleppey. The place has a don't worry-be-happy mood and a rustic delightfulness. Do you know what its SP is? Kumarakom is not a tourist trap unlike its counterpart and you get to absorb a one-of-a-kind backwaters ambience. How to reach : Kumarakom is 73 km away from Kochi, the closest airport and railhead (at Ernakulum) Not Coorg but... If you have never been to Chikkamagaluru, you might believe that Coorg is the queen of Karnataka's hill stations. It's undoubtedly magnificent. But there's a small, actually large problem -- it's swarming with raucous holidaymakers, almost all year around. Press the Operation Flee button and, eyes closed, without hesitation, book your passage to Chikkamagaluru. Home to the state's highest peak, Mullayyanagiri in the Chandra Dhrona hills, this cutesy town is also far-famed for its coffee plantations and touch-me-not saundarya . How to reach : Chikkamagaluru is a railhead and it is 150 km by road from Mangaluru, the nearest airport. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Sometimes, a toothache or jaw pain could be a manifestation of impending heart disease, warns Dr Ajit Menon, senior interventional cardiologist at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital. Until a few years ago, heart disease used to affect only the elderly. Today, we have youngsters in the age group of 25 to 45 years suffering from various stages of cardiac disease. Can a heart attack be avoided in young adults? What are some of the warning signs that people can look for? 1. Family history of cardiac disease The first indicator is family history. If the person has a strong family history of heart disease, which means that someone in her/his family or a close relative has had a cardiac event below the age of 55 or 60 years, it is a major risk factor. What we are particularly interested in knowing is if the mother has had cardiac history below the age of 60. In such cases, chances that the children will get it are extremely high. The same rule applies if a sibling has had a cardiac event recently or there has been a sudden cardiac death. The history of sudden cardiac deaths in the family is a strong indicator that a person should get checked for cardiac issues earlier in life. 2. Discomfort or pain in the chest, jaw or arm A person might face exertional chest discomfort, exertional jaw pain, exertional arm pain or exertional backache, which happens typically when the person exerts and typically settles down when the person stops doing the activity. This normally happens when the person does an unusual exercise or activity to begin with and, subsequently, there is progression of the symptoms -- the person starts getting these symptoms even with normal day-to-day activities. 3. Breathlessness at night If a person complains of chest discomfort or acute breathlessness in the middle of the night while sleeping and has to sit up to get relief, it is not a healthy sign. This is an indicator that s/he could be harbouring a heart disease. Unusual breathlessness on exertion should also be a warning sign. 4. Toothache or jaw pain Sometimes, people go with toothache or jaw pain to a dentist and find out that there is nothing wrong. This could, however, be a manifestation of impending heart disease. 5. Blackouts Another symptom of heart disease could be that the person gets blackouts. This happens because her/his blood pressure varies suddenly. This may be attributed to certain cardiac conditions or even blockages in the arteries supplying blood to the heart muscles. On exertion, the blood supply to the electrical activation node in the heart gets compromised and the person's heart starts getting rhythm disturbances. 6. Unexplained, acute breathlessness Another symptom is a sudden onset of acute breathlessness while doing nothing. 7. Abdominal discomfort after eating A common sign is symptoms of abdominal discomfort or chest discomfort, especially after eating. This is called a post-triangular angina which, in layman's language, means post-food heart pain. The blood supply to the heart gets compromised after eating a meal because the blood is diverted to the gastrointestinal system; s/he starts feeling discomfort in the chest because there could be blockages in the arteries supplying blood to the heart muscle. 8. High cholesterol and lipoprotein On routine blood tests, if extremely high cholesterol and extremely high bad cholesterol (LDL or low density lipoprotein cholesterol) is indicated, the person might be prone to heart disease. High homocysteine and high lipoprotein A levels could also indicate a heart-related issue. There are certain genetic genome testing options available today which can predict the possibility of having a cardiac event, especially if there is a family history of any cardiac disease, be it blockages or any kind of structural heart disease. Even children can get tested for genome sequencing, which can tell you the probability of having this health issue in the family.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Over eight million deaths in 2021 were attributed to air pollution, affecting both children and adults alike. Air pollution continues to be a formidable silent threat, responsible for nearly 464 deaths of children under five in India and 2,000 young lives daily worldwide, according to the latest State of Global Air 2024 report. Surpassing poor sanitation and inadequate clean water, air pollution now ranks as the second leading health hazard for children worldwide. The latest findings from US-based research organisation Health Effects Institute (HEI) reveals that over eight million deaths in 2021 were attributed to air pollution, affecting both children and adults alike. The State of Global Air 2024 report, an annual publication jointly produced by HEI and Unicef, highlights the stark reality that dirty air now ranks as the second-largest global killer, following closely after high blood pressure. Among children under five years, air pollution is the second leading cause of death after malnutrition. Pallavi Pant, lead author of the report and head of global health at HEI, emphasised the severe disparities revealed, \"Far too much of the burden [ is ] borne by young children, older populations, and low and middle income countries.\" The primary culprit identified by the report is PM2.5, fine particles smaller than 2.5 micrometres in diameter, which are responsible for over 90 per cent of air pollution-related deaths globally. These particles infiltrate the bloodstream, impacting organs and contributing to a spectrum of diseases from lung and heart conditions to diabetes and dementia. Generational impact of air pollution Kitty van der Heijden, deputy executive director of Unicef, warns of the profound generational impact of our inaction: 'Our inaction is having profound effects on the next generation, with lifelong health and wellbeing impacts.' 'The global urgency is undeniable. It is imperative that governments and businesses consider these estimates and locally available data and use it to inform meaningful, child-focused action to reduce air pollution and protect children's health,' she said. The report also links worsening air quality to the climate crisis, citing severe droughts, wildfires, and dust storms as exacerbating factors. These events release particles that persist in the air, worsening health outcomes globally. Addressing air pollution not only saves lives but also benefits the climate. Approximately half a million deaths among children in 2021 were linked to indoor air pollution from cooking with dirty fuels, including biomass, charcoal, paraffin and coal. Transitioning to cleaner alternatives like solar cookstoves could significantly reduce emissions and improve health outcomes. Solutions in access to clean cooking fuels Despite these challenges, significant gaps remain, with 2.3 billion people lacking access to clean cooking fuels worldwide. The International Energy Agency estimates a $4 billion annual investment is needed to solve this issue by 2030, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, urged global leaders to prioritise this issue, stressing its broad impacts on health, climate, and economies, as well as its disproportionate burden on women and girls tasked with gathering firewood. The State of Global Air report draws on data from the Global Burden of Disease study, covering over 200 countries. Previous reports have highlighted that nearly every person breathes unhealthy levels of air pollution daily, with half a million infant deaths annually attributed to polluted air.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Limit your intake of refined carbohydrates like white bread, pasta, and sugary snacks. Opt for complex carbs like whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Focus on consuming fewer calories overall to create a calorie deficit, which is necessary for weight loss, advises rediffGURU Dr Shakeeb Ahmed Khan. Have you recently undergone a surgery and trying to get back to your routine? Are you struggling to lose belly fat? Do you want to improve your overall health and fitness? Dr Shakeeb Ahmed Khan is a senior consultant physiotherapist with over 12 years of experience specialising in orthopaedic and paediatric physiotherapy. He has served as a technical consultant for the World Health Organisation, the United Nations, the Tata Institute of Social Sciences and several national and international NGOs. Besides physiotherapy, he is keenly interested in disability management, early intervention, geriatric care and assisting children with disabilities. Anonymous: I am 57 year old. I used to consume alcohol 180 ml every day. My abdomen is increasing. What should I do? As a physiotherapist, I strongly advise you to stop consuming alcohol, as it significantly impacts your health and contributes to abdominal weight gain. Koushik: I am 53 years now. Can I use 20 pounds weigh of dumbbells during exercise? Yes, you can use 20-pound dumbbells during exercise. However, avoid jumping and start gradually. Also, be mindful of your heart and blood pressure conditions. It's important to consult with your doctor before beginning any new exercise routine to ensure it's safe for your health. Here's a gradual regime to help you safely reach the goal of using 20-pound dumbbells. In weeks 1-2, start with 5-pound dumbbells, exercising three times a week with two sets of 12-15 reps for bicep curls, shoulder press, tricep extensions, lateral raises, chest press, and bent-over rows. In weeks 3-4, increase to 8-pound dumbbells and reduce reps to 10 to 12. For weeks 5-6, use 12-pound dumbbells and do 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps. In weeks 7-8, advance to 15-pound dumbbells with 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps. Finally, in weeks 9-10, transition to 20-pound dumbbells with 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps. Warm-up with 5-10 minutes of light cardio and cool down with five to ten minutes of stretching in each session. Wishing you the best. Kamal: My wife is 59 years old. Looking at her X-ray, d octor has said that the knee joint gap is almost negligible and has recommended knee replacement. Is there any possibility that physiotherapy and medicines can help? Given your wife's condition, where the knee joint gap is almost negligible, I would first recommend opting for conservative management through physiotherapy and medication before considering knee replacement surgery. Focus on strengthening the muscles around the knee, such as the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calf muscles, with exercises like leg lifts, hamstring curls, and calf raises. Perform exercises to maintain and improve the knee's range of motion, including knee bends and stretches. Engage in low-impact activities like swimming, cycling, or using an elliptical machine to reduce stress on the knee while maintaining cardiovascular fitness. Include exercises that improve balance and stability to help prevent falls and further injury. Starting with physiotherapy and conservative management can often provide significant relief and improve quality of life, potentially delaying or even avoiding the need for surgery.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'People in politics have lost the value of being connected to their own people.' 'Now it's all about vote share, vote bank, how many parties can you break and make them join you.' The 18th Lok Sabha will have four members who are between 25 and 26 -- Shambhavi (25), the Lok Janshakti Party (Ramvilas Paswan)'s MP from Samastipur; Sanjna Jatav (26), the Congress's MP from Bharatpur; Priya Saroj (25), the Samajwadi Party's MP from Machhlishahr; Pushpendra Saroj (25), the Kaushambhi MP also from the Samajwadi Party. Shambhavi -- Narendra D Modi called her the 'Youngest NDA candidate' during his rally in Bihar's Darbhanga -- who did her master's in sociology from the Delhi School of Economics and graduation from the Lady Shri Ram College spoke to Prasanna D Zore/ Rediff.com about her debut in Parliament, her development roadmap for Samastipur, the women Parliamentarians she is looking forward to meet. You will be among the four youngest MPs in the 18th Lok Sabha. As a contestant, what were the challenges that you had to overcome to win from Samastipur? I started my campaign from Samastipur 45 days before the voting day. My team and I would toil for almost 15-16 hours every day. Since we fought as a part of the NDA it was only natural that we spoke about the body of work that Prime Minister Narendra Modi did in his two terms since 2014. Nobody in India today can deny that there was a Modi factor in each and every constituency and we were asking people to vote for him for the third time. We also focused on the good work done by our Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Lok Janshakti Party (Ramvilas Paswan)'s chief Chirag Paswan. Apart from the national manifesto of the NDA, the manifesto of the LJP (RP), we also released a local manifesto for Samastipur. This manifesto clearly outlined what I would do as Samastipur's MP. Ours is a farmer-dominated belt and our manifesto talked about welfare schemes for farmers, development of agrotech and software sector in the region. We would talk about these development programmes in every meeting and public rallies we held in those 45 days. I believe I have put in a lot of hard work because of which the people of Samastipur elected me with a huge margin. As one of India's youngest MPs, what will be your message for your voters and constituency? When I toured my constituency for the first few days, I kept telling them that they used to look at me and think that I'm too young to do this. I always used to tell them that 'I have come here as a daughter ( Shambhavi's father Ashok Choudhary is a Bihar minister and a friend of Nitish Kumar; her grandfather Mahavir Choudhary was a minister in the then Congress government ). Accept me as your daughter first and only then can you see a Parliamentarian in me. You need to develop a heart to heart connection with me.' That's very important because people in politics have lost the value of being connected to their own people. Now it's all about vote share, vote bank, how many parties can you break and make them join you, how many people can you get in your club and this club is meeting that club. In this scenario I tried to establish a heart to heart connection with my voters. This is the only thing that worked for me. Being young, I was very actively -- physically, mentally, emotionally -- involved in my election campaign. How did you convince the voters in your constituency that even if you were to be a young Parliamentarian you have the potential to do justice to their faith in you? I think they were definitely looking for a new face. They were very excited and enthusiastic about it. For the first time, if you enter a new area and be like, I want your vote, they will not be convinced. Like I said earlier, I tried to talk to them about the vision that I had for Samastipur, about the development that I wanted to do. And there was a fair share of confidence among the voters that the NDA was coming back to power. In that sense there was a clear mandate among the people to elect the NDA. They were very clear in their mind that this is the side that they want to vote for. Our manifesto was like the icing on the cake. And it worked for me well. That is why people elected me with such a large margin -- the second highest margin ( of 187,251 votes ) in Bihar. My voters were convinced about my abilities and they accepted me wholeheartedly as their daughter. What will be your feelings like when you will enter Parliament, when you will be looked at as one of the four youngest Parliamentarians among a hall full of stalwarts? Honestly, I am very, very excited and overwhelmed at the same time. I am trying to find the right pace to manage all my emotions right now, because I think I have a big responsibility and to deliver that responsibility I should be able to manage my emotions well. It will be a very good learning experience. I will get to learn, and I think I will get the opportunity to take something from my culture to them. I will try to make that space and contribute in a positive way. I will ensure that the aura of the august House remains sacrosanct and every Parliamentarian gets the opportunity to express herself without any fear, intimidation or awe of the stalwarts. I would also like to create an environment where every Parliamentarian gets a chance to express herself without being heckled. As a young Parliamentarian I naturally have the responsibility to look after the welfare of my constituents and I realise those responsibilities. But I have responsibilities also as a young Dalit woman in Parliament. I will only hope, I can only pray that I work hard and live up to everybody's expectations. I'm in Delhi today ( June 5 ) and have already started interacting with the people here trying to establish a connection over here, trying to establish a friendly environment so that working here becomes easier. I'm already at it. I'm not waiting for the right time. The right time is now. If you have the zeal, the enthusiasm to work for your people, you will definitely be able to do that. What will be the most challenging for you to do as one of the youngest MPs? After the rigours of the election campaign, I feel that whatever challenges may come, I will be able to face all of them. I don't know what those challenge will be right now. Till now I have not come across a challenge that has deterred my will to work for the people. I don't think there would be any challenge that would sway me away from my goal. All I wish to do is work honestly, wholeheartedly and in a committed way for my people. And God bless me with the strength and power to overcome any challenge. Do you think you will be part of the next government? I don't have any personal aspirations or goals as such. Whatever my party decides, whatever my leader Mr Chirag Paswan decides, I would agree with him wholeheartedly and truly support all his decisions. I'm really humbled by the opportunity that the people of the country have given us a clear mandate. Mr Narendra Modi ji is going to hit a hat-trick this time which is historic. I am lucky and blessed to be witnessing this history and being able to play a small role in this historic win. How did this constituency come to you? How were you chosen for this responsibility? I expressed my will to contest. I am a Dalit woman and we have six reserved seats in Bihar. Lok Janshakti Party got three reserved seats out of which one was being contested by Mr Chirag Paswan. The other seat was Samastipur. My husband's ( Saayan Kunal, son of former IPS officer Acharya Kishore Kunal ) native place is Samastipur. This constituency is centrally located in Bihar and it has a lot of scope for development. I thought that it would do both of us justice if both of us -- the constituency and I -- are connected. There's a lot of scope in Samastipur to work. There is a huge scope for development of agrotech industries, software-based industries. It is an area which has not really flourished the way it should have with time. I always thought that if there is one constituency that I would like to work for, it would be Samastipur, because it's needs development and a young woman to represent it. I'm very glad that Samastipur chose me as their MP. Have you chalked out a five year plan for development of Samastipur as its MP? I released an election manifesto for my constituency. It was a very interesting process because we launched a Web portal where we connected with a lot of people from different parts of the constituency, and they shared their suggestions. We had a team that was working on those suggestions and we rounded off the suggestions that we could accomplish in the coming five years. Basically all these issues were related to connectivity, infrastructure, education, health, the farmers' situation over here, agricultural development and about the migrant labourers. There are some long pending promises that have been made by other Parliamentarians who were there before me, and the promises have yet not been fulfilled. I plan to fulfill all those promises, be it regarding connectivity. There are a few flyovers and bypasses that they've been asking for since a long time; there are still some villages that are not properly connected to the main town. It's not just about building roads. It's about connecting people, about facilities reaching to the villages at the right time, facilities that are crucial, like education and health. Sick people can't reach the hospital on time. Young people are not being able to get proper education. Girls are suffering in education because the villages are not properly connected. Connectivity and development is not just about beautification of a place. It's about delivering basic necessities to remote villages. These are some of the things that I plan to work on, and I do have a roadmap ready. Let's see, how much I can achieve in the coming five years. What would be your message to India's youth, especially young women, who would want to join politics, who would want to actively participate in India's development using politics as a tool? No dream is small; everybody has different aspirations, different dreams, and every dream, every aspiration is important to the person. Whatever you have in mind for yourself, have the strength and the courage to fulfill it for yourself, because it's important for your own mental peace. It'll definitely make you very happy. About the women who want to be in politics, I would say that the political situation in the country is changing. I think I am an example of it. Being a young Dalit woman, I've got the opportunity to enter the Lok Sabha. I wish that more and more girls in politics come up so that I also get the strength to voice their thoughts, their concerns. I would encourage everybody to be a part of it. Politics is changing. The political situation is changing. It's becoming safer and safer for women. I would request everybody to actively participate in politics, which just does not mean contesting elections. Political participation means active participation in voting, active participation in voicing their opinions. Come forward, talk to us about what you want. That's the only way we can connect, and that's the only way your dreams and your aspirations can reach somebody like me who can then raise them in Parliament. So it's important for everybody to be vocal about their needs and their aspirations. Women MPs you look forward to meet in the 18th Lok Sabha, and women MPs who inspired you? I am really inspired by Smriti Irani ji . Unfortunately, she lost ( from Amethi ). I was really looking forward to meeting her in Parliament. She did really good work for her constituency. I am looking forward to meet Bansuri Swaraj ( South Delhi's BJP MP and the late Sushma Swaraj's daughter ) because she's an excellent orator. She has been able to deliver a lot of work very positively. She has a very different way of connecting to the people, connecting to the media. She is very witty. I definitely look forward to meeting her. And, of course, we have a star in Parliament now, Kangana Ranaut. She is also somebody who's very fiercely vocal and has been able to talk ( defend ) about our ( Modi ) government in a very fierce way. It would be nice if all the women Parliamentarians could come together. Any non-BJP, non-NDA woman MP who you would look forward to meet? Supriya Sule. I've been closely following her for many years. There is no mention of your last name in your affidavit. Why? I do prefer to use my first name, but a lot of people in my state still know me as Shambhavi Choudhary. They call me Shambhavi Choudhary. There is no specific reason for it. When I was young, my parents wanted to not put the family surname and put a more neutral surname like Bhagyashree or something like that. I think later they forgot to put a surname over there. Now that I'm older and an adult, I believe that surname only ends up reinforcing the entire caste identity again. I'm also really looking forward to adopting a new neutral surname; something that does not identify me as only belonging to a particular caste. Now that I'm a young woman Parliamentarian, I want more and more young people to resonate with me. It can't happen if I'm suffixed to one caste. I feel privileged that I'm one of the very few Dalit women who would get this opportunity. I really do aim for working for the marginalised sections of the society. I don't want to be identified as somebody ( based on my caste ). I don't want to reinforce the caste barriers is all I can say. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'We want to prove to the world that they will get the best code written from a small place like Wayanad.' Wayanad became known to the rest of India when Rahul Gandhi chose it as his constituency in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But to Keralites, it has been an enchanting hilly forest area that is home for a wide range of animals ranging from elephants to tigers to leopards. As tourists to Kerala are captivated by the charm of Wayanad, two brothers who grew up in the region wanted to draw the attention of the world to Wayanad as an eco-friendly software development destination. That's why Allwyn Kent and Allen Rintoul decided to establish their Rs 200 crore (Rs 2 billion) start-up Vonnue Innovations headquartered in Wayanad. \"We built a company because we believe wealth creation can solve a lot of problems and close the gaps that exists in society,\" Allwyn Kent tells Rediff.com 's Shobha Warrier . I wanted to be a politician As a student at NIT Calicut, I wanted to be a politician having seen my mother ( K C Rosa Kutty ), a school teacher, working as a politician. Though she was a former MLA, her political life was more in the mould of a social activist. Incidentally, my mother dissuaded me from taking an active interest in politics. Becoming an entrepreneur was not a dream of mine while at NIT as there was no hype surrounding entrepreneurship when I passed out of college in 2006. The dream of every student in those days was to get a good campus placement. And I did get placed by Andocs, an Israeli IT firm, and my first posting was in Cyprus. From Cyprus, I moved to Seattle, and from there to Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore. The huge gap in opportunities Having worked in many cities around the world and visited many offices, I got this dream to start a company that is very local. It was just a dream then as the more I thought about it, I felt it was not workable. It was while I was stationed in Singapore that I started thinking about the opportunity gap that exists in India. I looked at this as a problem that has to be tackled by someone. The SOP ( Statement of Purpose ) I wrote on the gap in opportunities while preparing to study for an MBA came back to me. Having worked in the field of software for many years, I realised that the opportunity gap is extreme in this field. You go to any software firm in India, you notice this divide. For example, the urban-rural divide is huge. Those who studied in English medium schools were more confident to make conversations and express their views. In our case also, when we were in the 5th standard, our parents sent us to the Sainik School in Trivandrum because they felt the opportunities Wayanad offered were very poor. I realised later on that if we had continued our education in Wayanad, our lives would have turned out differently. There were students who were much better than me in school in Wayanad, and if I did better than them in my career, it is only because of the exposure and opportunities I got. The urban-rural divide in Indian IT companies I am not saying it is anyone's fault that the opportunity gap is very huge in a country like India, more than anywhere else in the world. Travelling around the world made me look at companies from a different perspective. What I saw in say, Russia or Germany, is that the language is centralised, and the culture of the company is the culture they grew up in. This is a huge advantage for the people who work there. That kind of a situation is just not possible in India. When a person who grew up in Wayanad goes to work in Bangalore, he is moving into a totally alien world. He may even feel he is going to a different country! Is it possible to build a company that is local? That's why I wanted to start a company which is highly technical, but the culture and language of the company should be what the people of that area grew up in. For example, when you start a company in Kerala, it will have the culture of Kerala. When we start a branch in Karnataka, we will employ people from that area, and the culture and language of the office will be of that area. If you look at a company like Robert Bosch, its German office has German culture while its Russian branch has Russian culture. Similarly, we can have small offices in different parts of India that are very local. The employees in the Kerala branch communicate not in English but in Malayalam, but they produce high-tech software for the world. I feel this way, I will be able to help someone who is left behind due to lack of opportunities. I am just trying to solve a problem that fascinates me. Brothers discuss starting a company. In 2018, when I was working in Singapore and my brother Allen in Bangalore, we started discussing starting our company in Wayanad. Allen is a hardcore techie working as a software developer in Bangalore and we were doing quite well in our careers then. We wanted to give something back to our native land. Our grandparents had migrated from Kottayam to the hills and made their lives as farmers in Wayanad. They had travelled in a bullock cart to Wayanad and started as planters in the forest. Many people did that in those days. We have heard stories of my mother walking 14 kilometres in the forest to reach home from her school hostel in the weekends. We had always felt we owe a lot to the place. And if you look at how Wayanad developed, you will see that it was not individuals who built the place; the entire community worked hard to build the town; the schools, the hospitals, roads, etc. You can say the society we grew up was non-individualistic. So, we decided to start a company in Wayanad that has a social structure like it will be carbon positive, where there is equal representation of both men and women, where the employees are recruited locally, where the meetings will be in the local language, etc. Why they named the company Vonnue Innovations We were paying respect to John von Neumann for his contribution in the field of mathematics and computer science when we took VONNEU from his name. But the guy at the registration office made a spelling mistake and made it VONNUE instead of VONNEU! We began our journey as entrepreneurs with the savings we had. As you know, to start a software company, you don't need much capital. You just need a place to sit and a laptop. Luckily for us, we began with a contract from Singtel ( Singapore Telecom ) when they were in the process of building an OTT platform. I continued to be in Singapore to focus on getting business while my brother got a co-working space at the Infopark in Kochi. We were in Kochi for a year until our employee strength grew to 15 people. Then came the pandemic.... The pandemic made one of our biggest our customers, a joint venture of Singtel, Sony Pictures and Warner Bros, file for bankruptcy. It affected us badly as there were pending payments from them, and we had to pay salaries to our 15 employees. Because of the pandemic, no company was spending any money on new ventures. Even though we had very little cash left with us, my brother took the bold decision to move forward and not hang the boots. It was not that we were the only people who were suffering; the entire world was. He decided to use the time as a period of learning and started training our employees. And he trained them every day. Meanwhile, I took up a contract job with SES Satellite to keep the fires burning. The momentum in growth started with us getting a contract from Grab Taxi and then came Robert Bosch. These companies trusting us was such a big deal for us. Finally an office in Wayanad By the end of 2020, we knew it was time to move to Wayanad. We took up a small house in Sultan Bathery for rent and began our new journey. Once the world came out of the pandemic, we started growing pretty fast. One of my NIT college mates, Nijesh KU, left a lucrative job to join us. So also my brother's classmate Rajeesh CV. These are highly regarded technical guys whose main passion is writing good code and when you have such people with you, you know you are on the right path. All of us were driven by this passion to do something highly technical but with a social angle. When our employee strength doubled to 30, the house became too small for us. So, we rented a 1000 square feet floor in a shopping mall. Today, our office space is around 7,000 sq. ft. 70% of the employees are from the nearby hilly areas. Every second Saturday we have a walk-in interview for the local people. We look for logical ability and the capacity to focus while recruiting. We then give them a small stipend, food and accommodation, and train them for six months. The idea is to recruit people from the nearby hilly areas of the northern Malabar belt like Idukki, Kannur, Malabar, etc. so that they can go home on the weekends. We make it a point to go to the colleges in this region looking for talent. Out of the 100 people working for us, 70% are from the nearby hilly areas and 47% are women. 30 more are going to join us soon. In our field, only very few people need to interact with customers. For coding, you have to only read and write English. You don't have to speak English. In a state like Kerala, all the educated people know to read and write English, but speaking is a big problem for them. Understanding a technical document or writing an e-mail is not an issue here. India is not just a country that outsources but develops products. In the initial days of the software boom, Indian companies were into servicing. It is not so today. The world does not look at as an outsourcing country but as a place from where good software products are developed. Today, we are building products and building them for the world. Building products for the world from Wayanad Where you are located is immaterial in today's world. What you produce has to be world class. We want to prove to the world that they will get the best code written from a small place like Wayanad. This is an experiment we are trying and from the list of clients we have like Singtel, Grab Taxi, Robert Bosch, SES Satellite, Eagle Eye Networks and Kearney, it seems our experiment has worked! I feel we are at the right place at the right time. The other day, our company was valued as a Rs 200 crore company. With a lot of focus on AI, we feel we can easily grow into a company with 1,000 employees in the next 5 years. Need for an IT Park in Wayanad Recently when the state government reached out to us, we said if they could build an eco-friendly IT park in Wayanad, more software developing companies would be encouraged to come to Wayanad. That way, all of us can showcase ourselves as say, carbon-neutral software companies from Wayanad. We don't see them as competitors as there is enough work for everybody in the world. Wayanad is a place where agriculture is going down and tourism is in the hands of a few very rich people. So, what will the educated youth do? They have to go elsewhere to work. Not socialists or capitalists; socio-capitalists I would like to call ourselves as socio-capitalists. We built a company because we believe wealth creation can solve a lot of problems and close the gaps that exists in society. When a company employs 1,000 to 2,000 people locally, it is taking care of not just those people but 1,000 to 2,000 families as well. We don't believe in redistribution of wealth; we believe in creation of wealth. Feature Presentation: Ashish Narsale/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'On May 21 we started our final summit attempt at 5 pm. On May 22 at 4.10 am we summited Everest.' Maharashtra police Inspector Dwarka Dokhe , 50, recently summited Mount Everest, becoming the first woman from the state police force to scale the tallest peak in the world. She spoke to A Ganesh Nadar/ Rediff.com about her achievement. I have been a police officer for 18 years. I joined as a PSI ( police sub-inspector ) and was later promoted to inspector. I also worked as a teacher for nine years before that. I have two degrees -- BSc, and BEd. I have often been invited to give lectures to students. In 2016 I gave a lecture to the students of the Himachal Pradesh youth hostel. They gave me a book as a gift which was lying in my house for three years. I read it after three years and it raised my curiosity about mountains and snow and the monks and sadhus who stayed there to meditate. I was always physically fit as I am a cop, and I exercise regularly. In 2017 I climbed the 16,000 feet high Roopkund mountain. In 2018 I went to Nepal to climb the Mera Peak which is 6,770 metres high. In July 2021 I made my first attempt to climb Everest. It costs Rs 35 lakh to Rs 38 lakh (Rs 3.5 million to Rs 3.8 million). I did crowd funding for three months. I had lost my father earlier and now my mother expired. I swore I would make them happy by climbing Everest. I climbed the Labuchi peak where I fell sick on my way to Everest. Water had entered my lungs. I had to descend in order to save my life. Later, for practice I climbed a mountain in Ladakh. I did cardio-vascular exercises. I learnt Vipassana and yogic deep breathing. On March 24 this year I left for Kathmandu where a Sherpa checked my gear. We purchased what we needed. On March 30 we went to Lukla. My leader there was Lakpa Sherpa. I had to acclimatise, then we went to the base camp for further acclimatisation. Before we reached the base camp we had to climb Island peak. I was at the base camp on April 12. We waited for our bodies to get acclimatised. Then we crossed the Kumbu ice wall which has lots of crevices, it is a moving glacier. We crossed at night when the glacier is frozen. Then we rested at the base camp. The wind speed was 60 km and we were getting frost bite. On May 17 we started our summit push and the next day reached Camp 2. On May 19 we left for Camp 3 and on May 20 we left for Camp 4. On May 21 we started our final summit attempt at 5 pm with Pasang Sherpa. On May 22 at 4.10 am we summited Everest. It had cost me Rs 30 lakh. I had saved up my salary, and my brother and my cousin helped me with money. At the summit I sang the National Anthem after removing my oxygen mask. I am the first Indian lady to do that. I am the first Maharashtra police woman to scale Everest. We came back to the base camp and I did not have money -- It costs 600 dollars -- for the helicopter ride to Lukla and so I decided to walk. Abhay More, a bank manager with ICICI, paid for my ticket. We did not know each other but we share a common love for mountains. I am thankful to my boss at the Maharashtra Police Academy in Nasik, Rajesh Kumar, who always sanctioned my leave when I went climbing. He encouraged me to always follow my passion. This summit climb is a tribute to my father and mother. Feature Presentation: Ashish Narsale/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Are these earbuds worth Rs 1,699? Ashish Narsale/ Rediff.com finds out. The pTron, a subsidiary of Indian tech company Palred Technologies Ltd, has launched yet another True Wireless Stereo earbuds, the pTron Basspods 992, with active noise cancellation (ANC eliminates the surrounding noise using a dedicated set of microphones. It produces negative sound waves to negate external noise. As this feature uses power, the battery may drain faster than normal). The ANC cannot be counted as a premium feature since these earbuds are priced at Rs 1,699. Do they perform as promised? Ashish Narsale/ Rediff.com shares his verdict. Build, Design and Fit The earbuds come in a plastic rectangular charging case with rounded edges. Both have a glossy piano finish that gives them a premium look. Available in white and black, the earbuds magnetically cling on in the space provide for charging. The lid too shuts with magnet support. The bottom of the case houses a USB Type-C charging port and an LED indicator that blinks white while charging and red when the battery is low. The earbuds have an in-ear design and come with replaceable silicon ear-cups. The earcups come in three sizes that are soft, comfortable and fit well, creating good passive noise cancellation. For a better sound experience, I would suggest that you try the extra silicon cups and find your best fit. The earbuds weigh just 4.6 grams -- once worn, you hardly feel any weight -- and fit well. Each bud has an LED indicator for battery and paring that glows red and blue. The buds support touch control for music, voice assistant, power, ANC and are IPX4 certified for water and sweat protection. Control The touch controls on the buds are minimalistic and simple to use. Once the buds are pulled out of the case, provided they are charged, they automatically turn on and connect to the paired device or go into pairing mode. If they are not on, you can long-press the touch-sensitive area on the top side of each bud to switch it on. A long-press on left earbud for 2 seconds activates voice assistants (it supports Goolge and Siri). And a long-press on right earbud for 2 seconds allows you to cycle between ANC modes and the transparency mode, which amplifies the surrounding sound without your having to removing the earbuds. The ANC reduces the external noise by about 70-80 per cent. When it was switched on, I could hear faint voices of people speaking; the sound of my room's fan was suppressed to a certain extent. While listening to music, you can play/pause music with single tap on either bud. To return to the previous, or move to the next, track, you can double tap the left and right touch-sensitive area respectively. You can also use either of the touch areas to receive/reject calls. Sadly, there is no volume control option in the buds; you have to control it through the device. The touch is quite responsive. Range and Connectivity The earbuds use 5.0 Bluetooth radio, a good upgrade from its previous generations of earbuds which cost almost same. The signal range is quite good and works upto 10 metres, unless you enter another room or are behind a wall. There is no visible delay in the audio-video synchronisation while watching videos in the wireless mode. For gaming, however, I would advise using wired earphones. Sound The 10 mm drivers are tuned to deliver good sound quality. It also supports AAC codec for HD audio if your phone/device supports it. The earbuds have a balanced sound signature. I tested it by listening to songs like Rehnuma from Rocky Handsome, Ok Jaanu from Ok Jaanu, Taal se taal mila from Taal and Piya Basanti Re, a music album by Ustad Sultan Khan. The bass (lows) is well tuned and does not boom so, if you are looking for extra bass, these earbuds are not for you. The vocals (mids) and treble (highs) are crisp and clear. The sound stage demonstrates depth with both wide and narrow sound. The dynamic range is pretty good; it can differentiate between the softest and loudest sounds. The directional accuracy shows convincing output and gives a good 3D effect when listening to 3D/binaural audio. Simply put, this means most of the musical instruments can be distinctively heard; the vocals are clear and the bass is soothing. While I like the volume at 50 per cent, there is no distortion even when the sound is raised to 100 per cent. These earbuds are made for music lovers who like to listen to all kind of genres -- pop, jazz, classical, rock, orchestra and even Bollywood. Watching streaming movies was a good experience. It's also a good option for those who work from home. The ANC helps reduce the background noise but you will be aware of your surroundings unless you are deeply engrossed. Call Quality The microphones work well during both indoor and outdoor calls. The person I was speaking to and I had no trouble hearing each other. Battery The battery is a great performer. The casing hosts a 500 mAh battery and each bud is embedded with 40 mAh battery. A fully charged casing lets you charge the earbuds approximately four times. After a single charge of 1 hour 30 minutes, the earbuds last upto four hours if it is used at a moderate volume with the ANC switched off. With 10 minutes of charge, it gave me approximately 60 minutes of playtime with the ANC on. It uses the USB Type-C and supports fast charging. Verdict These are the best earbuds from pTron I have tried; it has good features, good performance and is good value for money. I would certainly recommend them to those who are looking for good sound, good battery performance and ANC at a budget price. Watch!

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Focus on building closer connections with your partner by speaking more frequently without electronics in the room to get the most out of chats, advises Sybil Shiddell, country manager-India for Gleeden, a discreet extra marital dating Web site. It's true that it's difficult to resist the fun and convenience that technology offers. The use of technology should be moderated, and we shouldn't allow our devices dictate how we act or how we interact with others. In some ways, contemporary technology has simplified our lives. With just a touch. It's crucial to be aware of how technology is influencing your connections with your partner, from consuming too much of your free time to giving the wrong impressions. 1. Is it really easy-peasy? People are not giving each other the time and attention they require when they are continuously on their phones or laptops while in the same place. Due to a lack of meaningful communication or passive listening, this may produce emotions of detachment and dissatisfaction. 2. Decreasing Social Interaction With the development of technology, we are engaging with one another in person much less frequently. After all, texting is more efficient than talking. Instead of having real discussions, we spend more time hiding behind our smartphones. Even worse, this absence of face-to-face interaction may make you feel lonely and isolated. 3. Risk of social comparison and loneliness It's normal to crave approval and affirmation, but it may become harmful when we compare our lives to those of the individuals we see on our phones and tablets. It may be demoralising and tempting to compare ourselves to those who appear to be having more 'perfect' and 'successful' lives, which keeps us from concentrating on the connections in front of us. As we live more vicariously through virtual realities instead of real life, we end up neglecting our relationships, which causes us to feel distant and alone even when surrounded by other people. 4. Compromising attention spans Negative effects on relationships and misunderstandings can arise rapidly when one partner is not given one's full attention. These eight seconds of inattention can result in the loss of an opportunity, a missed conversation, or even a misinterpretation of your partner's emotions. 5. Versatility versus Depth Technology-based communication has the advantage of being quick and adaptable, but might lack depth in discussions due to the constrained amount of room for dialogue in text messages or social media posts. Also, if you and the other person are engrossed in your phones or computers even though you are in the same room, it may be difficult to pay attention. Focus on building closer connections with your partner by speaking more frequently without electronics in the room to get the most out of chats. This will deepen your bonds and make future conflicts simpler to settle. 6. Isolation In a relationship, gadgets can sometimes result in a feeling of isolation where one or both partners feel ignored or alienated. A relationship may become disconnected if one spouse is addicted to their phone or laptop all the time leaving the person dissatisfied. 7. Lack of Interaction Another way that technology is harming relationships is by reducing verbal and physical interaction. Sitting next to each other in a room while talking on your phones won't strengthen any connections between two individuals; rather, it will only accentuate their physical separation and lack of interaction. 8. Emotional Disconnect When we are separated by physical distance, it is simple for emotions to take a backseat when we don't spend as much time in person. Because facial expressions and body language can assist transmit feelings more effectively than words alone, texting and messaging might accidentally leave out emotional context. 9. Increasing Gap in discussion When one of you is on the phone or laptop, it can be challenging to maintain concentration and carry on a discussion. As a result, there is an increasing distance between the two people as one strains to maintain the conversation and the other becomes preoccupied with their device. You must take into account how technology affects your relationship's entire communication since it affects more than simply the loss of face-to-face interaction.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) When one first heard about the air fryer, almost 20 years ago, it sounded like a magical gadget. To have a nifty little box, that could fry French fries, alu tikki s, kebabs, without oil , had to be an incredible machine. I bought an air fryer three years ago. It is indeed an astonishing appliance. But... (Yes, the buts are important.) But a few truths. If you cook something in the air fryer with zero oil, it ain't gonna taste like much. So, a dash of oil is required. Yet, it is still amazing how good stuff tastes when it comes out of the fryer after it's been cooked in the tiniest quantity of oil. Another truth: Air fryers are meant for homes where lots of fried food is made. And not for households unused to an excess of deep-fried goodies. Many of us no longer wade though weeks of menus filled with puris, samosas, vada s etc. We may make one of these delicacies once in a month and then a little deep frying won't really hurt. Also don't expect to be cooking up bhajiya s or vada pao in your fryer -- all fried foods cannot be made in an air fryer, not without some serious modifications. Remember too: It's a large appliance that will need storage space or countertop room and a large plug and yet needs to be handy or it will gather dust. I was recently asked about the pros and cons of buying an air fryer and here is how I offered my advice: Instagram and YouTube are full of recommendations of the wonderful things you can do with an air fryer. Are they true? Remember an air fryer is not an OTG oven (0ven toaster grill) or a microwave (except those with an air fryer setting). Conceivably, it can stand in for one, if you don't have an OTG oven or a convection microwave. But if you have either, there is no need to imagine you are creating something fantastically different by putting stuff (that could easily be cooked in an oven or a frying pan) in an air fryer, which some Instagram posts lead you to believe. The main purpose of an air fryer is to eliminate the use of excess oil. And it uses special technology to do this, by speedily swirling intense heat all around the item via rapid air technology. Does an air fryer eliminate oil entirely? It can cook something entirely without oil. But if the item being cooked does not have any oil in it (in its raw form), using no oil while cooking an item will not work exactly. Whatever you are cooking needs a small amount of oil lubrication, with one of those pastry brushes, for the item to not taste like dry like sawdust and for it to crisp. Who is an air fryer meant for? For a family or couple or a single person, who, in the normal course of a week, add/s a lot of fried food to their meals -- fried fish, samosas, tikki s, different types of vada s, burgers, gulab jamun , French fries, kachori s, puris, kebabs, sausages etc. How often do you use an air fryer? If fried food is not a regular part of your diet, an air fryer is not so useful. And if you don't eat much of those frozen packaged food now available, regularly, like kebabs, sabudana wada s and samosas etc, it won't be so useful. But it does a marvelous job with fresh-out-of-the-freezer semi-cooked items. Samosas come out crunchy and fragrant with the tiniest amount of oil. The fryer turns out excellent kebabs and so on. Can a non-stick frying pan, where you use minimal oil and roast the item over low heat, stand in for an air fryer? About 75 per cent of the time. You don't need an air fryer to pan fry bhindi . When you try -- with less oil -- to fry something that normally needs more oil to cook in frying pan, it tends to stick to the bottom of the pan. That mostly does not happen in an air fryer. Fish, prawns, baingan (eggplant or brinjal), karela (bitter gourd) are good bets for an air fryer. What size air fryer should one buy? If you are a large family, or a family unit that plans to use the fryer for entertaining, then it is important to go for a larger size. Or you will have drooling hordes waiting and waiting endlessly for their batches of kebabs etc, because anything below 5.5 litres is pretty small What are some of the best items to cook in an air fryer? Various types of potato fries -- French fries, wedges, chips. Chicken nuggets, papad , fryums, momos, cutlets, samosas, paneer, burgers, fried fish, fried prawns, fried chicken, stir-fried vegetables, Chicken 65, Mushroom 65, sausages, peanuts, gula jamiun, chilly chicken, dahi bhalle , mung vada s, fried bhindi , fried karela , fried baingan (eggplant). Any other use for an air fryer? I have friends who use it as a one-stop cooking area that does not use too many pots and pans. Like they might do their sandwiches and fries in one go in an air fryer. Or pizzas. Omelets, bacon and cheese toast. That‚Äôs a reasonable alternative use. Tips? It's very important to preheat your air fryer for about 10 minutes before. Each air fryer is different and experiment with the timings for items and the time given in recipes may not apply to your air fryer. When frying something really gooey or sticky like fish, line the basket with baking paper or use a silicon air fryer basket or a paper liner basket (both available online); it will save you a lot of cleaning later. For making bhalle and other kinds of wada s, like mung wada s, buy a silicon mini muffin mold tray. American-style grilled cheese sandwiches do quite well in the air fryer. Traditionally it's toasted in a frying pan with a fair amount of oil or butter. In an air fryer you can use less butter and the mechanism of the fryer will ensure it gets a desired all-around crispness. This sandwich is a cross between the all-American favourite and Welsh rarebit, a snobby 18th century British tea special that uses beer or ale. Welsh rarebit, once called Welsh rabbit, obviously has no rabbit in it, but is a spiced-up cheesy bread concoction. Incidentally the British have been enjoying rarebit kind of snacks since Shakespeare's time and it is said that Welsh rarebit causes colourful dreams. Grilled Welsh Rarebit Serves: 1-2 Ingredients Method Zelda's Note : Instead of beer you could opt for wine. When served with an egg on top it becomes a golden buck or a buck rabbit. When tomato is mixed with the cheese sauce it becomes a blushing bunny. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

Anonymous: My daughter just passed SSC with 97.20 per cent from ICSE board. She is confused which field she should go for. If for medical then we cannot afford the fees of private medical colleges as they are on the higher side especially if NEET score is not good. I personally feel she should go for engineering through MH-CET or JEE Main. In engineering if she is not able to crack both exams at least she can go for private engineering colleges which are much affordable. But she is confused as math is not interesting for her. Please suggest us the same. Sir, taking into consideration that your daughter is not interested in maths, engineering is not advisable for her. To get a basic idea about which streams or courses will be suitable for her UG (undergrad). I suggest she attempts a psychometric test (available online) by paying approximately Rs 1,000. From a psychometric test, you will come to know your daughter's level of aptitude, attitude, interest, personality traits and her orientation style. It will also recommend suitable career options for her, other than medical and engineering. All the best to your daughter for her bright future. Mayank: Sir my JEE mains rank is 107000 CRL and around 35K OBC RANK and my COMEDK rank is 3733. Which exam I should go for admission? And sir also tell me, between JYPEE Noida and College of COMEDK which will I get. My rank is 3733. Thank you. Mayank, it is better to try through COMEDK as you have scored a good rank. You can apply to the RV College of Engineering, BMS College of Engineering, MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology, BIT and Dayanand. As far as first two top colleges of Bengaluru (mentioned here), it is slightly difficult to get admission into popular courses like CSE, ECE, IT. However, chances are more with MS Ramaiah, BIT and Dayanand. You can shortlist two or three more colleges in Bengaluru with your rank. You will definitely get through. Exposure in Bengaluru is more as it is an IT-city. You can choose Plan B with JAYPEE-Noida. As for Plan C for JEE-Main, chances for getting Tier 1 NITs/IITs/ GFTIs are very less.

    "title": "What's Quiet Vacationing? - Rediff.com Get Ahead",
    "published_date": "June 19, 2024",
    "author_name": "Sonica Aron",
    "author_url": "https://www.rediff.com/author/SONICA ARON",
    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Quiet vacationing is a valuable tool to manage stress and maintain well-being during busy periods, suggests Sonica Aron, founder of the HR consultancy firm, Marching Sheep. Gone are the days when employees sought approval from their managers and HR to go on a planned holiday. A significant portion of the workforce is now hesitant to use their paid time off. This fear can stem from various insecurities, such as feeling replaceable, being judged by managers or team members, or falling behind on work during their absence. However, the constant pressure to stay connected and available can lead to burnout, ultimately impacting both employee well-being and productivity. There has been an increase, therefore, in the concept of quiet vacationing. And like any other trend, it has both positive and not-so-positive repercussions. What is Quiet Vacationing? Quiet vacationing means taking a break from work without using your leave officially. For example, employees might travel to a holiday location, make sure that they attend meetings virtually, stay on top of their deliverables based on their own pace of working, while also enjoying the benefits of the holiday location. This could be a beachside resort or a visit to one's family. It's about carving out moments to disconnect and recharge, partake in fun activities, and rejuvenate with a change in scenery while being technically 'on the clock.' Importantly, it differs from 'quiet quitting,' which involves disengaging from work altogether. Quiet vacationing focuses on maintaining productivity while prioritizing your well-being. The primary reasons for 'Quiet vacationing' which is gaining popularity among Gen Z and younger Gen Y is the need to balance between work obligations and personal well-being. Reduced stress and less burnout are some of the key advantages. Disconnecting from the constant pressure of work allows you to return refreshed, leading to improved focus and productivity during your actual work hours. Additionally, quiet vacationing can boost creativity and problem-solving abilities, leading to better work outcomes. Where it becomes a concern is when it is carried out in secrecy, without proper communication with manage and peers. Also, an unplanned outing can lead to neither achievement of well being goals or work completion. How to make the most of Quiet Vacationing? 1. Embrace Digital Detox While you may be away from office, remember to schedule specific times to check e-mails and messages. Utilise 'Do Not Disturb' mode on work devices during personal time. Consider setting boundaries with colleagues about your off-hours availability. This creates dedicated focus periods and minimises distractions for a more relaxed work experience. 2. Incorporate Mindful Breaks Short bursts of mindfulness can work wonders. Integrate short breaks to connect with yourself throughout the day. Take walking breaks or engage in light physical activity. Focus on enjoyable activities during your lunch break -- read a book, listen to music, or socialise with colleagues about non-work topics. These mini-breaks help you recharge and return to your work refreshed. 3. Conquer Multitasking Multitasking might feel efficient, but it often leads to reduced focus, scattered thinking, and hampered productivity. Develop a system to identify the most important tasks and focus on completing one at a time. Turn off unnecessary notifications that can disrupt your workflow and hinder concentration. If your workload feels overwhelming, don't be afraid to delegate tasks to colleagues. 4. Craft A Calming Workspace It's important to choose your location wisely. A noisy hustling bustling place might not be want you are looking for. On the contrary, you could plan a trip to your parents' place, where not only one can personalise their workspace, but also get away from the pressure of domestic chores. It could be also a rental at a nearby hill station, or a natural reserve or a beach location. A comfortable, calming, enjoyable workspace contributes to a more relaxed workday. 5. Transform Your Commute If you are unable to get away from your place of work, use your commute as a form of quiet vacationing. Listen to calming music or podcasts that help you unwind after work or set a positive tone for the day on your way in. Practice mindfulness exercises during your commute, such as focusing on your breath or simply observing your surroundings. Avoid checking work e-mails or messages while commuting. This allows you to mentally transition between work and personal life more effectively. 6. Delegate And Share The load Don't be a one-person show! Identify tasks you can delegate to colleagues to lighten your workload. Don't hesitate to ask supervisors or coworkers for help on projects. Saying NO to additional tasks when you're overloaded is perfectly acceptable. Remember, a manageable workload translates to less stress and more opportunities for mental breaks throughout the day. 7. Disconnect After Working Hours This is easier said than done, but it's important to leave work at work. Establish a clear routine for ending your workday mentally and physically. A simple act like shutting down your laptop can send a trigger to your mind and body that the work day is over. Avoid taking work calls or checking e-mails at home. Engage in activities that take your mind off work after hours -- spend time with loved ones, pursue hobbies, or simply relax. This clear separation between work and personal life allows you to recharge and return to work feeling refreshed. 8. Prioritise Sleep We often don't realise how important adequate sleep is. A well-rested body and mind is happier and productive. There is a direct connection between quantum of sleep, weight management, energy levels and moods. You must aim for 7 to 8 hours of quality sleep each night. You can achieve this by creating a relaxing bedtime routine to wind down before sleep, and avoid screen time for at least an hour before bedtime. Getting adequate sleep improves your focus, mood, and overall well-being, contributing significantly to a more balanced work life. 9. Fuel Your Well-Being Nourish your body and mind with healthy habits on a daily basis. Maintain a balanced diet with nutritious meals and snacks. Stay hydrated throughout the day by drinking plenty of water. Regular exercise is also crucial. Even a short walk or light workout can boost your energy levels and improve your mood. Taking care of your physical health translates to a more resilient and relaxed state of mind. There are social media apps and reels that help with short workout routines that can be built in through the day. Not only will this impact one‚Äôs metabolism, but will help in maintaining an equilibrium of happy hormones. 10. Schedule 'Mental Health Days' Dedicate a specific day (or a few hours) to disconnect completely. Use this time for self-care activities, hobbies, or simply relaxation. Inform your colleagues in advance if possible, depending on your workload and urgency. These mental health breaks allow you to fully recharge and return to work feeling focused and ready to tackle any challenge. Quiet vacationing is a valuable tool to manage stress and maintain well-being during busy periods. Remember, it's not a replacement for a full vacation but a way to cope with breaks. Open communication with your employer about workload and well-being is also crucial. By prioritising your mental health, you can ultimately become a more productive and engaged employee. At the same time, a critical question to ponder on the that why is it that so many employees feel the need for quiet vacationing. A lot depends on the organisation's culture and managerial capability on how quiet vacationing is perceived. To minimise the need for quiet vacationing it is essential for organisations and managers to drive a culture where taking time off officially should not induce anxiety or stress. They should encourage employees to apply for leave, build a collaborative team culture where team members pitch in for each other, and being away from work is not penalised in any way. A well-planned vacation can be extremely beneficial if carried out transparently, in partnership with managers and colleagues. Hybrid and remote working options, flexibility in choosing place of work are frameworks that can help employees manage their work obligations, productivity and overall well-being.

My colleagues gossip about me and I want to quit as this relationship is affecting my work as well. How do I control my emotions and walk away with dignity? Hello there. It's understandable that navigating a relationship with your boss, especially when it's causing stress and affecting your work environment, can be challenging. Communicate your boundaries to your boss. Let him know how the relationship is affecting you and your work. Establishing boundaries will help you maintain a professional environment and signal that you are serious about your decision. Plan your exit strategy from both the personal relationship and your job. This might involve finding a new job or preparing to face potential challenges at your current workplace if you decide to stay. Focus on maintaining professionalism at work. Regardless of the gossip or workplace dynamics, continue to perform your job to the best of your ability. This will help you leave the organisation on good terms and maintain a positive professional reputation. If the workplace gossip is becoming unbearable or if the relationship is affecting your ability to work, consider talking to someone in HR or a supervisor. They can provide guidance and support, and they may be able to help address any negative impact on your work environment. Understand that leaving the relationship and, potentially, the job may bring about significant changes. Be mentally prepared for these changes and focus on the positive aspects of moving forward. Prioritise self-care during this challenging time. Focus on activities and practices that bring you joy, relaxation and a sense of well-being. When you're ready to end the relationship, communicate your decision clearly and calmly. Choose a private and neutral setting to have this conversation. Be honest about your feelings and the reasons behind your decision. Remember, it's essential to prioritise your well-being and make decisions that contribute positively to your life in the long run. Ending a relationship and making changes in your professional life can be challenging but it's a crucial step toward your personal growth and happiness. Anonymous: I have a successful career. My wife has a habit of calling my workplace female colleagues every time and embarrassing me. This has happened in the last three organisations and in spite of strict warnings she's done it again where she called a very junior female staff cause she saw our team photos and started abusing her. I somehow managed the situation at work and apologised to the employee and her family. This got spread anyway. She recently walked into my office to open accounts and surprised me, which was noticed by my organisation. Such behaviour has given wrong clues at my office about my character and I am now in a very vulnerable state. My wife speaks to her male colleagues openly and once clicked objectionable snaps with them which was highlighted to me by her colleague but I respected her office stature and didn't create a scene. Please help. It sounds like you're dealing with a challenging situation that is not only affecting your professional life but also potentially damaging your reputation at work. It's important to address this issue carefully and proactively. Choose a calm and private setting to discuss your concerns with your wife. Express how her actions are impacting your professional life and reputation. Be honest about the consequences of her behaviour and how it's affecting your career. Encourage open communication to understand her perspective and concerns as well. Communicate and establish boundaries regarding personal and professional matters. Discuss and agree on acceptable behaviours and actions within and outside the workplace. If trust has been compromised, work together to rebuild it. This may involve setting mutual expectations and following through with them. If your wife's actions have affected colleagues or subordinates, consider offering a professional apology. Make it clear that her behaviour does not reflect your professional values. Reinforce the importance of keeping personal and professional lives separate. Discuss the potential consequences of intertwining the two. Consider reflecting on the overall health of your relationship. Determine whether there are underlying issues that need to be addressed for the sake of both your personal and professional well-being. Remember, it's crucial to address these issues delicately and professionally to minimise further impact on your career and personal life. If the situation continues to escalate, it may be helpful to seek guidance from professionals who specialise in relationship counselling or workplace conflict resolution. Avinash: Hi. I am a married person aged 45, I am in a relationship with a girl who used to work in our office. Now she is working somewhere else but we are still in touch only by calls and WhatsApp. For the last 4-5 months she has been asking to help her from some financial crisis, I am helping her also. But she is treating me like a second-grade citizen after I am helping her financially and talks to me rudely. A few times we had heated arguments also, but we never had a physical relationship, whether I should continue or not. Dear Avinash, your situation is complex, involving both emotional and financial aspects. Reflect on your priorities and values. Consider the impact this relationship may have on your overall well-being, your marriage and your personal life. It's important to prioritise your own happiness and mental health. If you are comfortable doing so, consider discussing your feelings and concerns with your spouse. Open communication is crucial in maintaining trust and understanding in a marriage. Consider the long-term prospects of this relationship. If it is causing more harm than good, it may be worth reevaluating whether continuing the relationship aligns with your personal goals and values. Evaluate the nature of the financial assistance you are providing. If you feel taken advantage of or if the person is not appreciative of your help, it's crucial to reassess whether continued financial support is appropriate. Establish clear boundaries regarding your relationship, especially given your marital status. If the relationship is causing strain on your marriage or personal well-being, consider whether those boundaries need to be adjusted or reinforced. Remember, it's essential to prioritise your well-being and the well-being of those around you. If the relationship is causing distress or negatively impacting your life, it may be time to reassess and make decisions that are in your best interest. Seeking support from friends, family, or professionals can provide valuable perspectives during challenging times.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Like two wheels of a cycle moving in tandem, Danielle Flanagan and Shawn Samuel are building a beautiful life together. Remember that person you always saw around you? You never really talked but there was a certain sense of comfort that came from them. It was like that for Dan and me. We were always socially connected on various mediums, but had never had a conversation as such. Danielle Flanagan and I stayed in the same area. We went to the same church. I knew her as this pretty girl who sang in the choir. We'd exchange a hello every Sunday. Strangely, it was the lockdown that saw the beginning of our love story. Cycling, then, had become a 'thing'. I saw Dan's story on Instagram with a cycle and, for the first time ever, I dropped her a text stating, 'Oh, even you cycle?' She replied, 'I do. But this is not in Goregaon ( north west Mumbai ). I don't have a cycle at home, else I would.' I still remember the date -- September 14, 2021 -- when I decided I would get her a cycle and we would go cycling together. Two days, later I managed it. We began to see each other every day and, instead of becoming fonder of cycling, we became fond of each other. After cycling, we would go up to the terrace of either of our buildings and sit and talk for at least an hour, relaxing in the cool breeze. At that time, we never knew that our love for cycling would bring us together forever. A simple, delightful relationship developed between us and, after six months, I asked her to be my girlfriend. That's when I learnt that she had just been waiting since a long time for me to ask :) As time passed, we realised it was not just each other's company that we enjoyed -- we also loved spending time with our families and friends. When we could not see each other for a day, it felt like we had lost 24 hours. But more than that, it was the understanding, the friendship, the trust and that feeling that this person is the one . I knew I wanted her in my life forever. I have never been more nervous than I was when I went to her home to ask her parents' permission to marry her. They were happy and gave us the go-ahead. We were engaged on January 8, 2022, and married on December 17 of the same year; it was the most beautiful day of my life. Today, I can't imagine a moment when she is not part of my life. We love spending time with each other and make sure we have movie nights at home. She makes really good food. I really enjoy what she cooks as do my colleagues at work :) We share some really amazing moments. Everything with her in it is special and I really am blessed to have her in my life! Do you have a Very Special Someone in your life? How did you first meet? How did your jodi come about? Was it love at first sight? Who said the magical words first? How long have you been together?

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) A partner who remembers the details of your life -- from your favourite pizza toppings to important dates and events -- shows that s/he genuinely cares about you and your happiness, says rediffGURU Ravi Mittal, CEO, Quack Quack, an online dating app. In a world where red flags are the talk of the hour, where everyone is busy looking for warning signs that indicate potential trouble ahead, let's take a diversion and look at the positives or the 'green flags'. For a change, let's indulge in focusing on those delightful, reassuring signals that suggest 'this is the one'. Here are 10 signs to look out for in a relationship that suggest your partner is an absolute green flag. 1. Compassion and kindness Money, riches, good looks, even a stellar personality -- everything is easy to find in today's day and age. But a person with compassion and kindness is not a common sight. A partner who can understand and share the feelings of another human being, who can empathise with your happiness and sorrow, who offers comfort when needed and, above all, is kind even on rough days, is someone worth holding on to. 2. They are not afraid to say sorry No relationship exists is without a fair amount of conflict but how a couple resolves them is what sets the tone of the relationship. A person who isn't afraid to apologise when they are wrong is a rare gem. It's a solid green flag indicator. Setting aside one's ego and apologising is tougher than it sounds. Focus on how your partner acts when they are in the wrong. Do they deflect or do they admit their mistake? When a partner takes time to reflect on their actions and accepts responsibility, it's a sign of mutual respect. 3. They make you feel safe Your relationship has to be your safe space. But finding a partner who makes you feel safe and secure in your relationship isn't always easy. If your partner creates an environment where you can be your authentic self without fear of judgment or harm, consider yourself lucky -- it's a rare gem to find. Feeling safe in a relationship is much more than just physical safety; it's about feeling emotionally secure and knowing without a doubt that your partner has your back, no matter what life throws your way. 4. Support Imagine having a partner who's your biggest cheerleader, your rock through thick and thin. They stand by you, offering encouragement, a helping hand and a sturdy shoulder to lean on when things get rough. They help you be the best version of yourself. That is a green flag partner. Or should we call them a whole green forest? Navigating life, the ups and downs and the bumpy roads, is easier when there is someone who will catch you if you fall. 5. Attention to detail If your partner pays attention to detail, you are dating a green flag. It shows thoughtfulness and consideration. A partner who notices and remembers the details of your life -- from your favourite pizza toppings to important dates and events -- shows that they genuinely care about you and your happiness. These small gestures of mindfulness create a deeper bond and a happier relationship. 6. Healthy boundaries In a relationship, boundaries are equivalent to having your own rulebook; you get to let the other person know what is okay and what isn't. It can be physical boundaries, emotional boundaries and even financial boundaries. A partner who respects these boundaries instead of seeing them as hindrances is a green flag. They have higher emotional intelligence and clearly want to ensure that your needs and preferences are heard loud and clear. 7. Effective communication Communication is the secret ingredient of a healthy green flag relationship; it's what makes everything come together just right. If your partner is a communication wizard, you have hit the jackpot! They don't just listen; they actively listen with little nods and expressions cheering you all along. They will never leave you wondering what's on their mind -- clear, open and honest communication is their style. Hanging on to a conflict? No, not when you are dating a green flag. They're all about finding solutions and smoothing things over like pros. 8. Shared values Opposites attract but too many differences can disrupt the relationship's bliss. It is always considered best to find a partner with shared values and goals for a sense of alignment and unity in the relationship. A partner who shares your core beliefs, interests and aspirations is a green flag. With them, instead of trying to get on the same page, you can collaborate and work toward a future that reflects your shared vision and values. 9. Trustworthy Trust is like a cozy blanket; it gives you warmth and a sense of security. Now, imagine having a trustworthy partner. Life can be so easy when spent with a partner who never makes room for doubt and speculation. Your partner is a green flag if they are transparent about their actions and intentions and prioritise honesty. 10. Future talks If a partner is not shy about making plans, not just about the near future but even about five years down the line, they are in it for the long haul; that, my dear, is a definite green flag. It is an affirmation that they cherish you and plan on sticking by you. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The National Commission noted that if the policyholder wanted reinstatement, he should have made a written request and should have also cleared the premium till that date, but no such request had been made. Neeraj Kumar obtained a whole-life unit-linked insurance policy from PNB MetLife India. Under the policy called 'Met Smart Plus Policy', which Kumar purchased, his son was insured for Rs 1.75 crore. The policy had a term of 93 years for which the premium was Rs 5 lakh per annum. The policy commenced on September 27, 2007, and Kumar paid Rs 15 lakh over three years as premium. From the fourth year onwards (from 2010), he stopped paying the annual premium. On October 31, 2013, Kumar was informed that the policy had been terminated as the renewal premium had not been paid after September 27, 2010. He was paid Rs 13,91,553.54 as foreclosure proceeds. Kumar was surprised that the policy had been terminated without issuing any notice or an opportunity to apply for reinstatement. So, he filed a complaint before the National Commission seeking a direction to the insurer to continue the policy without demanding any more premium. He argued that a policy commencing at the age of 8 years with a term of 93 years with an annual premium of Rs 5 lakh was absurd as the policy would go beyond the life expectancy of the policyholder and the cumulative premium would exceed Rs 4.5 crore. The insurer argued that the terms of the policy provided for surrender or withdrawal benefits after three years, so the payment made was correct and in accordance with the terms of the policy. Kumar, on the other hand, claimed that merely because he failed to pay the premium, the policy could not be terminated without notice, as the policy conditions provided for reinstatement. He argued that the termination of the policy without notice was illegal and unjustified. The National Commission agreed with the insurer's explanation. It pointed out that the policy terms provided an option to surrender the policy for withdrawal benefits after three years. The National Commission further noted that if the policyholder wanted reinstatement, he should have made a written request and should have also cleared the premium till that date, but no such request had been made. The Commission observed that Kumar was not a lay consumer, but was well-educated and working as the chief executive of Jindal Saw, so he should have abided by the terms of the policy. However, having failed to do so, the Commission concluded that Kumar could not be allowed to claim a right to reinstatement of the policy. In its order of May 27, 2024, delivered by Justice A P Sahi, the National Commission noted that the annualised premium paid over three years was Rs 15 lakh, while the insurer had computed the gross surrender value at Rs 16,16,273.54 (Rs 2,24,720 deducted as surrender charge). Accordingly, it concluded that there was no merit in the complaint and dismissed it with the observation that the payment made by the insurer was correct and in consonance with the terms of the policy.

Are you struggling to manage work-related stress? How to deal with unrealistic expectations from parents and peers? rediffGURU Kanchan Rai , relationship coach and founder of Let Us Talk Foundation, urges you to talk about your problems so you can seek solutions and transform your life. Anonymous: Hello, I am a 43-year-old male with two kids, married for the last 13 years. My wife is very good at housework and takes care of my kids...she loves me a lot but mostly she shows us that she is doing us a favour by doing all this. Many times she stops talking and behaves like she doesn't care about anyone. If I ask something she replies rudely. I am fed up of all this behaviour. I do maximum efforts to make her happy but can't understand what is the issue with her. If I talk about her behaviour she blames me for everything. I want to be happy with my family, pls suggest. I'm sorry to hear about the struggles you're facing in your marriage. It sounds like despite your wife‚Äôs efforts in taking care of the household and the children, her behaviour is causing significant stress for you. Your wife's actions might be influenced by feeling overwhelmed or unappreciated. Managing the home and caring for the kids can be exhausting, and your wife might feel like her efforts go unnoticed. This can lead to frustration and the impression that she's doing everything as a favour, resulting in her becoming distant or irritable. Try to talk with her during a calm moment, expressing your concerns without placing blame. You might say, \"I've noticed you seem stressed lately. I want to understand how you're feeling and see how I can help.\" Listening to her and showing appreciation for her work can help alleviate some of her stress and improve your connection. If these conversations don't lead to improvement, consider seeking help from a professional counselor. They can facilitate better communication and help both of you address deeper issues. Your goal is a happy and supportive family environment. Working together with empathy and understanding can help you both move towards a more fulfilling relationship. If you continue to struggle, don't hesitate to reach out for support from professionals or loved ones. Your effort and commitment are crucial steps toward finding a solution. Anonymous: Dear Kanchan Mam, I have a very close friend who is been married for 10 years and with two kids -- an 8-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son. His wife whom he loved and trusted so much has cheated on him with one of her friends for almost three years which he came to know about recently. He could not digest that. He thought of divorcing her but thinking about his children's future he changed his mind and told her to end all communication with her affair partner. She too agreed. My friend didn't mention this to anyone including her parents whom he respects a lot because he didn't want to hurt them. But after three months he came to know that his wife is still in contact with her friend using another phone without his knowledge and her affair also has not stopped. This time he said he couldn't tolerate and told this to her parents and told them that he would be filing for divorce. Her parents are begging him not to do so and telling him to give her one last chance as they would mend her this time. He told them that even after giving her a chance to mend herself she had cheated him and broken his trust. He says he cannot live with her without trust. So he has decided to move on but his wife is telling him she will have no other choice but to commit suicide if he doesn't forgive her and has even threatened to commit suicide along with his children. She has attempted a couple of times too. My friend is in depression. He says he is also worried about his children's future without their mother. At the same time he says he cannot imagine living with his wife again as before after being cheated on twice...He is asking me for advice. I am totally confused. Kindly advise the pros and cons of 1. forgiving her once again and living in a trustless marriage and 2. moving on and finding someone more trustworthy. 3. If he decides to marry another person how will this impact his children? He is not interested in continuing with his wife but only for the sake of kids and because of his wife's and her mother's pressure he says he cannot initiate divorce proceedings. Kindly help me to advise my friend suitably. I understand how incredibly difficult this situation must be for your friend, and it's clear that he's grappling with some profound and painful decisions. Let's explore the potential paths he might take, keeping in mind the need for empathy and understanding for everyone involved. If your friend chooses to stay and forgive his wife again, it might provide immediate stability for the children. They would continue to have both parents in their daily lives, which can offer a sense of security and normalcy. However, it's essential to acknowledge the immense challenge of living in a relationship where trust has been deeply broken. Trust is fundamental to any healthy relationship, and without it, he might find himself constantly anxious and emotionally strained. This ongoing tension could create a stressful environment for both him and his children. If there's any hope for this path, it would require significant commitment to rebuilding trust and possibly professional counseling to navigate the healing process. Deciding to move on and possibly seek a new, trustworthy relationship could ultimately lead to a happier and healthier future for your friend. This path respects his emotional needs and acknowledges that rebuilding trust with his current partner may not be feasible. Moving on offers a chance to start anew and find fulfillment in a relationship built on mutual respect and honesty. However, divorce is a major life transition that will significantly affect the children. They'll need time and support to adapt to the changes in their family dynamics. This process can be emotionally and legally challenging, but it might be necessary for your friend to find peace and stability. His wife's threats are deeply concerning and must be taken seriously. Ensuring everyone's safety is paramount, and professional help may be needed to manage these threats. Introducing a new partner into his children's lives is a delicate process. Initially, they might feel confused or insecure about the changes. However, with careful handling and sensitivity, a new, loving relationship can eventually provide them with a positive and nurturing environment. It can show them that it's possible to overcome difficult circumstances and find happiness and stability again. Encouraging your friend to seek professional counseling can provide a safe space for him to process his emotions and support his children through these transitions. Consulting a lawyer will help him understand his rights and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect his and his children's safety, especially given his wife's threats. Leaning on trusted friends and family can offer much needed emotional support and practical advice. This is a time for him to draw on his community for strength and guidance. Your friend's priority should be the well-being of his children and his own emotional health. Whether he chooses to stay and work on rebuilding the marriage or decides to move on, it's crucial that he feels supported and safe in his decision. He doesn't have to face this alone, and with empathy, professional help, and the support of loved ones, he can navigate this challenging time and find a path forward that leads to peace and happiness. Being there for him as a compassionate friend during this time is invaluable. Your support and understanding can make a significant difference as he navigates these difficult choices. Harshita: I am a NEET aspirant in class 11 and I want to take a single room on rent for preparation because I don't want any disturbance but my family is not allowing me to do so because I am a girl and I can't live alone in the rented room. Also, they are not allowing me to join the hostel, and at home, I can't able to focus because of guests gathering in this relation, my parents said that I have to endure and live at home even though my home doesn't have a separate room for me. They said that we have a joint family and you can't tell someone not to come home. I don't know why it's really hard for me to prepare from home with so many distractions. I don't know what to do and I am frustrated because of this but they are not ready to listen because they think they are always correct. They never try to understand me. Dear Harshita, Best of luck with your exams! Balancing your preparation for such a demanding exam like NEET with the dynamics of living in a joint family can be incredibly tough, especially when you don‚Äôt have a quiet space to focus. Your desire to have a dedicated and peaceful study environment is completely understandable, and it's frustrating when you feel your needs aren't being acknowledged. NEET preparation requires a lot of concentration and consistency, and it's clear you're trying to set yourself up for success by seeking a quiet place to study. It seems your family's concerns are rooted in traditional views about safety and the roles of girls, which can be a difficult barrier to navigate. They want to protect you, but their protective instincts are clashing with your need for independence and a conducive study environment. It's also challenging because their stance seems inflexible, leaving you feeling unheard and unsupported. In situations like this, it can help to approach the conversation from a place of understanding. Try to express your needs calmly and clearly, showing that you understand their concerns but also need their support to achieve your goals. Perhaps you could propose a compromise, such as finding a nearby library or study centre where you can go daily, which might address their safety concerns while providing you with the quiet space you need. Another approach could be suggesting study times at home when the house is quieter, or discussing with family members the importance of creating a study-friendly environment for you. Sometimes, explaining how critical this phase is for your future might help them see the importance of supporting your study needs. It's also essential to manage your frustration and stress levels. Finding small moments of peace, practicing relaxation techniques, or even reaching out to friends who are supportive can provide some emotional relief. Remember, you're striving for something significant, and your determination is commendable. Continue to seek ways to communicate effectively with your family and look for any potential middle ground that can help you focus on your studies while respecting their concerns.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Purchase health insurance at an early age, before you incur a disease, as this makes access to health insurance difficult and raises the premium significantly. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) issued a master circular on health insurance on May 29, 2024, listing 20 provisions. These norms, if properly implemented, will make health insurance simpler, more accessible, and a reliable instrument for protecting customers' interests. \"The master circular encourages insurers to adopt customer-centric policies. This can positively impact insurance penetration,\" says S Prakash, managing director/chief executive officer designate, Galaxy Health and Allied Insurance. \"It will lead to a UPI-like movement -- deeper penetration and higher adoption--within the health insurance ecosystem,\" adds Prakash. Proportionate refund of premiums Previously, if a customer purchased a health insurance policy and decided to discontinue it during the policy term, she would receive a refund based on a 'short-premium scale'. For example, if s/he had used the policy for three months, the insurer would deduct six months of premium. If s/he had used it for six months, the insurer would deduct nine months' premium, and so on. Now, after the free-look period of 30 days, a customer can cancel the policy with a seven-day notice and get a proportionate premium back, unless she has made a claim. \"The insurer will only deduct the premium for the period for which the policy was used. This change provides greater flexibility to people who wish to discontinue their policy,\" says Kapil Mehta, co-founder, SecureNow. Reduction in moratorium period The moratorium period has been reduced from eight years to five. Previously, after eight years, an insurer could not deny a claim except in case of an established fraud. \"This means claim payment will become assured sooner,\" says Mehta. Prospective customers should not turn complacent. \"While purchasing a policy, declare your medical history, current health status, and lifestyle habits ( like smoking ) comprehensively,\" says Siddharth Singhal, business head-health insurance, Policybazaar.com. Cashless approval within an hour The regulator wants insurers to achieve 100 per cent cashless claim settlement and minimise settlement through reimbursement. The request for cashless authorisation must be decided immediately or within one hour. Insurers must set up helpdesks at hospitals and provide pre-authorisation via digital modes. They must put the necessary systems in place by July 31, 2024. \"The regulator's emphasis on shifting 100 per cent claims to cashless settlement will ease policyholders' financial burden,\" says Naval Goel, CEO, PolicyX. Cashless treatment is available only at network hospitals. \"Verify if your preferred hospitals are in the insurer's network and understand the cashless claim process to avoid last-minute issues,\" says Pooja Yadav, chief product officer, Zuno General Insurance. Discharge within three hours Patients have often been held up at the hospital for hours after discharge because the insurer had not settled their bill. Some have incurred additional costs for spending an extra night at the hospital. The regulator has mandated that if there is any delay beyond three hours, the insurer must bear the additional cost. \"In the future, if there is any delay from the insurer's side, do not pay the additional waiting charges,\" says Goel. Coverage for high-tech treatments The regulator has urged insurers to cover high-tech treatments hospitals are adopting. \"Health outcomes are improved by including coverage for procedures such as robotic surgeries, oral chemotherapy, and stem cell therapy,\" says Rakesh Jain, CEO, Reliance General Insurance. While many policies cover high-tech treatments, some have sub-limits for them. Jain says customers should review their policy carefully and remain informed about the specifics of the coverage offered by it. If your policy does not fully cover such treatments, consider porting. Points customers must pay heed to While the master circular sets many laudable goals, like making policies more inclusive, customers need to watch out for a few things. For many -- senior citizens, those with pre-existing diseases (PEDs), etc -- while policies may be available, they may be expensive. Purchase health insurance at an early age, before you incur a disease, as this makes access to health insurance difficult and raises the premium significantly. While the master circular urges insurers to offer a wide variety of policies, customers on their part must make appropriate choices. \"Consider your family conditions and choose insurance features such as OPD (out-patient department) coverage, maternity benefits (if planning for a family), global coverage for frequent travellers, and modern treatment coverage,\" says Jain. Utilise the enhancement in free-look period from 15 to 30 days. \"Read the policy document thoroughly, focusing on terms and conditions, exclusions, waiting periods, and coverage limits to ensure the policy meets your needs,\" says Yadav. Goel suggests not buying policies from insurers who do not offer no-claim bonuses as these bonuses are useful in combating medical inflation. \"Avoid plans with sub-limits related to modern treatments, room categories, or diseases,\" says Singhal. Claims using multiple policies Policyholders with multiple policies can choose which one to use (that insurer becomes primary insurer). If the hospital bill exceeds the sum insured of the first policy, primary insurer shall coordinate with other insurers to settle balance amount Impact : Claim settlement likely to become easier for customers with multiple policies Customer information sheet Aims to provide key information about policy at one place Impact : Customers won't have to go through scores of pages of fine print Ombudsman's award Insurers must comply with ombudsman's award within 30 days, or they will be liable for a penalty of Rs 5,000 per day Impact : Insurers likely to comply with greater alacrity Feature Presentation: Ashish Narsale/ Rediff.com To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Politicians from the Left and the Congress party in Kerala have rallied behind Malayalam superstar Mammootty, who is facing online harassment from certain right wing sympathisers in connection with his 2022 film, Puzhu . Certain posts on social media platforms claimed that the movie was anti-Brahmanical. Some of them even used Mammootty's birth name, Muhammed Kutty, to criticise the National Award-winning actor. The row erupted following a recent interview given by the debutante director Ratheena P T's husband to an online channel, where he claimed that the movie was against a particular community and criticised Mammootty for doing the film. Rubbishing the social media campaign against the actor, several persons, including state Ministers V Sivankutty and K Rajan and Congress General Secretary K C Venugopal came out in support of Mammootty. 'Mammootty,' General Education Minister V Sivankutty said, 'is Malayalees' pride' in a Facebook post. CPI leader and Revenue Minister K Rajan described Mammootty as the 'Pride of Kerala and Malayalees'. The minister alleged that 'Sangh Parivar politics' was behind the campaigns and said that such propaganda would not reap its desired results in the state. 'This is Kerala,' he pointed out to those behind the campaign. Recalling a similar campaign unleashed against director Kamal some time ago, the minister said, 'The Sanghi politics of calling Mammootty as Mohammed Kutty, Kamal as Kamaluddin and Vijay as Joseph Vijay will not reap any result here.' Sharing similar views, Congress General Secretary K C Venugopal also strongly supported Mammootty and said the secular society of the state would not support such propaganda. No matter how hard they try to brand a person who has clear political views and acting skills, Venugopal said the people of the state won't support them. In an FB post, the Congress leader added that it is the duty of Kerala society to take care of the actor without being affected by the 'poison of hate campaigns'. A person like Mammootty cannot be confined to the compartments of religion and caste, he said, adding that vested interests are doing so with a clear political agenda. 'Mammootty is Mohammed Kutty only in the contemptuous minds of those hate campaigners,' Venugopal added. The actor is yet to react to the controversy.

Malayalam director Sanal Kumar Sasidharan, whose 2014 film Sexy Durga created a stir, is now trying to release his film, Vazhakku . Sanal claims that the film's leading man Thomas Tovino is obstructing the release. Tovino has vehemently denied this, arguing that it would be in his interest to release Vazhakku as he is the producer. When Subhash K Jha caught up with Sanal in the US, he said he had given up film-making and left the country. \"I stopped making films some years ago. My last film was Vazhakku , which is in the news for all the wrong reasons,\" he says. Why did Sanal take such a drastic decision? \"Too many threats. If I had continued staying in Kerala and making films, I would have probably lost my life. I was being threatened from all mediums possible. For the past few years, I live in the US. I am no longer a film-maker.\" Sanal, whose Sexy Durga was a chilling film on sexual harassment, was accused of the same crime. \"A false sexual harassment accusation was made against me. I was arrested. That's when I decided to leave the country. You will be surprised to know that two years have passed, and no case has been registered against me. No legal procedure, nothing.\" Sanal says. Sanal blames Tovino for Vazhakku getting stuck. \"Tovino Thomas feels it will harm his career. If he felt this way, why did he do this film with me?\" Sanal uploaded the entire film on Vimeo and shared the link on his Facebook page, and captioned it: 'Cinema should be viewed by the audience. For anyone who wants to watch it, here is Vazhakku ( The Quarrel ). You will understand now why the movie hasn't been released.' The film has been taken down from the Web site.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'There is no cringe shot in the film which could give me a sleepless night.' Janhvi Kapoor says her sport drama Mr & Mrs Mahi is a hat tip to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, whose statement from a media event served as an inspiration for the film. Directed by Sharan Sharma ( Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl ), the movie features Janhvi and Rajkummar Rao as the titular couple: Mahendra, a former cricketer, and Mahima, a doctor. After Mahendra spots the cricketing talent in his wife, he encourages her to chase her dream and becomes her coach. \"He ( Dhoni ) gave an interview where he said, 'It's not about the result but about the process. If you do your process with honesty and hard work, the result will be seen at the end and even if you fail, it doesn't matter.' This film is made on that line. I hope we honour his philosophy,\" Janhvi told reporters at the launch event of the film's song Dekha Tenu . Hitesh Harisinghani/ Rediff.com and Afsar Dayatar/ Rediff.com bring back interesting moments from the launch. Rao, who earlier collaborated with Janhvi for the 2021 horror comedy Roohi , said he believes there is a lot to learn from Dhoni. \"True sportsman spirit is visible in him a lot. He is humble and grounded, kind hearted, it shows in his aura. He is such a big legend and the way he conducts himself, there is a lot to learn from him,\" the actor said, adding that the team wants to show the film to the cricketer and his wife, Sakshi. For Kapoor, learning cricket for Mr & Mrs Mahi turned out to be a herculean task as she suffered a lot of injuries during the process. \"A lot of hard work has gone into it. I trained for almost two years. I started training while promoting Mili . Our director is a purist and works with a lot of honesty, so he wanted me to become a cricketer for the film. He didn't want to use VFX or do anything halfheartedly. \"I suffered a lot of injuries as well. While prepping, both my shoulders were dislocated. But I'd like to give all the credit to him, the director, and both my coaches Abhishek Nayar and Vikrant sir who have done a lot of hard work and held my hand at every turn,\" she said. Sharan Sharma praised Janhvi for her dedication and pushing the envelope with the sports drama. \"I think I pushed her very hard to achieve the cricket level we needed for this film. There is no cringe shot in the film which could give me a sleepless night. We pushed her very hard and she endured the torture. The cricket fan in me is thrilled with what she has done in the film,\" he added. On collaborating with Rao for the first time, the film-maker said he is a \"lethal actor\". \"He has the hunger of a first timer and the skills of a legend which is a rare combination. I am only blessed that I got to work with Raj on my second film. It's fair to say he is one of the greatest actors of all time in India,\" he said. The song Dekha Tenu is derived from a stanza from the hit song Shava Shava from Karan Johar's Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham . The track is composed by Jaani and sung by music reality show winner Mohammad Faiz. The song is shot in picturesque locales in Jaipur, showcasing the couple's wedding sequence in the film. Showing his love for the track, RajKummar said, \" Dekhha Tenu is a beautiful song. I've grown up listening to it, and so it holds a special place in my heart. It comes at a crucial and sweet juncture in the film and I am happy that it's finally out for everyone to listen to.\" Janhvi said that Dekha Tenu resonates deeply with her. \"It has a nostalgic charm with a beautiful rendition. Featuring in this timeless gem feels like a full-circle moment for me and my heart is filled with gratitude. It's an important part of our love story in the film and I can't wait for everyone to experience it,\" she said. Mohammad Faiz, the singer, expressed his gratitude for getting the opportunity to recreate the verse. \"It has been a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me. This marks my debut song in Bollywood and the excitement is overwhelming. Being part of such a special film is a wonderful opportunity for me and I am truly grateful for it. \"Preparing this song for Rajkummar Rao and Janhvi Kapoor, alongside working with Jaani, has been nothing short of a dream come true. I am hoping that everyone resonates with the song and gives it the same love that we had while creating it,\" he said. Lyricist-Composer Jaani added, \"It's amazing to see the love people are already pouring in for Dekhha Tenu just after watching a small glimpse of it. It's such an iconic verse, and we wanted to live up to that legacy while ensuring that the new version is as beautiful and unique as the older one. \"The journey of composing this song has been exciting, and I truly believe that Mohammad Faiz has done an exceptional job singing it.\" Produced by Zee Studios and Dharma Productions, Mr & Mrs Mahi releaseS in theatres on May 31.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Given that Twelve Final Days doesn't really delve into the genesis of Roger Federer, the ups and downs of his career, the assumption is that it is meant for people who are already familiar with his work, observes Deepti Patwardhan. Late in the documentary, amidst the 2022 Laver Cup frenzy, Roger Federer's long-time coach and friend Severin Luthi remarks, 'You know what they say, sports people die twice.' It is the dying moments of Federer the athlete, who once seemed immortal, that Asif Kapadia's documentary Twelve Final Days , addresses. Not surprisingly, the documentary reels you in with footage of Federer's most stunning shots. In that, he could not have found a better muse. We could all happily just watch hours and hours of the Swiss turn tennis into art, with the most elegant, fluid strokes. Peak Federer, untouched by time. But then, it jerks you into reality, takes you to a place where the 20-time Grand Slam champion is preparing to record his retirement note. When Federer bid, in his own voice, a fond farewell to tennis. The one we heard a few days later, on September 15, 2022, in stunned silence. That may be the film's biggest failing. Given that the movie doesn't really delve into the genesis of the champion, the ups and downs of his career, the assumption is that it is meant for people who are already familiar with Federer's work. But the movie seldom tells us much about the last few days of his athletic career, that we hadn't already seen, heard or experienced before. There is much of the same for the die-hard Federer or tennis fans, and not enough for the others. Federer's has been one of the most documented careers ever. He was a master of masking emotion on the court but the Swiss never failed to give an insight into how he felt in the post-match analysis. Whether he was happy or sad or hurt or miffed or just genuinely proud of himself, Federer usually laid it all out. There are some attempts to add context to the retirement saga, like the interactions with his family. His wife, Mirka, a former tennis player herself, makes a rare appearance, as do his parents and four children. There is a lot of tearing up, from Federer, from his family, his rivals, his team, his fans, but very little raw emotion. At least, nothing that hasn't already been captured on film before. The second half of the movie looks like an extended cut of the 2022 Laver Cup, Federer's final tournament as an active player, with his media interactions in London around that time and official press conferences thrown in for good measure. But anything Federer touches can't be all bad. Right? The 20-time Grand Slam champion has been the best advertisement and the most eloquent spokesperson for the sport. He does sprinkle some gold dust through the movie with his insights into the sport -- a confluence of boxing and chess, his own game and also into his rivalries. It is baffling to many how the guy has so much time and grace -- in his career and in the documentary -- for those who have stolen glory from him. On the tennis court, Federer was all about the effortless beauty. When Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic burst onto the stage, their searing intensity was blinding. Their chase-every-ball-like-life-depended-on-it game threw some shade on Federer‚Äôs easy style. 'It was something for which I was criticised heavily,' he says of the time Nadal and Djokovic loosened his grip on men's tennis. 'Why didn't I fight more when losing? I didn't quite understand what that meant. Do I have to grunt? Do I have to sweat? Do I have to shout more? Do I have to be more aggressive towards my opponents? I tried but it was all an act.' The documentary spends considerable time on the dynamics of Federer's rivalry with Nadal and with Djokovic. And rightly so. Federer may have kicked off the greatest generation in men's tennis but it took Nadal and Djokovic's undying spirit to make it what it was. The setting of the finale is the Laver Cup, a team tournament conceived by Federer to honour tennis legend Rod Laver and one that provided a fitting platform for his farewell in 2022. As the action shifts there, it becomes clear why the Swiss ended up as one of the most loved sportspeople. Even though every conversation, be it with fans or with his heroes like Laver and Bjorn Borg, carries the under-current of his impending retirement, Federer carries on being funny and curious and personable. For years, he was the glue that held tennis-bringing players and fans of different countries, cultures and generations together. His farewell ended up being a celebration of not just Federer's career, but that of the sport and some of its best practitioners, past, present and future. His final match, a doubles match with Rafael Nadal as his partner on September 24, 2022, and the ceremony and speeches after were a tearjerker then, and are a tearjerker now. While Federer was always a crier, watching strongmen Nadal and Djokovic weep for a part of their career and life they were saying goodbye to was extraordinary. Humanity of super athletes rarely fails to move. And that's what Federer, Kapadia and everyone involved in the making of Twelve Final Days , will be banking on to make it a success. Twelve Final Days streams on Amazon Prime Video. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) Ishq Vishk Rebound is a drab romance and dull comedy that even the intended teen audience might have a hard time keeping up with, sighs Mayur Sanap. Years ago, when Shah Rukh Khan's Rahul from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai asserted, ' Pyaar dosti hai ', his words struck a chord with the audience. In Ishq Vishk Rebound , the same relationship dynamic is revisited with a contemporary update. A follow-up to the 2003 romantic-comedy Ishq Vishk , this bubblegum romance is a relationship drama that finds comfort in its gloss and stylishness without any emotional resonance beneath. The story is centred around childhood besties, Sanya (Pashmina Roshan), Sahir (Jibraan Khan) and Raghav (Rohit Saraf). Sanya and Sahir are dating each other. Raghav starts seeing his collegemate Riya (Naila Grrewal). Things take a turn when Sanya and Sahir break up, which somehow strains Raghav's relationship with Riya. Sanya finds comfort in Raghav, and while nursing her broken heart, they fall in love with each other. This complicated dynamic sets the course of the relationship for all four. Actually, forget about explaining the plot because it's virtually non-existent. Director Nipun Dharmadhikari, working on the script by Vaishali Naik, Vinay Chhawal, Ketan Pedgaonkar, delivers a sluggish and mostly incoherent endeavour that doesn't contain much. The characters are cardboard cut-outs, their personalities turn 180 degrees at any second, and the equation they have with each other is so vapid. Childhood sweethearts? What bond of super-cement was holding these people together, you wonder. The music, which is positioned as the selling point of the film, feels dated with visual aesthetics inspired from a Dharma film. It is only Milind Jog's camerawork that adds freshness to the frames as he captures pretty locales of Dehradun. Out of the four leads, Rohit Saraf is having most fun in his role and he has charming enough screen presence to lift a scene, even though his Fleabag -style fourth wall-breaking and talking to the camera feels jarring. Pashmina, in her debut outing, is afforded with the showiest role of the film. Her Sanya has a perky persona with a self-absorbed, obnoxious attitude and yet, there's a sweet quality about her. But Pashmina lacks the charisma or necessary acting chops to get through the task. Naila Grrewal and Jibraan Khan get short-changed by the script that leaves them sinfully under-utilised. They are initially positioned as significant but are in fact, marginal to the proceedings (Naila is even forgotten in the climax). Veterans Supriya Pilgaonkar and Sheeba Chaddha show up in scenes that attempt to infuse some wisdom into this fluff but it's all just random hokum making up for superficial interactions between the characters. Ishq Vishk Rebound mindlessly bounces from one scene to another without ever finding a rhythm to settle into. The result is a drab romance and dull comedy that even the intended teen audience might have a hard time keeping up with. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) The new season takes the students out of their preoccupation with studies to other problems -- jealousy of another's easy success, a blip in a romance, financial crunch, meltdowns, discovers Deepa Gahlot. When the first season of Kota Factory came out in 2019, it brought the Rajasthan city to the notice of audiences, who may not have been aware of the intense competition and soul-crushing slog that goes into the preparation for entrance exams of elite engineering and medical courses. Getting in means success and financial stability for the whole family. The flip side is the fear of failure that has led to an inordinately high number of suicides among the coaching class students of Kota. Subsequently, this grim reality of youngsters cracking under the pressure of expectations and shattering of dreams has been making it to the news. The solutions, like locking terraces or putting springs in fans, hardly tackle the actual core of the issue: The shortcoming of the Indian education system. TVF's Web series went into the classrooms and hostel digs of Kota but sanitised the air of anxiety that must permeate the walls of the commercial coaching classes for whom topping exams is more important than the mental or spiritual health of the students. Then there was Jeetu bhaiya (Jitendra Kumar), who was different: The popular physics teacher, with an aphorism for every crisis. It was in Season 2 that a suicide occurred and in Season 3, directed by Pratish Mehta, that Jeetu bhaiya is assailed by self-doubt (and recurring mould on his walls) that leads to therapy. The star teacher of Kota had, in the last season, started his own institute called Aimers because he always told his students not to dream but to aim, as dreams are just seen but aims are meant to be achieved. In Kota Factory Season 3 , also in black and white like the earlier two, the same core group of students returns, to carry forward the plot from coaching to the make-or-break exam. The fine bunch of actors include Vaibhav (Mayur More), Balmukund Meena (Ranjan Raj), Uday (Alam Khan), Vartika (Revathi Pillai) and Shivani (Ahsaas Channa). A new character is added in the form of Pooja didi (Tillotama Shome), whose approach to teaching is like Jeetu bhaiya 's -- make the kids feel for the subject, not just pass. The new season takes them out of their preoccupation with studies to other problems -- jealousy of another's easy success, a blip in a romance, financial crunch, meltdowns -- but the focus shifts from the students to Jeetu bhaiya 's angst (which gives the actor more performance challenges). He becomes aware that he takes on too much of the emotional burden of the students, trying to be the balm for everyone's bruises, and something's got to give. Meanwhile, reality gets darker, the education system more toxic, its purveyors more avaricious. Jeetu bhaiya may fly off the handle when a colleague (Rajesh Kumar) suggests that they focus on the brightest students but even to his own ears, his words about making the effort regardless of the results sound hollow. Because the coaching classes of Kota and the town itself flourishes because it promises toppers. The students, often seen like ants scurrying about in top shots, are just fuel for the money-making machine. The real achievement of Kota Factory is that it inspired other shows ( Crash Course, Shiksha Mandal ) and films ( 12th Fail, All India Rank ) to bring attention to the atrocities of the education system in which aptitude comes last.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'Love in today's time is very fast paced, whereas I seek calmness in love.' Once the cherubic face who charmed audiences as Krish, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol's son in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham , Jibraan Khan is now set to step into the spotlight once more, this time as the leading man in the rom-com Ishq Vishk Rebound . His journey from child artist to adult actor has not been easy. It's filled with hundreds of auditions and multiple rejections. \"My struggle has taught me a lot of things but I am happy with what is happening today and whatever is going to happen ahead in my life,\" Jibraan tells Rediff.com Contributor Mohnish Singh . The trailer and songs of your debut film as an adult have been generating buzz, especially among youngsters. How does it make you feel? It's a feeling that I cannot describe in words. I waited for years to bag a film of this scale to make my debut with. We are so blessed to be working with a production house like Tips Films, with our producers Ramesh Taurani and Jaya Taurani. Our director ( Nipun Dharmadhikari ) is fantastic. The icing on the cake is this kind of reaction that we are getting for the film's music. When I wake up in the morning and see this love coming my way, it overwhelms me. It also motivates me to work even harder in future. I hope we get the same amount of love when our film releases in cinemas on June 21. What are your memories of the original Ishq Vishk ? I was eight when the film released. I clearly remember that I, along with my sister and her friends, went to Chandan cinema in Juhu ( north west Mumbai ) to watch the film. When I came out of the theatre, I was singing the title track, Ishq Vishk . The entire cast of the film was fresh and so was its album. I would say Ishq Vishk was a breath of fresh air at that time. The makers and Rochak ( Kohli, music director ) have tried to come up with a fantastic soundtrack this time around as well. How is Ishq Vishk Rebound similar to Ishq Vishk ? There is nothing common between the two films story-wise. Our story is new, our characters are new. The only common thing, I would say, is that Ishq Vishk had a fresh cast and incredible music. Our film also has a fresh cast and great music. Another similarity would be the confusion around love. See, love is the same but its meaning has changed over the years and that we have tried to show in this film as well. Additionally, you will see emphasis on friendship and the importance of family. How challenging has your journey been from child actor to leading a big banner like this? The answer to this question is long but I would say that it has been very, very tough. Every actor's journey is different and difficult. I cannot say that it's easy for some actors and difficult for others. But when I talk to you, the press, go out for promotions, see my face on hoardings and amid all of this, someone walking up to me and asking for a selfie, all those memories of my struggles evaporate. The journey was difficult, of course, but when I see the present, it's worth it. My struggle has taught me a lot of things but I am happy with what is happening today and whatever is going to happen ahead in my life. Was it the first film you auditioned for as an adult actor? No, no, not at all. I have auditioned a lot in my life like any other actor and have been rejected. I have said no to scripts as well. This was one film where I felt when I left the audition room only that yeh mil jaye to mazaa aa jaye because the title has a great recall value. Additionally, our producers are very prominent. They make hit films and always deliver good music. How do you see love? Love is all about simplicity. When I reach home, I want peace, happiness, and, of course, a lot of fun. I fear unnecessary, irrelevant questioning which maybe stems from insecurity. I believe that love in today's time is very fast paced, whereas I seek calmness in love. I am a little old school type, so I believe in simplicity and calmness in love. Do you think social media has complicated love? Yes, but it is a tool that you can use the right way also. See, love has been different in every generation. It was different when our parents were young. Love was then about a phone call, a trunk call. Then it came to e-mails. Now, it's about right and left swipes. Love keeps evolving, but that simplicity has gone somewhere. Did the fact that it's not a solo-hero film and that you are sharing screen space with three other actors bother you? All of us read the script before signing the contract, so we knew who was doing what in the film. It's a film about four young people. At the end of the day, what truly matters is that what your story is trying to say. It's extremely hard to bring audiences to theatres in the age of OTT. Does that scare you as a newcomer? See, no actor or producer is trying to make a bad product. We put our hearts and souls into making a film thinking the audience is going to love it. Come June 21 and the fate of our film would be in audiences' hands. I don't know how they are going to react. I can just pray that they love it. Everyone comes with that belief that, you know, it will be accepted. Yes, I am nervous ( laughs ). But I also strongly believe that we have made something solid.

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) 'The earlier you get your treatment done, the better the chance of recovery.' Singing legend Alka Yagnik shared heart-breaking news this week when she announced that she suffered from a rare sensory neural nerve hearing loss due to a viral attack. Just what does that mean and what causes it? More importantly, how can we avoid it? Dr Suresh Singh Naruka , Senior Consultant, ENT, at Apollo Hospital, Delhi, has been treating patients for 15 years and does a quick FAQ with Ronjita Kulkarni/ Rediff.com , advising, \"Never use your amplification hearing devices like headphones and Bluetooth for more than half an hour in one go and try to moderate the intensity. It should not be 90 or 100 decibels. If you want to enjoy your music, 45-50 decibels is fine.\" What does Sensory Neural Nerve Hearing Loss mean? The ear serves two functions. One is to make ourselves hear the world, and the second is to maintain balance. So we stand, sit and we walk because of our eyes, our ears and our joints. Like other organs can lose their functions, the ear can also lose their functions. Sudden hearing loss means the functional capacity of ear goes off all of sudden. The ear has three components: The outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer and middle ear serve transfer the sound from the environment to the inner ear. The inner ear has some hair like cells, which transfer the sound by making them into signals to the brain. This is how we hear. Now if these hair cells lose their function, we cannot hear. This is what we understand as hearing loss. Hearing loss is bilateral or unilateral, which means either both ears or it can affect only one ear. Sometimes, the ear can lose function but not completely. So the hearing loss is not 100 percent. One can have a partial sudden hearing loss too. Sensory Neural Hearing Loss means the inner ear is not functioning. What are the reasons for this? There are two types. One is idiopathic, which means we don't know the reason. Majority cases are in this category. In the second, it's a known cause. These known causes can be sound trauma, viral infection, bacterial infection like meningitis and trauma. Sometimes we can have sudden hearing loss because of tumors. In her post, Alka Yagnik cautioned against loud music and headphones. Is that also a cause? Yes. In medical science, we understand these situations as noise trauma. If there is a sudden blast or if you go to a ( night ) club where there is loud music of 100 decibels and if you expose yourself to that for more than 30 minutes, you may get sudden hearing loss. Is this age-related? Sudden hearing loss is not age-related. Gradual hearing loss is age-related. Nerves start aging like the other parts of the body. Diabetes, chronic diseases, liver disease and blood pressure can make the nerve age faster. But sudden hearing loss can happen at any age. We have seen kids with sudden hearing loss. What are the symptoms for Sensory Neural Nerve Hearing Loss? Sudden hearing loss itself is the symptom. Sometimes, sudden hearing loss is associated with dizziness or imbalance because the other purpose of the ear -- balance -- may also get compromised. They may also feel vertigo and vomiting, but not always. What is the treatment for this? Again, there are two types. If the cause is known, the treatment becomes a little easier. You have to remove the cause. Like if it is a bacterial infection, you remove the bacterial infection and you can get your hearing back. If it is a tumour, you remove the tumour, and you can get your hearing back. But the most important factor in idiopathic hearing loss is time. The earlier you get your treatment done, the better the chance of recovery. Like, if you have any organ failure, if you reach hospital faster, the chances of your survival or your organ survival is better. The same goes for the ear. If you have sudden hearing loss, and you reach hospital in one hour, you will get better chances of recovery. If you will reach in one day, you will have more chances of recovery, but not as good as one hour. So time is very important. For treatment, we use an audiogram to check the hearing. We do an MRI to check for tumours. We sometimes do impedance audiometry to identify hearing problems. We check your blood sugar and do a thorough check on any other illness you have. We can start giving steroids through the intra-tympanic route. There is a window in the ear, the round window, through which we can introduce steroid drugs into your inner ear and hyperbaric oxygen. Oxygen can sometimes revive your organs. What are the precautions against this condition? Avoid noise pollution. Whenever you are having fever for a long time, correct your fever because in some cases like viral fever, one can have hearing loss. Avoid the use of ear buds. Avoid listening to loud music. Of course, other things like avoid smoking and alcohol, blood pressure is bad, uncontrolled sugar is bad. We all know that we should take care of these things. You mentioned ear buds. Can you please elaborate? Ear buds are not to clean ears. The purpose of ear buds is to apply ointment but mistakenly, we use ear buds for cleaning ears. We don't know what is inside our ears. We use ear buds blindly. Suppose if our ears have some structural abnormalities, it can be damaged with ear buds. A blind procedure by using ear buds for ear cleaning is not advisable and sometimes, can be dangerous. Sometimes, you can also stimulate a nerve which can stop the heart from functioning. You can have syncope and be unconscious for a few seconds because the nerve which supplies the eardrum is also supplying the heart. To stimulate your nerve from your ear can stop your heart to function for a few seconds. So if you are on a flight of stairs at that time, you can fall down and have other injuries too. Would you say this condition is common in your experience? See, it's not uncommon. Being an ENT, working in Apollo Hospital, Delhi, we see such patients weekly, especially the youth, who use hearing amplification devices like headphones or Bluetooth too often. It will be disastrous if we keep up the noise pollution, for our ears, for society... You know, noise is not good for animals too. If it can impact animal behaviour, it is impacting our behaviour too. If you are habitual of using headphones all the time, the social interaction is becoming less and it's impacting our behaviour. If you're listening to music or watching movies or videos all the time on your headphones, you are on your own. How will you bond with the others around you? So for the future, this is not something we recommend. What advice would you give our readers? Get a routine check-up of your ears annually. Never use your amplification hearing devices like headphones and Bluetooth for more than half an hour in one go and try to moderate the intensity. It should not be 90 or 100 decibels. If you want to enjoy your music, 45-50 decibels is fine. We should not involve ourselves in activities which include loud sounds for a long time as are troubling your ear as well as your brain. Like, if we are going to a ( night ) club, we should not be inside for more than an hour. Try to come out after 30 minutes, so you can relax your ears so that they are ready to bear that noise trauma again. If you are in a club for a long time, it is not good for your ears. We should not use ear buds to clean our ears. You can introduce infection. You can even traumatise your eardrum. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

As Mani Ratnam's Raavan completes 14 years in June, its star Abhishek Bachchan goes back in time to remembers shooting for the film in the jungles along with his wife, Aishwarya Rai. \" Raavan was the most challenging experience of my life, physically and emotionally. It sapped me in every way,\" Abhishek tells Subhash K Jha . How do you recall the Raavan experience? With tremendous love affection and fondness. It was my third film with Mani Ratnam. I can't wait to work with him again. You haven't worked with Aishwarya since Raavan . We are dying to. We are just waiting for the right script. Shooting in the jungles, weren't you concerned about Aishwarya's safety? I am a normal man and a normal husband. I was definitely concerned for my wife's well being and she was equally concerned about me. I believe she was up to any risk that the role demanded? Oh, she's very, very strong. But Mani wouldn't allow her to do anything that was unsafe. Speaking for myself, it was great fun. Ask any of Mani's actors. They'll tell you they're willing to do anything he asks them to. Was Raavan a challenge due to the gruelling jungle locations? Raavan is the most difficult film I've ever done. It offered me my most challenging role to date. It was deeply challenging for Aishwarya and me because we shot in the jungles under the most severe conditions. Finally, it was worth it. How do you rate your performance in Raavan ? I can't say I'm satisfied. When I saw the film recently, I realised there is so much more I could have done with my role. Given the opportunity, I'd do Raavan all over again, and a lot more. Raavan was your third and by far, the toughest film with the magical Mani Ratnam. I believe Raavan is even more magical than Yuva and Guru . It's territory that neither of us had ever visited. I believe it's Mani's most massy film to date. You know it's funny, but because Mani has a fantastic aesthetic sense and he's constantly raising the bar with every film of his, it is believed that his films are high art meant for a select audience. But Mani is for the masses. How was your rapport with Mani during Raavan ? I go by his judgement and believe he knows best. Our relationship goes beyond films. I would want to work with him a fourth time. The entire industry wants to work with him. Raavan wrenched you away from your comfort zone. To shoot in the jungles wasn't easy. But why do a film unless it challenges you to go beyond your comfort zone? I've always done films that remove me from the comfort zone and put me in a place I've never been before. That's one of the main criteria for choosing a role. Focusing on the emotions of your character Beera while doing those heart-in-the-mouth stunts couldn't have been easy. That was a double challenge. First, I was doing a role that required me to perform the most challenging physical activities. Then I also had to emote in ways that I had never done. And one couldn't be compromised for the other. It was very difficult but the pain was worth it. Mani allowed me to watch the film as it was being shot. I knew it was something very, very special. Did shooting in the jungles bring you closer to nature? It couldn't get any more natural... we were in the jungles with the animals, insects, waterfalls, rain and nature for months. It was Mother Nature in all her glory. I've always been very eco-conscious but this experience changed my life. How was it working with Vikram? I've known Vikram for a very long time. He's a very sweet chap. I take it as a compliment when co-stars enjoy working with me. Making a film should be as much fun as watching it. Closing thoughts? Raavan was the most challenging experience of my life, physically and emotionally. It sapped me in every way. I was really anxious about Raavan . Mani, Aishwarya and I had to go beyond Guru , which is one of my favourite films. I knew Raavan could do it. I'm very proud of the film. I know everyone has given sweat and blood to it. It was a lot of hard work. To get such articles in your inbox More from rediff"

    "article_content": "NewsApp (Free) It's been a weird year when it comes to box office performances. Most movies are doing half the business of what they would have during pre-pandemic, and it's getting increasingly tough to attract audiences to theatres. When even star-driven films are struggling, one can well imagine how it must be for a film like Ishq Vishk Rebound , which has new faces. From that point of view, it did a fair business of Rs 1.20 crore (12 million) on Friday. The number is not big but then expectations were not big either, and the makers relied on the music to do the trick. This is what pushed the audiences to some extent. The collections stayed under the Rs 2 crore (Rs 20 million) mark on Saturday and Sunday, as a result of which the weekend score was Rs 4.40 crore (Rs 44 million). Ideally, a film of this scale and size should look at collections in the whereabouts of 1 crore (Rs 10 million) during the weekdays. But that would have happened if Rs 2 crore (Rs 20 million) had been breached on both Saturday and Sunday. Since that hasn't happened, the film could get into the Rs 75 lakh to Rs 90 lakh (Rs 7.5 million to Rs 9 million) range on Monday and hope to sustain until Kalki 2898 AD arrives on Thursday.

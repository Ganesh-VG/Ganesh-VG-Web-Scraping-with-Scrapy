    "article_content": "The Financial Express In the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, Visakhapatnam is a port city and industrial center, on the Bay of Bengal. In short, known as Vizag, the city is known for its love for silver. The rate of silver here (like in any other city in India) depends on the demand and supply of the metal. It also depends on the use of the white precious metal in several domains such as industries, photography, silverware, jewelry, and coins among others. Interestingly, demand for silver shoots up if the government raises tariffs on gold imports. Also, local taxes and transportation costs besides additional costs by jewellery shops influence the rate of silver in the city. Silver price here changes daily and fluctuation is caused by short-term movements in the market which can be offset by long-term investors who can invest in this \"not so precious metal\" and resell it at lucrative rates. If you are interested in buying silver, there are several big showrooms such as Joyalukkas, Sri Kanakadurga Jewellers, Khazana jewellery, Lalithambika Jewellers, and GRT jewellers among many others. One can monitor silver prices on a daily basis and analyse trends. And when prices are low, it is the greatest time to buy the metal. It can guard you against future uncertainties."

Besides, favorable global cues are further adding to the positivity. We thus reiterate our bullish view and suggest continuing with a “buy on dips” approach. A banner year for stocks is drawing to a close, with gains in big tech leaving the market near all-time highs amid the artificial intelligence exuberance and dovish Federal Reserve bets, reports Bloomberg.

Commenting on the Technical outlook of Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said, The Nifty remained firmly in bullish territory as the index surged to a new all-time high.

It had closed at 83.4538 in the previous session. “The dollar strength is dominating the market at the moment and that is what is driving the rupee to a record low,” said David Forrester, a senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Singapore to Bloomberg. Despite a sharp fall witnessed on Thursday, the rupee is still the best performing currency in Asia this year after the Hong Kong dollar.

Sensex down over 400 points, Nifty at 23,450; FMCG, PSU major draggers Here is why ITC shares have fallen despite shareholders approving hotel business demerger ‘Runaway gains of broader market cannot sustain’ Year-to-date, the Hong Kong dollar has weakened 0.09% and the rupee has depreciated 0.52%. Japanese yen has emerged as worst performing currency by falling 11% followed by Thai Baht (7.2%), South Korean Won (7), Indonesian Rupiah (6%), Philippine Peso (5.8%) and Taiwanese Dollar (5%). “Broader dollar strength has been witnessed across G7 and Asian currencies. Chinese Yuan dropped to its weakest levels since November 2023 which also put the pressure on the rupee,” Kunal Sodhani, vice president-treasury, Shinhan Bank, told FE. “Corporate outflows have been further adding to rupee weakness”. Bond inflows are expected to provide some relief in the coming week, Sodhani added. The Reserve Bank of India has kept the rupee in a tight range, while focusing on building its foreign exchange stockpile to a record high to defend the currency. This has made the rupee one of the least volatile currencies across its emerging market peers, and the central bank is expected to continue accumulating reserves as foreigners continue flocking to the country’s bonds ahead of index inclusion. The rupee’s decline below the previous all-time low of 83.5750 triggered stop-losses, exacerbating the fall, said experts. “There could have been stop-losses triggered on some positions because the central bank had been defending the 83.60 level quite strongly for some time,” said Dilip Parmar, senior research analyst, HDFC Securities. He explained that the fall of the rupee was due to several factors such as the broad strength of the dollar following the attacks in the Red Sea, constant demand for dollars from oil importers and outflows due to Vodafone UK’s sale in Indus Towers .

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a stern warning to South Korea regarding the potential consequences of supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine. This comes following Putin’s visit to North Korea, where he solidified a strategic agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The pact entails mutual defence support in the event of an attack on either country, signalling a significant shift in regional security dynamics. During a one-day visit to Vietnam, Putin responded to concerns about the strategic agreement with North Korea, stating that South Korea need not worry unless it provides weapons to Ukraine. Putin emphasized that any such action from South Korea would be its fault and would lead to serious repercussions. The new strategic alignment between Russia and North Korea has raised alarms in South Korea. Consequently, Seoul is reconsidering its stance on providing military aid to Ukraine. South Korea has consistently supported Ukraine during the ongoing war with Russia, offering financial and humanitarian assistance. In July 2023, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol visited Kiev and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Despite this support, South Korea had maintained a policy of noninvolvement in providing military assistance to countries at war. Legal Trouble for UK’s Richest Family!

Man chops off camel’s leg for trespassing in Pakistan; poor animal to receive prosthetic leg from Dubai Singapore braces for COVID-19 surge with over 25,900 cases recorded in a week; govt urges citizens to wear masks However, the evolving geopolitical landscape, marked by the Russia-North Korea agreement, has prompted South Korea to reassess its policies. Rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula, particularly in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), underscore the gravity of the situation. The DMZ, a heavily fortified buffer zone between North and South Korea, has seen an increase in incidents of firing and infiltration in recent times. In response to these tensions, South Korea has intensified its military exercises with the United States, showcasing a united front against potential threats. Recent firing incidents in the DMZ have further escalated the situation. On multiple occasions, North Korean soldiers have crossed into South Korean territory, prompting warning shots from the South Korean military. These incursions, whether accidental or deliberate, have heightened alertness and military readiness in South Korea. The situation has been worsened by North Korea’s provocative actions, such as sending balloons filled with dirt across the border and engaging in construction activities near the DMZ, which are suspected to be preparations for potential military offensives. In retaliation, South Korea has resorted to psychological operations, including broadcasting propaganda speeches and K-pop songs into North Korea using loudspeakers, and releasing balloons carrying leaflets, USB sticks with South Korean pop culture content, and US dollar bills. These developments suggest that the Korean Peninsula is teetering on the brink of conflict. The lack of response from North Korea to recent South Korean warning shots adds to the uncertainty. The aggressive posturing and defensive measures from both sides indicate a fragile peace that could easily be disrupted. Putin’s visit to North Korea has undeniably amplified the tension in the region. The strategic agreement between Russia and North Korea has significant implications for South Korea’s security calculus. In light of this, South Korea’s consideration of providing weapons to Ukraine represents a critical juncture in its foreign policy. Putin’s warning serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of such a move. As the situation evolves, the international community watches closely, aware that any escalation in the Korean Peninsula could have far-reaching consequences. The strategic alliance between Russia and North Korea not only challenges the stability in East Asia but also complicates the global response to the Ukraine conflict. South Korea now finds itself in a precarious position, balancing its support for Ukraine with the need to maintain stability on its own border.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The East Central Railway (ECR) has ordered station masters within its jurisdiction to cease issuing the T/A 912 written authority letter, which allows train drivers to proceed past signals during automatic signalling system failures. This decision comes in the wake of a deadly collision between the Kanchanjunga Express and a goods train, which resulted in ten fatalities. The suspension was announced in a circular released by ECR on June 21, following a safety meeting attended by the General Manager, Principal Heads of Departments (PHODs), and Divisional Railway Managers (DRMs). The tragic accident occurred on June 17 in West Bengal’s Darjeeling District, within the Northeast Frontier Railway zone. Both train drivers had been issued the T/A 912 note due to defective automatic signalling between Ranipatra station and Chattar Hat Junction. Initial reports from the Railway Board suggested that the goods train was over-speeding, but driver unions argued that the note did not specify speed restrictions, thus absolving the driver of fault. Indian Railways announces train diversions, delays due to non-interlocking work at Puntamba-Kanhegaon section – Complete list inside Why do train drivers violate speed restrictions? Railway Board finds out New Delhi Railway Station to be shut for redevelopment? Railway Ministry issues clarification Train 18 IRCTC menu details: Vande Bharat Express to have branded 5-star food; beverages from Chaayos, Nescafe The ECR circular stated, “It has been decided in the safety meeting held by GM/ECR with PHODs and DRMs that during failure of automatic signal T/A 912 will not be issued until further notice. Instead, the provisions of G&SR 9.02 will be used for double lines until further advice.” According to G&SR 9.02, in the event of an automatic signal failure, train drivers must stop at each red signal for one minute during the day and two minutes at night. They can then proceed at 15 kmph if the track ahead is clear, or 10 kmph if the view is obstructed, until the next signal. The Eastern Railway Zone had issued a similar ban on T/A 912 on June 19, only to retract it the following day. Regarding the June 17 incident, the Railway Board maintained that the goods train driver should have adhered to a 10 kmph speed limit after stopping at each faulty signal for one minute. However, the Indian Railway Loco Runningmen Organisation (IRLRO) contested this, with its working president, Sanjay Pandhi, explaining that T/A 912 overrides the G&SR 9.02 provisions, allowing drivers to travel at the normal speed limit, which can be up to 130 kmph. Pandhi commented on the ECR’s circular, “This letter clearly shows that T/A 912 authorizes the driver to proceed at normal speed. With its suspension, G&SR 9.02 will now be enforced.” He further emphasized the need for senior railway officials to establish clear and consistent rules across all railway zones and divisions.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express By Sandeep Agarwal We’re at the start of a transformative decade in which generative AI is already reshaping work, life and business. Nothing better captures the influence of technology on the general public than the Collins Dictionary selecting “AI” as the word of the year for 2023. As a result, people might believe that in a future where artificial intelligence is unfailing, AI-based technology, at large, can do everything. It can quickly diagnose ailments; our groceries could be purchased by robots and delivered by self-driving cars; AI could even run trains and airplanes; and it could even prepare all our meals, without any human aid. How AI startups are contributing to environment and social impact Best crypto leaders worldwide making cryptocurrency mainstream Former Twitter India head to lead Harvard’s AI impact programme Neuromorphic computing: The future of IoT However, this is far from true. Despite the advancements in technology, the majority of jobs will still need to be performed by humans. So instead of trying to replace people, generative AI will be most useful when it comes to enhancing human creativity. In fact, the World Economic Forum predicts that AI will be a net job creator between now and 2027. So let’s try to debunk some myths about AI and human jobs. Spoiler alert: Your jobs are safe, and if anything, they are better enhanced because of AI. With the advent of AI, over half of the skills that people use on a daily basis at work will need to be revised. Hence, the employees who are skilled in AI might pose a threat to those who are not. AI and Big Data jointly ranks 15th as a general core skill today, and it is the third most important skill that businesses are looking for at present. A striking 66% of leaders admit they wouldn’t hire someone without AI skills. Furthermore, 71% of these leaders would prefer to hire a less experienced candidate who has AI skills over a more experienced candidate without them. For instance, emerging job roles such as prompt engineers, AI trainers, AI auditors, data detectives, and AI ethicists require specialized skills and knowledge, underscoring the importance of rapid reskilling and upskilling within the workforce. Many employees are capable of and willing to be self-motivated. As a result of which there has been a 160% spike in the use of learning courses designed to build AI aptitude. However, in certain instances, companies will have to pay for this upskilling and reskilling. Hence, businesses are increasingly investing in training programs to upgrade their workforce skills and address talent gaps in their organizations. Also read: Deeptech surge in 2023: India sees 480 new startups but faces funding struggles In India , specifically, the technology companies are involved in this transformation. Over 94% of Indian firms invest in upskilling their employees because of the progress made by artificial intelligence technologies. For instance, tech giants have created AI research centers across the country where they run wide-ranging AI skilling programs through workshops and certifications. There are people who still believe that cellphones can harm human health , regardless of the fact that this thought comes from limited and non-reputable sources. It is easier to look at new inventions and raise questions about its ill effects. Embracing innovation, on the other hand, has the potential to change things for better. Of course, every job will be impacted by AI. However, most of that will be augmenting the skills of the workforce rather than replacing them. Humans created AI, which shows that there is little to no match for our skills and aptitude. In other words, humans will always triumph over AI and other technological systems in all aspects. Hence, rather than fearing AI or other technologies that crop up in the future, we can benefit from viewing them as an added tool that can ease the day-to-day tasks, and enhance our quality of work. In short, AI should be viewed as a complement to human capabilities rather than a replacement. (The author is MD and global CTO of Visionet.

You can watch the live stream using the link embedded below: 21:38 (IST) 10 Jun 2024 Apple WWDC 2024 Live Updates: Less than one hour to go Less than one hour to go before Apple CEO Tim Cook and other top company executives take the stage and reveal to the world what they’ve been cooking on software. iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, as well as Vision OS are set to get their next major update and while Apple is expected to roll them out officially around September, beta rollout should kick off soon after the WWDC keynote event. 21:18 (IST) 10 Jun 2024 Apple WWDC 2024 Live Updates: iOS 18 will be ‘super heavy’ on AI At WWDC 2024 , Apple is expected to unveil a “smart recap” feature, designed to summarise missed texts, notifications, and various media such as web pages, news articles, and documents. This tool aims to help users manage the often overwhelming barrage of iOS notifications more efficiently. In addition, the Voice Memo app is expected to receive AI-generated transcription capabilities. Apple also plans to leverage AI to improve other functionalities, including on-device Spotlight search, Safari Internet searches, and writing suggestions for emails and texts. Moreover, AI may be utilised to retouch photos and generate emojis based on text content.

Apple will reportedly call its suit of AI features as “Apple Intelligence.” It is learnt that, even though it is set to partner with OpenAI for some if not all of its AI features, it won’t just offer another chatbot (ChatGPT) like many other brands. John Giannandrea, Apple’s head of machine learning, reportedly wasn’t in favour of the company putting another chatbot into its devices and so, chances are we may see a different approach. Moreover, Apple isn’t expected to “show off” some fancy AI features and be done with it. It is said that the initial batch of Apple Intelligence features will be more practical, focusing on tasks like summaries and message responses. The other big notable thing to know is Apple’s security angle. Reports suggest that Apple will allow users to opt-in to use its AI features. Algorithms will decide if something can be done locally and the system will prefer to do it that way. Only bigger more complex tasks will tap into the cloud and there, too, Apple is reportedly relying on its own M2-powered servers to keep things in check. It’s a setup like no other and so, even though Apple is late to the AI race, it appears to be putting a concerted effort to ensure, users’ private data stays secure and protected. 20:38 (IST) 10 Jun 2024 Apple WWDC 2024 Live Updates: Why AI matters? AI is not like metaverse , it’s here to stay, is what experts and analysts suggest. Some tech companies have caught the trend early. Microsoft for instance was one of the early movers into making the right moves and getting into right partnerships including one with Sam Altman’s OpenAI. So big was AI’s potential and impact, it triggered a red code inside Google. Google was quick to respond, mostly because, it sits on top of a wealth of Tensor chips and has been doing machine learning for far longer, though to power search. Microsoft’s breakthroughs however forced Google to come out of the shell and roll out gen AI across the length and breadth of its product ecosystem. Elsewhere, Amazon , too, is actively working to enhance Alexa with AI tech to make it better. Apple is perhaps the only big tech company which hasn’t revealed its cards. But this is expected to change at WWDC 2024 . 20:18 (IST) 10 Jun 2024 Apple WWDC 2024 Live Updates: Swift Student Challenge winners Apple’s annual Swift Student Challenge continues to honour top student coding talent, and this year, it introduced a new category. Out of 350 winning submissions, 50 students were “distinguished” for their exceptional app playgrounds, recognized for their innovation, creativity, social impact, or inclusivity. FE Tech Bytes got to interact with two of Apple’s distinguished winners from India : 22-year-old Akshat Srivastava and 21-year-old Asmi Jain. Be sure to check out our detailed coverage report here: How these India-origin Swift Student Challenge winners are bringing ideas to life and inspiring millions | FE Exclusive 20:02 (IST) 10 Jun 2024 Apple WWDC 2024 Live Updates: What to expect At WWDC 2024 , while AI advancements and Siri upgrades will be top priorities, Apple will also unveil a comprehensive array of features for its entire suite of software, including iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15. With iOS 18, users can anticipate more personalisation options. Among the noteworthy updates, iPad and Mac users may finally receive a dedicated calculator app, a long-awaited feature.

The keynote will start at 10 am PDT (10:30 pm IST ). Ahead of its “mega AI event”, Apple CEO Tim Cook has taken to X, the platform previously known as Twitter to tease and hype up the WWDC 2024 . “Can’t wait for you to join us at #wwdc24 this morning.” WWDC 2024 is one of, if not the biggest events for Apple in a long time, because it’s here that Cupertino will unveil to the world the future of iPhone and how AI will play a role in that. Apple is a bit late to the party, playing catch up with Google and Microsoft , so all eyes will be on it to see how things pan out. https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1800158474053005464 18:58 (IST) 10 Jun 2024 Apple WWDC 2024 Live Updates: Will Apple make any hardware announcements? Last year’s WWDC saw Apple launch a bunch of new Mac hardware including the M2-based MacBook Air 15, and Mac Studio, Mac Pro with M2 Max, M2 Ultra chips. Apple also officially previewed the Vision Pro headset at WWDC 2023. However, at WWDC 2024 , it isn’t expected to launch or showcase any new hardware. New Apple hardware isn’t expected until fall, which is when Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 16 series, new AirPods, and Mac devices.

Think of it as an alternative to popular password managers like LastPass and 1Password and so needless to say, it will help users manage their login information. The new Passwords app will categorise logins into sections such as accounts, Wi-Fi networks, and passkeys, according to Bloomberg. The app will reportedly support Windows. Expected to debut with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15, at WWDC 2024 , it will be able to generate and store passwords, and create authentication codes like Google Authenticator.

Expect better search, too. The same updates are expected to extend on to macOS as well. Additionally, the iOS Control Centre seems in line to get major improvements, including a new music widget and better smart home controls. The settings app update in particular has been long overdue, hopefully it would be more streamlined rather than the unending list that it is presently.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Anubhuti luxury coaches are all set to replace AC-1st class Executive Chair car coaches in some Shatabdi Express trains. As many as 10 Anubhuti coaches have been manufactured with idea of giving passengers an aircraft-like experience during their train journeys. From LCD entertainment screens that allow you to play movies, to cushioned leg rests and reading lights – Anubhuti coaches are a definite upgrade from the existing Executive chair cars. Adding to the good news is the fact that all these features are unlikely to translate into a fare hike for passengers. Financial Express Online brings you an exclusive preview of the Anubhuti coaches..check out the amazing features and images: The exterior of the coach has been given an artistic touch, while maintaining the overall blue scheme of the Shatabdi trains. Like all new trains of Indian Railways, this one too has an anti-graffiti vinyl wrapping. The 56-seat coach has seats in the 2+2 configuration. LED lights have been fitted to save energy and also provide better lighting. The upgraded executive-class coach has cushioned seats with an airline-like leg-rest to make your train travel more comfortable. The seat can also be reclined. Yet another aircraft-like facility includes the provision of LCD entertainment screens with every seat. Passengers can play music and movies while enjoying the experience with a personalised headphone that will be provided by Indian Railways. This is similar to the feature that was introduced with the Mumbai-Goa Tejas Express train. The seats in the middle too have been provided with LCD entertainment screens for all eight passengers (4 on each side). These screens can be made to slide back into the table by the simple action of a push in the downward direction. An added advantage for the passengers is the provision of USB and mobile charging points in the space that joins two seats. The favourite snack table that is usually attached to the back of the seat has now found its way in a compact compartment under the arm rest of the seat. Passengers are required to just pull it out and pack it back again after eating. Just like an aircraft, this coach too comes with a personalised reading light which will not disturb the fellow passenger. There is also an attendant calling facility above the seat. The 'bell' button will make sure that your queries are answered without moving from your seat. The luggage racks are spacious and the area above them has been coated with anti-graffiti vinyl wrapping. This will ensure that the walls remain free of scratches. In the middle of the coach there are passenger information display boards on both sides. These will display useful information such as the approaching station, distance, speed etc. There are mobile charging points next to each seat area in addition to those provided between the seats. The seat stickers have been braille-integrated to make them user friendly for the visually impaired. Anubhuti coaches get a modular toilet with improved features such as touch-free tap and soap dispenser, hand dryer. This is meant to ensure less wastage of water and also allows for better hygiene. The bio-toilet is in line with Indian Railways' aim to make tracks defecation free. There are toilet occupancy indicators at each end of the coach that light up if the washroom is occupied. There is also an announcement system at the end of the coach, similar to that in an aircraft. The mini-pantry remains the same with the only addition being that of a soup boiler, which means an added drink on the menu for passengers. The doorway area has also been upgraded with anti-graffiti vinyl wrapping, ensuring better cleanliness. The standard display plate on the exterior has been replaced with an LED display panel that is meant to not only flash the train name and number, but also the destination. The coaches have been manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory in Chennai. The average cost of manufacturing each coach is Rs 2.84 crore. Indian Railways hopes to start plying these coaches by December-end or January 2018 beginning, but the routes have not yet been decided. At a time when Indian Railways faces growing competition from the aviation sector, the focus on aircraft-like experience is a step in the right direction, but other factors such as punctuality and safety would play an equally crucial role in luring passengers.

Anant Ambani , the youngest scion of Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani, is uniting with Radhika Merchant, the daughter of pharmaceutical magnate Viren Merchant. The guest list reads like a who’s who of the global elite, including not only Bollywood ’s top-tier celebrities but also tech titans such as Bill Gates (Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), Disney CEO Bob Iger, Ivanka Trump, Qatar Premier Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, and the royal couple of Bhutan.

According to these reports, Rihanna typically demands anywhere from $1.5 million (Rs 12 crore) to $8 million (Rs 66 crore) for her participation in private gatherings. The Queen Bey herself graced Udaipur in 2018 for Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal’s sangeet ceremony, setting the stage ablaze with her iconic performance.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The debt market in Indian real estate is projected to present a financing opportunity worth Rs 14 trillion ($170 billion) between 2024-2026, according to a report released on Thursday. This opportunity arises from two primary market segments — construction finance, or long-term debt and lease rental discounting (LRD)– both slated for unprecedented growth during 2024-2026, the report by JLL-Propstack said. The report estimates that the long-term debt requirement in the residential market alone will amount to nearly Rs 4.3 trillion by 2026. Additionally, India ’s real estate construction market, which includes asset classes like Grade A commercial offices, high-quality malls, warehousing parks, and data centers, is predicted to grow by 35-40% over the same period, translating to an estimated potential of Rs 5.5 trillion to Rs 6 trillion.

However, there remains a significant gap between the total residential construction debt requirement and the debt that has been sanctioned, indicating the market’s underserved potential, the report said. With strong fundamentals and a substantial need for long-term debt in construction finance, the current gap between sanctioned and market debt stands at Rs 1.5 trillion, the report added. Furthermore, the LRD market in the commercial segment is expected to exceed Rs 8 trillion by 2026. The LRD potential in the commercial office segment alone is anticipated to grow by 30% in the next three years, driven by strong demand fundamentals and sustainability measures, it added. In addition, the physical retail market and other rent-yielding assets, such as warehousing, data centers, and hotels, present substantial opportunities for lenders in the LRD segment. “Last year, public and private sector banks accounted for 68% of total debt sanctioned, highlighting growing confidence and interest. The popularity of LRD in commercial real estate has also increased, constituting an average of 19% of total debt sanctions, with a notable rise to 25% in 2023,” said Lata Pillai, senior managing director, Capital Markets, India at JLL. “To support developers at different stages, innovative and customised funding structures are needed, offering significant opportunities for Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). Private credit will continue to play a crucial role, particularly in the residential sector. Shifting focus to smaller developers, who make up over two-thirds of the residential market, can make funding more inclusive,” added Pillai. The study showed an increase in the banking sector’s participation, accounting for 70% of the total debt sanctioned in 2023, compared to non-banking sectors. Reforms in the real estate sector, such as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), have instilled confidence among both public and private sector banks, the report added.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express By Pankaj Sharma The role of fintech has deepened across sectors, and it is especially true for the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) segment. It is changing the way financial services are delivered and consumed. From digital payments to peer-to-peer lending, financial services are powered by advanced tech like blockchain and AI, leading fintechs to offer accessible, efficient, and inclusive solutions to businesses – big or small. Fintech’s contribution to MSMEs’ empowerment will likely increase, with the Indian fintech sector predicted to reach $150 billion by 2025. How are fintech solutions equipping MSMEs? JM Financial invests Rs 40 crore in agri equipment startup Balwaan Krishi MSME Udyam registration: Check updated process to switch from Udyog Aadhaar certificate MSME Delayed Payments: What is MSME-1 form and penalties involved? MSME 45-day payment rule: Traders to urge new NDA govt for up to 180-day time limit MSMEs are one of the critical pillars of the Indian economy , contributing approximately 29% to the GDP, 44% to the exports and employing over 123 million people. However, they often face challenges accessing traditional financial services, such as credit and insurance. While MSMEs have the potential to fuel the Indian economy, the industry faces a significant credit gap of Rs 25 trillion. There is an urgent need to double the credit disbursal rate to the MSME sector. Fintech is bridging this gap by offering tailored solutions that cater to the unique needs of MSMEs. Fintech has improved access to credit. Traditional banks often hesitate to lend to MSMEs due to perceived risks and lack of credit history. To assess creditworthiness, fintech companies use alternative data sources, such as digital transactions, GST filings, and utility bills. This inclusive and data-driven approach has expanded the credit market for MSMEs, enabling them to secure the necessary funding for growth. According to a report by EY, digital lending is expected to reach Rs 47.4 lakh crore by 2026. This is a potential opportunity for MSMEs. In addition to credit, fintech solutions have simplified transactions through digital payments. It has enabled MSMSEs to streamline receiving and sending money. This is majorly done by the widespread adoption of mobile wallets and payments like UPI and digital payment platforms. As per data by IBEF, digital payments in India have surged, with the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) processing over 10 billion transactions in a single month in 2023. This shift towards digital payments simplifies day-to-day transactional operations and enhances financial inclusion by providing direct financial access to underserved and unbanked MSMEs access to financial services. Moreover, fintech tools like invoicing and expense management software have been a game-changer for MSMEs. They help manage cash flow more effectively. Automated invoicing and real-time expense tracking ensure that businesses clearly understand their financial health , allowing for better decision-making and strategic planning. The rise in digital adoption presents prospects for further growth in the sector, with 72% of MSME payments done through digital modes compared to 28% cash transactions. Policy support fueling the growth of fintech and MSMEs The Indian government and regulatory bodies are implementing policies to support integrating fintech solutions in the MSME sector. These policies create a conducive environment for fintech innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. One key initiative is the establishment of regulatory sandboxes that allow fintech companies to test their innovations in a controlled environment. This approach helps regulators understand the implications of new technologies and develop appropriate regulatory frameworks. The Reserve Bank of India ’s (RBI) regulatory sandbox will facilitate the development of various fintech solutions tailored for MSMEs. At the same time, the Indian government’s investment of Rs 14,903 crore between FY 2022 to FY 2026 in Digital India is a crucial step towards building digital infrastructure that supports fintech adoption. High-speed internet connectivity, digital identity systems like Aadhaar, and mobile penetration are critical enablers of fintech growth. These initiatives ensure that MSMEs can leverage fintech solutions seamlessly. A significant policy support initiative is the RBI’s Payments Vision 2025. This plan aims to achieve a threefold increase in digital payment transactions, a 50% CAGR, and an increase in the registered customer base for mobile-based transactions. Additionally, the goal is to achieve a 150% increase in prepaid payment instrument (PPI) transactions and the expansion of card acceptance infrastructure to 25 million by 2025. These thoughtful measures will help build a robust digital payment infrastructure that will, in turn, benefit MSMEs and enhance financial inclusion. Fintech growth and the expansion of MSME ecosystems The future of fintech in the MSME sector in India looks promising, with several trends expected to shape its growth trajectory. Integrating AI and machine learning in fintech solutions will further enhance credit scoring models, fraud detection, and personalized financial services for MSMEs. These technologies will enable more accurate risk assessments and tailored financial products. Also, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms could provide MSMEs access to a broader range of financial services without traditional intermediaries. Moreover, embedded finance, where financial services are seamlessly integrated into non-financial platforms, is also gaining traction. MSMEs will benefit from embedded finance solutions that simplify access to credit, insurance, and payments within their existing business workflows. Future outlook India’s gradual transition to a mobile-first economy plays a significant role in the future of fintech. With smartphone users expected to reach approximately 1.1 billion by FY2026 and Internet users projected to exceed 850 million, the country has almost shifted towards a mobile-centric approach to financial services. This shift will further accelerate the adoption of fintech solutions among MSMEs, providing them with the tools and resources needed to thrive in a digital economy. As the nation works towards the vision of becoming a $5 trillion economy, the continued growth of MSMEs through fintech innovations is set to play a major role.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Generative AI-based technologies like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have the potential to fundamentally change how several roles are delivered but they can also open a window of opportunity to do more value-added work, Salesforce India Vice President (Solution Engineering), Deepak Pargaonkar told FE. What that means is that while concerns of ChatGPT taking your job aren’t completely unfounded, Indian engineers –at least— have nothing to worry about. The senior Salesforce official further said that India is at the leading edge of these technologies in terms of both understanding as well as deployment while adding that in order to be able to use them more efficiently, some guardrails also need to be put in place. Excerpts. Why is Generative AI such a big deal in 2023 and how is Salesforce approaching it? Airtel Rs 279 prepaid plan with extended validity, unlimited calling launched in India — full details Jio versus Airtel: For Rs 395, which telco offers more benefits, better value with prepaid recharge plan? Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? Google to bump up free cloud storage from 15GB to 1TB for these individuals: Check benefits, eligibility, and more We have been doing a lot of work when it comes to AI. Einstein AI is baked into each of our solutions, which has been driving customer use cases like – the ability to do lead scoring, service, etc. We have a huge amount of data about our customers’ customers. For example, a business managing B2C consumers with Salesforce, manages the acquisitions, customer service, and marketing, generating a huge amount of data. In this scenario, a customer service executive has to answer questions from a consumer, which needs elaborate content generation. Towards this, we are trying to help organisations by delivering Einstein GPT models. We are giving power to our customers to use Einstein GPT to generate content, which is relevant for their business scenario. At the end of the day, these are language models which create a text, an audio, or an image. This enables the customer executive to structure an appropriate communication and send it to the customer.

Einstein GPT for Service can generate knowledge articles from past case notes, and auto-generate personalised agent chat replies to increase customer satisfaction through personalised and expedited service interactions. Einstein GPT for Marketing can dynamically generate personalised content to engage customers and prospects across email, mobile, web, and advertising . Einstein GPT for Developers can improve developer productivity with Salesforce Research’s proprietary large language model by using an AI chat assistant to generate code and ask questions for languages like Apex. Einstein GPT for Slack Customer 360 apps delivers AI-powered customer insights in Slack like smart summaries of sales opportunities and surface end users’ actions like updating knowledge articles. Where is India placed as far as your viewpoint is concerned on Generative AI – adoption? No single interaction happens without a conversation about OpenAI or GPT, today. We talk to the leaders of our customer organisations, operational executives, senior functional leaders, and everywhere people are talking about the possibilities with ChatGPT. Customers are asking if we are in the hype-cycle, what are the relevant use cases, how are we working on them, and how they can leverage these OpenAI or GPT capabilities for their business. With technological advancements, customers are even talking about how they can manage any associated risk elements and that’s a great thing. The technology is driving in a particular direction now. We have used it mainly in our capacities. While I have seen my child generating an essay out of ChatGPT, when it comes to business, customers want us to tell them how we can use this technology, what are the guardrails that we need to put so that essentially, we are using it in a very trusted and secure environment. Our observations about India are that we are actually at the leading edge of the technology, understanding, and ways of deploying it also. Every market tends to have its own need and focus. Is there any specific comment that you have on India as a market when it comes to Generative AI? What does the current trend look like? There are certain things as per the market and every market has its nuances. India means unprecedented scale, which, with our population, and the number of consumers that every organisation deals with, is humongous and it is practically going to be impossible for the organisations to manage these massive scales for everything. AI can be used for simple automated engagement with consumers. It’s going to be extremely important to leverage technology to address, manage, and scale so that the growth can also be managed, the costs could also be controlled, because one of the advantages that these technologies bring to the table is they can help you scale. In India, scale proportions are very different, there are urban scales, there are rural scales. So, these new-age technologies must be leveraged. However, it is also extremely important to manage it appropriately. The models which generate some of the responses, we need to worry about their accuracy. We need to think about safety, how honest the model’s output is going to be in the sense that if an organisation is leveraging AI to generate a response or using a bot for some conversation, it should be transparent with the consumers about whether this is an AI-generated response, or this is a bot that is engaging with you. When we talk about biases, we want someone to be empowered to authenticate the data that the technology is generating. Say a particular response is generated, then what we are seeing is that rather than initially immediately sending it across to the consumer as a straightforward response directly from the system, share it with the agent, the agent will view that, empower the agent to authenticate that response and then communicate it. So, when we talk about India as a market, one of the unique things is the scale and for that scale, to be managed, organisations need to know how to use technology. Apart from just technology, new developments in technology like AI, Generative AI have to be used so the organisation’s employees can be more productive, can be more efficient, as well as consumer engagement would be more interesting and value-added. But to do all of these things, some guardrails are also important. Organisations need to worry about safety, and accuracy, and to do all of that, you have to empower your staff so that there’s an authentication of the response that is getting created, especially talking about the Generative AI responses which are getting created. So, these are some of the things we are seeing in the market and we are also telling our customers it is our combined responsibility to leverage the technology with guardrails and also ethics in mind. Fortunately, because we already have an office of ethics in AI in Salesforce, we ensure all of these fundamentals which are necessary for any AI or even so Generative AI. Is regulation the way forward for technology like this? It is every organisation’s responsibility to deliver certain things with some basic premises being followed. If we consider that as a regulation, we are imposing on following certain guidelines. In particular, we want to cite the sources for accuracy. When we look at safety, we want to conduct maybe red teaming, what we want to do is regularly conduct bias or explainability and robustness assessment because the biases are the ones that are an inherent part of any AI model, including the Generative AI model. Also Read | ChatGPT has an answer to all your questions, but can it do “this”? We want to be honest, and we want to focus on sustainability also. Some models are so huge, but it’s not always the case that the largest is the best. We can create some well-trained simple and small models also, but guardrails are extremely important. Ethical use is essential, and towards that very specific way to drive accuracy, safety, honesty, and sustainability. There are concerns that AI can take some jobs . Are they warranted? Is there a certain set of people who should be worried? The majority of the initial part of structuring and creating content will possibly be done by the Generative AI. So, obviously it does impact the work that an individual is doing. But fundamentally, it [also] gives an opportunity to do more value-added work. It will be very cliched for me to say that every innovation cycle has always brought that fear but it always has got the positives also open. So yes, my personal view is it’s going to fundamentally change how several functions or roles are getting delivered. But what it does is, it allows doing more value adds. So Indian engineers have nothing to worry about. A year ago, everyone was talking about Metaverse. Those conversations have slowly started to fade. Now, Generative AI is the new buzzword. Do you see it sticking around, if yes, where do you see it next five years down the line? At Salesforce, we feel that there is a profound capability that organisations can leverage out of new-age technologies like Generative AI. Fundamentally because it helps the stakeholders, it helps the consumers, it helps employees and it helps organisations and those benefits are very real. Right now, I don’t really want to comment on the other parts of the technologies and how they will grow or the hype-cycle. AI in its current form is helping a lot. Generative AI technologies are going to help us as individual consumers and also the organisations where we create the content, textual content, image content, or maybe the audio and to add value to every stakeholder’s way of either working on living assessment is that organisations with the amount of data that they’re generating, and the engagement that they want to drive with the consumers of the world. Possibilities are immense. And looks like organisations will leverage one of these capabilities to drive our business outcomes. Basis of our conversation, it feels India probably has a 1st-row seat in all of this. Where do you see this going in terms of India driving this technology forward. What do you expect from the talent space? A lot of organisations and their huge amounts of tech development, are based out of India because of how engineers have progressed in the field of IT. In fact, many organisations like ours are focusing on a lot of startups, as they are doing innovative work in the area of AI or Generative AI. Organisations are encouraging these innovations from the engineers in India. So, I think India has an opportunity to be a part of this development cycle, and will adopt these technologies for the betterment of organisational efficiency and consumer experience.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express India is a very important strategic market that is leading the way for popularisation of foldables and it will play a critical role in Samsung’s recovery and success in the second half of 2023, TM Roh, president and head of MX Business at Samsung Electronics told FE on the sidelines of Unpacked in Seoul. Galaxy products already account for 35 percent share in the super-premium (products that are priced at $1000 or higher) segment in India , he said, and with the newly-launched Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 5, the company is looking to capture over 50 percent of the market . The confidence comes from India’s high sensitivity for technological innovation and the rapidly rising demand for high-end premium products in the world’s fastest growing mobile market. Roh asserted that with cumulative sales of foldables expected to top 30 million units globally this year, 2023 will be a “tipping point” wherein foldables will become [more] mainstream as a category. In the next few years, he expects foldable sales to top 100 million units a year, eventually expanding into other categories like tablets and personal computers.

Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? Google to bump up free cloud storage from 15GB to 1TB for these individuals: Check benefits, eligibility, and more Launched in 2019, the first wave of Samsung foldables set out to re-imagine the mobile phone as we know it, and even though there were some concerns along the way, “seeing how there are other foldable products being launched in the market today,” Roh believes that “our conviction that foldables will be an important player in the premium mobile market [and not a product only for the niche market] has been proven true.” Citing the example of the large screen smartphone, once called the “phablet”, and how the Note-series single-handedly created a category and fan-base of its own, Roh reiterated that Samsung Electronics has worked towards building new usability and innovations from time to time. Also Read | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy Z Flip 5 first impressions: Sealing the deal “If we had stuck to the existing 3.5-inch display all this time, then we would not have been able to enjoy the kind of usability that we enjoy today and provide the kind of experience that the consumers want,” Roh said, adding that “I am proud that we were able to create an environment where the consumers can get all the information that they want easily on a large screen and also all the experience that they want.” Specifically, for foldables, Roh is proud not only for creating a new category –yet again—but that Samsung continues to develop it with the intent that it would become more commonplace someday. At the same time, the company hopes that more consumers will use “this very good product so it could spread much more quickly than it has done [so far].” Internally, Samsung is working on a two-pronged approach to push for greater mass adoption of foldables. One is to keep improving on the performance and the quality of these devices even as it continues to innovate on the form factor itself. The second is to make them “as affordable as possible”. When asked about a potential Galaxy Fold/Flip Fan Edition and a tentative timeline of launch, Roh declined to get into the details but said that Samsung “is working very hard [internally] and with strategic parts suppliers [to make foldables more affordable], adding that “since we are currently working on future technologies, it is difficult to specify the timing of when such solutions will be made available. But when the time comes, then we will unveil more affordable foldable[s] as well.” Roh stressed that Samsung wants to make it easier for the consumers everywhere, including in India, to purchase its foldables, through sales programs and services like Samsung Finance+ and it will continue to work on that front, not only by itself, but along with its partners. And it works both ways. Also Read | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, Flip 5 quick review: Closing the gap “If more consumers in India were to use our Fold and Flip and provide us with better ideas [on how to make them better], we will incorporate them into future devices and [this] will drive further innovation,” Roh said, adding that “we have been listening to the voices of our customers, and it is the voices of the customers that we intend to keep reflecting into our next product.” For the second half of the year, Samsung wants to be “at least on par with the pace of market recovery” and to meet that goal, “the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Flip 5 will have to show very good performance [in sales].” The Fold 5 and Flip 5 may seem familiar but they’re easily the most comprehensive update to the line-up since the very origin of the line-up. At their heart is Samsung’s brand-new Flex hinge which folds the screen internally in the shape of a tear-drop which makes both the Fold 5 and Flip 5 fold completely flat without any gap. The Flip 5 is also getting a cover screen upgrade and comes with a larger 3.4-inch Flex Window opening up new possibilities and use-cases than ever before. The Fold 5 price in India starts at Rs 1,54,999. The Flip 5 starts at Rs 99,999.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express South Korean major Samsung wants to make great tech affordable while continuing to “premiumise” the smartphone market with its 5G-first strategy, the company’s Senior Director for Mobile Business for India, Aditya Babbar, said on the sidelines of the new Galaxy M34 5G launch. Doing that would bring power back to the consumer and help consolidate its leadership, he added. “We are very focused on our journey towards Make in India , powering Digital India and making it 5G-first,” Babbar told FE, adding that with the M-series (now) moving to 5G, Samsung remains committed to premiumise the market by not compromising on the core specs to give consumers access to a future-ready technology . The M-series turns 5 this year and has been time and again, “one of the segment’s best with millions of consumers using these devices every day to create, to play games”, Babbar reiterated.

Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? Also Read | Samsung Galaxy M34 5G first impressions: Heavyweight under Rs 20,000 Designed for power users, phones under the series come with massive battery to the tune of 6,000mAh, but over the years, Samsung has expanded their feature set upping the value proposition for budget-conscious buyers. The newly launched Galaxy M34 5G packs high-end specs including a 120Hz Super AMOLED display and 50MP primary camera sensor with optically stabilised lens at a starting price of Rs 18,999 for 6GB/128GB (Rs 16,999 with bank offers). “We believe that if you make great tech and make it affordable, that is where you bring power back to the consumer and we want to work towards that and we are very confident that with this device, it will help us to consolidate our leadership,” Babbar said, adding that “now our role is to make great tech of 5G affordable and the M34 is a shining example of that.” The senior Samsung India executive asserted that the company currently has a network of more than 80,000 stores selling 5G devices and about 20,000 stores giving 5G experience. All this when paired with affordability (through services like Samsung Finance Plus) means, it is now possible to buy a 5G phone “on per day basis at prices less than a 4G [phone].” “So that’s where you know we have worked on making tech affordable for the consumer, rather than just catering to a segment-first approach,” he added. Also Read | Making epic things happen: How 700 engineers from India made Samsung’s Galaxy S23 ‘ultra’ While M becomes “a mainstream strategy” for Samsung, a bit of overlap with A- and F-series (which are also growing by the way), cannot be avoided, but apparently that is by design. “We are a full range player and, in every strategy, we put the consumer at the centre of whatever we do,” Babbar explained and “every consumer has a very different need. For them, we have a Flip to a Fold to an Ultra with a pen to a gaming phone like the S23 to the M-series. We want to give a lot of options for the consumer to adopt whatever is best for them.” Even as Samsung gears to launch its next-generation of foldable devices, come July 26, phones like the M34 5G have equal weightage and focus, if not more, at least in the sense that both try to deliver breakthrough innovation, whether it be through screen-bending tech or the promise of longevity and future-proofing on a budget. “We are happy that we are continuing to grow faster than the market with the propositions which we have created,” Babbar said, adding “we have our ears on the ground and we believe that there is a space for everyone to coexist, even across the [same] price point.

In this rapidly evolving landscape of AI, few stories resonate as powerfully as that of Staqu. Founded by Unity of Manchester alumni, Atul Rai in 2015, Staqu is pushing the boundaries of AI, predominantly in the field of video analytics and security solutions. With its star product, Jarvis, the company aims to harness the untapped potential of AI to transform surveillance technology into an advanced, proactive safeguarding system. In an exclusive interview with FE TechBytes, Atul Rai, the co-founder of Staqu, shares his insights into the company’s journey and the groundbreaking technology it has pioneered. As we delve into the conversation, we learn the innovative ways in which AI is being used.

Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? Staqu is an AI research firm that targets unstructured data that are available in the form of images or audio. These are called unstructured because until and unless someone is not listening or seeing you cannot get any information out of it. Jarvis is our platform where you can integrate any camera feed and when say camera feed, it could be a CCTV camera, it could be a drone camera, or even a television or a video feed. And you can define what exactly you want to extract from it. Jarvis has two modules; one is the security and safety module and the second is the revenue enhancement module. The revenue enhancement module is a relatively new thing in the form of cameras, I’ll go to that. But safety and security are something which we started first with the state police forces wherein we took it to 9 state police forces across the country. ALSO READ l Will ChatGPT take your job?

For example, they do not know how many people came to their store, how many of them were male or female, and what could they have tried in their store. This is something that was missing for them and that is where we come in to help them identify these use cases for them. So these can be questions like what is a footfall ratio in the store, what is a male or gender ratio, at what time is the queue length higher in the store, and likewise more. So, this is something we are doing with the cameras and this is where we have all bigger retail brands working with us. And in security we have aspects like crowd analysis, violence analysis, cleaning, moping analysis or similarly more. What do you mean by violence analysis? We started this with UP prisons first. Let’s say there’s a camera, two people are fighting. You won’t come to know of it until and unless there’s an alert sent to you. This is where AI is now being trained. If any violence is happening in front of a camera, AI identifies these clips and starts sending alerts to the respective stakeholder or the Chief Security Officer of that particular estate. Fundamentally it’s an activity detection thing since violence is an activity Our technology also works on audio detection wherein of you say “Jarvis Help”, it will automatically l send out an alert to the concerned command center. What are some of the most innovative ways that Staqu has helped improve the security and safety of people and businesses? Safety and security is the area where we are mostly working with the police forces and manufacturers like Adani power . So, there are different use cases for them. For police, we help them identify a criminal using facial detection. We are the first ones to start this and we are just referring the criminal data available. What are some of the common use cases of Jarvis? On the security side, there is facial recognition, violence detection, intrusion detection, crowd analysis, security and safety analysis. On the revenue enhancement side, we have footfall analysis, queue analysis, customer journey analysis, and likewise more. These data can help an industry gets detailed insight into customer behaviour. Tell us about the challenges that Staqu has faced so far? There were many but to name one, it was at first difficult at first to pitch the overall idea of Staqu to someone. I remember when we went to the Punjab police to sell this facial recognition, they said it sounds more like a Hollywood thing! We were told by many police stations that they would like the try the product first. In the pilot run. Police managed to identify more than 300 criminals in two to three months of time span. This is how started getting references for different areas. In this process we understood the challenges and started integrating new features into the Jarvis. What are some of the ethical challenges that Staqu faces as an AI company? When we talk about AI it’s always about data. And data is something for which privacy is the first thing that comes to your mind. So, we’ve really worked on this part. We are the only AI startup company in India to have both American standard of privacy and GDPR which is European standard of privacy certificates with us. We have developed different kind of protocols for data security, data privacy and confidentiality. How does your service differ from other video analytics solutions available in the market? Staqu’s video analytics technology stands out in comparison to other players in the market. Unlike competitors such as Hikvision and CP Plus, Staqu focuses solely on advanced audio-video analytics solutions, where else other players are more hardware driven. Additionally, some competitors provide video analytics as an add-on feature with no built-in audio capabilities. Unlike other companies that require additional hardware installations, our solution thrives with existing camera setups and a stable Internet connection. This translates to swift adoption without new hardware costs or intricate deployment processes. Additionally, our cloud-based methodology accelerates the process of data storage, as we transfer feeds to the cloud for real-time processing, amplifying operational efficiency and enabling swift decisions. Also we are camera agnostic, that means our solution can be seamlessly integrated on any camera such as —CCTV, drones, and body-worn cameras. This versatility opens a wide range of use cases and applications across industries, providing users with a comprehensive video analytics solution. Eliminating hardware requirements reduces capital expenses in a big way. The cloud-centric model ensures data privacy, either through existing infrastructure or private cloud setups. Staqu’s technology epitomizes efficiency, adaptability, and economic prudence. Follow FE Tech Bytes on Twitter , Instagram , LinkedIn , Facebook .

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Strong showing for the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 5 from tier-3 and tier-4 towns helped Samsung clock a record Rs 1,500 Crores in revenue, a top Samsung India executive told FE. “We have recorded the highest ever 1,50,000 pre-bookings for the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 5 which is 1.5 times over last year and almost Rs 1,500 crores in revenue,” said Aditya Babbar, senior director for Mobile Business, Samsung India . Pre-bookings for the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 5 opened on July 27 through August 17. Demand seems particularly high for the Flip 5 clamshell pulling about 50 percent consumers from non-Samsung devices which is “definitely” helping the brand recruit some new users into the Galaxy.

Also Read | India is critical for our success, working hard on affordable foldables: Samsung Mobile head TM Roh Babbar attributes the success to a differentiated go-to- market (GTM) plan both with regards to the products themselves and sales coupled with custom financing options tailored-made for the consumer, which have seemingly come about after due deliberation. The brand has worked round-the-clock to increase awareness around these devices and make them more affordable. The numbers speak for themselves. Pre-booking data suggests “Bharat is growing faster than urban India” in terms of embracing the new products and Samsung expects the momentum to continue well into the festive season. Babbar says that the Fold 5 is getting traction for its lighter, brighter display while the Flip 5 with its large cover screen and pocketability is finding significant takers among the under 35-year-old age group. “In most cases, when buying a device, you can either do a trade-in or get a cashback or EMI. But we realised that the consumer wants more options. So, this year we did a Rs 8,000 upgrade plus a 24-month EMI and that has really helped us with Samsung Finance Plus to grow faster in the Bharat part of the country,” he adds. Samsung also has a well-thought-out plan for after-sales with Samsung Care Plus that lets consumers get their Fold 5 or Flip 5 with water or breakage damage repaired “no questions asked” by paying an amount of Rs 12,000. The brand will, also, replace the surface film of these devices one time free of cost should they damage it. Also Read | Why Samsung believes Galaxy Z Fold 5, Flip 5 will make foldables mainstream in India Babbar believes that H2 2023 will be extremely bright with the market expected to grow at a healthy double digit and Samsung wants to grow faster than the market. “The flagship market is showing extremely good signs. Even after the launch of [these] foldables, we are going extremely strong on our Galaxy S-series. And we are very confident that we will continue this momentum to Diwali,” he says, adding that “We are working on what will be the best plans for the consumer for the festive seasons.” Samsung aims to capture over 50 percent market share in the super-premium ($1000 or higher) segment in India with its new batch of foldables and if the initial numbers are anything to go by, the Fold 5 and Flip 5 are off to a blazing start. The Fold 5 price in India starts at Rs 1,54,999. The Flip 5 starts at Rs 99,999.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express If you know a thing or two about Madhav Sheth, you’ll know he’s not the one to mince his words. He is open and direct. After building Realme from scratch, his new role as HTech chief executive officer , sees Sheth taking up the challenge to “bring Honor back to our life”. Speaking exclusively to Financial Express.com’s Saurabh Singh , Sheth talks about his “sudden” exit from Realme, reasons for getting behind a brand like Honor soon after and what happens next. Excerpts. Firstly, congratulations on your new venture— HTech. Most people are wondering, why choose Honor and not a Micromax or a Lava? It’s all about bringing Honor back to our life and how I can help the Indian electronics industry to grow. We cannot discount the Chinese supply system; we all know that we must be dependent [on it]. The thought process behind why we’re moving in this direction [with Honor] is to ensure how I can make it more indigenized. Airtel Rs 279 prepaid plan with extended validity, unlimited calling launched in India — full details Jio versus Airtel: For Rs 395, which telco offers more benefits, better value with prepaid recharge plan? Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? Google to bump up free cloud storage from 15GB to 1TB for these individuals: Check benefits, eligibility, and more Also Read | India is critical for our success, working hard on affordable foldables: Samsung Mobile head TM Roh The reasoning is that the supply chain is still [largely] based out of China and to survive in this business, you need to have a robust supply chain and make global partnerships without which your existence would be completely minimalistic. Unfortunately, because of the economies of scale, Indian manufacturers do not have it [yet]. You also need a strong R&D in place [to succeed]. Honor has an R&D of about 17,000 people now. You’ve launched your first product, the Honor 90 smartphone. Where do you plan to go from here? We are planning a second launch very soon, probably before the end of this year. We are thinking of bringing more innovations and more localization into the market . Q1 2024 is the timeline that we are targeting internally to start local manufacturing. Where some of the innovations in India would be difficult to assemble, we will be moving a majority of our portfolio to India manufacturing. We have already talked with three partners. We’ll be signing the contracts very soon. Where does PSAV Global factor in? Will you be looking to onboard more partners as you start to grow? PSAV was the company that was doing business with Honor for laptops and tablets in India, and it had their licenses. We extended that to mobile phones to expand the network and bring Honor smartphones back to the market. If I had gone to Honor directly and started working on an agreement, it would have taken me six to nine months [to close everything]. So, it saved me time and expedited my launch which is why you see, me leaving Realme and announcing the Honor comeback, took hardly two months. That’s the speed with which I always love to work with. As for working with more such partners, for me, business is all about scaling up. If things and the ecosystem work in this place, I don’t mind taking other routes, which are shorter as well as compliant, and that’s something that we’ll be looking forward to. What is the problem that Honor is trying to fix? With so much competition, where does it fit in? Every other brand today has an umbrella brand. Vivo and iQOO have the same products. Samsung’s Galaxy M, F and A-series have the same products. Realme, OnePlus and Oppo have the same products. The same product is renamed and relabeled for different channels under different names with different marketing concepts and different callouts. But people understand that they are all surrogate products. India is a huge market with a huge population, and you cannot fool this population with surrogate products. The time is now right when consumers need a specific brand and not just surrogate products. Honor will be a substantial player in the next year itself. Even my one product launch, in two months’ time of my exit [from Realme], has triggered a lot of jitters in the industry. I believe a lot of brands in India will have sleepless nights once we start to launch more products and come full-fledged to the market before the end of next year. The way that I am going to do business will create a new benchmark. People have been critical about the Honor 90’s pricing. Your comment and was this the right product to start with? We did not want to position Honor just as a value-for-money brand but as a technology, innovation, and disruptive brand. The idea was to be different. So, the Honor 90 was definitely the right product to start with. As for critical conversations about the price point, I have been aware of them since day one and every single comment has been monitored by me personally. I am also aware of how many of those comments were seeded by competing brands. Their nervousness makes me excited. So, how are you positioning the brand in its second coming? We want to position Honor as a value brand, and not value for money, that can bring change through innovation and disruption to the industry. Clean software is something you spoke about openly at Realme, especially during the early days. We all saw how it turned out eventually. You’re making the same pitch with Honor as well. Will you be able to follow through this time? Having a bloat-free experience is something that I have always dreamed about. I believe that [software] experience should always be a priority and that experience cannot come at the cost of monetisation. Monetisation can be done, but in a way that it does not impact the experience of the user, which must be seamless. Maybe I have failed to convince my management in the past that that is the right way to go ahead, because monetisation always comes as a priority for a lot of brands. This time, the control of the operating system (OS) is in our hands, completely. What is the kind of investment you’re beginning with and how do you plan to be profitable with the approach that you are taking? We have already invested more than Rs 350 crore just in launching one product. This is not a small game. As for future investments, my yearly plans will be closed by November. Breaking even is always there on my mind. [Luckily] I have not had any glitches to get funding and so even with my new project, I’ve got money flowing in. Our investors know and believe that whatever I do, they are going to make money out of it. I’ll be very honest and candid in saying you put up the right price and not change the consumer experience [for monetisation’s sake]. It could take longer [to succeed] but would be more sustainable. Given your experience, is offline sales on your radar with Honor, a brand that’s largely been online-only all this time? It would be a mix of both online and offline put together. The reason is because in India, right now, we see the demographics demarcation is 50-50 in terms of the business value of online and offline sales. I believe that offline is over 70 percent and online is 30 percent. Even in the most mature markets in the world, where the 5G penetration is high, online is around 20-25 percent. So, offline experience becomes one of the most critical factors. And hence when you have very high-value products, the touch and feel is extremely important. We will be starting off big with online, but yes, we will be expanding to offline channels over a period. Honor has been doing foldables for a while and doing well there. Is that something you’re considering for India and if yes, how soon can we expect Honor to launch a phone like the Magic V2 in India? Unfortunately, the highly affluent users in India are not getting any differentiated products at this point of time. The iPhone 15 is a disappointment for a lot of people who are already using an iPhone 13 and iPhone 14. For them, there’s no difference as such, so probably what they are looking at is some differentiated products. And I think that’s where foldables come into the picture. When you have USD 1000-USD 2000 to spend, you want to be seen. Honor is doing a fantastic job with foldables. If you see the Honor Magic V2, it has a 5,000mAh battery and a slimness of around 9.9mm only. As for launching them in India, we are expecting at least one [foldable] product by the first half of next year. Our product roadmap will be finalized very soon. You’ve been an advocate of ecosystem play, what are your expansion plans with AIoT at HTech? I’ve always believed in ecosystems. Ecosystem play is extremely important for the consumers’ acquisition as well as for the consumers to stick to a brand for a longer period. It’s a no-brainer strategy for any brand to have complementing products. We will be planning and launching a few AIoT products very soon. Your expectations from the upcoming festive season? Consumers will be looking for better phones this festive season with price points of more than USD 300 or USD 250. Phones below Rs 15,000 will have a lot of struggles and I believe the brands [launching them] will have to face the heat. If you see it right now, you can probably see the price of 5G phones has dropped to around Rs 10,000. It is practically not possible to bring it this low. It has got more to do with the desperation of brands and to clear out their inventories. Also Read | Honor goes local under new brand name HonorTech; JV led by Indian leadership eyes 5% market share by 2024 As for HTech, we are happy to inform you that we are rolling out exciting festive offers valued at Rs 60 crores ensuring customer engagement and increased sales. As always, it was lovely to talk to you and as always, we appreciate the candor. While we’re on the subject, would you want to talk a little about Realme, why you left— what happened there? Over a period, when a brand is built and when you’re in the position of any CXO, your vision and your speed will be challenged at every single point. I would not like to get into this conversation now because I understand that probably this is [for the best]. What’s gone is gone.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Vivo’s market share in the above Rs 30,000 category rose to a substantial 22 percent in the second quarter of 2023 from just 3 percent in 202o, according to industry reports. Incidentally, 2020 was the year that Vivo debuted its X-series in India with the X50. With the new X100 series, the brand has even bigger ambitions and while it’s too early to put a number to it, Vivo says, it isn’t chasing them at least not anymore. The X100 phones, particularly the X100 Pro, challenge Samsung’s smartphone camera zoom dominance with powerful hardware but Vivo India ’s head of product management, Vikas Tagra believes, hardware tells only half the story. The secret sauce may be something else. Excerpts. The road from 3 percent to 22 percent— take us through the journey. How has the X-series evolved over the years? Airtel Rs 279 prepaid plan with extended validity, unlimited calling launched in India — full details Jio versus Airtel: For Rs 395, which telco offers more benefits, better value with prepaid recharge plan? Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? Google to bump up free cloud storage from 15GB to 1TB for these individuals: Check benefits, eligibility, and more Vikas: Three years back when we decided to start our X-series journey in India market , things were not easy. Earlier, the V-series used to be the flagship for us. But ultimately, for every brand, it’s the rub off effect which falls from top to bottom. We always wanted to gain some share in the premium market, and so we decided to conceptualise our X-series for that. We [have] emerged from 3 percent market share in the 30K plus category to 22 percent market share. It’s a huge jump for us and I think we were able to do it because of all the core technologies and experiences that we were able to bring to our consumers. Gimbal as a technology is one example. The X50 series was designed for the premium consumer looking for stability in camera experience. In the next generation, we collaborated with ZEISS [with the X60]. Both ZEISS and Vivo are pioneer companies with a camera-first approach. ZEISS is known for its century old optics and Vivo is also known for its camera expertise. We collaborated with ZEISS and took the portrait experience to the next level. Every phone can take portrait shots, but we worked with ZEISS to bring ample number of options for people to add artistic effects in portraits like swirly bokeh effects with the Biotar [ZEISS lens] and all that. But we did not stop there. In the X80 we brought anamorphic lens effects that otherwise cost lakhs of rupees. Then we could figure out that night photography was a consumer pain-point. We addressed that by bringing a 1-inch [type] sensor. Our endeavor has been to enable consumers to live out unimaginable things that they were unable to do a few years back. What does it say about the India market’s appetite for premium phones and features? Vikas: In India, the premium segment market is very niche. There are very few players. But what we have understood from consumers is that it’s not a numbers game anymore. Megapixels are a thing of the past. We have given a telephoto in our X100 series but while other brands may relate it with 50X, 100X, for us it is different. We tried to figure out the most often used scenarios for telephoto by consumers and found that they want to capture golden moments like sunrise and sunset, but they are still struggling to get it right. So, we got the APO telephoto setting from ZEISS, an industry standard, for the first time on the X100 Pro. We even put the largest aperture of f/2.5 on a Vivo phone yet. So, if you can give some unique perspective and proposition, then the Indian consumer will take it regardless of whether you are a new entrant in the segment, or you’ve been doing this for years? Vikas: I will put it in this way: as a product manager, if you don’t know your consumer, you can’t create a product, it will be just another commodity. Right now, in the smartphone industry, you see everyone has a chip. Everyone has some or the other display. We have been able to take the game forward because we understand our consumers need better. If you can tap on to the right consumer at the right time, the game will be yours. With rise in Generative AI and algorithms taking centre stage, have we passed the phase where hardware would govern everything (and by extension buying decisions)? Vikas: Generative AI and computational photography are going to enhance the consumer experience even if it is a wait and watch thing [right now]. But as a company, we need to strike the right balance with the hardware and software. That is what we are working on. We have been writing algorithms which are specific for different scenarios but at the same time, you’ll need hardware and optics to support them. That is the secret sauce behind our success and that’s why consumers are liking our imaging capabilities. We are not talking about just numbers but about the quality of the output or the quality of the images, which our consumers are going to enjoy. Likewise, are moon shots passe considering how your new phones shoot for the sun? Vikas: Consumer won’t tell you to bring some technology or feature. As a brand, you should analyse what they are using or what are the most used scenarios. We invest a lot in consumer research and over the last few months and the last generation, we could figure out that people are still struggling to capture the sun. So, why not write some special algorithms to make those golden moments more delightful? Whether it the warm tone or shape, consumers want to look at them in their full glory. We are not here to compete with anyone. As a brand, our endeavor has always been to better our game every time with the previous generation. A lot of loyalists buy our devices. They are camera enthusiasts. We just want to elevate this experience for them. Your choice of a MediaTek chip (and not Qualcomm) in the X100 series is proving to be a bit polarising. What do you have to say about that? Vikas: The first thing that our X-series and V-series consumers, who we call premium consumers, look for, is the design, how does it look in the hands, is it ergonomically fit, easy to carry, and whether the camera module looks beautiful or not. The second thing they look at is whether the camera is good or not. The chip frankly comes later. We decided to go ahead with the flagship MediaTek Dimensity 9300 for the simple reason because when it comes to the performance of the device, our imaging expectations are very high and the D9300 was the perfect choice to enhance our ISP capabilities. We have also worked with MediaTek in establishing better anti-shake capability in our camera. People feel a better processor means better performance in games only, but we have gone beyond that. It’s just not about gaming experience. It’s also to do with the ISP capabilities. What is taken into consideration while pricing these phones? Vikas: When it comes to our X-series pricing, we make sure it should be within the reach of our consumers and we should not vary too much as compared to our last generation because if the delta is too high, you end up losing many consumers. We make sure there are enough affordability schemes to make these aspirational phones, expensive phones, affordable to our consumers.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Founded 16 years ago in Santa Barbara, California, the brand Sonos is synonymous with smart speakers. Known for their easy installation, thoughtful software, and pristine sound, Sonos speakers adorn the lives of more than 7 million households, according to some industry reports. Its India story, though, is relatively new kicking off officially only in 2021 when it set up shop here in partnership with Sun Group subsidiary Luxury Personified . The portfolio has grown sizeably since then. The underlying technology , too. Take the new Era 100 and Era 300 for instance . While the entry-level Era 100 adds stereo and improved bass, the Era 300 brings spatial audio inside a reasonably portable form-factor. Sonos never ceases to impress. Speaking exclusively to Financial Express.com’s Saurabh Singh , Kylie Muntean, audio systems engineer at Sonos, takes us through the nitty-gritties of the brand, what it does and why it does it, India focus, and the fateful ruling in its long-standing legal patent battle with tech giant Google. Excerpts. Let me start by saying it is an absolute pleasure to be speaking to you today. The brand Sonos and its great legacy need little introduction. Still, I would like to start off with a little background into what you have been doing. Airtel’s cheapest prepaid plan gets you unlimited data for less than Rs 10 — validity, other benefits Airtel Rs 279 prepaid plan with extended validity, unlimited calling launched in India — full details Jio versus Airtel: For Rs 395, which telco offers more benefits, better value with prepaid recharge plan? Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? In the past few years, we have had the goal to launch three products a year and we have been doing that. The idea is, we want [to make] products that move people. If people have different lifestyle experiences, we want them to have a product that will allow them to listen to music in that space. We want to create an experience, not just a product and so, we are creating [those] experiences. What kind of a brand is Sonos, how do you position yourself in the market ? The way we call [it internally], Sonos is a premium brand. It is a mass brand accessible to everyone, just at the premium level. Let us talk a bit about how Sonos does music. What is the approach and what are the focus areas? When you think of how people hear music, there is a story [in there]. It starts with an artist who has an idea, they go, and they record it. The producers make sure that it sounds like they want it. Then it goes into a streaming format. From there, it goes into a speaker that plays it for the listener. So, there are a lot of steps and what Sonos strives to do is to make the experience that the consumer is hearing is the same as the artist’s intent. Also Read | HTech CEO Madhav Sheth accuses competition of selling ‘surrogate products’, calls iPhone 15 a ‘disappointment’ If you look through that whole chain, we are getting the same experience that the artist was trying to put out. Adding a stereo tweeter to the Era 100, makes it [sound] truer to the artist’s intent because you are going to get that space in that air that the Sonos One was not able to deliver. The Era 300 [likewise] is bringing a different level of content that people are going to [now] listen to. Now that the artists are mixing in Dolby Atmos, we are going to have a speaker that plays back that immersive audio. So, we just want to complete that chain so that people can hear the artist’s intent into music. The Era 100 seems like a mighty powerful product for its compact size. Could you take us through the features that make it truly special? One of the things that is cool about the Era 100 is how much more deep bass comes out of it. It is still the same acoustic volume [as the Sonos One] so the fact that we can get so much more low-end out of it, is a cool feat of technology. The design is also much more elegant than the One. The box design is a little dated now. But it is [definitely] the sound experience that sells it. Elsewhere, we have a new lean user interface, and the speaker now connects with Bluetooth. You can also directly connect line-in from an auxiliary cord. And what about the Era 300, your flagship product? If you were to think of the chain of events, you would have an artist mixing in a room filled with say seven speakers and then Dolby will make a file that plays back on seven speakers in someone else’s house. The feat that we did is, we took those seven speakers, or more precisely, the equivalent of seven speakers, and we made it come out of one speaker by sending sound all over the room and reflecting it off the walls. That is a huge thing because now, you do not need to buy seven speakers. You can just buy a single speaker and get the same experience. We work closely with the top artists in the community. All the top producers and mixers are saying, this –spatial audio— is the future and we – Sonos— need to do this and we need to do it right, because if you do it wrong, it is going to fall apart. So, working directly with them, we made sure that we were bringing something cutting-edge that was going to represent their sound to the world accurately. But how do you bring that sense of balance on speakers across different price points? Our approach is the same whether it is the Era 100 or the Era 300. The Era 300 just has that much more technology in it than the Era 100. I know it can get tricky. Fortunately, at Sonos, the user experience and the sound experience are the top deciders and so, we do not compromise [on] those experiences for costs. I would also like to add that these are sustainable products which was a huge cost add. It was cheaper not to do it that way [but we did it anyway] and so we care enough to add that cost to make it that way. We do balance things in a thoughtful way. Do you tailor sound depending on the market, like India is seen as a bass-preferring region among other brands? We do not flavour the sound [basis of the market]. We want the sound to come back like how the artist designed it. Drake throws tons of bass in there and we want the sound to be all bass and all highs because that is how he mixes it. And so, if the sound is mixed in that favourable way to, let us say, have people like it here, if it is deeper bass in general, then that is how the speaker will play it. We do not want to touch it. Of course, we always have the same user control things that we provide with all our speakers. You can turn up the bass, you can turn up the treble. It is all adjustable to taste. So that way in case your personal flavour is different from what the artist intended, that is fine, too. We still allow that. Talk a little bit about India as a market for Sonos. How excited are you about the prospects here? We want to create products that move people. There is an emotional connection that everyone has to music. From my own personal standpoint, I am working for a consumer audio company because I want to bring high-quality audio to as many people as possible. I think that should be a global thing. I think everyone should have access to high-quality audio in their homes and so knowing that the market her in India has so many people that want that focused listening experience, it is just a great application to have Sonos here in their living rooms as well. We are trying to make sure that it is more accessible to people. You have recently suffered a big setback in your ongoing legal patent dispute with Google in California, US, with the federal judge terming your key patents unenforceable and invalid, theoretically tossing out the USD 32.5 million verdict you won in San Francisco in May. Any comment? I cannot speak specifically to that. I have been told not to speak to that. All I can say is that we create lots of great ideas and we have a great team behind us and that is all we want to do, to be innovative. What does the future look like for Sonos? Any updates there? I am excited for what we are working on. I cannot say anything more to it, but I love working here because we do very interesting things. Working with producers, mixers, these multi-Grammy award-winning people and having them teach us exactly how to hear the tiny details of what’s right and what’s wrong and learning that critical listening skill, has been an amazing experience.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express For Salesforce, the modern-day world is a combination of four things: CRM, data, AI, and trust. The company piloted a lot of strides in customer relationship management when it was founded, some 24 years back (along with SaaS and cloud) and did it so well, everybody knows Salesforce as “the CRM company” today. With AI, it wants to do the same thing, in fact, it wants to champion the cause and by extension, help its customers stay ahead of the curve. It’s all connected. The numbers seem to suggest, it’s winning. Senior company executives say compared to peers like Microsoft, Salesforce has accomplished a lot more in a much shorter span of time and so, the aim —now— is to be the “fastest to 50 billion [in revenue].” The company may have its roots in San Francisco, California, but its India story is starting to get a lot more interesting and while you may not have considered India as very tech-savvy in the past, in the present day and into the future, it is cruising. No wonder, Salesforce is looking at India as a big opportunity both in terms of talent and growth. Speaking exclusively to FE.com’s Saurabh Singh, Arun Kumar Parameswaran, Senior Vice President & Managing Director, Salesforce India, takes us through the journey on the sidelines of the launch of the company’s latest State of Data and Analytics industry report. Excerpts. Airtel Rs 279 prepaid plan with extended validity, unlimited calling launched in India — full details Jio versus Airtel: For Rs 395, which telco offers more benefits, better value with prepaid recharge plan? Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? Google to bump up free cloud storage from 15GB to 1TB for these individuals: Check benefits, eligibility, and more Salesforce in India – what is the story so far? Arun: In India, we’ve quadrupled in size in the last four years from 2,500 to 10,000. We have centres of excellence in Hyderabad. We do a lot of cutting-edge engineering development work for our customers. We see a huge growth story in India. I think there’s a generational opportunity. Honestly, in the last 30 years, I haven’t seen a demand pipe that is this robust, and that cuts across all industries, all segments, and all customer sizes. I’ve seen secular growth trends in the past, but they were specific to certain industries, like when you saw the whole wave around 4G happening, it was predominantly a telco wave. Then there were waves around financial services, but we’ve never seen anything that is so massive in terms of the breadth of demand, if you will. And I think that the country is also uniquely positioned with a lot of the macroeconomic environmental factors in our favour. It almost feels like there’s the rest of the world and there’s India, a public digital infrastructure stack that is second to none today. In fact, I think we’re leading the world in terms of what we’ve done building that digital infrastructure to scale. And that’s helping every company whether you’re a 10-man organisation, or a 10,000-man organisation, aspire to be digital. Salesforce in India – where do you go from here? Arun : We are the largest Salesforce entity outside the US. The beauty is that Salesforce is looking at India, not just from one dimension, but multiple dimensions. One dimension is the talent pool. The second dimension is the market itself. If you think about the different parts of the world, the macroeconomic picture is so dire when you look at it and then [when] you look at India, it feels like you’re in two different universes altogether. India has a very strong macroeconomic foundation and hopefully it’s our decade. From a company perspective, there’s a very clear view that we should be front and centre [here]. If you [can] solve problems for India, that pretty much works everywhere in the world. That’s the other incentive for the company to continue to innovate for India, or Bharat, which is again turning out to be an interesting, almost secular trend by itself. That then becomes a complete pivot into the rest of the world, if you will. It’s always encouraging to get this kind of view from leaders like yourself. It’s fantastic how far India has come and how well Salesforce is doing. Do you want to take us through the report now. We can’t help but point out, it’s coming at an interesting moment in time. Arun: You’re right. Our latest State of Data and Analytics report comes at a time where it couldn’t be more relevant because at the end of the day, data powers everything from a machine learning and an AI perspective. And trusted data is probably the biggest challenge that every C-suite executive is grappling with. We’ve surveyed over 10,000 folks in the line of analytics, IT, and business leaders from 18 countries. We had about 300 odd people from India who participated in this. We found that there’s an absolute gold rush for making sure that people have their ducks lined up in a row in this space because more than anything, they are worried about what they’re going to miss out on. More than 92 percent of the leaders believe that advancements in AI, specifically generative AI, make data management a much higher priority than where it was before. More than 75 percent are worried about how competition is going to have a leg-up on them, if they don’t have the initiatives to drive the insights from this data with AI. A lot of questions are coming up on security and trust as well. The other big piece is that generative AI is cool in a lot of ways, but it can also provide a lot of inaccurate information. And so, data accuracy, how do you cut out the noise, how do you remove bias, a lot of these things are top of the mind, as people start putting this to meaningful use that is much beyond writing poems and creating marketing campaigns. The moment you want to start trusting AI to be as autonomous as you think it can be, now, you have to worry about ten other pieces. I also think that governance is top of mind. What is your position on AI regulation as a company? Arun: We’re one of the top five software companies in the world and so, we get invited to a lot of conversation in this area. In fact, I know that our CEO Marc Benioff and a few others were invited to the White House when they had a closed-door conversation around AI, and what’s happening in the larger domain. We participated in a similar one in the UK. And so, we’re part of a lot of these conversations around ethical use of AI, in fact, we have an executive whose role is just to make sure that as we embed AI into the core of everything that we do, we are acutely focused on also making sure that we’re not crossing lines that we should not. I think it’s still very early days, in terms of where this is heading from a regulation perspective. People and companies are rushing to deploy and use AI, a subject that’s still new and evolving— and prone to risk. What is Salesforce doing to minimise that risk? Arun: We’re not saying AI just for AI’s sake. We’re saying, think about AI in combination with data and trust, and more importantly, customer relationship management (CRM), because at the end of the day, the heart of all your customer data sits in your CRM platform. Our view is that the best answers you’re going to get from AI, generative or predictive, are going to come from a combination of data that you trust the most, which is your customer data, which we as a SaaS vendor, have an obligation and a commitment to make sure we take care of. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a Mayura Bakery in Bangalore, or you’re the National Security Agency. Both these customers get the same level of security, trust, and enforceability from a Salesforce platform perspective. Today, we make probably two trillion predictions per day from a predictive AI perspective on our Einstein platform at Salesforce. When we take you on that journey, it will include multiple things including your own large language model or it could be a public LLM that you’re using, the way we work with that is we don’t keep copies of your data. We will only look for veracity of the data and the accuracy of the information we’re providing. Every customer in the world has access to the same capabilities across the board. It’s a huge differentiator for us. And particularly in the world that we come in, where you have people who are sitting on versions that are five generations behind, our promise is we will keep you current, and we’ll keep you where you need to be. Your views on India’s AI-readiness, adoption, opportunities, and challenges? Arun: Because of India’s inherent scale, we will find unique use cases and solutions that the world will probably not see or not want. That will propel us to the top of the chart. A lot of the demographics in India are crying for help on automation and AI is going to solve a lot of problems that otherwise we would have no way of solving. So, in some ways, I would almost say that our demographics are going to force adoption faster. What we don’t know is at our scale, how would the pricing economics work. I think that’s the piece that needs to be seen. Right now, if you look at all the use cases, a lot of it is in customer service, a lot of it is around content, how can we make things autonomous, etc. If you truly start trying to solve some of India’s problems at scale, that’s going to put a lot of stress on the resources. The cost of being able to deliver that is what we need to see as we evolve into those large-scale solutions that will solve large problems for the society here in India. Then we’ll have to see how economically viable it becomes for us to do it. It’s still early. But I foundationally believe that, like a lot of the leapfrogs that we’ve seen in technology over the last 20 years, India will leapfrog in a number of ways because of this AI growth curve that we’re seeing. I don’t know the exact numbers, but India probably already has more users on DigiYatra, than CLEAR has had in the US over the last 10 years. I use CLEAR because I travel a lot to the US and it makes my life so much simpler at security checkpoint, but I’ve been paying USD 150 for that service. And I am thinking about what we’ve developed with DigiYatra, here in India. You can imagine that, in less than 12 months, if we’ve done more at essentially the cheapest cost possible to make this a free public digital infrastructure, here’s a classical example of where we bought AI to solve a problem at large scale that India represents. It’s not like we are saying that at some point we’re going to start charging for this either. It looks like it’s going to be a free service, primarily because we want to solve the congestion problem in airports and enhance customer experiences. We can see how AI is helping to solve large-scale problems, that otherwise, we had no other way of solving other than throwing more bodies at the problem, which can become a huge challenge at some point. DigiYatra for me is AI at work, every day. What is the talent pool like in India right now in terms of people who are educated and capable in this space? More importantly, are you hiring? [At a time when Big Tech layoffs are becoming increasingly commonplace, we believe that’s a pertinent question.] Arun: One of the good things that’s happened in India over the last five years is the number of data scientists, data analysts and people who can work on data models has absolutely gone through the roof. So, the foundation from a data perspective is there. If you were to think about innovation in generative AI, core large language models, a lot of that is still predominantly, Silicon Valley, West Coast [between Silicon Valley and Seattle] that probably comprises 80 percent of the innovation that’s happening today. But I think India is catching up fast and furious. We’re hiring across the board with a very clear view that every platform of Salesforce will have these capabilities embedded in it. When mobile became the latest fad, 12-14 years back, we said, we’ll make every platform fully mobile capable. When we got into predictive AI, 5-6 years back, we said, okay, Einstein is going to be embedded in everything we build, and therefore, everybody who comes on board should have these capabilities. And you’ll see that we will continue to hire in this space across a multitude of capabilities. In terms of where that talent is, I’d probably say in early stages, but again, you know how this country works, people spot a gold rush and then everyone will be heading in that direction. So, in a couple of years’ time, I think we will start seeing meaningful contributions and innovations coming out of India. Conversely, what is your take on concerns that AI will take away jobs ? Arun: Every technology shift that’s come in the last 30 years, has come with the first worry that it’s going to take away jobs. If you look at what’s happened subsequently, it’s not just not taken away jobs, if anything, it has spurred an entire generation of new jobs. What you can expect is a little bit of volatility in the short and medium term. Automation has always gone after low-value repeatable jobs that can be replaced. What AI is threatening to do is exactly that, which is, if you’re in a space where you’re doing something that’s of relatively low value that the system can accomplish, you should expect that it is going to be taken over. But it doesn’t mean that there is no role for those people. There is still going to be a whole bunch of jobs that will be created for managing those platforms. Yes, if you’re in an industry where you’re doing certain things that can be automated at scale, then there is going to be disruption. But there are also going to be new roles and new jobs that are going to be created over the course of the next 3-5 years. If you look at the stages of AI, today, it’s predominantly a user intervention driven AI model, and the future being autonomous general insurance at some point, which people are saying anywhere between 2027-2030. That’s a very long road to getting to a point where you’re going to have Autonomous General Intelligence (AGI) come into play in the mainstream. In that process, we will see roles and jobs evolve, new capabilities, and more enablement for people to take up some of these things and move away from what they know is going to get disrupted. And what about concerns of AI becoming larger than life and taking over humanity— from reel to real? Arun: Technology has been and will continue to remain a force for good. And I think the benefits far outweigh the downside risks of how technology can be used. But companies need to take a step back on behalf of their customers and have conversations around security, trust, the ethical use of AI, and put guardrails to make sure that this technology [remains] a force for good. That is why a lot of companies, like Salesforce, are taking very measured, but very agile steps to make sure that our customers benefit from this revolution but are also secure in making decisions. You can’t underscore the threat, but I would want to point backwards to history and say this is not the first time we’ve seen a technology that has the potential not just to be a force for good, but also to bring unintended consequences. We’ve always found a way to make sure that it stays on the right side of that line. There have been guardrails around how technology has evolved and deployed in the past, and there’s no reason to believe that we can’t do the same with AI. We’re in the very early stages of a hype curve, but the only difference between this hype curve and the rest is that this can get past the chasm of uncertainty or where people don’t get the benefits, because the benefits are going to be obvious in this case. We will see some very striking benefits for businesses and therefore it will quickly cross the chasm and go into a quick adoption curve. This technology revolution is very different from what we’ve seen in the past, and it’s going to come at a cost that is going to be very affordable, at least from what we can see right now. How do you see (and deal with) competition, which is frankly starting to get tighter in this space? Arun: I go back to the famous Intel CEO [Andy Grove], quote, “Paranoid, alone survive”. We must be paranoid, not just to survive, but to thrive. For a company of our size, complexity, and size of customer base, [if you] look at our growth rates, and look at the pace at which we are innovating, I think that’s truly impressive. But the reason we are there is because we’re constantly paranoid about the fact that if we don’t innovate, we won’t grow. If we won’t grow, we can’t invest, which means we can’t innovate. It’s a vicious cycle. And so, we’re constantly looking at everybody around us and saying, are we innovating ahead of competition? Secondly, as companies grow bigger, the inevitable issues of how easy you are to do business with comes up and it’s something that we’re very acutely focused on inside the company in terms of how we engage with customers, both internally and externally. There are multiple lenses with which we look at competition. At the end of the day, competition is what keeps you alive, keeps you on your toes, and it’s required. The opportunity is so large that there is enough for everybody here. Follow FE Tech Bytes on Twitter , Instagram , LinkedIn , Facebook .

    "article_content": "The Financial Express As Xiaomi brings its most expensive phone yet— the Xiaomi 14 Ultra— to India, the country is divided. At the one end, there’s a collective sigh of relief that Xiaomi has finally launched a premium flagship phone, alongside making a bunch of other announcements all centred around “premiumisation” of the market. On the other side, there’s talk of who will buy a 1 lakh Xiaomi phone and if Xiaomi is in fact, also overcharging its customers. But regardless of what side you’re on, you can’t contest that Xiaomi finally has a plan and a new-found level of confidence, to make a big splash in the flagship phone market. We sat with Xiaomi India chief marketing officer, Anuj Sharma, the morning after its big Xiaomi 14 series launch event in the National Capital, to make a sense of everything— why the 14 Ultra costs 1 lakh, who should buy it, but even more importantly, where does Xiaomi go from here. Excerpts. Firstly, congratulations on [finally] making a splash in the premium phone category. The Xiaomi 14 Ultra was probably the industry ’s best kept secret. Let’s start with availability. You’ve consciously kept stocks limited in the past. What is the status for the Xiaomi 14 and Xiaomi 14 Ultra? Airtel Rs 279 prepaid plan with extended validity, unlimited calling launched in India — full details Jio versus Airtel: For Rs 395, which telco offers more benefits, better value with prepaid recharge plan? Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? Google to bump up free cloud storage from 15GB to 1TB for these individuals: Check benefits, eligibility, and more Anuj: Getting the Xiaomi 14 and 14 Ultra [to India] is a conscious decision. What we did with the 13 Pro, now we’re splitting that audience so people who wanted to get the 13 Pro but couldn’t because Rs 80,000 was a little too much, with the 14, it becomes a lot more accessible. We’re expecting to sell at least about three to four times more 14s than the 13 Pro. And so, we are planning the supply in such a way that we can meet that demand. For the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, it [stock] is in evaluation process. It’s a completely new price point for us. We still have a month [for sale to go live] which is a luxury by Xiaomi standards. We never really have this kind of timeline. So, we’re looking at what we can do in a month’s time. We are opening the Xiaomi 14 Ultra Reserve Edition on the 11 th [of March] for pre-booking. That is going to be super limited. I don’t know if I can put that number out yet but it’s a small number. It comes with a whole bunch of things [in the box] which also need to be put together. The 14 Ultra is obviously a big step. So, we’ll see how it does and how many true photographers are out there [who would buy it]. With the 14, I’m hoping that we should be able to supply [for the demand]. The 14 ultra is an experiment for us. We don’t want to over-forecast in any manner. While you say that it’s an experiment, but it also appears that you’re putting your foot down this year and getting serious about the premium flagship space. Or at least, that’s what all your announcements seem to suggest. Anuj: We’re fairly confident about the device[s], but we also have to be cognizant of the fact that there’s a large audience that’s not seen Xiaomi at the Rs 1 lakh price point. The 14 ultra is going to be a device that may not be for everyone unless you are a serious photographer. Unless you understand the optics and unless you are capable of getting the most out of that system, you’re going to be utilizing only 30-40% of what it’s capable of. For most people, the 14 might be more than enough. So that’s how we’re looking at it. The overall response that we’ve got on the 14 series wherever it’s launched has also given us a lot of confidence. The last time we launched an Ultra was without Leica optics. That was 2021. And at that point, the gap between the Xiaomi 11 Ultra and essentially any of the top two flagships was not as much as the gap is today. We launched the 11 ultra at 70k. I think you were getting other devices at about 1 lakh. Today, this is at 1 lakh, but everyone else has gone to like a 1 lakh 50. So, it starts becoming [more] value for money from a flagship perspective. Of course you’re [still] undercutting Apple and Samsung in pricing, but there’s growing chit-chatter that Xiaomi is now “overcharging” people in India for the 14 series. What do you have to say to that? Anuj: The innovation and R&D do not come cheap and that is reflected in the cost of the device[s]. The whole is more than the sum of its parts. With the Xiaomi 14 series, we are talking to the innovators and the early adopters. The mass majority will wait for these guys and then they will just follow through. I remember back in 2016-17, the same set of people used to complain about the Apple devices— Why would I pay 60-70k for the iPhone 6S Plus? Now, those guys are willing to line up to get a device which is almost reaching three times that cost. The majority of the folks are looking at somebody else to tell them if it’s good or not, and we see this as a 2 to 3-year process before everyone else starts realizing this. Even after that also, you may or may not like it. Not everyone has to like the same movie. Not everyone has to like the same car . Not everyone has to like the same phone. Personally, I’m super excited because this is just the start of the Xiaomi-Leica journey and in just two years, we’ve come so far. Imagine what will happen in the future. Leica cameras are also super expensive. So in a way the Xiaomi 14 and 14 Ultra are probably the most affordable entry-point to using an “actual” Leica camera? Anuj: That’s a little hard to put. The cheapest Leica camera in India which is the Q3 is about Rs 4.65 lakhs. On the other side, we are also cognizant of the fact that it’s unfair to compare. I don’t think it will be right for us to say what you get on that Leica camera, you’re getting here. It’s not. You just cannot. The physics of it all will not get you there. All we’re trying to do is, to bridge the gap. These phones sit somewhere in the middle of smartphone photography, and what those cameras are capable of. We [have] just started to depart [from] where the [conventional] smartphone photography is, but there’s still a long distance [to cover]. And I’m hoping with the Xiaomi x Leica Optical Institute, we’ll get closer. But at the end of it, I don’t think we can discount the physics. The Xiaomi 14 Ultra Reserve Edition doesn’t bundle the full photography kit. Will you launch it separately in India? Anuj: The photography kit is not coming to India. Because of the electronics that are built into it, it will require a separate set of certifications which we don’t have yet. But the most exciting part about the photography kit which is the ability to put different filters is still there [in the Reserve Edition box]. Will it be possible to buy these filters separately? Anuj: No, they will be available with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra Reserve Edition only. Xiaomi priority club is another interesting initiative you’re launching alongside the 14 series? How do you sign-up for it and will there be any charges? No. There are certain set of devices [flagship phones and TVs] that, the moment you buy into that device, you are part of the priority club. The list includes: Mi 11 Ultra, Xiaomi 12 Pro, Xiaomi 13 Pro and Xiaomi 14 series, Mi QLED TV 75, Xiaomi OLED Vision TV 55, and Xiaomi Smart TV X 65 2023. I see you’re wearing the Xiaomi Band 8 Pro. Nice. Whatever happened with that and why does Xiaomi not launch its bands in India anymore? Any update on Xiaomi Watch S3 and Watch 2? Anuj: People want to hear the word watch more than a band now. There are a lot of watches out there which do less than what a band could do and less accurately versus what a band could do. But unfortunately, this is the larger messaging that’s kind of leading them astray. And because of that, we’ve held back on the band launches in India. Everywhere else in the world, our bands are still doing really well. Since the first Mi band, people have loved them for the accuracy, the details and of course the battery life . So, it’s going to be a tough one. We’re trying to see how we can straddle between band and watch. But watch is an area that we are actively working on [to bring to India]. We’re hoping to start looking at it [more actively] this year to see what we can do on the watch side. India, unfortunately from a wearables perspective, is running a very different tune versus the rest of the world. Right now, it’s in the downward price spiral which is at least from what we’re seeing, there’s a severe compromise on quality. Till that can be solved for, we’ll have to probably see how we tread these waters. And what about foldables? Are you considering them for India launch? What are the challenges? Anuj: We’re considering [foldables]. But there are still certain things that we need to iron out until that happens. It’s a little tough, but we are considering. There’s a lot of R&D that goes in right from the panel to the glass that you need to do. At the moment there are three aspects of a foldable device that don’t really work too well in the Indian market . First is that they are very expensive, so the entry barrier is so high that for me to experience a proper fold, I need to go well beyond [a price point] where a super flagship could come. The second aspect is the build itself in terms of how thick it is and the weight that’s another barrier for mass adoption. People are not very comfortable with something that’s more than half a pound or quarter of a kg in their pocket. That also needs to be solved. And the third one is essentially, how do you solve for the dust? Because these are foldable devices, they unfortunately also come with a certain amount of fragility, and in a country like ours, it’s very easy to get dust inside when you’re folding it which can lead to more failures. So, till we solve for price, form factor and the sturdiness, they are still going to be slightly niche. Follow FE Tech Bytes on Twitter , Instagram , LinkedIn , Facebook .

    "article_content": "The Financial Express As Xiaomi 14 series goes on sale in India starting today, we’re sure that many of you are curious about its Leica camera setup. That setup is one-of-its-kind, whether you pick the top-of-the-line Xiaomi 14 Ultra or relatively compact and more affordable Xiaomi 14. While the 14 has a custom Light Fusion-900 sensor and a floating lens telephoto, the 14 Ultra gets you the 1-inch LYT-900 and a stepless variable telephoto system. The idea is to gather more light, as much of it as possible, to get you the most true-to- life photos, but then, you can’t contest the fact that they are still smartphones. They have their limitations which is why it becomes all the more difficult to fashion the kind of tech the duo has managed to pull off with today’s technology . But even more importantly, Xiaomi and Leica are going the extra mile to define new standards for optical quality with the newly announced Xiaomi x Leica Optical Institute, to make all that’s impossible now, possible in the near future. Airtel Rs 279 prepaid plan with extended validity, unlimited calling launched in India — full details Jio versus Airtel: For Rs 395, which telco offers more benefits, better value with prepaid recharge plan? Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? Google to bump up free cloud storage from 15GB to 1TB for these individuals: Check benefits, eligibility, and more In an exclusive interview with FE’s Saurabh Singh, Pablo Acevedo Noda, head of development and engineering for mobile at Leica Camera AG, decodes the whole Xiaomi 14 series camera system for our readers while sharing key insights into the ongoing partnership with Xiaomi and what it would entail going forward. Firstly, congratulations on the new devices. It’s wonderful that more people can [now] access them, but more importantly, this camera system the two of you have meticulously designed together. Can you tell us one thing you love about Xiaomi. It could be an ideology, working style, or something else. Pablo: I like that everything is possible with Xiaomi when we sit down to get to a concept about a product. In my experience with other companies in the past, there was always a line that we could never cross. With Xiaomi, it has always been like, let’s work together and let’s make it happen. What were the biggest challenges while putting everything together inside the relatively compact chassis of the Xiaomi 14? Pablo: The main challenge was the lens design. We are using Summilux lenses [in the Xiaomi 14 series], which means [potentially] higher light intake in the system and that was one of the main challenges for the Xiaomi 14. Also, being able to get a customised sensor with 13.5 EV [exposure value] stops was another big challenge. What is custom about the Light Fusion 900 sensor inside the Xiaomi 14 and how is it different from the LYT-900 in the 14 Ultra? Pablo: What is custom about it, I cannot tell. But the dual ISO sensitivity or capture is the main characteristic that is new for this sensor. That allows to capture more dynamic range. As I was mentioning before, that’s 13.5 EV stops for the Xiaomi 14 [and 14 EVs for the 14 Ultra]. The pixel size is also different. The LYT-900 is a 1-inch sensor. The Light Fusion-900 is 1 / 1.3”. That means the 14 Ultra gets a little bit more light or let’s say better signal-to-noise ratio. So that means a little bit less noise in low light situations. But the difference will be almost negligible for the standard users. What are the advantages of the Summilux lens setup in the Xiaomi 14 series [over the last generation that came with Summicron lenses]? Pablo: At Leica, what we consider Summilux lenses are the ones below f/1.8 aperture. The big difference is basically the light intake. We are capable of getting more light to the sensor with the Summilux lenses and that really is the first big step to improve photography. The more light you get, the better signal-to-noise ratio, and then from then on everything is a little bit easier. The miniaturisation of the components is not as hard once you get more light into the system. Is there any particular area that benefits due to the new lenses? Pablo: Well, basically the challenging situations in low light, will see the most visible benefits. But at the same time, with faster lenses with an aperture of f/1.6, you get shallower depth of field, so you also get a more photographic feeling with a little bit better blurring or natural bokeh effect. Those two things are really interesting on both devices. The stepless variable aperture design is also interesting and as far as we can recall, unheard of in modern-day smartphones. Can you take us through how it works? Pablo: There are 4 presets in the regular photo mode [f/1.6, f/2.0, f/2.8 and f/4.0] and in the pro mode you can use the stepless [aperture] and get granular controls, so you can do a f/2.45 for example. The variable aperture was one of the most important features for the 14 ultra. This is the first time that we have a variable aperture on a 1-inch sensor in the market and there is a whole logic that was part of research and development in which the device decides based on the content of the scene, what is better to use. So for example, if you get a group photo, you will have a close f/2.0 or f/2.8 depending on the number of people at the distance so that you can get everybody in focus. If there is too much movement, then you might get f/1.6 so that the shutter speed is much shorter. There are plenty of other things like the conditions of the lighting and stuff like that. So, all of this comes into play to define the logic that is used anytime that you are pointing at a scene and doing the capture. Cut to the Xiaomi 14 and you have a floating lens system. Is it a workaround or a full-proof solution to getting more zoom without compromising on form factor and size? Pablo: The floating lens group inside the lens system for the 75-millimetre telephoto camera [in the Xiaomi 14] is there to reduce aberrations. The close focusing distance can also be achieved without a floating lens group, but we have introduced it coming from our own camera systems in a way that, as we were saying before, the light intake is the most important part and how that light gets to the sensor is super important. So, if we are able to reduce the aberrations on the first step, we don’t have to do post-processing to get those aberrations corrected afterwards. That’s the most important part [use case] of the floating lens group. What is your take on lens simulations in smartphones or as Xiaomi calls the master lens system in the 14 series? Pablo: The master system is developed exclusively by Xiaomi. It’s not something that Leica collaborates on. The simulation of lenses is a very interesting topic. What Xiaomi has been able to achieve already, I haven’t asked, but I could say that there might have been some inspiration [from Leica lenses]. It’s really important for users to get a nice portrait mode with different focal lenses. It will be more prevalent or more present in the future phones and it just brings more versatility to the users, so it’s always welcome. Any steps that you’ve taken to minimise lens flare? Vivo and ZEISS have T* coating and it works well enough. Pablo: We have special coatings developed together with Xiaomi and they are present in all of our flagship devices if I’m not mistaken, at least on the main cameras. We are also starting the Xiaomi x Leica Optical Institute and one of the topics [of research there] is lenses and coatings. So, there will be more research done and hopefully we will find the solutions that can be integrated in future forms. That institute is very interesting. Would you be able to share any more details? Pablo: We have been working together since June last year. The aim is to do research in all the different aspects related to the imaging pipeline — from lenses to sensors to ISP tuning and evaluation as well as trying to also integrate automation in those processes so that we are able to reach higher levels of quality in a shorter time span. Will it be open source so competitors can also maybe benefit? Pablo: We want to define the new lens standards for quality. I cannot tell yet if it’s going to be an open source or a public thing. But the aim I think will be there. As smartphones begin to get more and more advanced and smartphone photography gets more improved, do you see that as a threat to standalone cameras? Pablo: We believe that there are two different paths in photography. One is the camera that you have in your pocket and it’s available anytime you need it. Then there are the standalone cameras that are tailored for a different kind of use-case for enthusiasts, for professionals, for people who want to go out and take photos. It’s not exactly the same [as a smartphone]. The same people also need a phone with really nice capabilities because they don’t carry their cameras all the time. So for Leica, it’s two different ways. It’s not something that we feel jeopardises our business. Follow FE Tech Bytes on Twitter , Instagram , LinkedIn , Facebook .

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The Galaxy A55 and Galaxy A35 have officially landed in India. They are grabbing a lot of attention for their Galaxy S24-inspired design and feature set, but they’re also raising many eyebrows for their price. As Samsung makes them more premium gen-over-gen, getting the price right for its Galaxy A-series phones is a tricky proposition. In an exclusive interview with FE’s Saurabh Singh, Aditya Babbar, VP MX Business at Samsung India , addresses the elephant in the room and how it plans to “consolidate” its market share further on the back of the new A55 and A35. Excerpts. Let’s start by addressing the elephant in the room. The Galaxy A-series prices have shot up in 2024. The Galaxy A55 goes up to Rs 45,999. How do the A55 and A35 justify the price bump? Airtel Rs 279 prepaid plan with extended validity, unlimited calling launched in India — full details Jio versus Airtel: For Rs 395, which telco offers more benefits, better value with prepaid recharge plan? Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? Google to bump up free cloud storage from 15GB to 1TB for these individuals: Check benefits, eligibility, and more Aditya: The price is right. We have worked on a 3-d strategy for the A35 and A55. The first ‘d’ stands for democratisation of technology , where you see a design which is inspired by our flagship [S24], with a front and back [protected by Gorilla Glass Victus Plus], brushed metal at the side and floating camera. They are IP67 rated. We also have a flagship inspired camera and security with Samsung Knox Vault. Also, we are giving four times OS upgrades and five years of security upgrades. The second ‘d’ is the democratisation of affordability. We have our ears on the ground, and we understand that while consumers want the latest technology, it is our role to make it [more] accessible. The prices [of these phones] have not increased from last year. This year we have added a 12GB variant [for A55] because we want to innovate for all consumers, whether they seek a flagship or [more] features. Buying patterns are changing. Today, the conversations at retail are largely around per month EMI. The A55 comes with 24 months of EMI. Now, the EMI on an A15, which is a Rs 16,000-17,000 phone, is about Rs 1,600 and on the A55, it is Rs 1,792. That is where we see a lot of upgrades happening to a newer technology. Finally, the third ‘d’ stands for the democratisation of experience. We sell from a very large set of outlets because we have been able to make the entire setup ready for premiumisation. Availability of the phone at demo and a trained workforce are extremely critical and that is where we are making very large investments. [Around 25,000 odd A55 and A35 phones will be out there in the market giving the best experience to the consumers.]. Two years back, you had set a target to achieve 40 percent market share in Rs 20,000-45,000 segment with the Galaxy A-series 2022 line-up. What is your status in 2024? Aditya: Our market share in the Rs 30,000-Rs 50,000 bracket is currently 31.4 percent. We are one of the fastest growing brands in the fastest growing segment. That is something we are very proud of. There are three consumer sets, the consumer set #1 is looking for design. The consumer set #2 is looking for features and while consumer set #3 is looking for innovative AI based features. Design happens to be a very integral and important part, but somebody who’s just looking for design at an entry point, the A35 becomes a great solution, where a consumer is looking for 12GB RAM, the A55 becomes a solution. And if the core need is about enabling and having generative AI on their phone, then the S24 becomes an answer. We feel the power should be in the hands of the consumers. The general impression is that Samsung phones tend to be priced a bit on the higher side and then they tend to also fall, sometimes by a big margin, barely a few months after launch. People don’t like that, especially when they bought a product at launch price. What do you have to say to that? Aditya: I think the best way to put this will be with context to the A35 and A55 or A34 and A54 as we are discussing the Rs 30,000-Rs 50,000 price point. There’s been no price drop from our side officially, but there have been time and again offers which have been put up seeing the market demands. Normally, the festive season is when you see most of the offers are done for the consumers and propositions are built on. But as we move forward in a product’s life cycle, there are propositions which are built to get the best for the consumers [hence the price revision]. What are your expectations from the A55 and A35— any numbers that you’re chasing internally? Aditya: We would like to consolidate our market share even further with the A55 and A35. 5G and premiumisation are two very evident trends in the mobile market today. Last year, 50 percent of the phones were sold in the 5G bracket. This year, estimates are that two-thirds of the phones will be sold in 5G. Last year we were the number one shipment brand in the country. This year, the market will be lower single digit and the value is where you’ll see a double-digit growth. Premium market is where you’ll see the biggest growth coming in 30,000-50,000. We want to grow in line with the volume market, we want to grow faster in the value space and continue to consolidate our market share in the premium space. Is there any update on Galaxy AI coming to the Galaxy A55, A35 anytime soon? Aditya: We have been at the forefront of innovation and democratisation of technology. This [generative AI] journey is starting with the S24 and very soon coming to the S23 and S23 FE. We will continue to work on this part to make technology accessible and available to [more] consumers. Do you want to talk a little bit about sustainability on these new devices? Aditya: Again, as a pillar of democratisation of tech, it is not at all difficult. Consumers are keeping their phones for a longer period now. When that happens, there are two kind of needs which emerge. One is that they would want the best of tech in every aspect. Second, they would need software which lasts longer. That is what we have been working on and if you see the kind of GTM which we have built around that it, it is not [limited] to a particular segment of devices. Today, we give four times OS upgrades and five years of security upgrades even at Rs 12,000 price point. Follow FE Tech Bytes on Twitter , Instagram , LinkedIn , Facebook .

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Ruben Castano is the vice president of consumer experience and design at Motorola. But even more importantly, he has been with the company for almost two decades now. Having joined when Motorola was at its peak, on the back of the iconic Razr line of devices, he has seen the company go through numerous ups and downs over the years. Resilience is the word that comes to mind when you think of Motorola. The company that gave the world the first mobile phone simply refuses to die. In fact, it comes back stronger, each time. “The people that work at Motorola are very resilient, because we’ve seen a lot,” Castano tells me on the sidelines of Motorola’s latest Edge 50 Pro launch.

Airtel Rs 279 prepaid plan with extended validity, unlimited calling launched in India — full details Jio versus Airtel: For Rs 395, which telco offers more benefits, better value with prepaid recharge plan? Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? Google to bump up free cloud storage from 15GB to 1TB for these individuals: Check benefits, eligibility, and more Over the last few years, the company put all its focus on internal transformation that included setting up stage for more competitive products, improving cost and efficiency, basically, learning from competition and getting better. Getting that out of the way brought confidence. Motorola then quickly switched gears and started aspiring to become a lifestyle brand. The positive results brought more confidence. “The momentum we have seen is giving us a lot of confidence that we are doing the right things,” Castano adds. Motorola now wants to be a top three smartphone player and understands that India will be key to its success. So, if you’re wondering why the Edge 50 Pro had its global launch in India, well, let me tell you that it’s no coincidence. Castano calls India Motorola’s North Star, a market that seems to have a natural affinity to embrace a lot of the strategies that the company is developing. Motorola is a very resilient company, isn’t it? Where does that come from? I would attribute it definitely to our history. [Whether it is] the first mobile phone, or the first communication from the Moon. Then obviously, the time when I joined, which was just when they had launched the first Razr. All that creates a lot of heritage and memory in consumers’ minds, and it’s something that just has an emotional bond with them, that makes them still want to be at least curious [about us]. We cannot expect for anything more, right. We want the market to be curious about what Motorola is doing. Then we have to do all the extra work to convince them to come back into our family of products. And yes, the people that work at Motorola, we are very resilient, because we’ve seen a lot. And you’ve seen a lot clearly. Do you think the company continues to evolve with the times better than probably some of your other legacy competitors? You know, without mentioning about our competitors, our own data shows that the answer to that is a yes. We had a few years where we focused heavily on transforming our company. I’ll give you some examples. Our products needed to be more competitive. Our time to market needed to improve. The cost structure of everything we were doing, needed to be solved as well. So, once we finished that phase of transforming our company, now we are really accelerating into what is our end goal for the next three years, which is to double our business, which in theory, should be taking us to becoming the number 3 brand in the world. The momentum we have seen to date, whether it’s in India or many other markets around the world, is giving us a lot of confidence that we are doing the right things. But make no mistake, it’s a very competitive market. We have to continue to be super focused on everything we do, and the key is continuing to be focused on the consumer and the strategies that we are developing which are very consumer centric. What are your expectations from India as a market while chasing that end goal? India is an extremely important market for us, not only from a volume perspective, which is significant, but that’s not the main driver for us. We are transforming our brand to being more of a lifestyle brand that [also] delivers great technology in a very differentiated way. The Indian market is a market that embraces colour, embraces differentiation, embraces a lot of the strategies that we are developing. So, for me personally and for my team, it’s not only a test ground, but actually a North Star for a lot of things that we do. We do them purposely for India because we know the importance that Indian consumers give to those aspects of the phone design. And beyond that, we have invested in local manufacturing, and we are growing from that aspect as well. We are investing in diversifying our channel strategy from online to retail and so on. Today, India is our largest market for our premium products, Edge [series] in particular. Indian consumers are not just price shoppers, they are looking for a really good value in where they spend their money , and we strive to do that as a brand. The Pantone partnership is very interesting. Not a lot of people are probably aware of Pantone. But it’s a big differentiator for Motorola especially in a space where other brands generally tend to partner on camera and optics. Where does that idea come from? You know, the idea of having a strategic partnership with Pantone came from the brand objective of becoming more of a lifestyle brand. That quickly took us to the conclusion that we need to be focused on design, on fashion, on colour trends and so on. And [all] that pointed us immediately to Pantone. They are the world’s authority in that space. They work behind the scenes with different industries, and they are not only working with those industries to tell them what they should be doing, they really understand consumer trends and macro trends, even social, political trends, and they understand how to translate all that into colour because we, as humans, always want to express our feelings and our emotions and colour is a very important medium to do that. So, they have this unique ability of understanding different industries, understanding trends and then translating all that into colour. They know this also months in advance. So, as a brand, it gives us a very strategic advantage because we know when we launch a certain device with the careful planning that we do with the Pantone team that once that product hits the shelves, consumers, whether they realise it or not, are getting influenced [by those choices]. It really helps us reposition our brand and very importantly, address the consumer segment that, to be honest, we were not really talking to before. We were very tech focused [before] and now we are very balanced. No product in our product development process passes certain gates unless it is very competitive, but that’s not enough. Then we need to build in this lifestyle, fashion and design layer into our products. That helps us then to talk to both the tech savvy consumers that are out there as well as the ones that definitely want to use the smartphone but are not buying it because of the tech specs. They don’t care or they don’t know what a chipset is or what a megahertz or a megapixel is. Just to add to that, the whole “sensorial” experience is a big USP of your modern-day devices. Even the packaging comes with “Motorola fragrance.” Isn’t it a tad too much and do you think consumers notice these things? The company that we have partnered with, Firmenich, they are the Pantone equivalent when it comes to fragrances and [are] developing flavours for many of the world’s [finest] industries that are out there. They understand what values we want to bring to life , and they develop the fragrance that [best] represents those values. Now that we have had close to a year of products in the field where when consumers open the box for the first time, and they are greeted with the Motorola fragrance, the feedback is extremely positive. It’s no reason to buy the device [of course] but it is a way for us of saying thank you. Thank you for trusting Motorola. Thank you for buying our device and here’s a sensorial experience that we hope you find gratifying. The answer has been yes, it is gratifying. And, you know, I hope in India we will see at one point, Motorola-branded stores, that’s another great place to play with the senses, fragrance being one of them. In other parts of the world where we do have Motorola-branded stores, we are already using that as a way to greet customers. So, when do you plan to open these Motorola-branded stores in India? I can’t comment about plans in India specifically. What I can say is that we are expanding both our online and physical presence in India. We are incrementing especially [on] the physical retail presence to get a good balance there. What I can say today is, if we want to be true to ourselves, if we’re placing so much emphasis on design, colour, materials, and finish, we have to find a way for consumers that go to a physical retail outlet to experience that. Otherwise, if they learn about a product and they want to go and see it physically and then they can’t experience it, we’ve lost the battle. So yes, I think there’s more to come, but again, we have to be coherent in what we’re doing and if we talk so much about this, we need to make sure it comes to life when a consumer is thinking about purchasing a Motorola device. Most smartphone conversations are incomplete without AI today. It’s good that you’ve started to dip your toes into it. You’re still not quite there yet in terms of bringing generative AI to your devices but soon, maybe. What’s your strategy? AI is a fantastic technology. It has so many different applications and it’s going to be a journey for us. Make no mistake, it’s not a gimmick. It’s not going to go away. We want to always see the technology that’s accessible to us and transform it into something meaningful. Why we started with camera, there’s actually a good reason. Consumers today, and this is based on our own research, they are predominantly capturing, creating and consuming content on a mobile. And so that’s the reason why in the Edge 50 Pro, we overemphasised on camera experiences and display. We went as far as validating the display and the camera with Pantone. So, what you see is what you’re actually also then seeing on the display and then AI has started to be infused into those experiences to improve it for the user. As more capabilities come, hopefully we can talk in future product announcements. But it’s a journey and we will be coherent in how we apply it. I’d like to conclude with packaging. How long before you stop shipping chargers in the box – like your competitors? In some markets around the world, we actually don’t put charger in the box, but it’s the result of understanding what consumers are asking for in that specific market, taking advantage of how they use the smartphone, acknowledging that they have access to already, maybe multiple chargers around their house. For the Indian market, I think that that’s still important. Will we get to a point where it makes sense to not include the charger in the box because we would prefer a lighter-weight packaging with less environmental impact, let’s have that conversation, when the time comes. Is the Ultra coming to India? The Ultra, meaning? The Edge 50 Ultra? We haven’t announced anything beyond the Edge 50 Pro [for now].

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Avneet Singh Marwah, the chief executive officer of homegrown manufacturing company Super Plastronics Pvt Ltd, isn’t the one to mince his words. Time and time again he has expressed his views on how India can become a manufacturing hub for the world and called out the roadblocks that are stopping the country from realising its true potential. In an exclusive interview with FE’s Saurabh Singh, Marwah takes us through all the nitty-grittes of the smart TV and consumer durables space, how the market is changing, the positive signs as well as the areas that could be better, all in his candid, unabridged style. Edited excerpts. Follow FE Tech Bytes on Twitter , Instagram , LinkedIn , Facebook . Airtel Rs 279 prepaid plan with extended validity, unlimited calling launched in India — full details Jio versus Airtel: For Rs 395, which telco offers more benefits, better value with prepaid recharge plan? Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? Google to bump up free cloud storage from 15GB to 1TB for these individuals: Check benefits, eligibility, and more So, how is business? Business is fine. There were a couple of challenges in 2023. But now, in 2024, things are looking [to get] back on track. Market-wise, the whole segment of consumer durables is growing. Can you elaborate on some of the challenges you are referring to? In television space, the major challenge [in 2023] was that a lot of brands were exiting the market. It was a bloodbath. A lot of [cash] burning started happening among the [other] brands to take that chunk of market share. But they didn’t realise that they were making the same mistake that OnePlus and Realme made. They forgot that in India , if you burn [cash], you [can] get the market share, but the moment you increase prices, you lose everything. Consumers are not so loyal in low or medium-ticket segment products. They will shift. And that’s what happened. As it is, two major brands [OnePlus and Realme] have exited the market. This year, there will be more correction, mostly with Chinese brands because the Chinese economy is not doing so great, and so, they don’t have enough cash in their hands to burn. 2024 will be a strategic year for all those brands doing this sort of practice and only the brands which have strong infrastructure and manufacturing will survive. Interesting that you talk about the missing loyalty in the lower price bracket, because some of the brands make a lot of noise about this very aspect. Like Xiaomi does this a lot. For several years, it has been number one and it continues to be number one. OnePlus is another known brand. Its smartphones tend to have the most resale value in India. Would you care to shed more light on your observation? In India, the per capita [income] is very low compared to a lot of other countries and so, price matters. The Indian consumer is very intelligent. They will choose a lower priced product if the specifications are similar. Therefore, this sort of cash burning where brands lower the price to gain market share keeps on happening. Plus, they have huge marketing budget. Xiaomi and OnePlus have some of the best flagship stores. They spend a lot on advertising . But [despite that], Xiaomi has closed its offline television sales. This news was never out to media. It’s been a year now. Xiaomi is only selling online. How can they [claim to] be number one when the online market is only 32 percent [and they are not selling offline]? It’s all a marketing gimmick. OnePlus and Realme have exited the market completely. They were losing a lot of money. Because they are majorly mobile phone companies, they were not able to pump that sort of money into TVs. They couldn’t have more losses, so they stopped operations. But isn’t it cheating in some ways? Some of these brands have launched new products not that long ago and even entered new categories like monitors? Customers trusted them with their hard-earned money. I broke the story six months before OnePlus announced what they will be doing. They didn’t even [properly] announce it. They just gave a very small note [in media]. And so, if anyone goes to court, they can say that they’ve made the news that they are shutting their TV business public. That’s how they are safe. But regular consumers are completely unaware of this. If someone buys a TV, the expectation is that it will work for at least three years and if not, there will be someone to answer. Spare parts will be available. It is cheating because the consumer now doesn’t know where to go. That’s the problem if you’re just branding your products. You can come, test [the waters] and leave if it doesn’t go well. Does it mean the Chinese bubble is bursting, at least in the television space? Absolutely. The bubble burst last year itself. The same thing would have happened in mobile phones also but the problem is there are no [good] Indian brands to counter and take them head on. Owners of Micromax and Intex and Lava have had very small mentality. They would say 3G has not happened yet, how will 4G come in India? 4G has not happened yet, how will 5G come? I always give the example of air conditioners. There are ten major companies into air conditioners in India with more than a billion dollars in revenue. None of the Chinese players could enter India because they are very strong. If Voltas, Godrej, and Blue Star made mobile phones, none of the Chinese brands had a chance. Is the time of affordable smart TVs over? If you’re giving a full-specced TV, you can’t be cheap. If you’re going with a full-specced TV with a recognised operating system, your quality cannot be poor. The premium affordable category will flourish now. These consumers are very smart. You have to be very accurate with your product in terms of quality and after-sales. You can’t mislead them. Who thought that Patanjali will go to Supreme Court and apologise? SPPL is a massive company. Not sure how much awareness there is on the outside but you’re pretty big. Do you want to talk a little bit about that? This was a decision that was taken by the board, and I was part of that discussion. There are two ways. Either we take a private equity, or we do public, or we move slowly and steadily in the right direction. I thought that it is not a good time to go public. We didn’t have any debts two years back. And now for capex, we have debts to increase the manufacturing facility only. But for stocks, we don’t have any debt. We are reinvesting every year. We are on a healthy EBITDA. I haven’t seen most of the consumer durable brands having a healthy bottom line and then increasing their revenue. So that’s where, we’re not stuck. We can breathe on those levels. We will take a little more time but putting so much of pressure and again, burning money, will not help. We are investing huge on manufacturing, R&D, technology, and moving forward with the biggest trends around the globe. But at the same time, we are not taking money right now because we feel that we can grow ourselves. Tomorrow, if things change and we will have an opportunity, we might go the other way also. You have multiple brands including Thomson, Kodak, and a couple of more under your umbrella. How do you maintain a steady flow of products, R&D, and differentiation among them? In the beginning, it was a huge challenge for us to have a balanced category. But we learned a lot of things from the market. Now, all the brands are completely different from each other. They are not cannibalising, mostly. Especially, Blaupunkt, which is a high premium segment, where we are focused on the sound. The thought process behind Blaupunkt was that a lot of consumers were buying soundbars with their TVs. Kodak is a complete online-offline brand. Thomson is a complete Flipkart property in terms of sales. And year on year, there has been growth, because Flipkart as a platform is also growing in this segment. How big is the company in terms of employee strength? We have about 800-1,000 employees right now, directly and indirectly. In the next two years, that number will go up to more than 3,000. In the next five years, that number should go up to 5,000. Is there any particular vertical that you are looking at to scale up hiring? Manufacturing. There are a lot of new products coming in and we’re also scaling our existing products. Apart from that, in after-sales and the kind of back-end office that we need to have, sales and marketing. And then, of course, extension in different portfolios. You are increasing your footprint into other categories, washing machines and air coolers for instance. Why do you need to do that? It was a branding sort of a situation previously for us with washing machines. We were taking material. I won’t name from whom, but it is one of the number one ODMs in the country. We had a contract for more than 7 years. But we found that we were not getting the support that we needed. That’s when things started shifting and a lot of to and fro started happening. We decided that we will have our own manufacturing facility in Noida. If you have to survive in India, and you don’t have a manufacturing facility, you can’t establish your product. That was a big learning. In seven months, we not only introduced our own washing machines, we completely backward integrated. Within 3-4 months of launch over online where Thomson is available, we went from 0.5-4.0 percent and this festive season, we are targeting 10 percent market share. What does the upcoming plant in Hapur hold for the future of SPPL? We wanted to upgrade. We were in this [Noida] factory since 2003. It was high time because earlier there was VAT and sales tax, not GST . So, we had three more factories which had exemptions. And when the GST came in, we had to close those exempted factories. All the pressure came on the Noida factory as a result. That is when we decided to open a new factory. But then the pandemic happened and the whole plan got pushed. After that, we thought we should do about 3-4x of our plan seeing the future and how the group is growing. There has been a little delay because we started doing washing machines and air coolers. In the next two or three months, we will start the operations of that factory. Our target is to achieve about 100,000 units of televisions and fully automatic washing machines from that factory. Going forward, we have about three more plants to go. As and when things will be decided, we will definitely tell you what is coming next. Do you have any plans to expand into more categories? For instance, monitors come to mind instantly, or audio, for that matter. A lot of expansion is happening in terms of vertical and horizontal product lines for consumer durables. We are very close to closing two [new] categories in about next quarter or so. Because we are under NDA, we can’t share the names. But yes, the whole strategy of the company in 2021 was that we will not rely on televisions alone anymore.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Xiaomi India has denied exiting the offline market for smart TV sales. The rebuttal comes in response to a claim made by Super Plastronics Pvt Ltd chief executive officer, Avneet Singh Marwah, that Xiaomi had closed its offline television sales last year, apparently because it had ceased to serve as a viable business option. In a statement shared with FE over email, a company spokesperson said that, “Xiaomi has a strong retail presence across multiple offline channels besides Mi stores and Mi Homes including multi-brand stores, Mi Preferred Partners as well as large format stores like Reliance , Vijay Sales, Poorvika, Sangeetha, etc,” adding that brick-and-mortar channels have been contributing to 50 percent of its smart TV sales in the country.

Underscoring the importance of offline to showcase “the superior quality of Xiaomi smart TVs, and compare it with other marginal, fragmented players,” the spokesperson reiterated that Xiaomi will continue to strengthen its offline business across all categories, smart TVs included, giving the best experience and choices across channels to its customers. In an exclusive interview with FE , the SPPL CEO had claimed that Xiaomi had shut offline sales of its smart TVs in India last year, and was only selling online now. “How can they [claim to] be number one when the online market is only 32 percent [and they are not selling offline]? It’s all a marketing gimmick,” Marwah had said. In the same interview, he called out OnePlus and Realme for silently exiting the smart TV market, after creating a lot of hype on the back of aggressive pricing, a strategy that might have worked in the short-term but in the long run, they were “losing a lot of money .” “Because they are majorly mobile phone companies, they were not able to pump that sort of money into TVs. They couldn’t have more losses, so they stopped operations,” Marwah said, adding that “that’s the problem with just branding your products. You can come, test [the waters] and leave if it doesn’t go well.” Xiaomi however seems to be doing well. The company witnessed a strong uptake in the 43 inch-4K segment during the festive season in 2023 which grew by up to 75 percent (Y-O-Y) on the back of the cricket World Cup and Diwali. “With the IPL season setting, we expect a surge in the demand for larger screens suited for group viewing, particularly 55 inches and above,” the spokesperson concluded.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express LG Electronics wants to cement its position as India ‘s top television brand even as it works relentlessly to achieve a growth target of 25-30 percent within the burgeoning category in 2024, a senior company executive told FE on Wednesday. The South Korean tech major plans to do it on the back of an expansive catalogue of high-performance OLED and QNED TVs across a plethora of screen sizes all powered by the next generation of artificial intelligence. “We are looking at 25-30 percent growth this year in television business,” Abhiral Bhansali, business head, TV & Audio Products at LG Electronics said, reiterating that “We want to reinforce our position as a leadership [brand] especially with the latest technology QNED and OLED televisions.” LG has launched two different segments of QNED TVs in India — including one with mini -LED technology. It has incorporated an “upgradable web software” across the line-up and bundled high-end features like Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos previously reserved for its more premium OLED TVs.

Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? “With these technologies coming into affordable QNED TVs, I think there’s a big uptake and big growth opportunity for us in those price segments [of roughly about Rs 65,000],” Bhansali said, adding that, “till last year, features like Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos were only available in OLED TVs with starting price of about Rs 1.2 lakh.” Similarly on OLED TVs, LG has carefully orchestrated affordability construct on EMIs which are available for as low as Rs 2,990/month over a 36-month tenure in addition to cash backs and extended warranty. Bhansali said a typical LG customer can be rest assured his TV is totally secured and covered for about five years. Offering greater choice in screen sizes is deliberate, Bhansali added. “Today’s customer has an option of buying a television from 32-inch to about 97-inch so whatever their [preferred] space is, be it a small bedroom, or a bigger living room, we have those screen sizes available for consumers.“ Bigger screens in general have started to receive a lot of traction in the Indian market post COVID. The reason, he explained, is that people now increasingly want to setup a theatre-like experience at home. Similarly, another recent trend is AI though to be completely honest, LG has used some type of AI in most of its smart TVs since 2017. Anyhow, the 2024 batch features the next-generation of AI with improvements across picture and sound for an overall better “personalised” viewing experience. Through AI Picture Pro, the new LG TVs can understand the content, genre, and scene and accordingly upscale it. LG calls it “super upscaling”, Bhansali said. The TVs can use AI to upgrade the audio track to a 11.1.2 channel surround sound as well. Lastly, these TVs can also create custom picture profile through a feature called AI Picture Wizard. All the new TVs—including OLED—will be made in India at LG’s Pune Factory, which is “one of the company’s best factories globally”, Bhansali confirmed. LG also has an R&D base in Pune and “understands the customer” from ground-up, which invariably reflects in its features and innovations. LG has employed about 9,000 technicians to take care of its customers “day in and day out”, Bhansali said, while in terms of reach, it has 51 branches. “We completed 27 years in India this year, so our network is really wide. We are present everywhere. We are servicing customers in the remotest location possible.” On competition from “unconventional” Chinese brands, Bhansali said, “The top three brands contribute to 75 percent [of the market]. So still the chunk of business is available with the top three brands which are LG, Samsung, and Sony. Within 25 percent balance market, there are a lot of brands which are available, and I think there is not much of a shift happening. So the tier-two and tier-three brands are [still] at 25 percent.” Follow FE Tech Bytes on Twitter , Instagram , LinkedIn , Facebook .

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Robust India-specific service infrastructure, bolstered by its significant presence in the consumer PC market, has enabled Asus to provide exceptional service to its customers, a senior Asus India executive told FE. This extensive network not only meets the widespread demand of consumer services but also simplifies and enhances its ability to serve commercial clients. The dual capability has helped the brand strengthen its market position while reassuring commercial customers of reliability and extensive reach. “We’ve created a made for India robust infrastructure for Asus especially focusing on back-end services,” Dinesh Sharma, Vice President, Commercial PC and Smartphone, System Business Group, Asus India said, adding “The commercial service ironically becomes relatively easier when you have a vast service network on consumer side.” As the number two player in the consumer PC business, extensive service network is essential. Its vast scale necessitates a vast service network, and this extensive network for consumer services gives Asus a significant advantage in the commercial sector as well, Sharma reiterates. Commercial services tend to be more concentrated, and having a large consumer service network makes it relatively easier to cater to commercial clients. Thus, transitioning from consumer to commercial service was smoother for Asus compared to other brands. Airtel’s cheapest prepaid plan gets you unlimited data for less than Rs 10 — validity, other benefits Airtel Rs 279 prepaid plan with extended validity, unlimited calling launched in India — full details Jio versus Airtel: For Rs 395, which telco offers more benefits, better value with prepaid recharge plan? Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? “Commercial customers are more at ease when they look at Asus because the network that we’ve created on the service side is massive to be able to serve them anywhere.” Asus began its commercial PC operations during COVID in 2020, a period of significant change. The timing allowed it to adapt to long-term trends and distinguish them from short-term fads that didn’t last, Sharma explains. One key long-term trend is mobility. People now expect to work from anywhere, making laptops far more crucial than desktops. Another enduring trend is the role of laptops as essential communication tools. This shift means laptops are not just for work but also for connecting with colleagues, a change that’s “here to stay.” Another significant shift is the reduction in travel and in-person meetings. While face-to-face interactions remain important, their frequency has decreased. Now, companies may hold quarterly in-person meetings but conduct monthly meetings virtually. This change saves both time and money. Efficient time management means more time with customers, which is crucial for any business. In this new landscape, the devices we use must meet these evolving needs. Companies now require tools that support remote work and facilitate effective communication. Furthermore, the reduction in travel and increased reliance on virtual meetings mean that devices must be reliable and versatile, supporting both in-person and remote interactions seamlessly. Asus’ strategy has been to develop and provide devices that align with these trends. By focusing on mobility, communication, and AI, it ensures its products meet the demands of modern work environments. The ability to save time and reduce costs without sacrificing productivity or connectivity is vital for all organisations. Additionally, the rise of artificial intelligence is an important industry -wide trend that will have lasting impacts, Sharma said. Asus is also leveraging new AI capabilities to enhance customer experiences on its platforms. One key example is AI noise cancellation, which it plans to elevate further, with the introduction of NPUs (neural processing units) in upcoming products. The idea is to facilitate faster AI adoption and making AI more accessible and convenient for users. “We’ve been in the flux of change all the time. We’ve been at the right time where the change was happening and now the biggest upcoming shift is AI. From our perspective, the timing was actually very good, any later would mean that we would not have understood these shifts happening and the customer behaviour.” There’s no magic to success, Sharma said, just basics. It starts with understanding the market and customer needs, then applying “our fundamental design thinking process. Whether we’re delivering a product, service, or solution, our goal is to identify the best propositions that others might miss. We dive deep to understand what’s required and how we can deliver it effectively.” Building a strong organisation and network of channel partners is crucial. A business cannot succeed without a great team and organisation. Leadership must have the right vision, policies, and processes to ensure operational excellence. “All these elements are essential to deliver a high-quality customer experience, resulting in high satisfaction. This approach allows for steady, organic growth and provides a foundation to accelerate later.” Asus has started manufacturing some of its commercial products in India. However, PC manufacturing is relatively new in India. Unlike other regions, India doesn’t have a long history of large-scale PC production facilities. “It’s not that there was a huge factory which was already making a lot of PCs. Because it’s a new space, the definite aspects of it are more confined to the production guys,” Sharma said suggesting there’s still some time to go before making PCs locally becomes more commonplace like smartphones. “We are truly committed to our vision of becoming the best brand of choice in the commercial sector. This is not just a marketing statement but a mission we are dedicated to across the entire organisation,” Sharma said. Moreover, it has pledged to be the most partner-centric brand in the market. This commitment is reflected in the “transparent systems” it has developed for its partners. “There is no limit to continuously improving in every single area. We can improvise everywhere. The possibilities are open everywhere. And that is what is something that we are in constant search of like in search of incredible.” Follow FE Tech Bytes on Twitter , Instagram , LinkedIn , Facebook .

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Akshat Srivastava, a 22-year-old from Varanasi, India, is a talented student currently attending BITS Pilani K K Birla College in Goa. His journey into the world of coding began at the age of 16 after being introduced to it by his brother. Always intrigued by technology, coding felt like a natural fit. He was fascinated by the vast possibilities coding offered, from solving real-world problems to bringing imaginative ideas to life. “My first experience with coding was when I learnt web development, it started out as building some static website designs and eventually learning the backend development to create dynamic websites,” Akshat tells FE. “As I got more comfortable with programming, I started exploring different fields like web3 and eventually iOS development.” What he loves most about coding is the combination of creativity and positive impact it can lead to. Whether it’s building a website to help people find information easily or creating an app to solve a specific problem, coding allows Akshat to turn ideas into reality and “hopefully make the world a little better in the process.” Airtel’s cheapest prepaid plan gets you unlimited data for less than Rs 10 — validity, other benefits Airtel Rs 279 prepaid plan with extended validity, unlimited calling launched in India — full details Jio versus Airtel: For Rs 395, which telco offers more benefits, better value with prepaid recharge plan? Xiaomi 14 Civi versus OnePlus 12R vs Vivo V30 Pro — Which flagship killer offers best value in 2024? Apple’s annual Swift Student Challenge celebrates the pinnacle of student coding talent, and this year, the competition introduced an exciting new category. From a pool of 350 winning submissions, 50 students have been “distinguished” for their exceptional app playgrounds that shine in innovation, creativity, social impact, or inclusivity. Akshat has been selected as one of the distinguished winners for his innovative submission, MindBud. MindBud, an app born from the joyful moments Akshat spent with his nephew, is designed to transport kids into a world of classic games and activities reminiscent of his own childhood. The app’s mission is to foster both analytical and creative thinking in young minds. It features four engaging mini-games that encourage kids to play with their family and friends, blending traditional fun with modern technology. To bring MindBud to life , Akshat utilised a suite of advanced tools. He leveraged SwiftUI for the app’s user interface, AVKit for audio integration, PencilKit for drawing capabilities, and FileManager for data handling. These technologies ensure that MindBud offers a seamless and immersive experience, making classic learning activities accessible in a new, exciting way. “From the timeless strategy of Connect 4 to the creative exploration of sketching, every aspect of MindBud is designed to spark joy, foster creativity, and encourage connection. I wanted to make sure that children today could experience the same sense of wonder and delight that I did growing up,” he says. Akshat finds SwiftUI’s simplicity and elegance its most sought-after features. SwiftUI utilises a declarative syntax that allows developers to describe the desired appearance and behaviour of the user interface in a clear and concise manner. This not only makes the code easier to write and understand but also results in a more intuitive and efficient development process. Additionally, SwiftUI’s live preview feature enables real-time feedback, allowing developers to see their changes instantly and iterate quickly. “I built the whole of the app on iPad, and as there is not a full scale development ide other than swift playgrounds, it was a bit challenging on setting up the orientations for screen and background image visibility. But, there has been so much growth in the last few years, I hope, in some years SwiftUI, will be the new industry standard and the best way to create iOS apps.” Beyond his coding prowess, Akshat has a passion for music and sports. He enjoys playing the guitar and is an avid football enthusiast. His inventive spirit shone brightly during the COVID-19 crisis when he developed an app to track vacant hospital beds using social media posts from Twitter and Facebook. This initiative demonstrated his ability to apply technology to real-world problems, showcasing his commitment to making a positive impact on society. Looking ahead, Akshat aspires to publish his MindBud submission on the App Store, aiming to reach a wider audience and inspire more children through his creative and educational games. His journey from a young coder in Varanasi to a distinguished app developer in Goa exemplifies his dedication, creativity, and the potential to transform the way children learn and play in the digital age. As a Distinguished Winner, he has earned an exclusive invitation to a three-day, in-person experience at Apple Park. This special event, held during the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), will offer tailored programming designed to enhance skills and foster creativity. Akshat will join a global community of like-minded creators, sharing ideas and drawing inspiration from one another. “I am expecting this year’s WWDC to be one of its kind, and introduce a whole range of different AI capabilities and frameworks, which will be integrated in the upcoming OS updates, as well as providing frameworks, so that we as developers can use those AI frameworks to build and ship incredible AI apps. Also, I expect the new OS updates will be able to harness the incredible hardware power the new M-series chips offer on both iPad and Macs.” Asmi Jain, a 21-year-old student from Indore, India , has quickly made a name for herself in the world of coding. Intrigued by the world of machines, she started coding since the age of 19, while still in high school. Currently studying computer science at Medicaps University, Asmi’s dedication and skill earned her recognition as a Swift Student Challenge winner in 2023, an achievement that also landed her a feature in a prominent newsroom post. “Seeing the incredible work of tech pioneers and the booming startup scene in India only fuelled my excitement for what lay ahead. Each computer science class felt like unlocking a treasure trove of knowledge, and I soaked up every bit of it,” Asmi says, adding “Watching my brother effortlessly build amazing projects inspired me to dive headfirst into creating my own. After honing my skills, I proudly developed my first basic app.” Active in her college community, Asmi regularly participates in events like the Smart India Hackathon. Additionally, she is gaining practical experience through her internship with food delivery platform Swiggy. Her blend of academic pursuits and real-world application underscores her commitment to technology and innovation. This year, Asmi’s playground submission is a healthcare app designed to assist individuals struggling with hand movements. The Hand Track app, developed using SwiftUI, UIKit, and the Combine framework, utilises AVFoundation to fetch frames from the camera, tracking hand gestures and guiding users to improve their hand mobility. This thoughtful application highlights Asmi’s focus on creating technology that positively impacts people’s lives. Her ingenuity was also evident in her previous project, the EyeTrack App, which she designed to help individuals with eye disorders such as strabismus or lazy eyes. This app addresses misaligned eye movements, offering a technological solution to a common medical issue. “ Health apps have always intrigued me due to their potential to solve real-world problems and assist others. My journey began with designing an app to educate about PCOD/PCOS, sparking a deeper interest in creating interactive solutions. I find myself drawn to the research on body movement post-injury or during recovery from illness, which inspired the development of apps showcased in WWDC’23 and ’24. The vast scope of the medical field fascinates me, and I take pride in making small contributions through technology,” she says. Asmi’s dedication to her projects led her to visit the Apple Developer Centre in Bangalore, where she seeks guidance to enhance both of her apps. Her journey reflects not only her technical prowess but also her determination to refine and expand her work. “Winning the Swift Student Challenge holds a special significance for me. It’s a unique platform where developers can showcase their technical skills while unleashing their creativity. It’s not just about coding; it’s about bringing imaginative ideas to life. Winning offers visibility within the Swift community, potentially leading to exposure and various opportunities.” Excitement is building for Asmi as she prepares to attend WWDC24 in person. She looks forward to the event, eager to absorb the latest software updates and innovations announced there. Asmi’s story is one of rapid growth and unwavering ambition, illustrating her journey from a novice coder to an accomplished developer whose work promises to make a meaningful difference in the world of healthcare technology. “My expectations for WWDC 2024 revolve around updates to Apple’s software, hardware, and developer tools. Anticipated highlights include enhancements to iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, alongside potential advancements in generative AI technologies,” she adds.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express If 2022 was the year that “broke bitcoin”, 2023 has been the year of trauma recovery. Bitcoin has bounced pluckily in the face of depressed crypto prices, low trading volumes and tough economic conditions. It even found a second wind in October following a summer slump. “We’ve had a nice recovery, but we’re just in the cusp of the new cycle,” said Kelvin Koh, co-founder and managing partner at investment firm Spartan Group. Indeed, 2023 has been a surprisingly good year for bitcoin . The king of cryptocurrencies has leapt 164% since Jan. 1 and is trading above $40,000. It has outpaced traditional assets, including gold which has risen 10% and the S&P 500 which has gained 20%. Bitcoin also increased its share of the total cryptocurrency market , from 38% to above 50%, according to CoinGecko data. The overall crypto market cap has swelled to $1.7 trillion from $871 billion at the end of 2022, with ether’s price jumping 95%. Much of bitcoin’s gains came later in the year as a potential U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and hopes of easier monetary policy renewed investor energy. Trading volumes have picked back up too, with the combined spot and derivatives trading volume on centralized exchanges hitting $3.61 trillion in November, up from about $2.9 trillion in January, according to CCData. Meanwhile, stablecoins – cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a real world asset like the dollar – have also grown. Tether, the largest such coin, has seen its market cap soar to an all time high of over $90 billion. How AI startups are contributing to environment and social impact Best crypto leaders worldwide making cryptocurrency mainstream Artificial intelligence is here to aid, your job is safe Former Twitter India head to lead Harvard’s AI impact programme FALL OF TITANS After a torrid 2022 saw the downfall of FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried, 2023 has seen more crypto giants come a cropper. Binance chief Changpeng Zhao, pleaded guilty to breaking U.S. anti- money laundering laws, most notably, part of a multi-billion dollar settlement with regulators. The co-founder of Voyager Digital also found himself on the wrong end of American regulatory action, while Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky was arrested in the U.S. in July, pleading not guilty to criminal counts including securities fraud. And not forgetting SBF – after a whirlwind trial, the former industry poster child was convicted of fraud in November. On a brighter note, Ripple’s XRP token clocked gains of 82% for the year after a key legal victory for the industry when a U.S. judge ruled Ripple Labs’ sales of the token on public exchanges did not violate securities law. BITCOIN IN 2024 Most of bitcoin’s 55% run in the fourth-quarter has been attributed to bets that a spot bitcoin ETF will be approved in the U.S. and pull in money from retail and institutional investors alike on the ease of gaining exposure to the digital asset on a regulated stock exchange. Asset management giants like BlackRock and Fidelity are among the 13 companies that have submitted applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the multi-billion dollar product. Such a fund is expected to pull in as much as $3 billion from investors in the first few days of trading and billions more thereafter. Not everyone is as bullish though. J.P.Morgan expects the crypto market recovery to continue through the expected approval in early 2024, however, remains skeptical of the magnitude of success in adoption that broader market is pricing in. JPM expects the bitcoin ETFs to pull in assets in the low or low to mid-single digit percentage range of the $1.7 trillion crypto market compared with some optimistic outlooks of 10%. If adoption falls short of investor expectations of around 10%, crypto markets could reverse their recent gains, it said. To some market watchers, though, it looks like the current bitcoin recovery is still in early stages. The net dollar-denominated realized profit locked in by bitcoin investors has reached $324 million per day, which remains an order of magnitude below the peaks experienced during the later stages of the 2021 bull market, which eclipsed $3 billion a day, according to analytics platform Glassnode. This suggests bitcoin’s current performance remains very much within the bounds of an early rather than a late-stage bull market, Glassnode said.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Jefferies has shed light on a groundbreaking development that could reshape the insurance industry – the introduction of the “threshold premium” concept. While still in the consultation stage, this innovative idea has the potential to significantly impact insurers by influencing surrender values and, subsequently, trimming fees inversely. According to Jefferies analysis, the proposed threshold premium concept is currently in the consultation stage, with final terms to be determined through ongoing deliberations. The report highlights that this potential shift could introduce a new dynamic to the insurance sector, prompting insurers to reassess their strategies and adapt to the evolving regulatory landscape. One key implication highlighted by Jefferies is the possibility of increased surrender values, which could have a cascading effect on fees for insurers. While the industry awaits the final terms, insurers are anticipated to explore strategic cost reductions to offset potential impacts and maintain competitiveness. Sebi set to overhaul RIA norms Stock Market Highlight: Markets end lower! Sensex down over 400 points, Nifty at 23,450; FMCG, PSU major draggers Here is why ITC shares have fallen despite shareholders approving hotel business demerger ‘Runaway gains of broader market cannot sustain’ Jefferies analysis also points to non-unit-linked insurance products (non-UILP), which currently constitute 40-45% of premiums and Value of New Business (VNB), as being directly affected by the proposed changes. This insight suggests that insurers may need to reevaluate their product portfolios to align with the evolving regulatory framework. The report further notes that market dynamics could shift, creating winners and losers among insurance companies. Jefferies identifies Max Life and HDFC Life as potential beneficiaries with a higher market share, while SBI Life may face challenges amid this regulatory overhang. As the insurance industry navigates this potential paradigm shift, the Jefferies report emphasizes the importance of active participation in the consultation process. The insights gathered during this period will play a crucial role in shaping the final terms and determining how insurers can adapt to this innovative approach. With the industry on the cusp of transformative changes, insurers are urged to stay abreast of developments, actively contribute to the regulatory dialogue, and prepare for a future where the threshold premium concept could redefine the traditional norms of the insurance sector.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The Ministry of external affairs (MEA) has urged persons seeking jobs abroad to use the safe and legal services of registered Recruiting Agents (RA) only. In an advisory issued by MEA on Thursday (Dec 14, 2023) has said all registered RAs are issued a license number which is prominently displayed in their office premises and in their advertisements, including newspapers and social media. Therefore, prospective emigrants are advised to cross check the genuineness of the RA by visiting the government website www.emigrate.gov.in and click the link “List of active RA”. India and Bangladesh: A Strategic Partnership Shaping South Asia’s Future Major takeaways from Prime Minister Modi’s Kashmir visit Indian Army Recommends Major Changes to Agnipath Scheme Post-Article 370 abrogation: The evolving security and development landscape of Jammu and Kashmir In the advisory it has mentioned that there has been a massive rise in the number of overseas job seekers being cheated by unregistered recruitment agents by fake job offers and also overcharging to the tune of Rs. 2-5 lakhs. Adding, these unregistered/illegal agents operate without obtaining license from the MEA, which is mandatory for any recruitment for work abroad. According to the MEA, it is reported that many illegal agents operate through Facebook, WhatsApp , text message and other such mediums. These agencies provide little or no details of their whereabouts and contacts. They usually communicate only through WhatsApp, making it difficult to ascertain the location and identity of the caller & genuineness of the job offer. Such agents also lure workers to work in difficult and life -threatening conditions. Such cases are being reported for recruitment to work in several East European Countries, some of the Gulf countries, Central Asian countries, Israel, Canada, Myanmar and Lao People’s Democratic Republic. What to look for? A valid job offer is accompanied by an Employment Contract signed by the Foreign Employer, recruitment Agent, and the emigrant worker. This contract outlines the terms and conditions of the job, including salary and additional benefits. It is crucial that valid job offers facilitate emigration through an Employment or Work visa, as opposed to a tourist visa meant solely for tourism purposes. Reputable Foreign Employers typically cover expenses like airfare, boarding, lodging, and insurance. Emigrant workers should take the initiative to familiarize themselves with the local conditions of the destination country. This valuable information can be acquired through Pre-Departure Orientation Training (PDOT) Centers or by contacting the Community Welfare Wing of the relevant Indian Embassy in the destination country. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) mandates that registered recruitment agents purchase Pravasi Bharatiya Bima Yojana (PBBY) for migrant workers. This insurance scheme provides various benefits, including a Rs. 10 Lakh sum assured in cases of death, work-related injuries, and medical expenses. The one-time premium for this coverage is Rs. 275 for two years and Rs. 375 for three years. In adherence to the Emigration Act of 1983, recruiting agents are restricted from collecting service charges exceeding Rs. 30,000 + GST (18%) from prospective emigrants. The recruiting agent is required to issue a receipt for the amount collected. It’s emphasized that any attempt to go abroad through unregistered recruitment channels poses serious risks, including the potential for financial fraud, unfulfilled job promises, and challenging living conditions. Unregistered agencies engaging in overseas recruitment activities are sternly warned, as these actions not only violate the Emigration Act of 1983 but also constitute human trafficking, a punishable criminal offense.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Revenue authorities of India and the US have discussed ways to strengthen efforts to address illicit finance risk and accelerate global implementation of anti-money laundering standards for virtual assets. Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra and US Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson co-chaired the India -US Anti- Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Dialogue here on December 13. A joint statement issued on Thursday said the participants in the sessions discussed each country’s experience with virtual assets and virtual asset service providers, given the focus area of both sides to promote responsible innovation while mitigating illicit finance risks. TMB submits three names for MD & CEO role to RBI Banks bid Rs 1.6 trillion in VRR auction as liquidity tightens NBFCs needed in all forms & sizes: Shriram Fin NPS corpus may rise 28% to Rs 15 trillion in FY25: Regulator “Both parties recognised the pressing need to accelerate global implementation of AML/CFT standards for virtual assets, in line with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations, to effectively addressing the issue of regulatory arbitrage,” the statement said. Participants discussed each country’s efforts to enhance transparency in beneficial ownership, including the implementation of beneficial ownership registries, tools to improve data quality, and verification of the information. This is a crucial step in combating money laundering and other financial crimes, as it allows authorities to track the flow of funds and identify those who are ultimately responsible for them, the statement added. It also discussed the current challenges each jurisdiction is facing with regard to sanctions implementation, as well as opportunities to improve cooperation and information sharing to better combat sanctions evasion and terrorist financing in the region and globally. Our delegations identified various areas in AML/CFT where India and the US can jointly work together and share experiences and best practices, it added. India and the US agreed to convene the dialogue again next year to build on this week’s productive discussions and pursue opportunities to enhance coordination and cooperation bilaterally and multilaterally, including working together within the FATF. Reconvening and co-chairing the India-US AML/CFT Dialogue reaffirms the commitment of India and the US to work jointly to address illicit finance risk in the international financial system, the statement added.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services (Mahindra Finance) will enter the general, life, and health insurance distribution business. The board on Thursday approved undertaking supplemental business activity of soliciting and procuring insurance business as a composite corporate agent in the areas of life, health and general insurance – both group and individual. The company said in an exchange filing that the decision is subject to obtaining approvals from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India and no-objection from the Reserve Bank of India and other regulatory authorities. “The corporate agency licence will help the company diversify its sources of income,” Mahindra Finance said in an exchange filing, adding that the expected net fee income from the business could be around 0.1-0.2% of its standalone average assets over the next one-to-three years. The company will make an initial investment of Rs 5-10 crore towards technology set-up, manpower hiring, training and certification costs. In recent times, many non-bank lenders have landed up at the Irdai doorstep for corporate agent licences. As they are dealing with high cost of funds, such a licence will enable them to earn fee income. Earlier this week, Capri Global Capital announced that it has received a corporate agency licence from Irdai. Grihum Housing Finance, formerly known as Poonawalla Housing Finance has also applied for a corporate agency licence.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The seven-day variable rate repo (VRR) auction on Friday received a strong response, with banks placing bids worth Rs 2.73 trillion, against the notified amount of Rs 1 trillion. The VRR auction, the first such auction in the past six months, is expected to easy liquidity. Banks have seen outflows on account of advance tax and GST payments. “High bids reflect the desperation of banks for funds and shows the severity of liquidity tightness in the system,” a dealer at a private bank told FE. The liquidity crunch is temporary as government cash balances with the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) have been high. As the government spends, liquidity should ease. Moreover, foreign flows into the equity markets have been robust over the past month or so. TMB submits three names for MD & CEO role to RBI Banks bid Rs 1.6 trillion in VRR auction as liquidity tightens NBFCs needed in all forms & sizes: Shriram Fin NPS corpus may rise 28% to Rs 15 trillion in FY25: Regulator As on December 14, the liquidity deficit was at Rs 44,285 crore, according to the RBI data. The central bank accepted bids at 6.61% cut-off rate which is lower than the MSF (marginal standing facility) rate of 6.75%. Through RBI’s MSF, banks can obtain liquidity overnight when interbank liquidity dries up. The previous VRR auction was conducted the central bank on June 19. A repo auction is conducted by the central bank to inject liquidity in the banking system while reverse repo auction is conducted to mop up excess liquidity. The liquidity has slipped into the deficit mode since September, which prompted banks to borrow heavily from the marginal standing facility to meet their funding needs. Banks’ borrowing through MSF had touched an all-time high of Rs 2.34 trillion on November 22. MSF borrowing averaged nearly Rs 0.95 trillion during September which further increased to Rs1.2 trillion during October-November 2023. Average fund parked under the SDF was at Rs 0.62 trillion and Rs 0.58 trillion in October and November, respectively.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express State Bank of India (SBI) on Friday hiked its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) on various tenures by 5-10 basis points (bps), a move that could make consumer loans, such as auto or home loans, more expensive for borrowers. SBI’s decision to raise the MCLR comes after the Reserve Bank of India’s decision to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5% in its latest monetary policy. The new rates are 8.20% for a one-month tenure, 8.20% for a three-month tenure, 8.55% for a six-month tenure, 8.65% for a one-year tenure, 8.75% for a two-year tenure, and 8.85% for a three-year tenure, according to the bank website. SBI chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara told CNBCTV18 that MCLR has been hiked after consideration of various cost components. However, the room for a further hike in the lending rate is limited. TMB submits three names for MD & CEO role to RBI Banks bid Rs 1.6 trillion in VRR auction as liquidity tightens NBFCs needed in all forms & sizes: Shriram Fin NPS corpus may rise 28% to Rs 15 trillion in FY25: Regulator “As far as policy rates are concerned, it is moving in the right direction. From that perspective, I do not expect policy rates to go up further,” he said, adding that the current hike in MCLR is unlikely to weigh on loan growth. Earlier this month, HDFC Bank had hiked its MCLR on select tenures by up to 5 bps. The revised rates for HDFC Bank’s loans are in the range of 8.70-9.25%.Going ahead, other banks may also opt to hike the MCLR, but the quantum would hinge on their cost of funds. IDBI Bank deputy managing director Suresh Khatanhar said only those banks with a high credit-to-deposit ratio and high growth requirements are inclined to hike the MCLR, as the cost of deposits would also be higher for these lenders. Biju E Punnachalil, chief risk officer at South Indian Bank , said: “MCLR of South Indian Bank has already been increased by 1.60% from May 2022. A further increase in MCLR may be limited as we do not expect much increase in the deposit rates.”While the RBI has increased the repo rate by 250 bps since May 2022, the one-year median MCLR rose by only 152 bps during the May 2022–October 2023 period, the ‘State of Economy ’ published by RBI’s monthly bulletin for November, showed Get live Share Market updates, Stock Market Quotes , and the latest India News … Read More and business news on Financial Express.

Nordic Splendour and Economic Growth Situated between Greenland and the UK, Iceland flaunts a GDP per capita of USD 78,845.

Which is the no.1 rich country? Luxembourg holds the title of the world’s richest country by GDP per capita. Is India a rich country, as of 2023? While India has a growing GDP, its large population keeps the GDP per capita relatively low. Which is the fourth richest country in the world? According to the IMF, Norway ranks as the fourth richest country globally. How did Qatar become rich?

Following the failure, they were subjected to disciplinary action in accordance with established policies, he added. In the Upper House, BJP MP Sushil Kumar Modi and CPI’s Binoy Viswam brought up concerns regarding the Breathalyser (BA) test. In his written reply Vaishnaw said that Loco Pilots are required to undergo the BA test in their respective lobbies. This is done to ensure safe train operations. He added that out of a total number of 8,28,03,387 BA tests carried out in the last five years, 1,761 Loco Pilots failed the test.

Additionally, Viswam inquired about the expenses related to the health , fitness, and eyesight of locomotive pilots since 2019, as well as the initiatives and recreational activities organised by the railways to maintain the fitness of locomotive pilots. In response to the CPI MP’s query, Vaishnaw stated that approximately Rs 15,572 crores were allocated for medical services from 2019-20 to 2022-23 for all railway personnel, including Loco Pilots. He further explained, “Refresher programs including recreational activities like sports, yoga, meditation are arranged in training schools for Loco Pilots.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express By Group Captain Praveer Purohit (retd) Fifty-two years ago, on 16 December, the map of South Asia changed forever when Lieutenant General A A K Niazi of the Pakistan Army signed the Instrument of Surrender at Dacca. This ended the two-week Indo-Pakistan war, and a new nation, Bangladesh , was born. Ranked as the most comprehensive and decisive victory since the Second World War, Bangladesh’s birth resulted from a long-drawn struggle centering on basic human rights, the desire to live with dignity and political equality. Pakistani intransigence and an ingrained sense of Punjabi superiority made Yahya Khan and his regime blind to the genuine and just aspirations of the Bengalis in what was then East Pakistan. Treating the December 1970 Pakistan general election result with disdain, Yahya instead unleashed one of the worst human rights violations in modern history through a brutal repression of the hapless Bengalis. Millions died, women suffered some of the most heinous crimes, and India had to bear the influx of almost 10 million refugees, fleeing the genocide of the Pakistani forces. Even before the formal commencement of the war on 03 December 1971, localised skirmishes had started between the Mukti Bahini and Pakistani forces. An aerial engagement also took place between the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and the Indian Air Force (IAF), on 22 November over Boyra. The Indian Navy’s covert ‘Operation X’ jointly with Mukti Bahini was well underway, achieving some spectacular successes. The Army’s Eastern Command was ready to commence its multi-directional thrust from four directions into East Pakistan. Considerable diplomatic efforts continued on the part of India to avoid a war, but it seemed the stars aligned against our diplomatic efforts. Thus, when PAF launched a pre-emptive strike on IAF airfields on 03 December, the dice were cast, and the countdown to Pakistan’s shameful defeat commenced. India and Bangladesh: A Strategic Partnership Shaping South Asia’s Future Major takeaways from Prime Minister Modi’s Kashmir visit Indian Army Recommends Major Changes to Agnipath Scheme Post-Article 370 abrogation: The evolving security and development landscape of Jammu and Kashmir The 1971 war and India’s preceding actions testified to the Indian leadership’s strategic thinking moulded in the Kautilyan framework. The Prime Minister, Mrs Indira Gandhi, was justifiably concerned over the human rights violations in East Pakistan and the consequent stress on India’s economy due to the refugees. At the strategic level, she read the situation correctly. Even as she made immense diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue, she was realistic enough to direct the Army, Navy, and IAF to prepare for the worst. India’s external intelligence agency, the Research & Analysis Wing (R&AW), was in its infancy (it was formed in 1968), yet was in the thick of action, gathering, collating and deriving high-quality intelligence. Domestically, the nation was being prepared for the possibility of a war. Inter-ministry and inter-service coordination and cooperation were enhanced. The three service chiefs had the PM’s ears and confidence. The services were given the higher directions for war, and operational planning and execution were left to them. Geopolitical developments, mainly in the US’s rapprochement with China, made Pakistan indispensable to the USA. Thus, despite overwhelming evidence of the grave situation perpetrated by Pakistan, including that presented by Mrs Gandhi during her visit to the USA and by the press, Indian pleas found the then-US administration cold. By entering into a treaty with the Soviet Union, India effectively addressed any potential Chinese misadventure. The Arthashastra lays importance on negotiations and advises prudence in the use of force, with war as the last resort. Kautilyan realism also implies that when all else has failed, the ruler should not hesitate to apply hard power, if required when national interests dictate. The Indian playbook during that tumultuous period was exactly that. At the sharp end of India’s strategy spear were the Army, Navy and IAF. Ably led by their competent chiefs, General (later Field Marshal) Sam Maneckshaw, Admiral SM Nanda and Air Chief Marshal PC Lal, respectively, the services knew exactly what to do and how to do it. Joint planning for operations was given due importance, and the period before the war was gainfully utilised for ‘work-up’ and building the required fighting wherewithal. Field commanders were given clear-cut tasks and operational freedom to execute them. Admiral Nanda convinced the political leadership of the need for the Navy’s participation in the war. The IAF, despite a creditable performance in 1965, had learned some hard lessons- all of which were duly addressed- and was raring to fire their guns in anger. In East Pakistan, the IAF quickly achieved air superiority and ruled the skies with impunity. PNS Ghazi, a submarine and pride of the Pakistan Navy, was sunk off the coast of Visakhapatnam and INS Vikrant, with its complement of Seahawk and Alize aircraft, wreaked havoc on the enemy. The military genius of Lt Gen Sagat Singh and the daredevilry of IAF helicopter pilots ensured the mighty Meghna River was crossed swiftly. The IAF and Army jointly carried out the most successful airborne assault post-World War II, at Tangail by para-dropping 2 Para, who captured the Poongli bridge and speedily linked up with 1 Maratha Light Infantry (1 MLI). In the West, too, the Indian Armed Forces proved their mettle. Notable actions included the naval and IAF strikes on Karachi, the battles of Basantar and Longewala, the gallant air action in defending Srinagar and the innovative use of An-12 for carpet bombing. The speed and alacrity of operations in East Pakistan ensured our forces swiftly reached Dacca, surprising the Pakistani army and their international benefactors. The final nail in the coffin was struck when IAF attacked the Government House on 14 December, and Maj Gen JFR Jacob ‘convinced’ Lt Gen Niazi to sign the Instrument of Surrender. Apart from the Armed Forces, crucial in our victory in 1971 were R&AW, BSF, Assam Police (who also trained the Mukti Bahini), Railways and the foreign ministry. Each played their role to near perfection. Perhaps the most under-acknowledged and vital role was that of the Mukti Bahini. In less than a decade since the war with China, India had well and truly redeemed itself. It stood up against not one but three nations, including a superpower. Chinese veto in the United Nations and refusal to recognise Bangladesh made no difference to the ground reality. In fighting a ‘just war,’ giving credit to the Mukti Bahini, ensuring timely exit from Bangladesh and honourably treating the Pakistani Prisoners of War (PoW), India held high moral ground. The absence of jingoism and sycophancy allowed the Armed Forces to function professionally and successfully. Mrs Indira Gandhi exhibited pragmatic statecraft, led the nation effectively and yet was effusive in her praise of the Armed Forces and support of our citizens. The speech by Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who was in the opposition) in Parliament praising the leadership of Mrs Gandhi was a great example of democratic ideals and values. Since the war, much has changed. Bangladesh has come a long way from a per capita GDP of around $ 91 in 1972 to $ 2730 in 2022 (an almost 29 times increase). Contrast this with Pakistan, whose per capita GDP in 1972 was $ 151 and has shown only a 10-fold increase to $ 1597 in 2022. While Bangladesh is one of the fastest-growing economies, Pakistan has spiralled into an abyss of economic misery, social chaos, violence, radicalisation, and strife. Its use of religion in statecraft has miserably failed. Some believe that India should have settled the Kashmir issue by force in 1971 and have criticised India’s apparent ‘soft’ stand. These people may not have read ‘Pure Strategy’ by Everett Carl Dolman, who, in Chapter 2, presciently states that “overreaching in war is the costliest strategic mistake”. Indian statecraft had recognised this important aspect in 1971, much before Dolman published his book in 2005. Indian statecraft also avoided giving a religious twist to the events in 1971, instead rightly focusing on the humanitarian angle. Even under adverse conditions, our core value of plurality was not compromised. This ‘Vijay Diwas’ is an apt occasion to remember and acknowledge the statesmanship of the national leadership and valour of the Army, Navy, and IAF, who shaped a great strategic victory in 1971. Equally important is to remember the values on which this war was fought and ensure our uncompromising adherence to those.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Share Market News Today | Sensex, Nifty, Share Prices Highlights: The benchmark equity indices ended Week’s last trading session in positive territory. The NSE Nifty 50 soared 1.29% to settle at a record high of 21,456.65, while the BSE Sensex as much as 969.55 points to 71,483.75. The broader indices settled higher with the gains led by Nifty 100 and Nifty 200 stocks. The Bank Nifty index climbed 411.25 points, or 0.86%, to settle at 48,143.55. IT and PSU Bank stocks led the gains among the other sectoral indices and soared over 4% and 2%, respectively, while Financial Services and Realty stocks settled in red. TCS, HCL Tech, Infosys, SBI and Tata Steel were the top gainers on the NSE Nifty 50, while the laggards included HDFC Life Insurance, Nestle India, SBI Life Insurance Company, Bharti Airtel and Bajaj Auto. The volatility index (India Vix) ended up 6.55%. 15:35 (IST) 15 Dec 2023 Markets at close The NSE Nifty 50 soared 1.29% to settle at a record high of 21,456.65, while the BSE Sensex as much as 969.55 points to 71,483.75 15:23 (IST) 15 Dec 2023 USD-INR “USDINR CMP- 83.03 (spot) Indian Rupee appreciated on Friday as domestic markets has witnessed an early Santa Claus rally and hit fresh record highs. Weak US Dollar and expectations of fresh foreign inflows further supported the domestic currency. Upbeat Chinese industrial production data also extended gains in the Asian markets. US Dollar fell to a five and half month low on US Federal Reserve monetary policy which led to a rally in the global markets. Yesterday, ECB and Bank of England left their interest rates unchanged at 4.5% and 5.5% respectively but maintained a hawkish stance and maintained that. Further tightening may be required as inflation remains high. We expect Rupee to trade with a slight positive bias on rise in risk appetite in global markets and a soft tone in the US Dollar. Inflows by FIIs may also support Rupee. However, buying of Dollars by RBI to shore up its forex reserves may cap sharp upside. Traders may take cues from Empire State Manufacturing Index, Industrial Production and PMI data from US. In the domestic markets, traders may take cues from trade deficit data. USDINR spot price is expected to trade in a range of Rs 82.60 to Rs 83.35.” – Anuj Choudhary Research Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. 15:17 (IST) 15 Dec 2023 Crude oil – Up for the third straight day “WTI front-month futures, currently up nearly 0.50% at $72, closed with a gain of 1.25% at $71.58 yesterday. A weaker Dollar, lower US yields, encouraging US data and a dovish Federal Reserve helped the counter extend its rally to a third consecutive day. The US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision signalling pivoting continues to reverberate through the financial markets with markets continuing in ‘buy everything’ mode. The US Dollar Index tumbled even after encouraging retail sales and weekly job data as the ECB and Bank of England kept their rates unchanged and more importantly, did not drop their guards against inflation. The Bank of England’s policymakers suggested that it is premature to anticipate rate cuts. China’s industrial production and retail sales data released today have been somewhat encouraging. The International Energy Agency’s report released yesterday was somewhat supportive for the counter. The IEA said that global oil demand would grow by 1.1 million barrels per day in 2024, up slightly from its previous forecast of 930,000 barrels per day; thus, the Agency upgraded its demand outlook for 2024 by 130,000 barrels a day compared with its previous estimate. Crude oil may rise to $75 in the near-term. Support is at $70/$67,” said Praveen Singh – Associate VP, Fundamental Currencies and Commodities, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. 14:07 (IST) 15 Dec 2023 Metals and Mining Sector Update “The decrease in Chinese inventories, coupled with expectations of stimulus, has sparked an upsurge in steel prices in China. Although coking coal price has rallied defying market expectations, it is now trading at an unsustainably high price vs historical averages. Indian steel markets witnessed a soft quarter with average prices broadly flat sequentially. Global steel making raw materials continued to rally – coking coal at US$330/t, iron ore at US$120/t driven by worker strikes and higher Chinese production respectively. Spreads of India steel players are likely to be under pressure in 3QFY24 driven by flat realizations and soaring coking coal consumption cost. Consequently, we estimate an EBITDA margin compression of INR1.5k+/ton QoQ. Volume growth is likely to be muted sequentially. Working capital requirements on account of higher coking coal prices and possibly higher steel inventory could negate any chances of net debt reduction. However, recent run up in China prices, sound bites around China stimulus, higher expected consumption in 4Q owing to general elections and recent media articles pointing towards import curb measures by ministry have led to a rally in steel names. While we are yet to see an improvement in spot spreads, any let up in coking coal price amidst price rise in China can help the rally sustain into CY24. JSPL (lowest leverage, highest volume growth over next few years) and Hindalco (Novelis delivering record margins) remain our top picks in the space,” said Ashutosh Somani of JM Financials. 13:55 (IST) 15 Dec 2023 Automobiles sector Quarterly update and outlook from global OEMs “As per most OEMs, supply constraints continued to ease during the quarter. Although wholesales for major OEMs declined sequentially owing to seasonality and workmen strikes, demand momentum remains healthy. Majority of the OEMs have maintained volume guidance for CY23. Inflationary pressure has softened and companies have guided for better margin outlook during the year. Global Tractor demand remains mixed with positive outlook for large agri equipment and inventory destocking for small agri equipment. Tyre companies indicated of sluggish demand environment and continued inventory destocking in replacement market in the near term. Overall, automakers are maintaining a positive mid-term outlook, focusing on executing healthy order book and move to electrification. We expect revenue/margins of Indian auto companies with higher global exposure like SAMIL / TTMT / SONACOMS to continue to improve/remain steady, ” said Vivek Kumar of JM Financials 13:41 (IST) 15 Dec 2023 Alkem Laboratories appoints Ashish Sehgal into management Alkem Laboratories appointed Ashish Sehgal to hold senior management position in the company and will be effective from December 15, 2023. The stock gains by 1.88% to Rs 4,948.35 in intra-day trade on Friday. 13:26 (IST) 15 Dec 2023 Markets so far 13:14 (IST) 15 Dec 2023 Bullion Outlook “Gold and silver experienced a significant surge, buoyed by the unexpected revelations from the Federal Reserve meeting. The U.S. Fed indicated that the terminal rate has been reached based on the latest CPI and PPI data. Also, the Fed hinted at the possibility of three rate cuts in 2024. Consequently, the dollar index plummeted, and U.S. 10-year bond yields fell below 4.0%. The U.S. stock market achieved its yearly high, and other riskier asset classes demonstrated resilience. Anticipating continued volatility in today’s session, gold’s support is identified at $2005-2018, with resistance at $2044-2055. Meanwhile, silver is expected to find support at $23.78-23.61, with resistance at $24.22-24.40. In INR, gold’s support is at Rs 62,070-61,810, and resistance is at Rs 62,590-62,710. For silver in INR, support is seen at Rs 74,450-73,880, while resistance stands at Rs 75,650-76,130,” said Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities Ltd 12:56 (IST) 15 Dec 2023 Coforge Faces Rs 10,000 GST Penalty Coforge has received an order from GST Authority imposing penalty of ₹10,000 under applicable provisions of Central Goods and Services Act, 2017.

The surge came in the wake of the IEA optimistic demand forecast for 2024, unveiled in its monthly report released on Thursday. According to the IEA, global oil consumption is anticipated to increase by 1.1 million barrels per day in 2024, reflecting a 130,000-barrel-per-day upward revision from its previous projection. This adjustment is attributed to an improved outlook for the U.S. and lower oil prices. Additionally, the rally in crude oil prices was bolstered by a decline in the dollar index to 19-week lows and a slip in U.S. 10-year bond yields below the 4.0% threshold, following signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve indicating potential rate cuts in 2024. Furthermore, an uptick in risk appetite and the strength observed in global equity markets provided additional support for crude oil prices. Expectations are for crude oil prices to maintain volatility in today’s session. The commodity finds support in the range of $71.50–70.80, with resistance levels identified at $72.90–73.50. In terms of INR, crude oil is anticipated to have support at Rs 5,880–5,810, while resistance is projected at Rs 6,120–6,190,” said Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities Ltd. 11:35 (IST) 15 Dec 2023 Nifty IT gains over 4% The N ifty IT index gains more than 4% in intra-day trade on Friday.

While still in the consultation stage, this innovative idea has the potential to significantly impact insurers by influencing surrender values and, subsequently, trimming fees inversely. Also Read: Jefferies report unveils potential disruptions in insurance sector with new threshold premium concept 10:56 (IST) 15 Dec 2023 Nifty outlook “Yesterday’s run just about met 21220, pencilled in yesterday as the upside objective. Prospects of extension into the 21430-600 region, now rests on the ability to hold above 21160 which may be used as the downside marker for today. Slippage past the same could ask support from 20890, but will also expose 20700. Given how divergences are maturing in different oscillators, our bets are on a turn lower from the top,” Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services . 10:44 (IST) 15 Dec 2023 Markets so far 10:35 (IST) 15 Dec 2023 Derivative outlook “ Nifty weekly contract has highest open interest at 21200 for Calls and 21150 for Puts while monthly contracts have highest open interest at 21000 for Calls and 21000 for Puts.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Leaders of India and Oman at the end of talks adopted a new ‘India-Oman joint vision, a partnership for future’ under which both countries will work in ten different areas. During the bilateral talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tarik in New Delhi, the focus was on deepening cooperation in various sectors including maritime security, trade and investment space cooperation, agriculture and food and energy security. The two leaders witnessed the signing of five agreements in different areas including field of culture; in the field of Information Technology; Gainful Employment of Accompanying Persons of Official Employees; cooperation in the exchange of intelligence related to money laundering, associated predicate offences and terrorism financing; and establishment of the ICCR Chair of Indian Studies- Hindi Language India and Bangladesh: A Strategic Partnership Shaping South Asia’s Future Major takeaways from Prime Minister Modi’s Kashmir visit Indian Army Recommends Major Changes to Agnipath Scheme Post-Article 370 abrogation: The evolving security and development landscape of Jammu and Kashmir On Saturday, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held delegation-level talks with the Sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tarik, in New Delhi said: “Today we are adopting a new India -Oman joint vision, a partnership for the future. In this joint vision, concrete action points have been agreed upon in ten different areas. I am confident that the joint vision will give a new and modern shape to our partnership.” Both leaders also discussed the CEPA agreement for which two rounds of negotiations have already taken place and several important issues have been completed successfully. The Prime Minister in his address expressed hope that the agreement will be signed soon as that will add a new dimension to the economic co-operation between the two countries. Historic Visit PM Modi termed the Sultan’s visit as `historic’. The state visit of the Sultan comes after 26 years. T-20I He congratulated Oman for qualifying for the T20I cricket World Cup. This will be co-hosted by the West Indies and the US in 2024. Special MEA Briefing by Foreign Secretary Speaking about the visit, Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said, “The PM has just concluded his talks with the head of the state, the Sultanate of Oman, his majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tarik, who is currently on a state visit to India. His majesty is accompanied on this visit by a very high-level delegation comprising of his deputy PM for Defence, seven Cabinet ministers and three vice ministers.” He mentioned that both leaders expressed worries about terrorism and explored potential collaboration in maritime activities, space ventures, and securing energy, especially green energy. The discussions encompassed various aspects of bilateral involvement, covering maritime collaboration, trade, investment, and exploration in emerging areas like space and financial technology. “They also talked about potential cooperation in energy security, focusing on green energy, and explored opportunities to enhance people-to-people connections, including through the widely enjoyed game of cricket in both nations,” he included. He highlighted that PM Modi and the Sultan of Oman shared views on regional and global matters during their exchange. Significant outcomes from the discussion The leaders embraced the India Oman Joint Vision Partnership, charting a course rooted in Oman Vision 2040 and India’s Amrit Kaal vision. This blueprint outlines collaboration in eight to ten areas, including maritime cooperation, connectivity, space, energy security, and green energy. The focus spans maritime cooperation, energy security (especially green hydrogen), digital payments, fintech, health , tourism, and hospitality. The two leaders talked about disaster management, agriculture, food security, and cricket. The cooperation in clean energy will also focus on green hydrogen. The ongoing discussions related to CEPA featured prominently between the two leaders, said the foreign secretary. According to the FS, besides an exchange on views on trade in Indian rupees, PM Modi and the visiting Sultan of Oman talked about the possibility of Oman utilising India’s digital payment system UPI with a corresponding Omani platform. Was the situation in West Asia discussed? Yes. To a question, Kwatra said the challenges arising out of the conflict in Gaza were definitely an important element of discussions. “There was a shared appreciation of the continuing challenge that both countries face from the emerging multiple dimensions of the conflict, including the catastrophic humanitarian situation which is there,” Kwatra said on the Hamas-Israel conflict. Also, the challenge of terrorism and the larger need to try and achieve a two-state solution as a way forward was discussed. “With regard to the situation there, it was discussed and both leaders exchanged in detail their perspective of the situation there,” he said. Bilateral Relations between the two countries India and the Gulf nation are strategic partners and the bilateral trade and investment relationship between the two nations has been on an upswing in the last few years. Diplomatic ties started between these nations in 1955, evolving into a robust strategic alliance by 2008. Oman holds a unique status as India’s foremost defence ally in the Gulf, fostering a pivotal partnership marked by defence collaboration. As has been reported previously, Oman stands alone in West Asia, engaging in routine bilateral exercises and staff-level discussions with all three branches of the Indian Armed Forces. Demonstrating the strength of this bond, Oman received a special invitation from India to participate in the G20 Summit during India’s presidency, contributing actively to over 150 working group sessions and multiple G20 ministerial meetings. More about the visit The visiting Sultan after meeting with Prime Minister Modi went to the National Gallery of Modern Art in Delhi. Earlier, on Saturday, PM Modi and President Droupadi Murmu received the Sultan at the Rashtrapati Bhawan and he was accorded a ceremonial reception at the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi. On December 15, the Sultan of Oman arrived at the Delhi airport and was received by the Union Minister of State (MoS) for External Affairs, V Muraleedharan. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Union Minister of Commerce & Industry , Piyush Goyal, Union Minister of State V Muraleedhraran, and Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra were also present in the meeting.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express In today’s audio, we talk about Reliance Industries being the largest wealth creator in India and Essar group’s agreements with Gujarat government, among other things. Today’s Latest Business News at 09:30 am on 15th December, 2023. [Disclaimer: This transcript is auto-generated] === Let’s begin…Union Power Minister, R K Singh has said that even after the country adds 80 GW of thermal capacity by 2030, the share of coal-based power in installed capacity will come down to 23% by then from 68% in 2014. He said this while talking about the final deal adopted at the recently concluded COP28 summit. The government aims to add 80 GW of thermal capacity by 2030 in order to meet the rising power demand while working towards tripling it’s renewable energy capacity to 500 GW in the same timeline. Addressing the country’s network of transmission lines, Singh said that the country is not lagging behind but the pace of RE capacity addition is much faster than the building of transmission lines. Next up, Reliance Industries (RIL) continued to be the largest wealth creator in India for the fifth time in succession, generating Rupees 9.6 trillion during the 2018-23 period. The top 100 companies created Rupees 70.5 trillion through the five-year period, showed the Wealth Creation Study for 2018-2023 by Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL). RIL contributed 13.7% to the total wealth created by the top 100, with its share price showing a 22% CAGR. Over the last 17 five-year study periods, RIL ranked first on 10 occasions. TCS, ICICI Bank, Infosys, and Airtel were others among the top five. Lloyds Metals, a relatively low-profile entity, emerged the ‘Fastest Wealth Creator’ at a CAGR of 79%. Moving on, Pierer Mobility AG, which owns the KTM and Husqvarna brands, has announced that it would partially relocate production and R&D activities from Austria to China (CFMOTO) and India (Bajaj Auto). Bajaj Auto is part-owner of the company, which both manufactures and sells the KTM and Husqvarna brands. The company said that unfavourable economic conditions in Europe prompted the decision to relocate. It added that, quote, “Among other things, this (decision) is intended to exploit cost advantages in these regions and accelerate development and industrialisation processes,” unquote The decision would lead to a reduction in staff of up to 300 employees at the Austrian locations in 2024. The company expects the global economic environment to be difficult in FY24. In other news, Bengaluru-based QuadGen Wireless Solutions has entered into a partnership with Vietnam’s state-owned telecom major Viettel High Tech to manufacture 5G network equipment. The products will include radio access, optical transmission and core network equipment, particularly targeted for the sub-urban and rural markets where the low average per-user revenue makes it cost intensive for telecom operators to deploy 5G network equipment. The partnership also includes the participation of Silicon Valley-based Ai20X. The company said that while QuadGen brings in its network engineering and software expertise and Viettel brings in design, R&D, and manufacturing knowledge, Ai20X creates an ecosystem to bring in other companies with differentiating products. Next up, Essar group has signed three agreements with the Gujarat government to invest Rs 55,000 crore across port, power and energy transition, and create more than 10,000 jobs. This is as part of the company’s renewed phase of making strategic investments in the state. The group has signed an MOU to develop a 1 giga watt green hydrogen project with an estimated Rs 30,000-crore investment. This would be undertaken by EET Future Energy, an Essar Group company, and will initially focus on export of green hydrogen derivatives to Europe. The company will set up a 1 GW green hydrogen electrolyser near Khambhaliya in the Devbhoomi Dwarka district, which will create 4,500 direct and indirect jobs. Additionally, Marquee global investors like UAE’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and Dutch pension fund APG have put in bids to buy Canada’s largest pension fund manager CPPIB’s 50% stake in IndoSpace Core, said sources in the know. Canadian investor Oxford Properties and Ivanhoe Cambridge, the real estate arm of Canadian pension fund CDPQ, are also in the race. As per the sources, the deal is expected to be of around $700 million and CPPIB has given the mandate to Morgan Stanley to run the sale process. IndoSpace Core, an owner and developer of warehouses, is a joint venture between IndoSpace and CPPIB, which is the majority owner with an about 80% in the venture.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Delhi’s Safdarjung Tomb, a graceful Mughal architectural marvel that stands as a symbol of the city’s rich cultural heritage, recently found itself in an amusing situation. The main door of this historical landmark was “inadvertently” painted with the wrong color which in no way matched its original aesthetic, a report by The Times of India claimed. The good news is that the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has now swiftly jumped to action to rectify this error, and embarked on a mission to restore the door’s original colour. According to the report, the ASI officials said that the door was painted a dark yellow colour when originally, it was painted light yellow. The officials admitted that they painted a darker yellow as they thought it would lighten up after drying. But that didn’t happen. They said they are now repainting it as the ASI is very sensitive and particular about retaining the originality of the structure. However, this mishap did delay the work by a month. The incident is a gentle reminder of how delicate is the balance between conservation and modernization in safeguarding the essence of historical treasures. Built in the 18th century, the Safdarjung Tomb stands as a testament to the opulence and grandeur of the Mughal era. The tomb was commissioned by Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula in memory of his father.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Passenger movement through Maitri Setu, the bridge connecting India and Bangladesh in south Tripura district, will commence by September this year, according to a senior government official. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina virtually inaugurated the Maitri Setu in March 2021. The bridge, spanning 1.9 km over the Feni River, connects Sabroom in India with Ramgarh in Bangladesh. “The Maitri Setu has already been inaugurated. The land port is almost ready…The movement of passengers through the bridge will commence in September. It will take two or three months to introduce goods movement after passenger movement gets underway,” said Kiran Gitte, Secretary of Tripura’s Industries and Commerce Department, during a press conference last week. The initiation of goods movement through the bridge is considered strategically significant, not only for Tripura but also for the entire northeast region. The Chittagong port in Bangladesh is just 80 km from Tripura’s Sabroom, offering potential for enhanced trade routes. Additionally, Gitte announced that the Kamalasagar border haat in Tripura’s Sepahijala district, closed due to the Covid pandemic, would be reopening soon. Currently, the Srinagar border haat in south Tripura district is operational. Cabinet clears Rs 76,220-crore mega sea port on west coast Traffic relief for Noida commuters!

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The 72nd meeting of the Network Planning Group (NPG) took place in New Delhi this week. The session was chaired by Rajeev Singh Thakur who is the Additional Secretary of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). The primary focus was on evaluating three major infrastructure projects from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. Each project was assessed for its alignment with the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways proposed a project involving the construction and upgrading of a 51-km section of NH-701 from Rafiabad to Chamkot. This project includes both greenfield (14.34 km) and brownfield (36.66 km) developments, with an estimated cost of INR 1,405 Crores.

New underpass linking Jungle Trail to Mahamaya flyover to come up by year-end – Details here Kolkata Metro to initiate special night service from June 24 – Know more Delhi Metro Update: Centre approves DMRC’s Rs 6,231 crore Rithala-Narela-Kundli metro corridor – Check route, stations, cost and more The improved route will significantly enhance connectivity for villages like Kupwara, Chowkibal, and Tangdhar. This upgrade will bolster logistical support for defense forces and elevate socio-economic conditions by offering better access to healthcare, education, and business opportunities. The aim is to construct a third rail line between Gudur and Renigunta stations in Andhra’s Tirupati district. The 83.17 km line is designed to increase the capacity of the existing double line and is estimated to cost INR 884 Crores. Anticipated Impact This project will boost the efficiency of passenger and cargo movement. It requires 36.58 hectares of land and includes infrastructure upgrades such as new bridges, extended underpasses, and advanced signalling systems. These improvements are expected to significantly boost regional economic activities. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has proposed extending the operational metro corridor from Vanaz to Ramwadi in Pune. The project involves extending two lines: a 1.12 km elevated section from Vanaz to Chandani Chowk and an 11.63 km elevated section from Ramwadi to Wagholi/Vitthalwadi. The total length of this elevated metro corridor will be 12.75 km, with an estimated cost of INR 3,757 crores. Anticipated Impact The daily ridership for the line is expected to reach 3.59 lakhs by 2027, growing to 9.93 lakhs by 2057. This extension will link central Pune with expanding suburbs, cutting travel time, easing road congestion, and greatly improving the city’s public transportation network. During the meeting, all projects were evaluated for their integrated planning and alignment with the principles of the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (NMP). The focus is on the socio-economic advantages, better connectivity, lower transit expenses, and improved efficiency. Additionally, the projects seek to promote multimodal integration, thereby improving overall transportation and logistics networks. All these infrastructure projects are expected to play pivotal roles in integrating various modes of transport to provide substantial socio-economic benefits. They are set to contribute significantly to the overall development of the regions, improving ease of living and fostering economic growth.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Kolkata Metro has embarked on a transformative journey to replace its traditional steel-made third rail with a modern aluminum counterpart. This initiative by Kolkata Metro marks a significant move aimed at enhancing its operational efficiency and reducing energy consumption of its metro trains. This ambitious initiative commenced on June 13 at Noapara in Baranagar. According to the statement issued by Kolkata Metro, this marks a pivotal moment in the metro’s history, promising substantial benefits across its network. This step reflects Kolkata Metro’s dedication to meeting global benchmarks set by leading cities such as Singapore, London, Moscow, Berlin, Munich, and Istanbul. The motive of this shift is not only to modernise the metro’s infrastructure but also to significantly enhance its energy efficiency and operational performance. Cabinet clears Rs 76,220-crore mega sea port on west coast Traffic relief for Noida commuters! New underpass linking Jungle Trail to Mahamaya flyover to come up by year-end – Details here Kolkata Metro to initiate special night service from June 24 – Know more Delhi Metro Update: Centre approves DMRC’s Rs 6,231 crore Rithala-Narela-Kundli metro corridor – Check route, stations, cost and more The aluminum third rail enhances efficiency by reducing system voltage drops and consequent energy losses due to its superior electrical conductivity. This improvement allows for faster acceleration of running metros, reducing trip times and enabling increased service frequency during peak hours. This advancement significantly boosts the overall efficiency of metro operations and results in substantial energy savings, thereby reducing operational costs for the Kolkata Metro. The return on investment for replacing the third rail is anticipated within three years. The statement also added that the replacement project is scheduled for completion within two years. Aluminum third rails have already been installed along the East-West Metro (Green Line) and the Joka-Taratala stretch of the Purple Line, and they will be incorporated into all future corridors of the Kolkata Metro. The environmental impact of this upgrade is noteworthy. Over its lifetime, the aluminum third rail is projected to reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 50,000 tons, contributing significantly to Kolkata’s efforts towards a greener future. “Apart from this, Aluminum Third Rail will require less maintenance and will be highly reliable and stable. In a hot and humid city like Kolkata this replacement will be very much beneficial and inside the tunnel lesser heat will be generated during the time of contact of Third Rail Current Collector (TRCC) with this Third Rail,” the statement said. “For maintenance work, the new Third Rail will not require any welding as two such rails can be joined with the help of splice joint. It will help to maintain the air quality inside the tunnels,” it added.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) officials on Saturday (June 15) informed that there will be adjustments to the timings of the last and first trains on Sunday and Monday due to ongoing construction on a 490-meter stretch of the Janakpuri West to R K Ashram corridor of Phase-IV of Delhi Metro’s Yellow Line. The officials said that the affected stretch, which passes over the Haiderpur Badli Mor Metro station, runs parallel to the operational Yellow Line and reaches a height of approximately 28.36 meters, marking the highest rail level in the entire Delhi Metro network. DMRC’s principal executive director corporate communications, Anuj Dayal revealed that the last train from Samaypur Badli to Millennium City Centre Gurugram will depart at 10:45 pm instead of 11 pm on Sunday. Similarly, the last train from Millennium City Centre Gurugram to Samaypur Badli will depart at 9:30 pm instead of 11 pm.

During this period, there will be no train services available between the Samaypur Badli and Jahangirpuri stations after 11 pm on Sunday and before 7 am on Monday. Dayal also highlighted that normal train services will continue on the remaining major sections of the Yellow Line from Jahangirpuri to Millennium City Centre Gurugram during this period. Passengers will be informed about train destinations and platform changes via announcements at stations and inside trains on the Yellow Line, he added. He emphasised that DMRC prioritizes passenger convenience during such challenging engineering projects, which involve working near operational corridors. The construction work is meticulously planned to take place only during nighttime shutdowns, ensuring minimal disruption to passenger services, he explained. This approach allows the completion of work before the resumption of regular services the following day.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) is likely to conduct the first trial run of the Namo Bharat regional rail in the Delhi section by the year’s end. According to a news report in Hindustan Times, the civil construction of the viaduct in Delhi is nearing completion, with ongoing work at the station premises. The inauguration of the Delhi section of the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) is scheduled for mid-2025. This 14-km-long section, encompassing Sarai Kale Khan, New Ashok Nagar, and Anand Vihar RRTS stations, is progressing rapidly. A Cabinet clears Rs 76,220-crore mega sea port on west coast Traffic relief for Noida commuters! New underpass linking Jungle Trail to Mahamaya flyover to come up by year-end – Details here Kolkata Metro to initiate special night service from June 24 – Know more Delhi Metro Update: Centre approves DMRC’s Rs 6,231 crore Rithala-Narela-Kundli metro corridor – Check route, stations, cost and more The report quoted Puneet Vats, Chief Public Relations Officer of NCRTC saying that “the construction of the RRTS viaduct in the Delhi section of the Delhi-Meerut corridor is almost complete. The trial runs are likely to be started in Delhi by the end of this year. The RRTS stations – Sarai Kale Khan, New Ashok Nagar, and Anand Vihar (underground) in Delhi – have already taken shape and finishing work is underway.” Trial runs are conducted post-completion of signalling and telecommunication work, marking readiness for operational service. Following these trials, NCRTC will apply for a safety certificate from the Commission of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS), which conducts multiple inspections before granting certification. Officials affirmed that once CMRS certification is secured, the RRTS can be inaugurated as per the government’s scheduled time. The Delhi section comprises a 9 km elevated stretch and a 5 km underground stretch.According to the HT report, the viaduct work for the elevated portion is finished up to Sarai Kale Khan station, with ongoing activities including track laying and installation of overhead electrification (OHE). The Sarai Kale Khan station, serving as the interchange point for the initial three RRTS lines, is currently in an advanced stage of construction, with ongoing roof and finishing work. “This station is designed for seamless integration with other transport modes, including a bus stand, railway station, and Metro station, allowing passengers to switch between these modes without exiting the station. It has four tracks and six platforms, two of which are floating platforms, on the same level for all three RRTS lines,” said an NCRTC official. The Sarai Kale Khan RRTS station will feature connections to the Veer Haqiqat Rai ISBT via an entry/exit gate and a dedicated footbridge, and to the Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station through a foot-over bridge (FOB) travelator. Moreover, the station will be linked to the Delhi Metro Pink Line, a city bus stop, and will have an exit opening onto the Ring Road. At the New Ashok Nagar station, located adjacent to the existing Ashok Nagar metro station, the track laying has been finished, and final roofing touches are underway. This station is set to cater to residents of New Ashok Nagar and Noida, providing connectivity towards Meerut. “Construction at the Anand Vihar underground station is progressing rapidly, providing multi-modal integration with Delhi Metro, interstate bus services, Swami Vivekananda (Anand Vihar) interstate bus stand, city bus stand, Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation bus stand at Kaushambi, and two Metro corridors (Pink and Blue lines), along with Anand Vihar railway station,” the official informed. Currently, the Namo Bharat train services run across eight stations covering a 34km route from Sahibabad to Modi Nagar North along the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor. Officials have indicated that the Meerut South RRTS station is nearing completion and is expected to be operational by the end of the year. This development will expand the operational length of the RRTS corridor to 42km, according to officials.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express In its first attempt at monetisation through Toll Operate Transfer (ToT) mode this financial year, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has invited bids for three bundles of highways at one go as against two bundles in earlier rounds . The investor response to earlier rounds of monetisation through ToT has led to NHAI planning to put three bundles of highways on block every quarter. The highway builder has invited bids for monetising 801.7 km of national highways through Toll Operate Transfer (ToT) mode in the first round. Cabinet clears Rs 76,220-crore mega sea port on west coast Traffic relief for Noida commuters! New underpass linking Jungle Trail to Mahamaya flyover to come up by year-end – Details here Kolkata Metro to initiate special night service from June 24 – Know more Delhi Metro Update: Centre approves DMRC’s Rs 6,231 crore Rithala-Narela-Kundli metro corridor – Check route, stations, cost and more The highways have been grouped together in three bundles and are in states of Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Odisha. In ToT bundle 17 Kanpur-Lucknow-Ayodhya section and Ayodhya-Gorakhpur section of highways in Uttar Pradesh totalling 333.4 km are on offer. In Bundle 18 Chandikhol-Bhadrak and Panikholi – Rimuli sections on two highways in Odisha of total length of 283.8 km are on offer. In Bundle 19 Trichy – Thanjavur and Madurai – Tuticorin sections of highways of total length of 184.5 km in Tamil Nadu are open for bidding. Last year for bundles 11, 12, 13 and 14 bids had come from the likes of KKR-backed Highways Infrastructure Trust, Cube Highways, IRB Infrastructure Trust, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority-backed funds, National Investment and Infrastructure Trust (NIIF) and Adani Group . Around Rs 15,968 was raised through transfer of these bundles to outside investors. Under ToT the investors get the right to collect toll on highways for 20 years after making an upfront payment to NHAI, the owner. According to analysts on an average the realisation from monetisation of every kilometre of highway is around Rs 22 crore. The amount, however, varies wildly depending on the traffic density and the user base- whether it is used more by personal vehicles or commercial vehicles. Bidding process for Bundle 15 and Bundle 16 is in progress. These bundles have three highway stretches 375 km long in the states of Telangana and Tamil Nadu. The aggression on ToT comes as NHAI chases the Rs 54.000 crore target for monetisation this financial year, which is much higher than Rs 40,227 achieved last year. Of the FY 25 target, Rs 8,000 will come from project based financing and Rs 46,000 crore from ToT and Infrastructure Investment Trust. National Highways Infrastructure Trust (NHIT) has already said that its share will be Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 crore in this year’s monetisation plan. The highway builder has identified 33 highway stretches of 2741 km that will be offered in the monetisation drive.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya on Monday (June 17) announced that certain proposed routes of the under-construction metro rail in Indore have faced criticism from segments of the public and social organizations. Consequently, officials have been instructed to conduct a fresh feasibility survey and submit a report within a month. Speaking to reporters following an open house meeting with local stakeholders of the metro rail project, Vijayvargiya said, “It seems public and representatives of social organisations are unhappy with the present planning of some metro rail routes in the city. The participants have suggested changes, especially in the underground portion of the metro rail project.” “Officials have been instructed to conduct a new feasibility survey on technical and financial aspects in view of these suggestions and submit a report within a month. Around 30 to 40 percent work of the metro rail project in the city has been completed. All decisions have already been taken at the level of the Central and state governments regarding this project,” he added.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari recently said that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will soon commence the Rs 4,000-crore Chattergala tunnel project in Jammu and Kashmir. Gadkari chaired a review meeting attended by Union Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office, Jitendra Singh. “The prestigious Chhatergala tunnel work, costing about Rs 4,000 crore, will be executed by the NHAI, and the underpasses on the Kathua express corridor section, wherever demanded by the public, will be undertaken at the earliest,” stated an official spokesperson after the meeting. Jitendra Singh expressed gratitude to Gadkari for accepting most of his suggestions and proposals. He noted that the tunnel proposal was initiated six years ago, with the Border Roads Organisation preparing the detailed project report. However, the project was delayed due to a lack of funds. Now, the NHAI will construct the new national highway from Lakhanpur to Basohli-Bani to Bhaderwah-Doda. Cabinet clears Rs 76,220-crore mega sea port on west coast Traffic relief for Noida commuters!

It will reduce travel time, boost businesses, create employment, and generate revenue,” Singh said. Regarding the Delhi-Katra express corridor, Singh recalled the project’s approval process, which began in 2015. Initial delays occurred due to Punjab’s demand for a similar corridor between Delhi and Amritsar. A compromise led to the express corridor between Delhi and Katra with stopovers in Amritsar and Kathua, finalizing the project. Singh confirmed that the corridor is in its final construction phase and expressed satisfaction that public demands for underpasses in locations like Hatli, Rajbagh, Chann Arorian, Chapper, and Kootah had been accepted to benefit locals.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express Investments in key infrastructure sectors of roads, renewable energy and real estate may increase by 38% to Rs 15 trillion by 2025-26 of which the highway sector alone will account for 60%, according to Crisil Ratings. Overall capital outlay for the roads sector is seen at Rs 9 trillion for FY25-FY26 with most of the investments coming from central and state governments. Private sector share is expected to improve moving forward, the agency added. Strengthened order books of road developers will support 11% growth in highway construction, which is seen at 12,500 km per year over the next two fiscals. Strong awarding in the last few years, barring last financial year, has led to a comfortable order book of rod developers which will drive execution. Cabinet clears Rs 76,220-crore mega sea port on west coast Traffic relief for Noida commuters! New underpass linking Jungle Trail to Mahamaya flyover to come up by year-end – Details here Kolkata Metro to initiate special night service from June 24 – Know more Delhi Metro Update: Centre approves DMRC’s Rs 6,231 crore Rithala-Narela-Kundli metro corridor – Check route, stations, cost and more Investment interest remains strong in the roads sector which has the highest number of infrastructure investment trusts (InVITs) at 10. The assets under management of road sector InVITs is expected to grow to Rs 3 trillion in the current fiscal year from Rs 2 trillion in FY 24. InVITs offer exit routes and liquidity to developers who can then take on new projects. In the roads sector, as government budgetary allocation is moderating, amendments in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) toll model concession agreement have been made to increase private participation. However, improvement in traffic estimation accuracy and increase in willingness of lenders to fund BOT toll projects will bear watching, Crisil said. For renewables (RE), the agency estimates an investment of Rs 3 trillion over the period of next two years, up from Rs 1.8 trillion last financial year as the demand for sustainable energy transition increases. It further sees addition of 50 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy capacity during the period taking the country’s total RE capacity to 180 GW by FY26. The government’s target of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy capacity by 2030 is driving up auctions which has created a strong pipeline, the agency said. In FY24, the country saw renewable energy project auctions of 35 GW, the highest ever in a single fiscal, resulting in a strong pipeline of 75 GW. Even though the sector has been able to attract investments and witness growth in the last few years, the agency fears some risk to growth momentum. “In renewables, timely commissioning of storage and storage-linked capacities remains a key risk given their higher tariffs compared with the usual renewable capacities,” said Manish Gupta, Senior Director and Deputy Chief Ratings Officer at CRISIL. These storage-linked capacities have so far had low traction on the ground in finding off-takers, with nearly 7 GW of the 9 GW projects yet to find buyers, the report said. Gupta noted that relatively higher tariffs of storage and storage linked capacities pose a risk to increasing RE adoption with 65% auctioned capacity has unsigned power supply agreements as of April 2024. “Hence, tariffs of such projects should be compared with thermal project tariffs that can also supply power all day or match the demand,” he said. According to the agency, development of timely storage infrastructure is critical for absorption of the intermittent nature of renewable energy. For the RE players, Crisil maintains a stable credit outlook and operational performance amid high growth. This will be supported by stable generation and receivable reduction. As for real estate, net leasing of commercial office space will see demand growth of 8-10% this fiscal and the next. The primary drivers of the same will be global capability centres eyeing India ’s large talent pool and competitive rentals, as well as healthy demand from domestic sectors. Demand growth for residential real estate will sustain at 8-12% this fiscal and the next, aided by favourable affordability and premiumisation, according to Crisil. Residential real estate is expected to grow 10-12% this fiscal and 8-10% next fiscal. Healthy demand in residential real estate has led to inventory reduction which in turn has been aided by favourable affordability and regulatory safeguards.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express In her Interim Budget speech on February 1, 2024, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman outlined the Centre’s vision for Metro Rail and NaMo Bharat trains. But did not specifically mention any funding for the sane. However, she emphasized that these transit systems could be key to driving urban transformation in the country. Highlighting the importance of these projects in improving urban transportation and infrastructure, Sitharaman revealed that the government plans to extend these trains in big cities. Last fiscal year, Rs 19,518 crore was allocated for Metro projects, and going by the extensive plans, the figure should increase this year to support the government’s vision. The Regional Rapid Transit System ( RRTS ) trains are known as the NaMo Bharat trains. The RRTS network provides top-notch commuter transit services that are safe and fast, with trains running at 160 km/h and every 15 minutes initially. Non-stop journeys can cover 100 km in 45-50 minutes. The project also offers quality last-mile connectivity, catering to all types of travelers. It is designed to integrate smoothly with Indian Railways , Inter-State Bus Terminals (ISBTs), Airports, and the Delhi Metro . The first NaMo Bharat train was flagged off from Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Oct 20, 2023. It is operational on the 17-km-long priority section of the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut Rapid Rail corridor. The corridor is being developed under RRTS Phase 1 and is targeted to be completed by June 2025. In fact, the NCRTC plans to conduct the first trial run of the Namo Bharat regional rail in Delhi by the end of this year. As per the latest media reports, the civil construction of the viaduct in Delhi is almost finished, with ongoing work at the station premises. The Delhi stretch includes New Ashok Nagar, Sarai Kale Khan, and Anand Vihar RRTS stations. Budget 2024: More budget allocation can help push India’s infrastructure growth – A look at country’s roadway network Will Budget 2024 bring back train fare concessions for senior citizens? Budget 2024: Yes to green power! Capex for renewables may get a boost, solar energy a popular choice Budget 2024 Expectations: Logistics industry hope for consistency in growth policy, continued infra push, tax reforms, financial incentives If the Centre plans to meet the targeted June 2025 deadline, and also, with more RRTS trains anticipated to be introduced this year, Sitharaman is expected to allocate huge chunk of money specifically for this purpose. Currently, three RRTS corridors are planned for the first phase in the National Capital Region. These include the 82-km Delhi-Meerut corridor, the 103-km Delhi-Panipat corridor, and the 198-km Delhi-Gurugram-SNB (Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror Urban Complex)-Alwar corridor. After Sitharaman ‘s Interim Budget 2024 announcement of expanding India ’s metro rail network to big cities, the then Union Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs, Hardeep Singh Puri, had predicted that our metro network is set to become the second largest in the world, surpassing that of the United States within the next two to three years. Let’s look at the statistics. Before 2014, only 248 km of Metro Rail was operational in five cities. Over the past decade, an additional 697 km has been added to the Metro Rail Network nationwide. By 2024, there are about 945 km of metro rail lines that are operational across 21 cities, with another 919 km under construction in 26 cities. With proper budgetary allocation, the forthcoming metro rail expansion will aim to provide efficient, reliable, and sustainable transit options for millions of urban commuters, ultimately transforming the urban transit landscape and addressing the growing demand for public transportation in densely populated cities. As India continues to invest in and expand its metro network, it is poised to become a global leader in urban transit systems.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the development of a Rs 76,220-crore all-weather greenfield deep draft major port at Vadhavan in Maharashtra, which, on completion, will be among the top 10 ports of the world. The project will be implemented by a special purpose vehicle, Vadhavan Port Project, to be formed by the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority and the Maharashtra Maritime Board with a shareholding of 74% and 26%, respectively. The project will be located 130 km from Mumbai and 150 km from the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, the country’s largest container port. Traffic relief for Noida commuters!

The project cost includes the cost of land, development for core infrastructure, terminals and other commercial infrastructure in the public-private-partnerships mode. The Cabinet also approved establishing the road connectivity between the port and national highways by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and rail linkage to the existing network and the upcoming Dedicated Rail Freight Corridor by the Ministry of Railways. The port will comprise nine container terminals, each 1,000-meter long; four multipurpose berths, including the coastal berth; four liquid cargo berths; a Ro-Ro berth and a Coast Guard berth. The project, aligned with the objectives of the PM Gati Shakti, will further economic activity and also have the potential for direct and indirect employment opportunities for around one million individuals, thereby contributing to the local economy , a statement issued after the Cabinet meeting said. It involves reclamation of 1,448 hectare of area in the sea and construction of 10.14 km of offshore breakwater and container/cargo storage areas. The project will create a cumulative capacity of 298 million tonne per annum, including around 23.2 million TEU (twenty-foot equivalents) of container handling capacity. Capacities created will also aid the trade flow through the the India -Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor and the International North-South Transportation Corridor. The port’s state-of-the-art terminals will be capable of handling mainline mega vessels plying on international shipping lines between the Far East, Europe, the West Asia, Africa and the Americas.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The Cabinet on Wednesday approved the development of mega Rs 76,200 crore all-weather greenfield deep-draft port at Vadhavan in Maharashtra, signalling then National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s intent to give continued thrust to public investment in infrastructure. The Cabinet also gave its nod to viability gap funding, for Rs 7,453 crore offshore wind energy projects, including one in Gujarat, and a Rs 2,870-crore project for the expansion of Varanasi airport . It also approved viability gap funding, for Rs 7,453-crore offshore wind energy projects, including one in Gujarat. On completion, the new port on west coast will have a cumulative capacity of 298 million metric tonnes/annum, and will be among the top 10 in the world. It will be constructed by Vadhavan Port Project, an SPV formed by Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority and Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB), in a 74:26 joint venture, and will involve substantial private investments. The project cost includes the cost of land development of core infrastructure, terminals and other commercial infrastructure in public-private partnerships (PPP) mode.

AAI-CISF scuffle revives plan for new security body “Today, in the country we have 20 million TEUs (Twenty-foot equivalents) capacity in all ports put together. Compared to this, Vadhavan Port alone will have 23 million TEUs. This port will alone have more capacity than all ports together in the country now,” information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said. Road connectivity between the port and national highways, and linkage to the existing rail network and the upcoming Dedicated Rail Freight Corridor have also been approved. “The port will comprise nine container terminals, each 1,000 metres long, four multipurpose berths, including the coastal berth, four liquid cargo berths, a Ro-Ro berth, and a Coast Guard berth.” The Cabinet also approved increases in the range of 1.4-12.7% in the minimum support prices (MSP) of 14 crops for the 2024-25 kharif season (July-June), but raised the support price for paddy, the key summer crop, by a relatively modest 5.35% to Rs 2,300/quintal.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The ordeal of Noida commuters will end soon as an underpass connecting Noida Jungle Trail Park to the Mahamaya flyover will open to the public soon. This underpass will also minimise, if not eliminate, the traffic jams in Noida. The construction of the underpass will begin this week, according to an announcement made by the Noida authority. This marks a major step in enhancing the connectivity to the new park close to the Okhla Bird Sanctuary. According to multiple media reports, the Noida Authority has said that the construction of the new underpass will take 6 months to complete. As soon as the construction begins, one lane of the road under the Mahamaya flyover will be closed to vehicular movement.

During the underpass construction, Noida’s traffic advisory includes measures to manage vehicular movement effectively. Traffic police will regulate traffic flow, particularly for cars traveling from Kalindi Kunj towards Sector-95 Dalit Park in Noida, restricting them to one lane.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The timing of the Kolkata Metro Railway’s special night service along the north-south circuit would advance by twenty minutes starting on Monday, June 24. If the timing is advanced, authorities anticipate that a large number of commuters will use the service. According to a PTI report, trains would experimentally depart from both the Kavi Subhas and Dum Dum metro stations at 10:40 PM instead of 11 PM, from Monday through Friday. Previously, the special trains ran five days a week, starting at 11 PM on May 24, from both ends. The notice also referenced Metro Railway ’s experimental special service, which runs on the Blue Line until 11 PM. Although night service doesn’t seem to be profitable enough, it was expected that it would serve the bulk of users when the service was originally established. There are typically only 300 passengers on each train travelling between Dum Dum and Kavi Subhash after 11 PM.

The metro railway is losing a lot of money , according to Kolkata Metro Spokesperson Kaushik Mitra, making it hard for the metro service to continue running. The combined monthly revenue from these two trains is hardly Rs 6000, while their operating expenses, excluding additional extraneous costs of Rs 50,000, come to about Rs 2.7 lakh. Authorities have observed that passengers were frequently only offered one or two tokens at a time from counters in numerous stations. Furthermore, he said that the 11 PM service is too late for customers and that he hoped that more commuters would use the service as a result of the changed timetables. Additionally, according to Mitra, ticket counters will close for the night service starting on June 24. As an alternative, travellers purchasing tickets using the UPI payment option can utilise Automatic Smart Card Recharge Machines (ASCRM) found at stations.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has issued additional surveillance measures aimed at curbing the misuse of pre-open call auction sessions for initial public offerings (IPOs). The new session, lasting 60 minutes from 9 am, will be structured with specific intervals for order entry, order modification, order cancellation, order matching, and trade confirmation. “In order to enhance the surveillance mechanism at stock exchanges for pre-open call auction sessions for IPO and relisted scrips, it has been decided that stock exchanges shall have the following additional surveillance mechanisms,” Sebi in a circular on Thursday. The new rules will take effect after 90 days. The pre-auction session will be for a duration of 60 minutes from 9 am to 10 pm. Out of which, 45 minutes shall be allowed for order entry, order modification and order cancellation, 10 minutes for order matching and trade confirmation and the remaining 5 minutes shall be the buffer period to facilitate the transition from pre-open session to the normal trading session. Stock Market Highlight: Markets end lower! Sensex down over 400 points, Nifty at 23,450; FMCG, PSU major draggers Sell-off in Friday Session, Indices down 0.3% for the week! Nifty tests 23,500, Sensex falls 270 points Here is why ITC shares have fallen despite shareholders approving hotel business demerger Stanley Lifestyles IPO opens for bidding; Here are key details to know before you subscribe The changed rules will also allow system-driven random closures during the last ten minutes of order entry, which is anytime between 35th and 45th minute of the order entry window. This was in response to the cancellation of orders, which are placed at higher price and in large volumes, just before the closure of call auction session, creating a false demand and supply, and possibly manipulating the price of the scrips to the detriment of common investors, Sebi said. In addition to the surveillance mechanisms, the stock exchanges will generate alerts based on parameters such as the modification of prices significantly away from previously placed order, cancelled quantity/value exceeds 5% of total cancelled quantity/ value across the market during the pre-open session or exceeds 50% of quantity/value placed by the client. Stock exchanges are mandated to provide detailed reports to Sebi by the end of each trading day and seek explanations from clients on their cancellations. Stock exchanges also have to display cancelled orders information in real-time for investor decision-making. Special call auction for scrips of listed investment & investment holding companies In another circular, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has introduced a special call auction mechanism with no price bands for scrips of listed investment companies (ICs) and listed investment holding companies (IHCs), in a bid to enhance price discovery. This development comes in response to Sebi’s observations that certain scrips of listed ICs and IHCs are traded infrequently and at significantly lower values than their disclosed book values. “The variance in the market price and book value of such ICs and IHCs is adversely affecting liquidity, fair price discovery and the overall interest of investors in scrips of such companies,” Sebi said on Thursday. Sebi has identified some industry classifications for the application of the special call auction across stock exchanges, with the first one slated in October. Subsequent auctions will follow as and when the annual audited financial statements are published by the companies, the regulator said. Eligible companies will be given a 14-day advance notice for the same. Further, if a call auction is not a success on day 1, it shall continue on the next day and till such time the price is discovered, but will be provided only once a year.

Following the trend, Bank Nifty closed in the red down 225 points or 0.43% at 51,558.55. 15:31 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Markets today at close The NSE Nifty 50 closed 0.47% lower at 23,455.85, while the BSE Sensex closed 0.53% lower at 77,067.49. 15:15 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Stock market today live updates | Top gainers and losers Bharti Airtel , LTIMindtree, Adani Ports , Hindalco , and Infosys were the top gainers in the Nifty 50 . While Ultratech Cements, Adani Ports, BPCL , Tata Motors , and Tata Consumer Products were the major losers in the Nifty 50 on June 21. 15:01 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Share market today live updates | Sharekhan on Rupee “We expect Rupee to trade with a slight negative bias on strong US Dollar and surge in US treasury yields. Disappointing manufacturing and services PMI data from Germany and Eurozone may further strengthen the Dollar. Renewed geopolitical tensions may further pressurize the Rupee. However, FII inflows and any further intervention by RBI may support the Rupee at lower levels. Traders may take cues from PMI and existing home sales data from the US. USDINR spot price is expected to trade in a range of Rs 83.20 to Rs 84,” said Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. 14:33 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Stock market today live updates | Nifty PSU Bank index movers Courtesy: NSE 13:46 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Share market today live updates | Nifty Consumer Durables Courtesy: NSE 13:37 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Stock market today live updates | Expert’s take on gold’ movement “Participation in gold has started to increase. This may lead to a price correction as some participants unwind their positions. This may lead to price correction as some participants unwind their positions. We believe that gold will consolidate at its current price. Nonetheless, it remains a favourable investment opportunity. Currently, we are observing a rally of up to Rs 73,500. On the downside, gold may experience a correction down to Rs 71,800 levels,” said Chintan Mehta, CEO of Abans Holdings . 13:15 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Share market today live updates | Sensex index movers Courtesy: BSE 12:40 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Stock market today live updates | Sharekhan on M&M Finance “We attended Mahindra Group’s Analyst Day meet, where the company discussed its current positioning and how it will capture mega-growth trends evolving with the help of the technology ecosystem. The management also addressed the factors that it was lacking earlier versus peers: a) adequate diversification of the asset mix, which is concentrated towards wheels; b) they were late adopters of technology; c) volatility in asset quality. Considering all these factors, the company has undertaken calibrated steps to expand & diversify its portfolio, improve customer accessibility (through branch expansion, building partnerships, and the Super app), and offer the right products in a timely manner through a seamless digital journey by adopting technology. Underwriting and collection functions have been strengthened, and the focus has been to acquire prime affluent customers, as asset quality is of paramount importance. This would result in credit costs gradually falling in the medium term. The company is focusing on improving realisation through fee and distribution income to offset lower yields in the case of prime customers. The company gave confidence that it is gradually embarking on the turnaround path to deliver sustainable and predictable performance going forward, unlike in the past, when businesses reported volatile performance,” said Sharekhan on Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services. 12:19 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Share market today live updates | Elara Securities on Tata Motors “We believe JLR’s long-term target of 15% EBIT margin is aggressive and a lot hinges on how its EV products are accepted, especially when EV profitability for global peers has been cause for concern. With net debt issue behind it, management’s focus on ROCE target of >22% in FY25 is a positive, in our view, and will be a catalyst, although the near-term demand and FCF outlook for Q1 remains muted. Despite JLR’s market share in global premium segment declining from 6.1% in CY20 to 5.4% in CY23, its revenue share increased from 8% to 10%, driven by a richer product mix. We reiterate Accumulate with a target price of Rs 1,100 based on a SOTP method. We value JLR at 2.5x FY26E adj EV/EBITDA, implying 8.0x target P/E, which is at a premium to BMW and Mercedes, but at a 30% discount to Porsche. While Porsche has a higher EBIT margin of 17.7% as on CY23 , its ROCE is similar to JLR at 20-25%. We value India CV at 11.0x June 2026E EV/ EBITDA, India PV (ICE+EV) at 15.0x June 2026E EV/ EBITDA, and JLR at 2.5x June 2026E adj EV/ EBITDA. (please refer to our report, Aggressive PV market share target, on 12 June 2024),” said Elara Securities on Tata Motors . 11:56 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Stock market today live updates | Prabhudas Lilladher on Bajaj Auto “We met with the management of Bajaj Auto , wherein the management gave a detailed overview of its 2W/3W/ EV businesses. The management expects African volume to continue to be under pressure due to currency devaluation; however, the absence of African volume has been offset by a better mix in its international volume. Its Triumph launch has been well received in the US and UK, its key markets. The management aims to gradually scale up the production of Triumph to ~10k units/month (currently at ~6k units/month). The company launched E-3W in Q3FY24 in certain markets, where it has become one of the leading players, aided by its strong brand value. Additionally, E-3W profitability is on par with ICE powertrain, while the path towards profitability for E-scooters will be gradual. BJAUT remains optimistic on its growth prospects, which will be led by a robust product portfolio for domestic and international markets. We foresee healthy demand from rural and urban markets, driven by new launches across categories and a strong presence in the 125+cc space. Positive demand momentum coupled with network expansion in E-3W/2W shall further aid in volume expansion. Factoring this in, we estimate its revenue/EBITDA/APAT to grow at a CAGR of 13.8%/18.4%/16.7% over FY24-FY26E. Given the high growth rate in E-scooters/3W, market share expansion, and consistent mix improvement, we change our rating from ‘Sell’ to ‘Hold’ and revise our target price upwards to Rs 9,984, valuing the company at 27x (20x earlier), factoring in the high growth rate in the EV and premium segments,” said Swarnendu Bhushan, Co-Head of Research at Prabhudas Lilladher. 11:34 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Share market today live updates | Kotak Sec on Crude Oil “WTI Crude oil futures rose for the fourth consecutive day and are poised for the second weekly gain in a row as heightened geo-political tensions propped up the risk premium. Data released on Thursday showed that US crude stockpiles declined by 2.547 million barrels last week, while gasoline and distillate stocks also experienced surprise drawdowns. Meanwhile, a forecast from the American Automobile Association for a record 71 million Americans to travel over the US Fourth of July holiday period. In the Middle East, Israeli forces advanced deeper into the Gaza Strip city of Rafah, and an exchange of fire happened between Hezbollah in Lebanon, raising geopolitical tensions in the region that could disrupt oil flows,” said Kaynat Chainwala, Assistant Vice President of Commodity Research at Kotak Securities. 10:14 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Stock market today live updates | Nifty IT index movers Courtesy: NSE 09:25 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Share market today live updates | Top gainers and losers All the top five gainers in the Nifty 50 were IT companies as Accenture reported its quarterly results. LTIMindtree, Tech Mahindra , HCL Technologies , TCS , and Infosys were the top gainers. Coal India , HUL, ONGC , Tata Motors , and Kotak Mahindra Bank were the major losers in the Nifty 50 on June 21. 09:17 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Markets today at open The NSE Nifty 50 opened 0.40% at 23,661, while the BSE Sensex opened 251 points or 0.32% at 77,729.48. 09:01 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Stock market today live updates | Sharekhan on gold movement “Spot gold surged on Thursday to a two-week-high level of $2366 on the Fed rate cut bets. The rate cut speculation was fueled once again as the Swiss National Bank cut interest rates for the second straight time and the US data turned out to be weaker than expected across the board. The US housing starts, weekly job and Philadelphia Fed business outlook data fell short of expectations. Housing start recorded the slowest gain in four years, and jobless claims were around a ten-month low. Earlier, in an unexpected move, the Swiss National Bank lowered borrowing costs for the second time as the bank grappled with a strong euro amid subdued inflation. The Bank of England kept its rate unchanged at a 16-year high of 5.25% on Thursday with a 7-2 vote of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), as 2 members voted for a rate cut. China’s People’s Bank of China kept the key rate steady, too,” said Praveen Singh, Associate Vice President of Fundamental Currencies and Commodities at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. “Gold is expected to touch $2385 resistance in the near term, though taking out $2400 mark will be a tall order unless major US data show further weakness. Today’s major US data include S&P Global US manufacturing, services, and composite PMIs. Support is at $2343/$2318.” 08:52 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Share market today live updates | Mehta Equities on markets ahead of opening On Thursday, Nifty bounced back sharply from the day’s low, closing on a positive note. Bank Nifty continued to shine amid short covering and value buying, supported by a strong Indian economy , robust balance sheets, and cheap valuations. “Banking stocks have decent support at the 51300 and 50771 levels. The global market is optimistic about the Fed’s easing cycle, with the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicating a 65% probability of lower rates by September 18. The S&P 500 reached a new high, and Nifty IT may gain traction following Accenture’s strong AI demand. Fertilizer stocks surged on GST removal reports, and MapMyIndia hit a record high due to its dominant market share and growth opportunities. FIIs have been net buyers of Rs. 10893 crore this week. Nifty is expected to trade between 23000 – 24000, with significant resistance at 24000 and support at 23000. Recommended trades include buying Nifty at CMP with targets up to 24250 and Bank Nifty with targets up to 53500. PI Industries , MGL, and NALCO are bullish on corrective declines, while RBL Bank is recommended for a momentum play with targets up to 301,” said Prashanth Tapse, Senior Vice President of Research at Mehta Equities. 08:42 (IST) 21 Jun 2024 Stock market today live updates | Kotak Securities on markets movement On Thursday, technically, after a muted opening throughout the day, the markets hovered between 23450–23620 and 77100–77600 levels. In the last couple of days, the markets have witnessed a narrow range activity, which indicates indecisiveness between the bulls and the bears. “We believe that the current market texture is non-directional perhaps traders are waiting for either side breakout. On the higher side, 23680/77800 would be the immediate breakout level, while below 23450/77100, the selling pressure is likely to accelerate.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express The sectoral index Nifty IT surged 2.7% to an intraday high of 35,875.30 after the IT bellwether Accenture reported its Q3 results. The company threw up a few positive elements, such as strong booking growth and raised the inorganic growth guidance from 2%+ to 3%. However, Accenture revised its full-year revenue guidance, slashing the growth range to 1.5%–2.5%, compared to the previous growth guidance of 1%–3%. The company that follows the September to August calendar reported revenue of $16.47 billion, a decrease of 1% year-over-year from $16.56 billion posted in Q3 of FY23.

Sensex down over 400 points, Nifty at 23,450; FMCG, PSU major draggers ‘Runaway gains of broader market cannot sustain’ Nifty IT stocks saw an uptrend as soon as markets opened. The top five gainers in the Nifty 50 were IT companies: LTIMindtree, Tech Mahindra , HCLTech , TCS, and Infosys . Infosys and TCS alone contributed more than 260 points to the sectoral index. Overall, the Indian IT companies were trading at a fair value, and there was no traction in them for some time. The result of Accenture has provided the markets with a good sentimental boost that’s why IT is witnessing a decent move on June 21. This uptrend will last long as the technicals, as well as the fundamentals of the IT companies, are strong enough, said Osho Krishan, Senior Research Analyst at Angel One . He said that most IT companies are trading either above the 200-DSMA or are coming out of it Now, the quarterly results (Q1 FY25) of these IT companies will be eyed for the long term, which the companies will start reporting in July, said Osho. “Accenture acquired 35 companies in FY2024 YTD at a total cost outlay of US$5.2 billion. The company spent $2.3 billion across 12 acquisitions just in 3Q FY24. Accenture has increased inorganic guidance from 2%+ at the beginning of the year to 3%. We believe, given the increase in the pace of acquisitions, the inorganic contribution can be higher in 2H FY24,” said Kotak Securities.

The NSE Nifty 50 hit a new all-time high of 23,667.10 surpassing the previous high. The index later closed 66 points or 0.28% higher, from its previous close, at 23,501. The BSE Sensex settled 269 points or 0.35% higher, from the previous close, at 77,210. The significant losers in the Nifty 50 include Ultratech Cements, Adani Enterprises, L&T, Nestle India, and Tata Motors. Following the trend, Nifty Midcap 100 jumped to a fresh record high of 55,854.75. It closed 45 points or 0.08% lower to settle at 55,429, from its previous close. In the broader markets, midcap and smallcap closed down in the red. Bank Nifty also took a breather closing 122 points or 0.24% lower to 51,661.45. The sectoral indices Nifty FMCG , PSU Bank, and Realty pushed the markets lower. However, in the weak market, IT and metal stocks outperformed.

Nifty gave up the previous week’s gains. In the last five days, Nifty 50 has dropped 0.28% and Sensex 0.35%. Broader benchmark indices remained range-bound and ended the week on a flat note. However, BSE Smallcap index gained 1.5%. Most of the sectoral indices reported negative returns for the week. However, BSE IT and BSE Bankex indices saw positive gains. Indian equities saw buying from FIIs this week. On the economic front, India ’s goods trade deficit in May 2024 widened due to a sharp increase in the oil trade deficit. Meanwhile, oil prices continue to rise and are well above the lows witnessed earlier this month, said Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities. “The government announced MSP for 14 Kharif crops, with MSP for paddy being increased by 5.4% year over year. As per the IMD, the southwest monsoon has further advanced into some more parts of Maharashtra, Vidarbha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and a few more regions. The market participants will keep an eye on the further progress of the monsoon. Food inflation in May 2024 was 8.7%. A healthy crop outlook would be important for controlling food inflation. In the near term, the Indian equity market will continue to track domestic macro data and global markets. Going ahead, the focus will gradually shift towards budget and Q1 FY25 earnings,” he said. “The Bank Nifty was an outperforming sector and it was also one of the leading sectors especially private banks which were responsible for taking Nifty higher during this week. On expected lines, Bank Nifty almost tested our 2nd target level of 52,000 in Friday’s trading session. On the downside, the support zone lies at 51,100–300 / 50,400–500, while the resistance is seen at 51,950–52,000 / 52,350. Overall, all dips should be used as an opportunity to buy,” said Tejas Shah, Technical Research at JM Financial & BlinkX.

    "article_content": "The Financial Express After the election verdict, the broader markets have significantly outperformed benchmark indices, defying the expectations of many fund managers. Harish Krishnan, co-chief investment officer (CIO) and head of equity at Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, tells Vivek Kumar M that he does not expect this runaway growth to sustain, given there is no divergent trend when it comes to earnings growth. Excerpts: The outcome of the Lok Sabha elections was not as per expectations, but the market has recovered from the shock. Do you see things changing in a big way for the markets? We do not expect a big departure from the previous policies. The market is also gravitating towards that view itself. There will be reasonable continuity both on the fiscal glide path as well as the borrowing programme. But we do expect higher focus on consumption compared with the previous regime, because earlier, the supply-side reforms were a major priority. Sebi set to overhaul RIA norms Stock Market Highlight: Markets end lower! Sensex down over 400 points, Nifty at 23,450; FMCG, PSU major draggers Here is why ITC shares have fallen despite shareholders approving hotel business demerger Stanley Lifestyles IPO opens for bidding; Here are key details to know before you subscribe We currently have 5-10% changes in our portfolio compared with the pre- election . It is not a meaningful change in our stance. But over the last six months, we have moved into largecaps and midcaps, and trimmed our position in smallcaps. We are back to record-high levels. Do the valuations concern you, especially in the broader market? The valuations are above fair value in most segments right now. The value proposition opportunities are mostly available only in large caps. The runaway growth in the broader market cannot sustain. We are not seeing sharp divergence in earnings growth between the broader market companies and large caps. Therefore, the dispersion in returns should moderate in the next few years. While it is difficult to predict the near-term view for the market as it will be a function of liquidity, sentiments and earnings, we are positive from a two-three year perspective. You have come out with a new quant fund. How is this different from your other fund offerings and how has the investor’s response been so far? It is the first such offering from our fund house. We will start by narrowing the universe of stocks such that they fall in the large and midcap category. Both investors and distributors have been appreciative of the fact that this is a different fund from others. Model based investing not only provides greater flexibility & repeatability but also maintains discipline by pre-defining the entry and exit points. We expect this to be one of our largest NFOs till date. What is your view on the banking space and consumption stocks? Both have been underperformers in a way over the last few years. We find larger banks more attractive from a long-term perspective. But smaller PSU banks may have an advantage in the near-term because liquidity is tight and the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) is lower for them. For consumption stocks, we don’t see much room for re-rating. We need to see some evidence or meaningful change in posture from the government in terms of wanting to boost demand creation. But one has to look at valuations from a different perspective here because these companies have higher cash flows and capex requirement is very low.

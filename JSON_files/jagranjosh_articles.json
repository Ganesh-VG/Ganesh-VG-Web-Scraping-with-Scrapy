It is tagged the world heritage site by the UNESCO in 2007. Image Source:www.burrp.com Year 2010: 28. The Jantar Mantar, Jaipur- The Jantar Mantar, in Jaipur, is an astronomical observation site built in the early 18th century. It includes a set of some 20 main fixed instruments. They are monumental examples in masonry of known instruments but which in many cases have specific characteristics of their own. Designed for the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye, they embody several architectural and instrumental innovations. This is the most significant, most comprehensive, and the best preserved of India's historic observatories. It is an expression of the astronomical skills and cosmological concepts of the court of a scholarly prince at the end of the Mughal period. Through the impetus of its creator, the prince Jai Singh II, the observatory was a meeting point for different scientific cultures, and gave rise to widespread social practices linked to cosmology. Image Source:journeymart.com Year 2010: 29. Western Ghats- The Western Ghats scattered from the mount of the river Tapi to the cape of kanyakumari for a distance of 1600 kms. Its average height is 1200 metres. It is not a real hill range; rather it is a rift side in the peninsular plateau. The height of Western Ghats increases from north to south whereas height of Eastern Ghats increases from south to north. Western Ghats are also more continuous than Eastern Ghats. Older than the Himalaya mountains, the mountain chain of the Western Ghats represents geomorphic features of immense importance with unique biophysical and ecological processes. The site’s high montane forest ecosystems influence the Indian monsoon weather pattern. Moderating the tropical climate of the region, the site presents one of the best examples of the monsoon system on the planet. It also has an exceptionally high level of biological diversity and endemism and is recognized as one of the world’s eight ‘hottest hotspots’ of biological diversity. The forests of the site include some of the best representatives of non-equatorial tropical evergreen forests anywhere and are home to at least 325 globally threatened flora, fauna, bird, amphibian, reptile and fish species. Image Source:figshare.com Year 2013: 30. Hill forts of Rajasthan- The serial site, situated in the state of Rajastahan, includes six majestic forts in Chittorgarh; Kumbhalgarh; Sawai Madhopur; Jhalawar; Jaipur, and Jaisalmer. The ecclectic architecture of the forts, some up to 20 kilometres in circumference, bears testimony to the power of the Rajput princely states that flourished in the region from the 8th to the 18th centuries. Enclosed within defensive walls are major urban centres, palaces, trading centres and other buildings including temples that often predate the fortifications within which developed an elaborate courtly culture that supported learning, music and the arts. Some of the urban centres enclosed in the fortifications have survived, as have many of the site's temples and other sacred buildings. The forts use the natural defenses offered by the landscape: hills, deserts, rivers, and dense forests. They also feature extensive water harvesting structures, largely still in use today. Image Source:america.pink Year 2014: 31. Rani-ki-Vav (the Queen’s Stepwell) at Patan, Gujarat- Rani-ki-Vav, on the banks of the Saraswati River, was initially built as a memorial to a king in the 11th century AD. Stepwells are a distinctive form of subterranean water resource and storage systems on the Indian subcontinent, and have been constructed since the 3rd millennium BC. They evolved over time from what was basically a pit in sandy soil towards elaborate multi-storey works of art and architecture. Rani-ki-Vav was built at the height of craftsmens’ ability in stepwell construction and the Maru-Gurjara architectural style, reflecting mastery of this complex technique and great beauty of detail and proportions. Designed as an inverted temple highlighting the sanctity of water, it is divided into seven levels of stairs with sculptural panels of high artistic quality; more than 500 principle sculptures and over a thousand minor ones combine religious, mythological and secular imagery, often referencing literary works. The fourth level is the deepest and leads into a rectangular tank 9.5 m by 9.4 m, at a depth of 23 m. The well is located at the westernmost end of the property and consists of a shaft 10 m in diameter and 30 m deep. Image Source:www.pinterest.com Year 2014: 32. The Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP)- It is located in the Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh, India. GHNP was formally declared a National Park in 1999, scattering area of 754.4 sq kms. The Great Himalayan National Park is a habitat to numerous flora and more than 376 fauna species, including approximately 32 mammals, 180 birds, 3 reptiles, 10 amphibians, 12 annelids, 18 mollusks and 126 insects. It got the tag of World Heritage site on 23rd June 2014. Image Source:saveourgreen.org Heritage Sites added after 2015: 33.

    "article_content": "The Revolt of 1857, also regarded as India's First War of Independence is an extremely important event of Indian history. In this article, we have summarized the causes, impact, importance, and outcomes of the revolt. By Jagranjosh Oct 28, 2020, 11:34 IST The Revolt of 1857: Causes, Nature, Importance and Outcomes The Revolt of 1857 was a prolonged period of armed uprising as well as rebellions in Northern and Central India against British occupation of that part of the subcontinent. Small precursors of brewing discontent involving incidences of arson in cantonment areas began to manifest themselves in January. Later, a large-scale rebellion broke out in May and turned into what may be called a full-fledged war in the affected region. This war brought about the end of the British East India Company’s rule in India, and led to the direct rule by the British Government (British Raj) of much of the Indian Subcontinent for the next 90 years. Causes of 1857 Revolt The issue of greased cartridges and military grievances has been over-emphasized, as the factor for the Revolt of 1857. However, recent researches have proved that the cartridge was not the only cause for this revolt. In fact, multiple causes i.e., social-religious-political- economic worked together to produce the rebellion. 1. Social and Religious Causes: The British had abandoned its policy of non-interference in the socio-religious life of the Indians. Abolition of Sati (1829), Hindu Widow Remarriage Act (1856). Christian missionaries were allowed to enter India and carry on with their mission of proselytizing. The Religious Disabilities Act of 1850 modified the traditional Hindu law. According to it, the change in religion would not debar a son from inheriting the property of his heathen father. 2. Economic Causes: British rule led to the breakdown of the village self-sufficiency, commercialization of agriculture which burdened the peasantry, adoption of free trade imperialism from 1800, de-industrialization, and drain of wealth all of which led to the overall decline of the economy. 3. Military Grievances: The extension of British dominion in India had adversely affected the service condition of the Sepoys. They were required to serve in an area away from their homes without the payment of extra Bhatta. An important cause of Military discontent was the General Service Enlistment Act, 1856, which made it compulsory for the sepoys to cross the seas, whenever required. The Post Office Act of 1854 withdrew the free postage facility for them. 4. Political Causes: The last major extension of the British Indian territory took place during the time of Dalhousie. Dalhousie announced in 1849, that the successor of Bahadur Shah II would have to leave the Red Fort. The annexation of Baghat and Udaipur was, however, canceled and they were restored to their ruling houses. When Dalhousie wanted to apply the Doctrine of Lapse to Karauli (Rajputana), he was overruled by the court of Directors. Leaders Associated with the Revolt of 1857 Barrackpore Mangal Pandey Delhi Bahadur Shah II, General Bakht Khan Delhi Hakim Ahsanullah (Chief advisor to Bahadur Shah II) Lucknow Begum Hazrat Mahal, Birjis Qadir, Ahmadullah (advisor of the ex-Nawab of Awadh) Kanpur Nana Sahib, Rao Sahib (nephew of Nana), Tantia Tope, Azimullah Khan (advisor of Nana Sahib) Jhansi Rani Laxmibai Bihar (Jagdishpur) Kunwar Singh, Amar Singh Allahabad and Banaras Maulvi Liyakat Ali Faizabad Maulvi Ahmadullah (He declared the Revolt as Jihad against English) Farrukhabad Tufzal Hasan Khan Bijnaur Mohammad Khan Muradabad Abdul Ali Khan Bareilly Khan Bahadur Khan Mandsor Firoz Shah Gwalior/Kanpur Tantia Tope Assam Kandapareshwar Singh, Manirama Datta Orissa Surendra Shahi, Ujjwal Shahi Kullu Raja Pratap Singh Rajasthan Jaidayal Singh and Hardayal Singh Gorakhpur Gajadhar Singh Mathura Sevi Singh, Kadam Singh British Officials Associated with Revolt General John Nicholson Captured Delhi on 20th September 1857 (Nicholson died soon due to a mortal wound received during the fighting). Major Hudson Killed Bahadur Shah's sons and grandsons in Delhi. Sir Hugh Wheeler Defense against Nana Sahib's forces till 26th June 1857. British forces surrendered on 27th on the promised of safe conduct to Allahabad. General Neil Recaptured Banaras and Allahabad in June 1857. At Kanpur, he killed Indians as revenge against the killing of English by Nana Sahib's forces. Died at Lucknow while fighting against the rebels. Sir Colin Campbell Final recovery of Kanpur on 6th December, 1857. Final reoccupation of Lucknow on 21 st March, 1858. Recapture of Bareilly on 5th May, 1858. Henry Lawrence Chief Commissioner of Awadh. Who died during the seizure of British residency by rebels at Lucknow on 2nd July, 1857! Major General Havelock Defeated the rebels (Nana Sahib's force) on 17th July, 1857. Died at Lucknow in December 1857. William Taylor and Eye Suppressed the revolt at Arrah in August 1857. Hugh Rose Suppressed the revolt at Jhansi and recaptured Gwalior on 20th June, 1858. The whole of Central India and Bundelkhand was brought under British control by him. Colonel Oncell Captured Banaras. Causes of Failure 1. Some of the local rulers like Scindia of Gwalior, the Holkar of Indore, the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Raja of Jodhpur, the Nawab of Bhopal, the rulers of Patiala, Sindh, and Kashmir, and the Rana of Nepal provided active support to the British. 2. The military equipment of the rebels was inferior. Comparative lack of efficient leadership. 3. The modern intelligent Indians also didn't support the cause. Impact of the Revolt 1. The revolt was mainly feudal in character carrying with it some nationalist elements. 2. The control of Indian administration was passed on to the British Crown by the Government of India Act, 1858. 3. The army was carefully reorganized to prevent the recurrence of such an event. The Revolt of 1857 was an extremely important event in Indian history. It was merely a product of Sepoy but was accumulated grievances of the people against the Company’s administration and of their dislike for the foreign regime.

    "article_content": "The first five-year plan in India was launched in 1951 and since then, India has witnessed twelve Five Year Plans. The present government had however discontinued the Five-year plan system and a new mechanism was put into place. Let us have a look at all the Five Year Plans the country has witnessed so far. By Hemant Singh Apr 7, 2021, 18:18 IST List of five year plans of India The Five-Year Plans were laid to rest by the Narendra Modi-led NDA government in 2015. Hence, the 12th five-year plan is considered the last five-year plan of India. The decades-old Five-Year Plans was replaced by a three-year action plan , which will be part of a seven-year strategy paper and a 15-year vision document. The Niti Aayog has replaced the Planning Commission in the Modi Cabinet and launched three-year action plans from April 1, 2017, onwards . 1. First Five Year Plan: I. It was launched for the duration of 1951 to 1956, under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru . II. It was based on the Harrod-Domar model with a few modifications. III. Its main focus was on the agricultural development of the country. IV. This plan was successful and achieved a growth rate of 3.6% (more than its target of 2.1%). V. At the end of this plan, five IITs were set up in the country. 2. Second Five Year Plan: I. It was made for the duration of 1956 to 1961, under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru. II. It was based on the P.C. Mahalanobis Model made in the year 1953. III. Its main focus was on the industrial development of the country. IV. This plan lags behind its target growth rate of 4.5% and achieved a growth rate of 4.27%. V. However, this plan was criticized by many experts and as a result, India faced a payment crisis in the year 1957. (P.C. Mahalanobis) 3. Third Five Year Plan: I. It was made for the duration of 1961 to 1966, under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru. II. This plan is also called ‘Gadgil Yojna’ , after the Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission D.R. Gadgil . III. The main target of this plan was to make the economy independent. The stress was laid on agriculture and the improvement in the production of wheat. IV. During the execution of this plan, India was engaged in two wars: (1) the Sino-India war of 1962 and (2) the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965. These wars exposed the weakness in our economy and shifted the focus to the defence industry, the Indian Army, and the stabilization of the price (India witnessed inflation). V. The plan was a flop due to wars and drought. The target growth was 5.6% while the achieved growth was 2.4%. Welfare Programmes by the Government of India 4. Plan Holidays: I. Due to the failure of the previous plan, the government announced three annual plans called Plan Holidays from 1966 to 1969. II. The main reason behind the plan holidays was the Indo-Pakistani war and the Sino-India war, leading to the failure of the third Five Year Plan. III. During this plan, annual plans were made and equal priority was given to agriculture its allied sectors and the industry sector. V. In a bid to increase the exports in the country, the government declared devaluation of the rupee. 5. Fourth Five Year Plan: I. Its duration was from 1969 to 1974 , under the leadership of Indira Gandhi . II. There were two main objectives of this plan i.e. growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance. III. During this time, 14 major Indian banks were nationalized and the Green Revolution was started. Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and the Bangladesh Liberation War took place. IV. Implementation of Family Planning Programmes was amongst major targets of the Plan V. This plan failed and could achieve a growth rate of 3.3% only against the target of 5.7%. 6. Fifth Five Year Plan: I. Its duration was 1974 to 1978. II. This plan focussed on Garibi Hatao, employment, justice, agricultural production and defence. III. The Electricity Supply Act was amended in 1975, a Twenty-point program was launched in 1975, the Minimum Needs Programme (MNP) and the Indian National Highway System was introduced. IV. Overall this plan was successful which achieved a growth of 4.8% against the target of 4.4%. V. This plan was terminated in 1978 by the newly elected Moraji Desai government . 7. Rolling Plan: I. After the termination of the fifth Five Year Plan, the Rolling Plan came into effect from 1978 to 1990. II. In 1980, Congress rejected the Rolling Plan and a new sixth Five Year Plan was introduced. III. Three plans were introduced under the Rolling plan: (1) For the budget of the present year (2) this plan was for a fixed number of years-- 3,4 or 5 (3) Perspective plan for long terms-- 10, 15 or 20 years. IV. The plan has several advantages as the targets could be mended and projects, allocations, etc. were variable to the country's economy. This means that if the targets can be amended each year, it would be difficult to achieve the targets and will result in destabilization in the Indian economy. 8. Sixth Five Year Plan: I. Its duration was from 1980 to 1985, under the leadership of Indira Gandhi . II. The basic objective of this plan was economic liberalization by eradicating poverty and achieving technological self-reliance. III. It was based on investment Yojna, infrastructural changing, and trend to the growth model. IV. Its growth target was 5.2% but it achieved a 5.7% growth. 9. Seventh Five Year Plan: I. Its duration was from 1985 to 1990 , under the leadership of Rajiv Gandhi. II. The objectives of this plan include the establishment of a self-sufficient economy, opportunities for productive employment, and up-gradation of technology. III. The Plan aimed at accelerating food grain production, increasing employment opportunities & raising productivity with a focus on ‘food, work & productivity IV. For the first time, the private sector got priority over the public sector . V. Its growth target was 5.0% but it achieved 6.01%. 10. Annual Plans : I. Eighth Five Year Plan could not take place due to the volatile political situation at the centre. II. Two annual programmes were formed for the year 1990-91& 1991-92. Nature of Indian Economy: Structure and Key Features 11. Eighth Five Year Plan: I. Its duration was from 1992 to 1997 , under the leadership of P.V. Narasimha Rao. II. In this plan, the top priority was given to the development of human resources i.e. employment, education, and public health. III. During this plan, Narasimha Rao Govt. launched the New Economic Policy of India. IV . Some of the main economic outcomes during the eighth plan period were rapid economic growth (highest annual growth rate so far – 6.8 %), high growth of agriculture and allied sector, and manufacturing sector, growth in exports and imports, improvement in trade and current account deficit. A high growth rate was achieved even though the share of the public sector in total investment had declined considerably to about 34 % V. This plan was successful and got an annual growth rate of 6.8% against the target of 5.6%. 12. Ninth Five Year Plan: I. Its duration was from 1997 to 2002 , under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. II. The main focus of this plan was “ G rowth with Social Justice and Equality”. III. It was launched in the 50th year of independence of India. IV. This plan failed to achieve the growth target of 6.5% and achieved a growth rate of 5.6%. 13. Tenth Five Year Plan: I. Its duration was from 2002 to 2007, under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh. II. This plan aimed to double the Per Capita Income of India in the next 10 years. III. It also aimed to reduce the poverty ratio to 15% by 2012. IV. Its growth target was 8.0% but it achieved only 7.6%. 14. Eleventh Five Year Plan: I. Its duration was from 2007 to 2012 , under the leadership of Manmohan Singh . II. It was prepared by the C. Rangarajan. III. Its main theme was “rapid and more inclusive growth”. IV. It achieved a growth rate of 8% against a target of 9% growth. 15. Twelfth Five Year Plan: I. Its duration is from 2012 to 2017, under the leadership of Manmohan Singh . II. Its main theme is “ Faster, More Inclusive and Sustainable Growth”. III. Its growth rate target was 8%. For a long time, there had been a feeling that for a country as diverse and big as India, centralised planning could not work beyond a point due to its one-size-fits-all approach. Therefore, the NDA government has dissolved the Planning Commission which was replaced by the NITI Aayog. Thus, there was no thirteen Five Year Plan, however, the five-year defense plan was made. It is important to note that the documents of the NITI Aayog have no financial role. They are only policy guide maps for the government. The three-year action plan only provides a broad roadmap to the government and does not outline any schemes or allocations as it has no financial powers. Since it doesn't require approval by the Union Cabinet, its recommendations are not binding on the government.

It led to the formation of the Indian National Congress in 1885. Read in detail below. By Shikha Goyal Aug 12, 2022, 13:41 IST Indian National Movement Independence Day 2022: India celebrates Independence Day every year on August 15. In 2022, this day will be historically significant as the country completes 75 years of Independence from the imperial rule of the Britishers. In these 75 years, India's journey has been nothing less than adventurous, both politically and socially. India's Independence from the imperial power was full of sacrifices. The struggle to gain independence has a long list of movements that were required to show a united front to make the voices reach to every corner of the world. As India celebrates the 75 years of its glorious Independence, we remember here the Indian National Movement and various significant phases attached to it. Summary of Indian National Movement It has been observed that the struggles for Freedom in India had been a merger of a series of Political, Socio-Cultural, and Economic factors that led to the rise of Nationalism. On 28 December 1885 Indian National Congress (INC) was founded on the premises of Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit School at Bombay. It was presided over by W.C Banerjee and attended by 72 delegates. A.O Hume played an instrumental role in the foundation of INC with an aim to provide Safety Valve to the British Government. A.O Hume served as the first General Secretary of INC. The real Aim of Congress is to train the Indian youth in political agitation and to organise or to create public opinion in the country. For this, they use the method of an annual session where they discuss the problem and passed the resolution. The first or early phase of Indian Nationalism is also termed as Moderate Phase (1885-1905). Moderate leaders were W.C Banerjee, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, R.C Dutt, Ferozeshah Mehta, George Yule, etc. Moderates have full faith in British Government and adopted the PPP path i.e. Protest, Prayer, and Petition. Due to disillusionment from Moderates' methods of work, extremism began to develop within the congress after 1892. The Extremist leaders were Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, and Aurobindo Ghosh. Instead of the PPP path, they emphasise on self-reliance, constructive work, and swadeshi.

So far, there have been multiple videos released by Pannun that censure India. He has also been accused of providing monetary rewards to the ones writing anti-India graffiti. Last year, another video came into light where Pannun warned the Indo-Canadian Hindus to leave Canada. The video was enough to attract huge condemnation from the Canadian officials and politicians For instance, Dominic LeBlanc, the Public Safety Minister of Canada called the video as \"offensive and hateful\". It has also been reported that Gurpatwant Singh Pannun has made threats against Bhagwant Mann, the incumbent Chief Minister of Punjab.

    "article_content": "Have you recently seen the Fake Google Chrome alerts? You should not be clicking them! Attackers are making use of such techniques to trick users into downloading malware. Here's everything you need to know about the Fake Google Chrome, and how attackers try to trick users. By Astha Pasricha Jun 19, 2024, 20:52 EDT What is This Fake Google Chrome, and How Does it Trick People? Protect Your Device from this Malware The world of the internet and devices is never out of risk. Now, in this world comes another entrant that can swiftly trick many into unknowingly installing malware in their devices. A novel malware distribution campaign is here, that makes use of fake Google Chrome, One Drive, and Word errors as a means to trick people into troubleshooting through PowerShell \"fixes\" and unknowingly installing malware. Hackers are making use of JavaScript in hacked websites and email attachments. Fake error messages that resemble OneDrive, Microsoft Word, or Google Chrome alerts are now what the hackers make use of to trap the users. Messages like these urge users to tap on a button in order to copy a \"fix script\" in the clipboard of their devices. Then, users are instructed to paste this copied script in a \"Run\" dialog or the PowerShell prompt. What makes this attack reliable is the sheer sophistication it demonstrates. Unlike other hacking techniques, users do not get hacked by simply or mistakenly clicking on a button. Here, the users are expected to follow certain steps, in order to \"fix\" the errors in their devices. The sophisticated multiple steps seem so genuine, that users mistakenly trust the process and fall in the trap. The steps make people believe that they are actually solving a genuine issue, much to their disappointment later on. All these hacks mislead the users to act without analyzing the risks. This has been said by a report by ProofPoint. DarkGate, NetSupport, XMrig, Amadey Loader, Lumma Stealer, Matanbuchus, and a clipboard hijacker are some of the malicious software that ProofPoint identified. The attacking methods There are three distinct attack methods that have been identified. Each of these attacking methods start in a different manner. In the very first method, users go to a compromised website. This method is related to the threat actors responsible for ClearFake. The site opens up a risky script hosted on the blockchain via the contracts of Binance's Smart Chain. The script then scans for vulnerabilities. Next, the user finds a fake Google Chrome alert which says that there exists an issue in displaying the page. The user is then prompted by the alert to install a \"root certificate\". In order to do this, the user is prompted to copy a PowerShell script to the clipboard of Windows and run it in the Windows PowerShell (Admin) console. Now that the PowerShell script is run, the script scans if the device is fit for the attack or not. It further installs the software that are significantly harmful. The steps it follows are as follows: 1) Clearing up of the DNS cache. 2) Clearing the clipboard. 3) Displaying a fake message to distract. 4) Installs another PowerShell script through a remote server. The script then looks if it is actually running on a VM (virtual machine), prior to installing software to steal the data. This is how the first attack is made. ALSO READ: iOS 18 at WWDC 2024: A bunch of things to know The second attack is called as the \"ClickFix\" campaign. This attack works by injecting codes into compromised sites. Now, this brings up fake Google Chrome error alerts. Obviously, such alerts overlaying the page are enough to worry any user of errors. In order to fix these errors, the users are guided to kickstart \"Windows PowerShell (Admin). Now, they are instructed to paste a certain code. These leads to devices to get infected. The third method is enough to trap possibly anyone. The third method makes use of email attachments. Now, these email attachments look quite similar to Microsoft Word documents. Users are urged to download a \"Word Online\" extension to view those documents properly. Once the users get stuck in this situation, they are provided with prompts such as \"Auto fix\" or \"How to fix\". The option of \"Auto-fix\" makes use of a protocol that unveils a remote file that is controlled by attackers. This can further install and run harmful files such as VBS or MSI scripts. These further cause malware like DarkGate or Matanbuchus to infect the devices. The option of \"How to Fix\" urges the user to copy a PowerShell command and paste it into PowerShell. No matter what the method, the aim of the attackers is often filled with malice. Attackers see the lack of knowledge among users as an opportunity to exploit them.

    "article_content": "Cambridge University prohibits any form of intimate relationship between its staff members and students. What does the new policy say, and what can be happened in case such a relationship has taken place in the past? Here's everything you need to know. By Astha Pasricha Jun 20, 2024, 06:11 EDT Intimate Relationships Between Students and Teachers Prohibited: Here's What the New Cambridge Law Says A new rule has been implemented by the Cambridge University. The rule is not based on any educational reforms, but rather prohibits intimate relations between students and teachers. The aim is to shield student welfare. What exactly is the new law, and what prompted the authorities to bring about such a law? Let's understand. Change in policies and procedures Recently, there have been many reports of instances of many types of intimate relationships between the staff of the Cambridge University and the students. There have been many cases of sexual intercourse and casual flirting reported between students and teachers. As a response, there have been several updates in the website of the Cambridge University lately. These changes have been specifically made in the \"policies and procedures\" mentioned on the website. As per the new rules, the University prohibits the faculty of the University from pursuing or getting into an intimate relationship with any of the students of the University for whom the faculty has any form of academic responsibilities. While this means that there is no such prohibition for an intimate relationship between teachers and the students that they do not teach, the Cambridge University advises the teachers to not engage in such a setting in order to foster student well-being. The new regulations The new changes in the regulations are as follows: An actual or apparent conflict of interest arises when a personal relation of an intimate nature between a student and a member of staff is formed. Such a relationship may be perceived to forma a risk of abuse of authority or favoritism. The University says that the members of staff are duty bound to act with integrity. A personal relationship of the intimate form between a staff and a student must be avoided at all costs. In case a member of staff has or has an intimate or personal relation with a student they share a professional relationship with, it is the duty of the staff member to disclose it to the Head of Department. A failure to comply with these policies may be deemed as a disciplinary matter. Protecting both parties from unfairness The new policy brought forward by the Cambridge University intends to discourage consensual relationships of intimate or sexual nature between the students and the staff pf the university, specifically in cases where the staff member actually holds a professional responsibility towards the student. The policy makes sure that in case any such relation have occurred, there are certain measures implemented to protect both the parties from any perception of unfairness. This preserves the interests of both the sides. Acting with integrity Staff members of the University are expected to act with integrity. The staff members are expected to refrain from any such situations of perceived or actual conflict. It is recommended to the staff members to avoid creating any personal relations with the students of the manner mentioned above. However, even if such an incident arises, it is the duty of the staff to abide by the disclosure requirements as mentioned in the policy.

With International Yoga Day celebrated every year on June 21, the whole world embraces yoga and acknowledges the yogic life.

    "article_content": "The Supreme Court in the US has approved the access to abortion pills. However, it has not been an easy and straightforward decision for the court. What was the case all about, and how does the FDA approve any drug? By Astha Pasricha Jun 21, 2024, 02:06 EDT Access to Abortion Pills Preserved by US Supreme Court: What Was the Case All About? It was June 13 when the US Supreme Court rejected a petition by anti-abortion groups that demanded the disapproval of mifepristone, an easily available abortion pill. The approval of the pill has been given by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). According to the court, the petitioners did not hold a direct stake in the matter and therefore the petitioners could not sue the Food and Drug Administration. The ruling was authored by Justice Brett M Kavanaugh. Justice Kavanaugh expressed that the plaintiffs were not the ones who prescribed or used mifepristone. Moreover, the FDA has not asked the plaintiffs to do something or refrain from doing something. Justice Kavanaugh said that to make any drug less available for others as the desire of the plaintiff does not actually establish a stand to sue. What exactly is the verdict of the US Supreme Court in the matter? For now, the court has preserved the access of mifepristone. Two years ago, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the case of Roe . Wade, which repealed the right to abortion. Take a look at what the present case is all about. The case, the arguments, the contentions It was in the year 2022 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was sued by some individual doctors and four pro-life medical associations. The suit was filed in the US District Court, Northern District of Texas. The petitioners were against the FDA's assent to the mifespristone pills. They also challenged the changes made by the federal agency in the conditions of use of the pill and the provision of providing the pills to remote areas through telemedicine and mail. According to the plaintiff, the mifepristone pills are unsafe. The plaintiffs also argued that the approval process of the FDA was actually flawed. In the month of April last year, it was held by Matthew J Kacsmaryk that the approval of the drug by the FDA should be suspended. It was held that mifepristone should be suspended from the market. The ruling was partially overturned by an appeals court in New Orleans. The court put certain restrictions on the distribution of the pill. The Supreme Court, however, put the ruling of the appeals court on hold. The Supreme Court assented to hear the case. Finally, how does FDA approve drugs? As per the official website of FDA, the FDA goes through a comprehensive process involving many checkpoints and steps. First things first, a drug is developed by a drug maker for the purpose of treating a disease or medical ailment. Tests for the same medicine is done in laboratories. Once these preliminary tests go good, submitting an Investigational New Drug Application to the FDA is what the drug maker does next. The application elaborates the ways the drug maker intends to test and investigate the drugs via clinical trials done on volunteers. The clinical trials are followed based on a set of regulations and laws. These laws are designed to safeguard the rights and ensure welfare of the volunteers. Once the clinical trials are conducted and enough information is gathered in support of the drug, the drug maker can now submit the New Drug Application to get it approved by the agency. Now, the ball is in the court of the FDA. An unbiased FDA team comprising of experts analyze the clinal trial research. They make use of scientific date to assess if the drug meets the rigorous standards of the FDA. If the FDA analyzes that the drug is safe to use, it inspects the facility where it will be manufactured. If the FDA finds the research, date and the evidence in favor of the drug, it approves the drug. However, even after the drug is approved and is out for public to use, the agency continues to monitor the safety, effectiveness, and quality of the drug for years.

प्रधानमंत्री हैं, जिन्होंने तीसरी बार पीएम पद की शपथ ली है। उनके साथ अन्य 71 मंत्रियों को मंत्रीमंडल में विस्तार मिला है। इन मंत्रियों में भाजपा समेत अन्य पार्टियों के नेता भी शामिल हैं। ऐसे में इस लेख में हम जानेंगे कि किस पार्टी व किस मंत्री को कौन-सा मंत्रालय मिला है। साथ ही किस राज्य से कितने मंत्री बने हैं, यह भी जानेंगे। By Kishan Kumar Jun 13, 2024, 17:14 IST मोदी कैबिनेट 3.0 Modi Cabinet Ministers List 2024: नरेंद्र मोदी ने तीसरी बार प्रधानमंत्री पद की शपथ लेकर इतिहास रच दिया है। क्योंकि, पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री पंडित जवाहरलाल नेहरू के बाद वह दूसरे प्रधानमंत्री हैं, जिन्होंने तीसरी बार पीएम पद की शपथ ली है। उनके साथ अन्य 71 मंत्रियों को मंत्रीमंडल में विस्तार मिला है। इस बार भी भाजपा ने प्रमुख मंत्रालयों को अपने पास रखा है। कुछ पुराने चेहरों को कैबिनेट मंत्री का पद दिया गया है, जबकि कुछ चेहरों को स्वतंत्र प्रभार का पद मिला है। इन मंत्रियों में भाजपा समेत अन्य पार्टियों के नेता भी शामिल हैं। ऐसे में इस लेख में हम जानेंगे कि किस पार्टी व किस सांसद को कौन-सा मंत्रालय मिला है। साथ ही यह भी जानेंगे कि किस राज्य से कितने मंत्री बने हैं। इस बार लोकसभा चुनाव के परिणाम हैरान करने वाले हैं। क्योंकि, सियासी पिच पर कई बड़े-बड़े सूरमा ढेर हुए गए हैं, जबकि कुछ नए चेहरों ने पहली पारी में ही प्रतिद्वंदियों को करारी शिकस्त देकर इतिहास रचा है। भाजपा के खाते में इस बार 240 सीटें आई हैं, जबकि उसके सामने बड़ी विपक्षी पार्टी कांग्रेस के खेमे में 99 सीटों का जनाधार है। वहीं, तेलुगू देशम पार्टी ने 16 और जनता दल(यूनाइटेड) ने 12 सीटें जीते हैं। उधर, राजनीति का गढ़ कहे जाने वाले उत्तर प्रदेश में भाजपा का गहरा झटका लगा है। प्रदेश में यह पहली बार है, जब समाजवादी पार्टी ने 37 सीटों पर अपना खाता खोला है। ऐसे में भाजपा को सिर्फ 33 सीटों पर संतोष करना पड़ा। बीते चुनाव की तरह इस बार भी प्रदेश में बसपा का खाता नहीं खुल सका है। भारत में मंत्रिपरिषद् की त्रिस्तरीय प्रणाली है। ऐसे में कैबिनेट मंत्री, राज्य मंत्री व राज्य मंत्री(स्वतंत्र प्रभार) जैसी तीन श्रेणियों में मंत्रियों को पद की शपथ दिलाई जाती है। इसमें कैबिनेट मंत्री व राज्य मंत्री(स्वतंत्र प्रभार) सीधे प्रधानमंत्री को रिपोर्ट करते हैं, जबकि राज्य मंत्री सीधे कैबिनेट मंत्री को रिपोर्ट करते हैं। 20 साल में पहली बार 24 घंटे में हुआ मंत्रालयों का बंटवारा आपको बता दें कि बीते 20 वर्षों में यह पहली बार हुआ है, जब मंत्रालयों का बंटवारा करने में 24 घंटे का वक्त लग गया है। इस तरह की स्थिति कम ही देखने को मिली है। पीएम मोदी के पास कौन-से मंत्रालय पीएम नरेंद्र मोदी ने अपने पास कार्मिक, लोक शिकायत और पेंशन मंत्रालय, अंतरिक्ष विभाग, परमाणु ऊर्जा विभाग, नीतिगत मुद्दे व अन्य विभाग, जो किसी मंत्री को नहीं सौंपे गए है, वें अपने पास रखे हैं। भाजपा के पास रहेंगे CCS मंत्रालय भाजपा ने अपने पास केंद्रीय मंत्रिमंडल की सुरक्षा संबंधी समिति या सीएसएस को अपने पास रखा है। इसमें रक्षा, गृह, विदेश और वित्त मंत्रालय जैसे महत्त्वपूर्ण मंत्रालय होते हैं। ऐसे में इस बार कुछ प्रमुख मंत्रालयों को पुराने हाथों में सौंपा गया है। इस कड़ी में सीसीएस मंत्रालयों में शामिल गृह मंत्रालय अमित शाह, रक्षा मंत्रालय राजनाथ सिंह, वित्त मंत्रालय निर्मला सीतारमण और विदेशी मंत्रालय एस. जयशंकर को सौंपा गया है। आपको बता दें कि राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा सलाहकार, रक्षा सचिव और कैबिनेट सचिव भी सीसीएस की बैठकों में शामिल होते हैं। ऐसे में यह समिति भारत की महत्त्वपूर्ण समिति होती है। क्या होता है CCS का काम अब आपके मन में इसकी महत्ता को लेकर और भी सवाल आ रहे होंगे, तो हम आपको बता दें कि रक्षा संबंधी मुद्दों से निपटने के लिए सीसीएस की भूमिका होती है। यह भारत की राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा से संबंधित मुद्दों से भी निपटती है। वहीं, देश की सुरक्षा को लेकर राजनीतिक मुद्दों पर चर्चा के साथ राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा तंत्र का मूल्यांकन, परमाणु ऊर्जा से संबंंधित मामलों पर चर्चा और रक्षा उत्पादन और रक्षा अनुसंधान व विकास विभाग में 100 करोड़ से अधिक के पूंजीगत व्यय से जुड़े मामले में यह अपने स्तर पर विचार करती है। ऐसे में इस समिति को कैबिनेट की महत्त्वपूर्ण समिति भी कहा जाता है। किस राज्य से कितने मंत्री(State-Wise Ministers List) राज्य/ केंद्र शासित प्रदेश मंत्री जम्मू

When the mind has settled, we are established in our essential nature, which is unbounded Consciousness. Our essential nature is usually overshadowed by the activity of the mind. - Patanjali Yoga is equal parts strength, flexibility, balance, and endurance. - Mandy Ingber My mom was a practicing Hindu, and my dad was a Catholic who practiced yoga meditation and karma yoga. My earliest memories are of the bright colors, beautiful sounds, and fragrant aromas of both Christian and Hindu celebrations. - Tulsi Gabbard Concentration of the mind is in a way common to both Knowledge and Yoga. Yoga aims at union of the individual with the universal, the Reality. This Reality cannot be new. It must exist even now, and it does exist.- Ramana Maharshi Yoga is a way to freedom. By its constant practice, we can free ourselves from fear, anguish and loneliness. - Indra Devi Ayurveda is a sister philosophy to yoga. It is the science of life or longevity and it teaches about the power and the cycles of nature, as well as the elements. - Christy Turlington I mean the whole thing about meditation and yoga is about connecting to the higher part of yourself, and then seeing that every living thing is connected in some way. - Gillian Anderson There are certain ways in which I cultivate awareness, both through mindful yoga and taking care of my body and taking time to actually drop as deeply as possible into stillness, into whatever is unfolding in the present moment. - Jon Kabat-Zinn I love yoga. There's a lot of stretching involved, which helps with my flexibility and injury prevention. Vinyasa is my favorite as a recovery tool and for me to continue having my legs feel good. - Alex Morgan More yoga in the world is what we need. - Diane Lane The goal in some types of yoga is to try and reconcile all the characters within a person, and, in fact, the word 'yoga' comes from the word 'union.' - Asghar Farhadi Yoga is a method for restraining the natural turbulence of thoughts, which otherwise impartially prevent all men, of all lands, from glimpsing their true nature of Spirit. Yoga cannot know a barrier of East and West any more than does the healing and equitable light of the sun. - Paramahansa Yogananda As a longtime practitioner of yoga and a person who's been involved in physical fitness my whole life, I can tell you, yoga helps you achieve altered states of consciousness. It is not just stretching. The only way you can say that it's stretching is if you haven't done it, or that you haven't done it rigorously for a long period of time. - Joe Rogan Yoga is great for easing my back pain. It also helps me keep stress at bay, which is something I can suffer from. - Dervla Kirwan Yoga reduced my stress and bodily tension. It allowed me to bring my body back into balance, to emerge from my fertility struggle with my sense of self-esteem and self-worth intact, and to forge a stronger bond with my husband. - Brenda Strong International Yoga Day 2024: Messages Happy International Yoga Day!

    "article_content": "Join the global movement! Learn about International Yoga Day 2024 with the theme \"Yoga for Self and Society.\" Discover the benefits of yoga for mind, body, and community. By Nikhil Batra Jun 21, 2024, 09:11 IST International Yoga Day 2024 Every year on June 21st, the world comes together to celebrate International Yoga Day. This global phenomenon recognises the ancient Indian practice of yoga and its profound impact on physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. Yoga, derived from the Sanskrit word \"yuj,\" meaning \"to yoke\" or \"to unite,\" and it embodies the philosophy of bringing harmony to the mind, body, and spirit. It's more than just physical postures, as it is a holistic approach to health that integrates breathing exercises, meditation, and ethical principles. According to the Ministry of External Affairs, “The word ‘Yoga’ is derived from the Sanskrit root ‘Yuj’, meaning ‘to join’ or ‘to yoke’ or ‘to unite’. As per Yogic scriptures the practice of Yoga leads to the union of individual consciousness with that of the Universal Consciousness, indicating a perfect harmony between the mind and body, Man & Nature.” As we mark the 10th International Day of Yoga, I urge everyone to make it a part of their daily lives. Yoga fosters strength, good health and wellness. Wonderful to join this year's programme in Srinagar. https://t.co/oYonWze6QU — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 21, 2024 Greetings to the entire global community, especially the fellow citizens of India on International Yoga Day!

Yoga is a way to physical, mental and… pic.twitter.com/4XQACokOFg — President of India (@rashtrapatibhvn) June 21, 2024 Why is International Yoga Day Celebrated? International Yoga Day shines a light on the positive impact yoga can have on our lives. From building strength and flexibility to promoting relaxation and stress reduction, yoga caters to individuals of all ages and abilities. It's a practice that cultivates mindfulness, improves focus, and fosters inner peace. Secondly, International Yoga Day serves as a day of recognition. We celebrate the rich history and enduring legacy of this ancient Indian tradition. Yoga's philosophy emphasizes the connection between mind, body, and spirit, offering a path to self-discovery and personal growth. Here's a breakdown of the reasons behind celebrating Yoga Day: Ancient Tradition: Yoga is a practice that originated in India thousands of years ago. Celebrating it acknowledges its historical significance. Holistic Wellness: Yoga goes beyond physical exercise. It incorporates mental and spiritual aspects, promoting a sense of overall well-being. Global Appeal: Yoga's popularity has grown tremendously worldwide in recent times. The day celebrates its universal acceptance. In September 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). During his speech, he proposed establishing an annual International Day of Yoga. Prime Minister Modi highlighted yoga's well-being benefits and its holistic approach to health. He also suggested June 21st as the ideal date for the celebration because it holds significance in many cultures and is the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. The proposal gained momentum, and the UN adopted a resolution in December 2014, officially declaring June 21st as the International Day of Yoga. A record-breaking 175 member states endorsed the resolution. The UN mentions: “The draft resolution establishing the International Day of Yoga was proposed by India and endorsed by a record 175 member states. The proposal was first introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address during the opening of the 69th session of the General Assembly, in which he said: “Yoga is an invaluable gift from our ancient tradition. Yoga embodies unity of mind and body, thought and action ... a holistic approach [that] is valuable to our health and our well-being. Yoga is not just about exercise; it is a way to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature.” “The resolution notes “the importance of individuals and populations making healthier choices and following lifestyle patterns that foster good health.” In this regard, the World Health Organization has also urged its member states to help their citizens reduce physical inactivity,” it adds. What is the Theme of International Yoga Day 2024? The theme for International Yoga Day 2024 is \"Yoga for Self and Society.\" This theme emphasizes the two-fold benefits of yoga practice: enhancing personal well-being and fostering a more positive and harmonious society. Source: Yoga Ayush Benefits of Yoga for the Self: Physical Benefits: Yoga improves flexibility, strength, balance, and posture. It can also help manage chronic pain, improve cardiovascular health, and boost the immune system. Mental and Emotional Benefits: Yoga practices like meditation and breathing exercises can significantly reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. It can also promote better sleep, improve focus, and enhance overall mood. Mind-Body Connection: Yoga cultivates a sense of body awareness and teaches individuals to connect their breath with movement. This holistic approach leads to a deeper understanding of oneself and a greater sense of well-being. Self-Discipline and Growth: Yoga requires dedication and consistent practice. Over time, it fosters self-discipline and a sense of accomplishment. It can also be a powerful tool for personal growth and self-discovery. Benefits of Yoga for Society: Community Building: Yoga studios and group classes provide opportunities for people to connect and build a sense of community. Shared practice fosters empathy and understanding. Peace and Harmony: Yoga promotes inner peace and reduces stress. This positive energy can ripple outward, creating a more peaceful and harmonious society. Compassion and Mindfulness: Yoga encourages individuals to be present in the moment and cultivate compassion for themselves and others. This fosters a more caring and empathetic society. Global Unity: International Yoga Day celebrates the worldwide practice of yoga. It serves as a reminder that regardless of culture or background, we all share a desire for well-being and can connect through this ancient practice. International Yoga Day 2024: Pledge Certificate In celebration of the 10th International Yoga Day on June 21st, 2024, with the theme \"Yoga for Self and Society,\" the Government of India is offering a special opportunity to solidify your commitment to this powerful practice.

    "article_content": "National Technology Day 2024: National Technology Day is celebrated across India on May 11 to commemorate India’s scientific advancement. On this day, India successfully tested nuclear bombs in Pokhran. By Shikha Goyal May 11, 2024, 20:03 IST National Technology Day National Technology Day 2023: National Technology Day is observed every year on May 11 across the country. The day commemorates the achievements of engineers and scientists in the field of science and technology. During the ongoing pandemic, the day holds a special significance. Modern technology has emerged as the key to saving human lives today through inventing COVID-19 vaccines or instruments for artificial oxygen for patients counting their breadths. National Technology Day: History As we have seen above that on 11 May 1998 nuclear test was held in Pokhran and based on these tremendous achievements of the scientists, engineers, etc., Atal Bihari Vajpayee declared 11 May as National Technology Day. Since 1999, every year the Technology Development Board (TDB) celebrates the day with various technological innovations that have positively impacted the nation. Also, every year TDB selects a theme and on that basis several events, competitions were held in the country. This day also marks the significance of Science in our day-to-day life. National Technology Day: Significance - On 11 May 1998, the First indigenous aircraft \"Hansa-3,\" was test flown at Bangalore. - India performed a successful test firing of the Trishul missile on the same day. - At that time very few countries have nuclear power and India had become one of those elite players and became the sixth country to join the nuclear club. - Operation Shakti (Pokhran-II) on 11 May,1998 was initiated. - Every year, on this day, the Technology Development Board of India awards various individuals with national awards for their contribution to indigenous technology. Therefore, we can say that this day glorifies the importance of science in day-to-day life and motivates us to adopt science as a field of career. What is Operation Shakti? Do you know that ' Smiling Buddha' was the first nuclear test at Pokhran which was carried out in May, 1974 ? The second test was Pokhran II which was a series of five tests of nuclear bomb explosions, administered by India at the Pokhran Test Range of the Indian Army in May 1998. Pokhran II or Operation Shakti comprised of five detonations out of which the first one was a fusion bomb while the other four were fission bombs. Shakti word in Sanskrit means power. On 11 May, 1998 Operation Shakti or Pokhran II was initiated with the detonation of two fission and one fusion bomb. On 13 May,1998 two additional fission bombs were detonated and the Government that time in India was run by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister shortly convened a press conference to declare India as a full-fledged nuclear state. The original name of the operation was ' Operation Shakti-98' and five nuclear devices were classified as Shakti I to Shakti V. And now, the whole operation is known as Pokhran II and Pokhran I was the explosion made in 1974 . National Technology Day 2024: Theme The theme for National Technology Day 2024 is 'From Schools to Startups: Igniting Young Minds to Innovate.' It emphasises nurturing schoolchildren to start their own start-ups and contribute to making India the hub of startups in the world. The theme this year is “Integrated Approach in Science & Technology for Sustainable Future”. The theme was launched by Union Minister Jitendra Singh. The theme of National Technology Day 2021 was \"Science and Technology for a Sustainable Future”. The theme of National Technology Day 2018 was “Science and Technology for a Sustainable Future”. The key objective of this theme is to promote the development of technology in various fields. Also for this, the Department has been generating technology development projects which include materials, devices, and processes. Several programmes are organised in advanced or emerging areas and in traditional sectors to support technological activities. Under this programme, fresh ideas or concepts are also assessed so that they can be used in the product or technology. National Technology Day: Celebrations On this day TDB confer National Awards to the most noteworthy individuals, institutions, and businesses of the year. The Department of Science and Technology, Department of Bio-Technology, the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, and several other scientific departments are part of this event. The people are awarded for their contribution so that they excel more and more in their research by the President of India. The ministry of science and technology also coordinates different events across India. All the decorations and planning of the event should be done according to the theme. Script, speech, or essay competitions are organised in several institutions. Theme-based articles are also promoted etc. Therefore, it is necessary to create interest and awareness about science and technology to the students. No doubt National technology Day is a great way to encourage the youth of the country to come forward and also is the way to appreciate the scientists, researchers for India's growing technology.

    "article_content": "Discover the Dominican Republic's captivating story, from its tumultuous colonial past to its present-day charm. Uncover the nation's diverse geography, from lofty peaks to fertile valleys, and learn about its indigenous Taíno heritage. Explore the bustling streets of Santo Domingo, home to historic landmarks and vibrant culture, and immerse yourself in the beauty of its UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Whether you're drawn to its history, landscapes, or cultural tapestry, the Dominican Republic offers an unforgettable journey into the heart of the Caribbean. By Mohammad Jazib Feb 15, 2024, 14:38 IST Discover the Dominican Republic: Maps, History, Heritage Sites & More Situated in the heart of the Caribbean Sea, the Dominican Republic, officially known as República Dominicana in Spanish, commands the eastern five-eighths of the illustrious Hispaniola island. This island, forming part of the esteemed Greater Antilles archipelago, stands as a testament to nature's grandeur. Bordered by the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean to the north, the nation shares this magnificent landmass with its neighbour, Haiti. In this unique arrangement, Hispaniola proudly stands as one of the rare Caribbean islands, alongside Saint Martin, to be governed by two independent nations. With an expansive territory spanning 48,671 square kilometres (18,792 sq mi), the Dominican Republic stands as the second-largest nation in the Antilles, following the vast expanse of Cuba. Beyond its geographical magnitude, the nation boasts a thriving population, estimated at approximately 11.4 million inhabitants in the year 2024. Among these citizens, around 3.6 million individuals reside within the bustling metropolitan hub of Santo Domingo, the esteemed capital city that serves as the vibrant heart of the nation. ALSO READ| California Map: Official Image, Population and Other Important Details Dominican Republic Map And Geography The Dominican Republic boasts both the loftiest peaks and the deepest troughs in the entire West Indies, rendering it a land of unparalleled geographical diversity. Its principal mountain ranges and expansive, fecund valleys predominantly stretch from the northwest to the southeast. Here is the map: To the north lies the Cordillera Septentrional, the most northerly range, casting its imposing shadow over a slender coastal plain irrigated by diminutive rivers like the Balabonico and the Yasica. Descending from the mountain's southern slopes, one encounters the sprawling expanse of the Cibao Valley, a verdant oasis stretching from Manzanillo Bay in the northwest to the eastern reaches of the Samaná Peninsula and the Bay of Samaná. This valley's fertility finds sustenance in the nourishing embrace of two of the nation's principal river systems: the Yaque del Norte, meandering northwestward, and the eastward-flowing Camu-Yuna system. DOWNLOAD PDF Dominating the island's landscape, the Cordillera Central, known as the Massif du Nord in Haiti, stands as the most rugged and awe-inspiring feature. In Dominican terrain, its crest averages a staggering elevation of approximately 6,000 feet (1,800 meters) and culminates in the majestic Duarte Peak, soaring to an unparalleled 10,417 feet (3,175 meters), claiming the title of the loftiest summit in the Caribbean. Other notable peaks include Yaque, La Rucilla, Bandera, and Mijo. While tributaries of the Yaque del Norte cascade down the range's northern slopes, its southern flanks are traversed by the Yaque del Sur system, as well as the Ocoa, Nizao, and various other smaller rivers. The San Juan River, a principal tributary of the Yaque del Sur, irrigates the fertile expanse of the San Juan Valley, linking with Haiti's Central Plateau through the upper Artibonite River valley. Bounding the southern periphery of the San Juan Valley lies the Sierra de Neiba, corresponding to Haiti's Matheux and Trou d'Eau mountains, boasting peaks soaring to approximately 7,200 feet (2,200 meters). Waters coursing down from the Neiba range find their way partly to the Caribbean via the Yaque del Sur system and partly inland, feeding into the saline waters of Lake Enriquillo. This lake, the largest natural expanse of water in the country, stretches some 23 miles (37 kilometres) in length and spans up to 11 miles (18 kilometres) in width, with its surface marking the lowest point in the West Indies, nestled 144 feet (44 meters) below sea level. Overlooking Cape Beata and the arid southwest plain, including the largely barren Pedernales region, lies the Dominican Republic's southernmost range, the Sierra de Baoruco, known as the Massif de la Selle in Haiti.

The region's principal rivers all course their way to the Caribbean, among them the Ozama, reaching the coast at Santo Domingo, and the Macorís, Soco, Chavón, and Yuma. The nation's most fecund alluvial soils are ensconced within the valleys of the Yaque del Norte, Yuna, San Juan, and Yaque del Sur rivers, as well as along the Ozama and various smaller rivers in the southeast. Conversely, the slopes of the mountains are adorned with soils of lesser quality, primarily blanketed in forests and grasslands. Surrounding Lake Enriquillo, salt deposits engender some of the nation's most infertile soils. ALSO READ| 9 Most Unique Borders in the World Dominican Republic History Christopher Columbus's arrival in Hispaniola in 1492 marked a tumultuous era for the indigenous peoples, particularly the Taino, preyed upon by the Caribs. Their village-based societies, focused on agriculture and fishing, contrasted with the advanced civilisations of the Americas. Columbus's attempts at colonisation faced resistance, leading to the establishment of Santo Domingo. The Spanish imprint on Hispaniola was profound, with the island becoming a focal point of colonial policy. Despite the establishment of institutions like the first cathedral and university, exploitation and cruelty characterised the era, leading to the decimation of the indigenous population. Hispaniola's fate oscillated between neglect and exploitation. Raids by European powers devastated the island, leading to a division between the Spanish and French spheres. Haitian occupation further shaped the island's history, marked by repression but also social reforms. The Dominican Republic's journey to independence was tumultuous, marked by caudillos and interventions, including by the United States. Trujillo's brutal dictatorship, lasting until 1961, exemplified this period, followed by a mix of democratic and autocratic rule. Recent decades saw economic growth and political transitions, from Fernández's tenure to Abinader's election in 2020. Despite challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dominican Republic continues to navigate its path through history, shaped by its complex past and aspirations for the future.

Dominican Republic Heritage Sites Within the borders of the Dominican Republic lies a UNESCO World Heritage Site , namely the Colonial City of Santo Domingo. Following Christopher Columbus's historic landing on the island in 1492, Santo Domingo emerged as the epicentre of groundbreaking developments in the Americas. It bore witness to the establishment of pivotal institutions including the first cathedral, hospital, customs house, and university in the New World.

The term \"Taíno\" translates to \"good\" or \"noble,\" reflecting the commendable lifestyle of these inhabitants. They were characterised by their peaceful demeanour, generosity, and cooperative spirit. However, following Columbus's departure, Spanish settlers found themselves in conflict with the Taínos. Many Taínos were killed by the settlers, while others succumbed to diseases brought by the Europeans. Those who survived endured brutal exploitation in agriculture and mining, forced into labour against their will. United Confederation of Taíno People Established in 1998, the United Confederation of Taíno People (UCTP) serves as a representative institution for indigenous communities, with a primary focus on promoting self-determination and safeguarding the human rights, culture, traditions, and ancestral lands of the Taíno and other Indigenous Peoples of the Caribbean.

By Mohammad Jazib Jun 12, 2024, 13:19 IST Tennessee Map: Official Image, Population and Other Important Details Nestled in the heart of the central-southeastern United States, the landlocked state of Tennessee boasts a unique geographical position. Tennessee shares its borders with a total of eight other states, forming a mosaic of connections: Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, and a southern embrace from Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. Along the majestic Mississippi River in the west, Tennessee finds its western boundaries with Arkansas and Missouri. Aptly nicknamed \"The Volunteer State,\" Tennessee exudes a spirit of active participation and contribution. Originally a segment of North Carolina's territory, the region now known as Tennessee became a part of the United States in 1790 when North Carolina relinquished control. Embracing statehood on June 1, 1796, Tennessee proudly earned the distinction of being the 16th state to join the Union. The pages of history unfold with Tennessee as a significant theatre during the Civil War, witnessing pivotal battles such as those at Shiloh and Chattanooga.

In the vast landscape of the United States, Tennessee would snugly fit into Texas more than six times over. Adding to its unique character, Tennessee introduces the concept of the \"Grand Divisions,\" dividing the state into three distinct regions: East, Middle, and West Tennessee. 1. East Tennessee , dominated by the Appalachian Plateau and Cumberland Plateau in the southern part, boasts key cities like Knoxville, Chattanooga, and the Tri-Cities (Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol) nestled within its mountainous terrain. Notably, East Tennessee aligns with the Eastern Time Zone, setting it apart from the rest of the state, which follows Central Time. 2. Moving westward from the Cumberland Plateau, Middle Tennessee unfolds with its rolling hills, and fertile river valleys, and serves as the home to the state capital, Nashville. The Nashville Metropolitan Area, with a population of 1.6 million people, stands as the largest metro in Tennessee. 3. Nestled between the Tennessee River and the Mississippi, West Tennessee emerges as a predominantly agricultural region, punctuated by the presence of Memphis, the state's second-largest city. ALSO CHECK| Map Of Hawaii Tennessee World Heritage Site Tennessee shares a distinguished UNESCO World Heritage Site with North Carolina, namely, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park . Acknowledged on the UNESCO official website, this park stands as a significant sanctuary for temperate zone flora and fauna that endured the challenges of the Pleistocene glaciations. Source| NatGeo With over 200,000 acres, the park is centred around the majestic ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, a prominent subrange of the Appalachian Mountains.

Rabindranath Tagore Jayanti 2024: Famous and Motivational Quotes by the Bard of Bengal 1. \"Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.\" 2. \"That side of our existence whose direction is towards the infinite that seeks not wealth, but freedom and joy.\" 3. “I have spent a fortune traveling to distant shores and looked at lofty mountains and boundless oceans, and yet I haven’t found time to take a few steps from my house to look at a single dewdrop on a single blade of grass.” 4. \"Death is not extinguishing the light; it is only putting out the lamp because the dawn has come.” 5. “Gray hairs are signs of wisdom if you hold your tongue, speak and they are but hairs, as in the young.” 6. “I slept and dreamt that life was a joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was a joy.” 7. \"We read the world wrong and say that it deceives us.\" 8. \"The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but that makes our life in harmony with all existence.\" 9. \"The small wisdom is like water in a glass: clear, transparent, pure. The great wisdom is like the water in the sea: dark, mysterious, impenetrable.\" 10. \"If you cry because the sun has gone out of your life, your tears will prevent you from seeing the stars.\" 11. “If I can’t make it through one door, I’ll go through another door or I’ll make a door. Something terrific will come no matter how dark the present.” 12. “Our nature is obscured by work done by the compulsion of want or fear. The mother reveals herself in the service of her children, so our true freedom is not the freedom from action but freedom in action, which can only be attained in the work of love.” 13. “The one who plants trees, knowing that he will never sit in their shade, has at least started to understand the meaning of life.” 14. “When we accept any discipline for ourselves, we try to avoid everything except that which is necessary for our purpose; it is this purposefulness, which belongs to the adult mind, that we force upon school children. We say, “Never keep your mind aler” 15. \"Love is an endless mystery, because there is no reasonable cause that could explain it.\" 16. \"Let your life lightly dance on the edges of time like dew on the tip of a leaf.\" 17. \"By plucking her petals you do not gather the beauty of the flower.\" 18. \"The greed of gain has no time or limit to its capaciousness. Its one object is to produce and consume. It has pity neither for beautiful nature nor for living human beings. It is ruthlessly ready without a moment's hesitation to crush beauty and life.\" 19. \"Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky.\" 20. \"We come nearest to the great when we are great in humility.\" Rabindranath Tagore Biography: Early Life, Education, Works and Achievements Rabindranath Tagore Jayanti 2024: Poems by the Bard of Bengal 1. Waiting The song I came to sing remains unsung to this day. I have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument. The time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set; only there is the agony of wishing in my heart….. I have not seen his face, nor have I listened to his voice; only I have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house….. But the lamp has not been lit and I cannot ask him into my house; I live in the hope of meeting with him; but this meeting is not yet. 2. Gitanjali Thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure. This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life. This little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new. At the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable. Thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill. 3. On The Nature of Love The night is black and the forest has no end; a million people thread it in a million ways. We have trysts to keep in the darkness, but where or with whom – of that we are unaware. But we have this faith – that a lifetime’s bliss will appear any minute, with a smile upon its lips. Scents, touches, sounds, snatches of songs brush us, pass us, give us delightful shocks. Then peradventure there’s a flash of lightning: whomever I see that instant I fall in love with. I call that person and cry: `This life is blest! for your sake such miles have I traversed!’ All those others who came close and moved off in the darkness – I don’t know if they exist or not. 4. Paper Boats Day by day I float my paper boats one by one down the running stream. In big black letters I write my name on them and the name of the village where I live. I hope that someone in some strange land will find them and know who I am. I load my little boats with shiuli flower from our garden, and hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land in the night. 5. Where The Mind Is Without Fear Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high Where knowledge is free Where the world has not been broken up into fragments By narrow domestic walls Where words come out from the depth of truth Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit Where the mind is led forward by thee. Rabindranath Tagore Jayanti 2024: Interesting Facts Not only was Rabindranath Tagore the first Non-European to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, but he was also the first Asian to do so. Tagore's Nobel Prize medal was stolen in 2004 from Shantiniketan. He received the honour from the Swedish Academy once again in the shape of two silver and gold replicas. Rabindranath Tagore received a knighthood from King George V of England in 1915 in recognition of his outstanding contributions to literature. He was the author of the national anthems for Bangladesh and India, as well as the Sri Lankan National Anthem, 'Sri Lanka Matha.' People noticed that he was red-green colour blind because of his odd hue combinations and eccentric aesthetics. Rabindranath Tagore used the money from his Nobel Prize to build the \"Visva-Bharati\" school.

In the article below, learn all about Tagore's early life, his family, education, career and more. Rabindranath Tagore's birth anniversary is also known as Pochishe Boishakh.

We can't forget that he is the person who composed the National Anthem of India. Rabindranath Tagore: Early life and Childhood Days He was born on 7 May, 1861, to Debendranath Tagore and Sarada Devi in the Jorasanko mansion, which is the ancestral home of the Tagore family in Kolkata (Calcutta). Among his siblings, he was the youngest. He lost his mother when he was very young, his father was a traveler, and so he was mostly raised by his servants and maids. At a very young age, he was part of the Bengal Renaissance, and his family also took active participation in it. At the age of 8, he started writing poems and by the age of sixteen, he also started composing artworks and started publishing his poems under the pseudonym Bhanusimha. In 1877, he wrote the short story 'Bhikharini' and, in 1882, the collection of poems 'Sandhya Sangit'. He was influenced by the classical poetry of Kalidasa and started writing his own classical poems. His sister, Swarnakumari, was a well-known novelist. In 1873, he toured with his father for several months and gained knowledge on several subjects. He learned Sikhism when he stayed at Amritsar and wrote around six poems and many articles on the religion. Shankaracharya Jayanti: Birth Anniversary Rabindranath Tagore: Education His traditional education began in Brighton, East Sussex, England, at a public school. In 1878, he went to England to become a barrister to fulfill his father's wish. He was not much interested in school learning and later he joined University College in London to learn law but he dropped this and learned various works of Shakespeare on his own. He also learned the essence of English, Irish and Scottish literature and music. He returned to India and married Mrinalini Devi. Rabindranath Tagore: Established Shantiniketan His father bought a huge land for meditation and named it Shantiniketan. Debendranath Tagore founded an 'Ashram' in 1863. In 1901, Rabindranath Tagore established an open-air school. It was a prayer hall with marble flooring and was named 'The Mandir'. It was also named 'Patha Bhavana' and started with only five students. Classes here were held under trees and followed the traditional Guru-Shishya method of teaching. This trend of teaching revived the ancient method of teaching, which proved beneficial when compared with the modernised method. Unfortunately, his wife and two children died and he left alone. At that time, he was very disturbed. In the meantime, his works started growing and became more popular among Bengali as well as foreign readers. In 1913, he gained recognition, was awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize in Literature, and became Asia's first Nobel Laureate. Shantiniketan is now a famous University town in West Bengal. Let us tell you that Rabindranath Tagore envisioned a centre of learning which would have the best of both the east and the west. He established the Visva Bharati University in West Bengal. It consists of two campuses, one at Shantiniketan and the other at Sriniketan. Sriniketan focuses on agriculture, adult education, village, cottage industries, and handicrafts. Rabindranath Tagore: Literary Works Japajog: Published in 1929, His novel is a compelling take on marital rape. Nastanirh: Published in 1901. This novel is about relationships and love, both requited and unrequited. Ghare Baire: Published in 1916. It is a story about a married woman constricted in her household trying to find her own identity. Gora: In the 1880s, it is an expansive, exhaustive, and extremely relevant novel that deals with several themes like religion, gender, feminism, and also tradition against modernity.

Around five museums are dedicated to Tagore, of which three are situated in India and the remaining two in Bangladesh. He spent his last years in severe pain and even in 1937, he went into a comatose condition. After a lot of suffering, he died on August 7, 1941, in the Jorasanko mansion where he was brought up.

Under Dhoni's captaincy, India has won the top prize in all formats. He is an inspiration for his exemplary game, dedication, and calmness. By Twinkle May 20, 2024, 13:04 IST Get best and motivational MS Dhonia Quotes Best MS Dhoni Quotes: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the most admired, loved and valued cricket captain in the history of cricket turned 42 today. He is known to the world as Captain Cool, Thala, MS, MSD and many other names out of love. Under his leadership, the Indian national cricket team won world championships like the ICC Cricket World Cup, T20 World Cup and the Champions Trophy, and recently CSK secured the trophy for the fifth time. Let’s celebrate his legacy, passion, determination and love for cricket with the best of his quotes. About MS Dhoni MS Dhoni was born to Pan Singh and Devki Devi in Ranchi, Bihar (now Jharkhand), on July 7, 1981. He is the only skipper in cricket history to have taken home every ICC trophy. He was selected for the 1997/98 Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship and did well there thanks to his outstanding wicketkeeping, which made him the Commando Cricket Club's regular wicketkeeper (1995–1998). He held a position as a TTE for South Eastern Railway in Midnapore, West Bengal, from 2001 to 2003. He first represented Bihar and then the Jharkhand Cricket team in domestic cricket in India. Three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a few half-centuries in other competitions were among Dhoni's accomplishments during the 2002–03 season. He gained worldwide popularity for his low-order contribution and hard-hitting batting style. He won multiple national and international championships with the Indian Cricket Team before becoming the captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK), who have advanced to the Indian Premier League final 10 times with five victories. He is the first wicketkeeper and the seventh cricketer overall to have scored more than 5,000 runs in the IPL. The list of milestones, hundreds, and other accomplishments doesn't stop here. Top 35 Rabindranath Tagore Quotes for Inspiration and Motivation Inspirational and Motivational Quotes by MS Dhoni \"Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality.\" \"You don’t play for the crowd; you play for the country.\" \"You have seen cricketers who are not god-gifted, but even then, they have gone far. That’s because of the passion.\" \"Gut feeling is all about the experiences that you have had in your life. It is about being in difficult scenarios, knowing what worked, what did not work, and then taking a decision.\" \"Self-Confidence has always been one of my good qualities. I am always very confident. It is in my nature to be confident, to be aggressive. And it applies in my batting as well as wicketkeeping.\" \"If you don’t really have a dream, you can’t really push yourself, you don’t really know what the target is.\" “I don’t mind repeating everything.” – M.S. Dhoni \"For me, it is important to build good partnerships rather than score centuries. Once, you have those partnerships; you will also get centuries. \"I don’t regret anything in my life. What does not kill you makes you stronger.\" \"I believe in giving more than 100% on the field, and I don’t worry about the result if there’s a great commitment on the field. That’s a victory for me.\" \"Till the full stop does not come; the sentence does not complete.\" \"It’s important to learn and not make the same mistakes, what’s done is done.\" \"Listen to your elder’s advice not because they are always right, but because they have more experience of being wrong.\" \"It's like having 100 kgs put over you. That's good enough to weigh you down. After that even if you put a mountain, it will not make a difference.\" \"When you die, you die. You don't think which is the better way to die.\" “You Don’t play for the crowd, You are playing for the country.” “I want people to remember me as a Good Person, Not as a Good Cricketer.” \"I have always believed that process is more important than results.\" Famous MS Dhoni Quotes \"For me, the opposition is just another opposition.\" \"Face the failure, until the failure fails to face you.\" \"The process is more important than the results. And if you take care of the process, you will get the results.\" \"A loss makes you humble. It tests the other batsmen and bowlers. Also, if you keep winning you don't know what area you need to work on.\" \"I don't mind repeating everything.\" “If you don’t really have a dream, you can’t really push yourself; you don’t really know what the target is.” “I live for the moment – not the future, not the past.” “I live in the present with an eye on the future.” “I never allow myself to be pressured.” “I have three dogs at home. Even after losing a series or winning a series, they treat me the same way.” Without any Motion or Movement, There is no Life.” “You learn a lot more when you’re going through a rough period compared to the good times when everything goes your way.” “You need to perform consistently, and if you’re raising the standard, you have to stand by it. You have to keep on doing well.” “When people say ‘He’s in the form”, nobody has seen the form. It’s a state of mind where you are confident and you think very positively and everything you think about, you think it’s very achievable. It’s about how you treat the mind.” “I am in the hands of Deori Maa. Every time I come to Ranchi, I visit her temple. I still remember my first visit.” “If you are not 100 per cent fit and not at your best (and still play), it’s cheating.” “Everybody has views in life, and it should be respected.” “Unless you know the individual, it’s very difficult to advise that individual as to what he needs to do.” “I have more than I will ever need for one life.” “You die, you die. You don’t see which is the better way to die.” In recognition of his contributions to cricket, Thala has also been given the honorary title of Lieutenant Colonel in the Indian Territorial Army. He finished a two-week assignment with the Army in the Jammu and Kashmir region in August 2019. His achievements also include, the Major Dhyanchand Khel Ratna medal is India's highest distinction bestowed for sporting achievement, as are the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian honour, and other prizes and recognitions.

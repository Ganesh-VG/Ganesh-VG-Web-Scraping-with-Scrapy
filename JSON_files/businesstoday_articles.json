    "article_content": "Feedback The Latte Factor calculator estimates the opportunity cost of petty expenses incurred over a period of time. The term ‘Latte Factor’ was coined by American financial author, David Bach. Bach suggested jettisoning recurrent small expenses and investing the money instead. Unfettered indulgence in binge spending has ramifications on long term wealth. The BT Latte Factor calculator helps estimate earnings if money is spent on SIP instead of trivial expenses. The calculation is based on inputs viz, expenditure, duration of expense (years), frequency of expense and annual return forgone. Annual return forgone is the return that you have forgone by indulging in spending rather than investing. The Latte Factor calculator uses 4 inputs viz, amount of expense, duration of expense, expense frequency and annual returns forgone by not investing. It measures the opportunity cost of expenses on trivial purchases. For calculating the return on SIP investments, the calculator uses the formula P [(1+i) ^n-1] x (1+i)/i Total expenditure incurred = Amount (daily*30/weekly*4/monthly*1) * 12 * Duration of expenditure (years) Assume you spend Rs 50 each day for 5 years. Thus, monthly spending is Rs 50*30 = Rs 1,500. In 5 years, the total expense made is Rs 90,000 (50*30*12*5). Assuming an expected annual return of 12%, had you invested Rs 1,500 through monthly SIP, you would have earned almost Rs 1.24 lakhs. The Latte Factor calculator allows you to recalibrate the inputs in order to provide a precise estimation of the output. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback Amid accusations of using exit polls for stock market manipulation, Axis My India's chief Pradeep Gupta said he is open to facing all kinds of investigations and it would help do business in a much better way if the government frames specific regulations for pollsters. Opposition parties and several civil society groups have been asking for thorough investigations, including by capital markets regulator SEBI and a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), after the stock markets witnessed a massive rally when exit polls gave a huge majority to the BJP but fell sharply after the actual results showed the ruling party falling short of a clear majority on its own. Gupta, in a interaction with an agency, termed as \"childish\" the demands for banning exit polls, saying every single citizen and organisation wants to know the election results and banning exit polls would serve no purpose. Gupta had predicted 361-401 seats for the BJP-led alliance as against the actual tally of 240 seats. \"We have no connection with stock market whatsoever but I am happy to know these allegations because our data and system is so foolproof that any probe will give me an opportunity to showcase all of that is used to predict exit polls to the world. In a way it is an opportunity for us, I support the demand as it will give us a chance to show our credentials,\" he said. Asked about whether he is open to a probe by a JPC or SEBI, the pollster said, \"I am open to facing all kind of investigations\". \"As far as me deriving any benefit from stock market jump is concerned...Axis My India has no demat account. It is a limited company, not listed and till today not a single external investment is there in the company. There is no investment by promoters. My personal investment in stocks since April has been merely Rs 35,000. Where have I benefited?\" he asserted. The pollster also responded to allegations of Axis My India also conducting exit polls for foreign investors and sharing different results with them. \"We have never been approached by any FII, neither we have worked for any foreign investors, we have not conducted any exit poll survey for them ever,\" Gupta, 55, said. He also said Axis My India's 70 per cent clients are corporate clients including bigwigs like Bill Melinda Gates foundation and denied any conflict of interest with exit polls. Questioned about whether the dent in image caused by 2024 poll results has also impacted his corporate clients, Gupta said, \"They give us business for the work we do for them and not on basis of how rightly we predict election results\". \"Since the last five years, I am running from pillar to post seeking some regulations. When our people go on ground, they are seen with a suspicious mindset. We have to convince that we are not salespersons, we aren't frauds and we are not sent by a political party. We are often asked who gave you permission? And we ask please tell where we need to take permission? \"We wrote to the home ministry, we were guided to the law ministry that there is no law so first we need a law. From there we were referred to the information and broadcasting ministry that you get yourself registered there and set up a cell. We were told that you will publish a survey but who will monitor who is right and wrong ... nothing has moved but I strongly believe that we need regulations,\" he said. Axis My India has been conducting exit polls since 2013 after Gupta returned from the Harvard Business School and claims a track record of predicting 61 out of 65 elections correctly. Asked about why does Axis My India does not make a disclosure that some political parties are also its clients, Gupta said, \"In the 2019 Haryana assembly elections, BJP was one of our clients and in exit polls we predicted a hung assembly, which was bang on\". \"The prediction is even part of a Harvard Business School case study and includes a disclosure. Wherever, the client agrees we make a disclosure, there is nothing to hide,\" Gupta added. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

In a notification, the board said that a new date for the examination will be announced soon. The employed teachers are given the status of state employees only when they pass the Teacher Eligibility Test. TET is to be conducted for teacher candidates of primary school, secondary school and higher secondary school in Bihar. The postponement of the exam comes against the backdrop of paper leaks UGC-NET and NEET-UG exams. Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on June 20 said that UGC-NET exam was cancelled after it was found that the question paper was leaked on darknet. The CSIR-UGC-NET exam, which was to be conducted between June 25 and June 27, was also postponed by the NTA in a notification on June 21 due to ‘unavoidable circumstances’. The NTA conducted the UGC-NET June 2024 Examination in OMR (pen and paper) mode on June 18 across 1,205 exam centres in 317 cities. Nearly 10 lakh candidates appeared for the exam, which is held for Assistant Professor posts in universities and colleges and to determine eligibility for junior research fellowships. Meanwhile, The National Testing Agency (NTA) has released admit cards for re-examination for 1,563 candidates for National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET-UG), which will be held on June 23. Officials said that NEET-UG re-examinations will be conducted for 1,563 candidates, who were earlier given grace marks as compensation due to lost time during the examination held on May 5. Officials from the National Testing Agency (NTA) and the Union education ministry will be present at the examination centres. Officials said that six new centres have been issued to students this time. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback For serial entrepreneur Bhavin Turakhia, the vision while setting up Zeta was very clear. \"We started with the notional objective of being a globally disruptive and dominant player in three buckets, with focus on banking, payments and commerce. Our goal is to provide the most-outstanding experience from a banking and payments standpoint and create unique experiences for commerce - buying/selling goods for customers, merchants, companies, employees and banks,\" says Turakhia. Co- founders Turakhia and Ramakrishna Gaddipati started their Fintech journey with 'Zeta Tax Benefits' in 2016, a Cloud-based enterprise benefits suite, which digitises meal vouchers, fuel and communications cards, medical reimbursements, gadget cards, gift cards and LTA cards. There was also Zeta Express for cashless transactions at corporate cafeterias, for which the company initially roped in Sodexo, RBL Bank, IDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ADP India and Excelity Global. \"While the solution that we first started out with was employee benefits, we were eventually building a full-stack banking solution,\" says Bhavin. While charting out Zeta's path, the founders were staring at two options - either to get into the neo-banking/lending space, or become a pure-play Fintech. However, the challenges of regulation and capital- intensive nature in case of banks, and the risk of vertical integration and middle layers in case of Fintechs, led Turakhia and Gaddipati to look into the problem-solving area in both spaces. \"If you talk to any bank today, not a single bank will tell you they love their technology,\" says Turakhia. \"With many of them having worked with 20- 30 different vendors, from big companies to small players, banks know they are running on old technologies that cannot adapt to the latest trends or changing technology. We felt that is a clear problem to solve and we can basically become a dominant player in that space.\" The company currently has three distinct platforms - Tachyon, Fusion and Electron - offering solutions. Tachyon is a Cloud-based full stack, API-ready neo-banking solutions platform with a card management system, which can host credit, debit and prepaid cards and is capable of supporting use-cases for both physical and virtual cards. The payment engine enables just-in-time payments with transactions funded from multiple accounts. For instance, a payment can be funded first from a credit card account and any shortfall in funds can be covered from the savings or prepaid account, which is enabled with multiple payment methods such as account transfers, UPI, card payments, P2P payments, QR code payments etc. Fusion has been built for Fintech developers, for managing accounts, issuing physical, digital or tokenised cards and controlling spends on channels, levying fees or charges or interest, etc. The platform provides Fintechs with a set of Application Programming Interfaces or APIs that helps them build and solve use-cases unique to them by reducing the prototyping and go-to-market time for companies. An API is a source code-based specification used as an interface by software components to communicate with each other. One of the Fintechs that uses Fusion came up with the business idea of a start-up that gives teens access to financial literacy and digital payments through gamification, in the final year at IIT Roorkee in 2019. \"We needed a technology partner who could help us provide and scale digital payments for this vast market. We wanted to go to market fast and needed a credible, flexible and dependable technical service provider to do it with,\" says Kush Taneja, Co-founder of FamPay, a neo-bank for teenagers. A neo-bank is a kind of digital bank with no branches. Taneja recalls how they conducted their research by reaching out to other founders and Fintech product managers within their network to understand the options available and finally chose Fusion's offering. \"We charted the user journey and the Fusion team mapped APIs to wireframes. Concluding that phase, we were given sandbox and SDK (software development kit) access to integrate and test APIs. It took us six weeks for testing, which happens in a User Acceptance Testing environment wherein you can test your product with a small set of users. After User Acceptance Testing, we ran Beta testing, and then FamPay went live in four months,\" says Taneja. Zetas third offering, Electron, is a suite of solutions sold via banks to enterprises for offering employee benefit solutions and travel and management options, corporate gifting, and rewards and recognition for enterprise payments. Zeta has already signed up with seven banks and is in talks with another 11 of them for adopting Tachyon. Around 20 Fintechs have signed up for Fusion - seven of them are already live and another 11-15 are in talks with the company to integrate the programme with their apps. While Zeta plans to launch corporate gifting soon, the employee benefits product is already live in partnership with Sodexo. It has over 8,000-10,000 companies on-board, with nearly 1.5-2 million employees using it. Outside India, Zeta operates in Vietnam, The Philippines, Brazil and Italy with Electron, and plans to shortly go live in Spain and the UK. The company is also in the process of launching Tachyon and Fusion in North America. According to Turakhia, bulk of the revenues come from the Electron platform, and majority of the contracted revenue is from Tachyon. Electron benefits have already reached operational break-even, and are set to grow upwards of $20 million in annual revenues over the next five years. But both Fusion and Tachyon are catching up, \"We believe Tachyon and Fusion will operationally break-even in 2023\" he says. Bootstrapped like most of Turakhia's companies, the first external funding of around $60 million came from Sodexo in 2019 at a valuation of $300 million. Founders and employees still own around 90 per cent. \"We have cash in the bank, but we may choose to raise some additional capital. There's no urgency,\" says Turakhia. With new technology invading the financial space every day, Zeta believes it is solving one of the biggest barriers in the sector. According to Turakhia, for Fintechs to proliferate, banks have to be provided with a modern stack to help them write codes and build apps. Some of Zeta's clients have launched their businesses in less than two months with a full mobile app and financial products. With Tachyon and Fusion together, \"banks will be able to serve new-age modern digital financial services companies, and these companies in turn will be able to make a meaningful impact on the ecosystem,\" says Turakhia. @rukminirao Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback Collaborations between industry leaders can pave the way for groundbreaking innovations. Enter Healthify, one of India's foremost health tech companies, and OpenAI, the pioneering force behind transformative AI models. At the forefront of this partnership stands Abhijit Khasnis, VP - Technology at Healthify, orchestrating the integration of OpenAI's cutting-edge GPT models into Healthify's products. The synergy between Healthify and OpenAI has not only propelled the development of innovative features but has also garnered significant recognition within the tech community. By harnessing the power of OpenAI's advancements, Healthify has introduced groundbreaking solutions such as Ria, the AI-powered wellness assistant. One notable testament to this collaboration is the recent acknowledgement from OpenAI, where Healthify was featured in a customer story on its website. This spotlight on Healthify's utilisation of Generative AI models to enhance consumer-facing products underscores the depth of the partnership and the impact it has had on advancing health technology. Moreover, OpenAI's explicit reference to Healthify's implementation of their GPT-4 Vision model in the Snap product signifies a significant milestone. As the world's first 'Fire & Forget' food recognition system, Snap automates the nutrition tracking process, showcasing the tangible benefits of integrating AI technology into healthcare solutions. The recognition not only bolsters Healthify's reputation as a leader in the field but also opens doors to new partnerships, investments, and growth opportunities. With a shared presence in India and a mutual dedication to leveraging AI for positive societal impact, the partnership between Healthify and OpenAI is hoping to redefine the future of healthcare technology. PD: What is Healthify's relationship with OpenAI? How did OpenAI give Healthify a \"shout out\"? Abhijit Khasnis: Healthify's relationship with OpenAI has allowed us to integrate their cutting-edge GPT models into our products. We have been able to get early access to the latest advancements from OpenAI to offer innovative features to our users, such as Ria, our AI-powered wellness assistant. OpenAI has acknowledged our collaboration in a couple of ways. First, they featured Healthify in a customer story on their website, which delves into our experience using Generative AI models to revamp our consumer-facing products. Most recently, when OpenAI announced the general availability of their GPT-4 Vision model, they explicitly referenced Healthify's implementation of this technology in our Snap product, the world’s first 'Fire & Forget' food recognition system that automates the nutrition tracking process, as a prime example of its capabilities. Our partnership with OpenAI is further strengthened by our shared presence in India, where OpenAI has its second-largest user base, and Healthify stands out as the country's largest health tech company. By working together, we are able to capitalise on the growing interest and expertise in generative AI, harnessing its potential to create tangible, impactful solutions for our users that ultimately lead to significant health improvements. The @healthifyme team built Snap using GPT-4 Turbo with Vision to give users nutrition insights through photo recognition of foods from around the world. pic.twitter.com/jWFLuBgEoA PD: What products or services does Healthify offer that may have caught OpenAI's attention? How is Healthify utilising or interacting with AI technology? Abhijit Khasnis: Healthify has been an AI-driven company since 2017, and we've continuously expanded upon this foundation to enhance our offerings for both coaches and users. How do we use AI? We offer advanced Gen AI solutions making us the first and only Indian company OpenAI and other big tech firms like Amazon have recognised us for our work in improving millions of lives with sustainable weight loss. Our key offerings include our conversational AI wellness coach Ria, Coach CoPilot, and Snap. With the evolution in AI models, we've swiftly implemented the latest functionalities, like function calling, JSON formatting and more. This early adoption allows our users to benefit from the newest in AI technology and address their health and wellness needs. Our partnership extends across various AI technologies, such as the Whisper model for voice processing and GPT-4 Vision for our Snap feature, enabling photo-to-food recognition. In essence, we've integrated OpenAI's technology into our application across multiple dimensions, including voice, image, and text. PD: How does the OpenAI shoutout validate or boost Healthify's work? Will it lead to new partnerships, investments, or growth opportunities? Abhijit Khasnis: OpenAI is one of the earliest and most significant AI models, often considered foundational in the field of artificial intelligence. So, being the first Indian company acknowledged by OpenAI twice in less than a month (alongside distinguished global projects like Cognition's Devin and TLDraw's Make Real) further solidifies our leadership position in the global health and fitness industry and reaffirms our commitment to leveraging cutting edge AI.

    "article_content": "Feedback ITR filing AY 2024-25: The Income Tax department time to time introduces changes in tax return forms seeking some additional details from taxpayers. Like in December 2023, the Income Tax department tweaked ITR forms 1 and 4 notified for Assessment Year 2024-25. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has introduced many additional reporting requirements and modifications due to the Finance Act 2023 amendments. Tax regime declaration In the revised tax return forms, a taxpayer filing ITR 1 is required to indicate his choice of tax regime in the return of income. An assessee filing ITR 4 will be required to file Form 10-IEA to opt out of the new tax regime. A new column has been added to claim deduction under section 80CCH in new ITR Forms 1 and 4. Capital gains accounts scheme Taxpayers using Income Tax Return (ITR) forms 2, 3, 5, and 6 are mandated to provide exhaustive information regarding the Capital Gains Account Scheme compared to the previous year's forms, where only the deposited amount was necessary. The revamped Schedule CG stipulates the inclusion of additional particulars such as the deposit date, account number, and IFSC code. Form 10-IEA must for ITR 4 filers ITR-4 or SUGAM is for individuals, HUFs and firms (other than LLP) whose total income is up to Rs 50 lakh and the income from business and profession that is calculated under sections 44AD, 44ADA or 44AE under Income Tax Act. Taxpayers opting for ITR 4 will now need to file Form 10-IEA to opt out of the new tax regime. Form 10-IEA was introduced to allow taxpayers to opt for the old regime if they wish to do so. The \"Receipts in Cash\" column has been added to ITR-4 to claim an enhanced turnover limit. Legal Entity Identifier requirement ITR forms 2, 3, 5, and 6 are income tax return forms used by taxpayers to report their income to the tax authorities in India. These forms require a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), which is a unique 20-character alpha-numeric code. The LEI is used to identify parties involved in financial transactions globally. Taxpayers are mandated to provide their LEI when claiming a refund amounting to Rs 50 crore or more. This requirement ensures transparency and traceability in high-value financial transactions, aiming to prevent fraudulent activities and promote financial integrity. Acknowledgment number and UDIN requirement in ITR-6 Companies submitting ITR 6 must now include acknowledgment numbers and Unique Document Identification Numbers (UDIN) for audit reports as per section 44AB (tax audit report) and section 92E (transfer pricing report). Donations to political parties Details of contributions made to political parties must be disclosed in the new Schedule 80GGC, which is applicable to ITR forms 2, 3, 5, and 6. The required information includes the date of the contribution, contribution amount (including breakdown of cash and other modes), eligible contribution amount, transaction reference number for UPI transfer or cheque number/IMPS/NEFT/RTGS, and IFSC code of the bank. Deduction details for medical treatment For claiming deductions related to maintenance and medical treatment expenses for a dependent with a disability, details must be provided separately in Schedule 80DD (and not under Schedule VI-A). Required information includes: > Nature of the disability > Type of dependent (spouse, son, daughter, father, mother, brother, sister, or member of the HUF) > PAN of the dependent > Aadhaar number of the dependent > Date of filing and acknowledgment number of Form 10-IA > UDID Number. Agniveer Corpus Fund Section 80CCH of the Income Tax Act was introduced through the Finance Act 2023. This section enables individuals filing their tax returns through ITR forms 1, 2, 3, or 4 to seek a deduction for the amount deposited in the Agniveer Corpus Fund. As a result, a dedicated column has been added in \"PART C – DEDUCTIONS AND TAXABLE TOTAL INCOME\" to specify the eligible deduction amount. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

Mark Ong, the visionary behind the sneaker customisation brand SBTG, took this everyday annoyance and turned it into a catalyst for innovation. Enter Monsoon Patrol, a footwear collaboration that has evolved into a full-fledged apparel collection with the creative input of GRAYE. This exciting journey, starting with a practical problem and leading to an international showcase, encapsulates the dynamic evolution of sneaker culture. Mark Ong reflects on this evolution, noting, \"Custom Culture in the sneaker world started out as an underground punk band and is now mainstream pop. It became this collective consciousness where if you had an idea, someone would have already done it.\" Monsoon Patrol's journey from a simple idea to a feature at Paris Fashion Week underscores the brand's promising future and its potential impact on the global fashion scene. This conversation with Business Today's Pranav Dixit will delve into Mark's creative process, the inspiration behind Monsoon Patrol, and his thoughts on the evolving landscape of sneaker culture, particularly as this collection gears up for its Indian release. PD: Monsoon Patrol started as a footwear collaboration. What drove the expansion into a full apparel collection with GRAYE? How did the collaboration with them influence the design direction? Mark Ong: The idea for Monsoon Patrol was always to be presented as a brand with no particular category as lead. We had a ticket to work with Asics during that time so we chose footwear first as it would make more noise. This year, we got introduced to GRAYE from Jebson of Zha Huo Dian and became a fan of their products. We find their designs very original and well thought out. We approached them later to work on a casual tech suit to go along with the shoes. PD: The collection is clearly built for functionality in challenging weather. Was there a specific experience or memory that sparked the initial idea for Monsoon Patrol? Mark Ong: It is very simple. I really hate it when my toes get wet in the rain, it would ruin my day so I had the thought that all shoes should have some sort of protective coating on the toes for this purpose. So I presented a problem which I feel we all experience and a sub-brand as a solution. Mandeep shared the same sentiment and that's when we decided to join forces to do Monsoon Patrol. PD: You've been a major figure in sneaker customisation for many years. How have you seen sneaker culture evolve, and where do you see collaborations like Monsoon Patrol fitting into the future of footwear and fashion? Mark Ong: Custom Culture in the sneaker world started out as an underground punk band and is now mainstream pop. It became this collective consciousness where if you had an idea, someone would have already done it. I feel blessed to have a 20-year headstart on it. Monsoon Patrol is a work-in-progress young brand that has an exciting future. Already having 3 collabs deep with ASICS and New Era, we will be showcasing the future of it in this year's Paris Fashion Week. PD: What are your impressions of the Indian sneaker scene, and what excites you about bringing Monsoon Patrol to a new audience? Mark Ong: The Indian sneaker scene is in its infancy stage but it couldn't have come at a better time. Everything is already set up for them to consume. Imagine having the choice of being served the best of the best to a big group of audience that is enthusiastic and open to trying new things. That was the vibe I got when I attended the opening of Limited Edt India. PD: What's next for Mark Ong and SBTG? Any exciting projects or collaborations on the horizon you can tease? Mark Ong: We have been on Fire lately with collabs dropping every month this year and we are not done yet. I find myself in a very good space with good management and team support. Opportunities have been coming non-stop too. Right after this launch, we will be flying to Paris to present the future of Monsoon Patrol and after we are back, It will be time to drop our Vans collab. Then I'll start thinking of Culture Cartel and Urban Sneaker Society. Never not working. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback Mining Mogul Anil Agarwal-controlled Vedanta Resources is planning to sell off a 2.5% stake in Vedanta Ltd through block deals in July. The promoter group is likely to sell about 9 crore shares to raise around Rs 4,000 crore through block deals, a report in the Economic Times said. At the end of FY24 (March 31, 2024), Vedanta's promoters held a 61.95% stake in the company, down from 63.71% stake in December 31, 2023. In February this year, promoters had sold some stake in a block deal that was valued at over Rs 2,615 crore. In February this year, Finsider International, which is part of Vedanta Resources, sold more than 6.55 crore Vedanta shares for Rs 1,700 crore. The shares were sold at Rs 265.14 apiece. Starting December 2022, Vedanta's promoter shareholding has declined from nearly 70% to just over 60%. Earlier this week, Vedanta Resources said it will seek to cut its debt by $3 billion over the next three years. In its annual report, Agarwal said \"We seek to further deleverage Vedanta Resources by $3 billion over the next three years.\" Vedanta Resources has been grappling with a host of rating downgrades since last year as analysts flagged liquidity issues and high default risk. In the last two years, Vedanta Resources has cut its debt by $3.70 billion. Agarwal said the maturity of its outstanding bonds worth $3.20 billion, extended up to fiscal 2029, has provided it with \"newfound liquidity\". The group will use this liquidity to fund \"important capex projects,\" he added. Vedanta Ltd, which is in the middle of a planned demerger, aims to operationalise coal blocks and expand capacities for its steel and aluminium business and has proposed to set aside $1.90 billion as capital expenditure for fiscal 2025. This fiscal so far, the Vedanta Group, which includes Vedanta Ltd and Hindustan Zinc Ltd, has produced most wealth for its stock market investors, with combined market valuation growing by Rs 2.2 lakh crore. The Vedanta Group's market value increased by more over Rs 2.2 lakh crore between March 28 and June 20, 2024, according to stock exchange statistics shared by PTI. According to stock exchange data, it has been observed that the share prices of Vedanta and Hindustan Zinc have demonstrated remarkable growth, having doubled from their 52-week lows. This uplifting trend can be attributed to several favorable factors, including the impending demerger, the consistent focus of management on restructuring initiatives, and a discernible uptick in profitability. In a divergent scenario, the market capitalization of the Adani and Mahindra groups has surged by Rs 1.4 lakh crore each. Meanwhile, during the same period, the market valuation of heavyweight RIL witnessed a notable decline by more than Rs 20,656.14 crore. In contrast, the market cap of the Tata Group experienced a significant surge, escalating by over Rs 60,600 crore. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback The Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications, on Friday issued an advisory alerting users that calls are being made in the name of DoT, wherein the users are being threatened that their mobile numbers would be disconnected or their mobile numbers are being misused in some illegal activities. The DoT has also cautioned them about WhatsApp calls from foreign-origin mobile numbers (like +92-xxxxxxxxxx) in which there are elements who are impersonating government officials and duping the people. “Cyber criminals through such calls try to threaten/steal personal information to carry out cyber-crime/financial frauds. The DoT does not authorise anyone to make such calls on its behalf and has advised people to stay vigilant and not share any information on receiving such calls,” an official notification said. The DoT has advised citizens to report such fraud communications at ‘Chakshu-Report Suspected Fraud Communications’ facility of Sanchar Saathi portal. Such proactive reporting helps DoT in prevention of misuse of telecom resources for cyber-crime, financial frauds, etc. Further, citizens can check the mobile connections in their name at ‘Know Your Mobile Connections’ facility of Sanchar Saathi portal and report any mobile connection not taken by them or not required. Further, citizens can check the mobile connections in their name at the ‘Know Your Mobile Connections’ facility of Sanchar Saathi portal (www.sancharsaathi.gov.in) and report any mobile connection not taken by them or not required. The DoT has also advised citizens to report at cyber-crime helpline number 1930 or www.cybercrime.gov.in in case anyone has already become a victim of cyber-crime or financial fraud. Amit Relan, co-founder and CEO, mFilterIt said, \"This is a great initiative to spread awareness and prevent misuse of mobile connections. Fake Profiles impersonation is a massive headache for GoI and individuals alike. Countering such threats requires awareness, vigilance, and a comprehensive monitoring system for organisations getting frequently impersonated online like law enforcement agencies, Telecom department, etc. We also collaborate with one of the largest banks to identify fraudulent activities - like mule accounts, UPI frauds, and other fraudulent activities with mobile numbers linked with accounts as key identifies. We detect approximately 18 to 20,000 cases every single day for a National Bank with suspicious activities scanning leveraging open-source intelligence across more than four thousand websites and social platforms. Trust and transparency are key to building an empowered and efficient digital India.\" Earlier this year, the DoT prohibited over 1,500 phone lines, inclusive of international numbers linked with cybercrimes and potential threats. These preventative measures are a proactive response to curtail the abuse of telecommunication resources amid the escalating occurrences of financial deception.

    "article_content": "Feedback What was the problem you were grappling with? Back in the day, I was grappling with a difference of opinion with my team. I was using the same yardstick with everyone around me. This came to light during an annual conference, where several members spoke about the unrelenting pressure that was being exerted. I had just taken over the leadership role and my style was quite intense. The feedback came as a rude shock. Whom did you approach for advice and why? Although I did not approach him directly, Anand (Mahajan, who was the Managing Director then and later became Chairman of the company), being the perceptive leader that he was, noticed that I was disturbed. He did not voice any opinion in public, was sensitive and without being intrusive, suggested a shift in my leadership approach. What was the advice you received? Anand advised me to listen, learn, and adapt. He expressed confidence that I would overcome the business challenges in future. How effective was it in resolving the problem? That advice made me rethink my leadership style. And after that, I brought about several changes in terms of democracy, inclusion, etc., in the workplace. It has been over four decades now [since I received that advice], but I believe it was life-changing for me at a professional level and continues to be the same to date. I also learnt from Anand that a leader needs to be empathetic and not assume that everyone would have the same level of aspiration that a leader has. A leader should also be open to seeking feedback and incorporating it. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback The stars came out early on a Friday evening in March as Business Today celebrated the success and achievements of The Most Powerful Women in Business, with a host of women leaders at St. Regis Mumbai. Kicking off the evening’s proceedings was an agenda-setting discussion on ‘Leadership’s Female Quotient’, helmed by Tarun Khanna, Jorge Paulo Lemann Professor of Harvard Business School. Following it were several interesting discussions featuring Zia Mody, Co–founder and Managing Partner at AZB & Partners; Arundhati Bhattacharya, Chairperson and CEO of Salesforce India; Swati Piramal, Vice Chairperson of Piramal Group; and Nandita Das, Film-maker and Actor, among other eminent personalities from the fields of business, sports and entertainment, who held forth on the challenges faced by women at work and the ways to overcome them. Mamaearth Co-founder Ghazal Alagh; Sangita Reddy, Joint MD of Apollo Hospitals; HCL’s Roshni Nadar Malhotra; and SUGAR Cosmetics Co-founder and CEO Vineeta Singh were among the achievers honoured at the recent event to celebrate the 19th edition of BT MPW. The awards were given away by Union Minister Smriti Irani. The list of 55 trailblazing women winners represented both continuity and change as the evening saw nine debutantes, 31 repeat winners from last year and seven comebacks from earlier years, from fields as varied as textiles, pharma, entertainment, start-ups, finance and manufacturing, among others, take home the award. Three women—Nita Ambani of Reliance Foundation, Kaku Nakhate of Bank of America and Priya Nair of Unilever—who are seven-time winners of the award, entered BT’s prestigious MPW Hall of Fame, making way for newer entrants in the coming year. A highlight of the evening was the talk by actor-turned-politician Irani, Union Minister of Women & Child Development and Minister of Minority Affairs, on ‘Leveraging India’s Better Half for Economic & Social Growth’. The evening also saw Indian cricketers Jemimah Rodrigues and Harleen Deol break into a song at the end of their session called ‘Trailblazers: Cricket’s New Icons’; the panel also included former Indian cricketers Jhulan Goswami and Hrishikesh Kanitkar—who is also their coach. Started in 2003, Business Today was the first magazine to champion this glittering annual list of star women achievers in India. And here’s hoping that the coming years will see an even more diverse set of women grace the list. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

As one of the oldest courses in this part of the world, the greens here have a character of their own, much like the city it resides in. For instance, this is one golf course where walking is par for the course as golf carts are not allowed because they may damage the pristine greens. The tournament, held at the 18 hole, 70 par, 100-acre championship all-season golf course, saw participation from more than 100 corporate captains of Kolkata. The chief guest for the occasion was West Bengal Industry, Commerce and Enterprises Minister Shashi Panja, who felicitated the winners. The exclusive, invite-only tournament, of which this was the fifth and last leg for the 2022-23 season, is co-powered by Qatar Airways and Indian Oil XP 100 with Morris Garages as mobility partner and Rajasthan Tourism as tourism partner. As for the winners, Sheena Rawla, Interior Architect & Designer at The Colonial Design House, who tallied 30 points, won in the ladies category. Pavan Ghai, Director of Mojo Footwear and Partha S. Barman, Managing Director at Highstreet Securities, amassed 36 and 37 points, respectively, to be declared winners in the 0 to 14 handicap category and 15 to 24 handicap category, respectively. Presenting the awards to the winners, Minister Panja, a physician by training, said, “I can say with complete conviction that the Tollygunge Club, or the Tolly as we all know it, is one of the best and most exquisite golf courses in all of India. And West Bengal’s turf is as smooth as the grass at the Tolly, so I would say to the participants, do come back to this state of opportunity.” Amongst the winners of the individual prizes were Harmander Bindra, Director of processWare ERP, for the Straightest Drive; Satbinder Singh, Partner at Sen & Singh Engineers, for the Closest to Pin; and Jayanta Gohain, Head-Tea Excellence Centre of Hindustan Unilever, for the Longest Drive. Wrapping up the day’s and this season’s game play, Panja said, “P.G. Wodehouse said, ‘play golf with a man’—with all emphasis on gender neutrality here—‘to know his character’. We in West Bengal invite you all to do the same. And I must say BT Golf put up a most impressive show here today.” And like they say, it’s a birdie. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback More than a 100 corporate leaders took to the greens on a crisp Saturday morning this October to kick off the much-awaited Royal Ranthambore Business Today Golf 2023-24 tournament with panache. The season—which will see the tournament travelling to six more cities in the course of the next few months—could not have asked for a better start than the one it received at the Classic Golf and Country Club near Gurugram in Delhi-NCR on October 21. Apart from the corporate honchos who teed off that day were two former cricketers who were part of India’s World Cup-winning squads: Madan Lal from the team that won in 1983, and Suresh Raina, who was part of the winning team in 2011. Not just renowned cricketers (former player Murali Kartik was also present) but up and coming pro golfers like Aman Raj, currently No. 2 on the domestic PGTI Rankings, were also present to cheer the players on and share their insights on the players’ game. The expanded tournament’s first leg—that had a full house and perfect autumn weather—witnessed close competition among the 120 golfers who participated. Pooja Ahluwalia, Director of Ahluwalia Dream Developers; Mahaveer Singhvi, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs; and Rajiv Kumar Pandey, Director General of Audit (Central Expenditure) in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department emerged as winners in the ladies, 0-14 Men’s handicap, and 15-24 Men’s handicap categories, respectively. With tight competition being witnessed in the Men’s 15-24 handicap section, Pandey won based on the performance in the last six holes after he was tied with Ravinesh Kumar, Chief Administrative Officer of Indian Railways, on 46 points. Ahluwalia topped the ladies category with 34 points, while Singhvi won the Men’s 0-14 handicap section with 46 points, ahead of Siddharth Sangwan, MD-Talent at Lightspeed India, who secured 44 points. Going forward, Qatar Airways will co-power the seven-city season that will wrap up in March 2024. Bandhan Mutual Fund will support the tournament as its investment partner, Darwin Platform Group of Companies as conglomerate partner, O3+ as gifting partner, and MG Motor India as the driving force for the tournament. While the first leg also saw the likes of Deshant Kaila, MD of PepsiCo GBS India; Anubhav Jain, CEO of Silverglades; Pankaj Tandon, CEO and Joint MD of Jakson Group (EPC Business); Vineet Sharma, Head of Product Management-Trade at IndusInd Bank; Anmol Puri, Partner at Deloitte; Rajesh Sud, MD-Financial Services at Bharti Enterprises; and Anuj Dayal, Executive Director at Delhi Metro Rail Corporation tee off in the hunt for honours and on-course prizes, the upcoming games promise to be as exciting as the one that just concluded, if not more.

    "article_content": "Feedback Away from the hustle and bustle of the City of Joy on a balmy Saturday morning, more than a hundred golfers assembled at the historic Tollygunge Club in the posh southern part of Kolkata to compete on the greens. The city had been drenched in showers a day before, but the skies were clear when the first golfers ambled in at 6:45 in the morning to register for the exclusive and invite-only Royal Ranthambore Business Today Golf 2023-24’s Kolkata leg of the tournament. By the time they teed off at 8 am, it was bright and sunny, and all the participants were pumped up and ready for action. Over the next few hours, they showcased their golfing chops in the sun, displaying great competitive spirit and camaraderie. Even though most in the field were familiar with the twists and turns of the Tolly Club’s 18-hole, 70-par, 100-acre championship all-season course, which was originally started as a plantation, they still had to contend with its quick greens and strategically placed pins, along with the multiple hazards scattered across the fairways and, of course, the intense heat and humidity. The draw was heavily dominated by corporate leaders such as Amit Bhowmik, Head of Procurement-RSE & Asean & South Asia of Linde India; Hitesh Gurtu, Head of Marketing-South Asia at Linde India; Murali Ganesan, Executive VP & Head of Audit of ITC Ltd; Gaurav Soneja, GM of ITC Royal Bengal; Ranabir Chatterjee, VP-Deliver & SHEQ-South Asia of Praxair India; Joydeep Datta Gupta, Senior Director, Deloitte Touche Tomahatsu India; Sunil Jha, MD of Shristi Infrastructure Development Corp.; and Arnab Basu, Leader Advisory and Regional Managing Partner, PwC India. There were others as well, such as B. Sumant, Director of ITC Ltd; Harsh Pal Singh, Vice President-Marketing, Residential Sales, Shristi Infrastructure Development Corp.; Vijay Jacob Parakkal, Senior Vice President & Managing Partner, Wunderman Thompson; and Sanjeev Mehra, Senior Vice President, RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group. Finally, after four hours of play, Oona Khanna, Nutritionist & Health Coach; A.K. Sareen, former MD of Ceratizit India; and Dinesh Agarwal, Partner, EY, emerged as the winners in the ladies, 0-14 Men’s handicap and 15-24 Men’s handicap categories, respectively. West Bengal Industry, Commerce and Enterprises Minister Shashi Panja, who graced the event as the chief guest, felicitated the winners and said, the city is in the grip of a sports wave. “It’s a season full of sport for us. We have a cricket World Cup match here tomorrow so the flavour of the season is sports, sports and sports, and golf is not very far behind,” she said. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback After almost a year, BT Golf returned to the City of Pearls for the Hyderabad leg of the 2023-24 season. The exclusive and invite-only event saw close to a hundred golfers hitting the links on a balmy Saturday (November 18, 2023) morning at the Boulder Hills Golf and Country Club. Nestled amidst the offices of global IT giants like Infosys and Microsoft, the 18-hole championship course is considered one of the toughest in the country. Strategically located natural boulders and the presence of water bodies throughout the course provided ample challenges for the corporate warriors, even though many were familiar with the course. Over the next few hours, the who’s who of Hyderabad’s corporate world took on each other at the greens, showcasing their prowess with a putter and a club in a competitive display of camaraderie that had everyone in attendance wishing for an encore. Finally, psychiatrist Swetha Gullapalli (32 points) emerged as the winner of the Hyderabad leg of Royal Ranthambore BT Golf 2023-24 in the ladies’ category, while Vasu Merugu, VP-Product & Analytics at Head Digital Works, won the award in the 0–14 men’s handicap category and Vidyasagar (33 points) won in the 15–24 men’s handicap category. Syed Akbaruddin, India’s former Permanent Representative to the UN and currently the Dean of the Kautilya School of Public Policy, was the chief guest and gave away the prizes. Speaking at the post-event presentation, he said, “I came to Hyderabad thinking I would retire and play golf, but I see that the young people have done much better than me. So, perhaps it fits in better while you are active and tired, and retired players like me don’t do very well, so congratulations to all of you. Hyderabad is a boom town, and golf is also booming here.” Among the other players who teed off on Saturday in the iconic city of the Charminar and Golconda Fort were Srinivasa Rao Aluri of QuNu Labs, Vinayak Reddy Chintapally of JPMorgan, Anil Yamani of OSI Digital, Q-Mart’s B.V.K. Raju, Deepak Gullapalli of Head Digital Works, Murali Bukkapatnam of Volksy Technologies, A.V.N. Reddy of Roshni Crop Sciences, and Ravi S. Athmakuri of Lemongrass Consulting.

    "article_content": "Feedback Varun Gupta, 33, travels frequently for work. But the Co-founder of home-grown wearables brand Boult makes it a point to also plan for weekend getaways during work trips—whether he is in Europe, the US or China. Of all the places he has explored till date, the Alps in Europe are his favourite. “It seamlessly combines everything I hold dear in my travels—from the intricate charm of historical architecture to the awe-inspiring beauty of nature. The European Alps, with their harmonious blend of artistic allure and breathtaking landscapes, have a way of enchanting every fibre of my being,” says Gupta, who also loves strumming the guitar. But more than architecture, the Alps provide the perfect playground for this adrenaline junkie. From thrilling ski runs to heart-pounding snowboarding adventures, the snow-covered slopes offer an exhilarating experience that complements Gupta’s love for adventure sports. “The sheer rush of gliding down the powdery slopes amidst the stunning alpine vistas is unmatched,” says Gupta, a sports enthusiast who got into adventure sports while studying for his MBA. Not just mountains, Gupta loves beaches as well. His travels in Southeast Asia introduced him to water sports—from scuba diving and snorkelling to kayaking—each fostering a deep connection with the serene beauty of the ocean. But snow sports are his first love. Snow sports have taken Gupta to numerous breathtaking locations, such as the majestic Hampta Pass in the Himalayas. “The awe-inspiring vistas and the sheer physical challenge of these mountainous terrains serve as a testament to my resilience and unwavering determination,” says Gupta. The beauty of skiing, he adds, lies in its simplicity, where all that’s needed are a pair of snow blades and boots. And, he adds, a delicate balance of calculated risk and physical prowess, which keep his senses sharp and spirit invigorated. As a skiing destination, Gulmarg—with its majestic slopes and unparalleled beauty—holds a special place in his heart. “Unlike many European counterparts where costs can quickly escalate, Gulmarg provides an economical yet exhilarating skiing experience that remains accessible to a broader spectrum of adventure seekers,” he says. @nidhisingal Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback Swimming with Sharks The idea of coming face to face with one of nature’s most agile predators may not be everyone’s idea of a New Year celebration but make ‘overcoming your fears’ your New Year resolution and jump in. To be honest, swimming with sharks is actually much safer than you think. You can either scuba dive with sharks in many parts of the world or swim with sharks in cage diving, where swimmers are put in protective cages that sharks are not able to penetrate. Some popular destinations include Hawaii, South Africa, Australia and the Bahamas. In front of a massive bonfire The Dutch love their bonfires and on New Year’s Eve, the towns of Scheveningen and Duindrop compete to build the world’s largest bonfire. The locals begin to assemble wood a few days ahead of time to prepare for the massive conflagration. Bonfires have been a large part of Icelandic culture since the Middle Ages and are also well-known in Reykjavik. So go ahead, kick off 2024 in front of the world’s largest or second-largest bonfire in the Netherlands. Running a Midnight Race If your New Year resolution is to get more fit, there is no better way to start the year than running a midnight race. The New York Road Runners organise a four-mile run at Central Park on New Year’s Eve. There’s music and dancing for everyone leading up to the race which kicks off at 11:59 pm and is accompanied by a fireworks show. You will have plenty of company with approximately 4,000 runners and even more spectators, many donning costumes. Or you could run the Shrewsbury Midnight Run in the UK. First place to welcome the New Year While Sydney, Australia, receives the lion’s share of media attention for having one of the first celebrations of the new year, it is Tonga, which is the first country in the world where the New Year dawns. Made up of more than 170 South Pacific islands, the main island is Tongatapu, a coral island with plenty of sandy beaches. Go for snorkelling, island hopping and sea kayaking in the protected lagoon. Oh! and when you see the first dawn of the New Year, don’t forget to greet others by saying, “Ofa kemou ma’u ha ta’ufo’ou monu’ia”— Tongan for Happy New Year! Last place to welcome the New Year Just over 500 miles away from Tonga, be among the last to welcome 2024 in American Samoa. Technically, the clock will last strike midnight on Baker Island in the South Pacific. However, Baker Island is uninhabited, so you’ll need to celebrate an hour earlier in American Samoa. Charter a flight between Tonga and American Samoa and you can celebrate New Year twice on the same day! Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback A qualified chartered accountant and a corporate finance leader, Vinay Swamy, Country Head of learning company Pearson India, keeps a busy schedule. Yet, he has figured out ways to keep himself focussed and pumped up through the work week by spending his ‘me time’ doing something that delights him. For starters, he spends his mornings relaxing in his terrace garden. And every other week, he indulges himself by baking cakes. Baking, he says, helps him to unwind, connect with his family, and create memories with them. For this baking enthusiast, the journey started in 2014, when he decided to turn his love of baking into a meaningful pursuit. And for that, he enrolled in a certification course at the Bengaluru-based Institute of Baking & Cake Art. “This allowed me to bake a strawberry cake for my mother-in-law’s 60th birthday. It’s been 10 years now, and she still recalls it as one of the best cakes she has ever had,” Swamy says with a smile. The Pearson India boss says his ardour for baking has also played a pivotal role in his parenting journey. He recalls how he began baking delectable chocolate cakes nearly every week for his wife when his younger daughter Maanya was on the way. “This not only heightened my love for baking, but it also became a medium to craft some of my most cherished memories,” he says, adding that now, every moment spent baking with his children is a treasure for him. Not only do these baking sessions bring them closer, he says, but they also give him an opportunity to impart vital life skills to his children. For him, it’s a fun way of forging connections and cultivating endearing memories, and at the same time sharing in the sheer delight of baking a delicious cake. Swamy says that the true joy of baking is not just in the end product, but in the process of making a cake. It’s a meticulous process that requires careful planning and foresight, which Swamy says, has helped him organise his life better. “When I engage in baking, I meticulously plan my entire day in advance, detailing every step necessary for a successful outcome. This practice of crafting a comprehensive to-do list has significantly improved my ability to organise and manage my time,” he says. Patience and an acute attention to detail are the other by-products of baking that he has gleaned. Swamy believes that experiential learning is the best way to learn and grow in any task as it allows you to practice in a controlled environment. “The idea of enrolling in an immersive five-day course was exactly this. Gain knowledge by experimenting with recipes, share ideas with the fellow participants, and create recipes first-hand. The hands-on learning experience enabled me to explore more ingredients, and grasp their nuances more effectively.” Over the years, Swamy’s baking chops have evolved to include a wide repertoire of delectable treats. And he has gained a well-deserved reputation for his mastery of crafting sumptuous chocolate cakes, a skill that even his family holds in high regard. Talk to him about his choicest recipes, and he is all smiles talking about them. “I’ve got classic favourites like chocolate cake and banana walnut cake. I’ve also created healthier options like eggless and wheat flour-based cakes. But the most important thing—that makes my baking special—is the love and happiness I put into every single thing I make. Each baked treat isn’t just food; it’s a way for me to share the happiness this skill brings into my life.” Other than a medium to plan, bond with loved ones, and create memorable family moments, baking is a creative outlet for Swamy that fosters relaxation and enables him to channel his energies positively. With the modest investment in learning, acquiring an oven and essential baking tools, he has not just managed to create delightful treats for his family and friends, but also found a delicious way to share warmth and joy with them on countless Sunday mornings. @nidhisingal Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback I love people-watching on visits to foreign shores, whether it is the morning rush hour commute on the subway, or the hordes of people who stop to grab a sandwich at lunch hour—just regular people going about their business without bothering with some tourists gaping at them. But gape I do, and I see everything from high heels to sneakers, from fitted skirts to pant suits, from suits to jackets to hoodies. But what I don’t see enough of anymore are ties. It’s the same story in corporate India. The tie, that essential bit of clothing for corporate dressing that could take a backseat only on Fridays, when it was considered fine to be casually dressed, is no longer considered a must. “I have around 50 ties. Some exceptional ones are from brands like Versace and Paul Smith and others are unique and quirky. They all have two things in common—they are beautiful and useless,” says Delhi-based banker Aman Khanna. He has been working in the banking industry for over two decades and laments the time when dressing up for work definitely meant adorning one of his precious ties. “Banking has been a conservative industry as far as dressing is concerned, but even that is now changing, with the tie no longer considered compulsory.” There was a time when the tie was a de facto part of everyday dressing. But it has been losing ground for years, between the advent of casual Fridays, the work-from-home (WFH) days of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the blurring of lines between our personal and professional lives. The likes of Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg, with their turtlenecks/sweatshirt and jeans, have a role to play in that. Take a look at global movers and shakers from the past couple of decades, and you will find that fewer and fewer have gone fully formal. Virgin Group Founder and billionaire Richard Branson has eschewed ties for years, as have Jeff Bezos and even Bill Gates. Tie-free world leaders include US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, along with former UK PM Boris Johnson, and the Italian and Japanese prime ministers, who all abandoned silk ties for the official portrait at the G7 summit in Germany in 2022—marking the first time in 40 years this had happened. Barack Obama set the precedent as President, when he preferred the tie-less-rolled-up-sleeves look at the White House, except for formal occasions. In the corporate world, even before the WFH days of the pandemic, in 2019, Goldman Sachs, historically known as a white-shoe investment bank, with its bankers in bespoke suits and ties, issued an internal memo relaxing the dress code for all its employees. How significant this move was became evident from the fact that it was carried as news by leading international publications, as it was once considered unimaginable for the Wall Street firm. It was done to bring the bank’s traditional policies up to date for its younger workforce—nearly 75% of Goldman employees are Gen Z, or Millennials. Today, it is comfort that wins over stiff corporate attire, and that’s true not only for the younger generation but also for those who have been working in the corporate sector for a long time. “I wear ties nowadays for events as statement clothing. The work environment today is more about performance and less about formality. It’s the mental ease,” says Sharad Gautam, a senior executive with a leading global alco-bev company. Agrees Aman Vohra, a management consultant-turned digital content creator: “In today’s dynamic work culture, where flexibility and personal expression are increasingly valued, the once rigid dress codes have been relaxed, allowing individuals to explore a wider range of styles.” Of course, the tie will always be a part of a man’s wardrobe. But has it been reduced to a special events-only garment? A relic of tradition and redolent with historical meaning but not relevancy? Even Ermenegildo Zegna, Chief Executive of Zegna, has given up on ties. “Let me be clear: the suit is not dead,” Zegna said at a luxury conference in May 2022. “But the tie is!” “Although ties still hold significance in certain professional settings and events, I feel that more or less, their usage seems to be very limited. They will definitely remain a symbol of elegance and sophistication in menswear, but customers have started leaning towards ties as formal or else occasion wear, though to me it signifies old world elegance and unmatched style,” says designer Varun Bahl. In India, the rise of Indian wear at formal occasions is also impacting the wearing of ties. “Over the years, I have realised that a smart bandhgala is far more comfortable and chic,” says 47-year-old PR professional Sayantan Sinha. Agrees digital content creator, Riaan George: “We are not wearing ties even on formal occasions as in India a lot of us have adopted the bandi (Nehru) jacket instead of the blazer. Even Air India and Vistara have ditched the ties for their male attendants, replacing them with bandi jackets.” While looking around us, we may feel that the tie is losing its significance in men’s fashion, it hasn’t impacted sales. As per research firm Verified Market Reports, the size of the global ties market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% to $261.78 million by 2030 from $153.5 million in 2023. At the end of the day, you choose to tie or not to tie! @smitabw Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback In the heart of Khalid Wani, who is the Senior Director of Sales for the India region at the American storage drive maker, Western Digital, beats the rhythm of a fervent traveller. He’s a man who believes passionately that the most precious memories are forged on the road, under distant skies. Although his life is bound by the dictates of a corporate environment, whenever there is time, Wani sets off on impromptu expeditions, especially on his trusty bikes, carrying him to destinations both near and far. For Wani, travel is more than just a journey; it’s an odyssey of discovery shared with family and friends. Each mile traversed, each new horizon reached, holds within it the promise of unforgettable moments. And Wani is careful to treat these memories as priceless treasures, woven into the fabric of life, something to be cherished for all time. If you ask the soft-spoken Wani, he becomes philosophical every time the topic of his adventures are broached.“Every trip of mine, especially if it’s a motorcycle expedition, means that you live on minimal possessions and rely on essentials. I believe this experience effectively leads to a greater appreciation for a simpler life and the importance of experiences over material possessions,” Wani says. And yet, although his wanderlust has taken him to many destinations, Wani says that there’s no place better than Kashmir. He particularly highlights the Gurez Valley, a mere five to six hours from Srinagar, where the mesmerising emerald green Kishanganga river flows through the region. “[It] is a spectacle that you need to witness once in your life and not to forget the small hamlets and villages in Gurez. It’s so peaceful there,” he says. While Kashmir holds the top spot in Wani’s list, his second favourite riding destination is the US. He fondly recalls the US as a dream destination for motorcyclists, boasting of numerous amazing destinations and routes that are waiting to be explored. Among his unforgettable experiences is a ride along the Californian coast, which includes traversing through Yosemite Park and visiting Lake Tahoe. Wani finds biking trips even more enjoyable when shared with close friends, enhancing the experience. “My preference is riding with a few friends, as it adds a wonderful social element to the journey. In fact, we have a tight-knit group called ‘Ride for Food.’ Our primary agenda is to explore new destinations while indulging in the quest for the best food joints around,” he says. Wani’s biking adventures are quite frequent, occurring once or twice a month, depending on the season. Each trip becomes a unique exploration, combining the thrill of biking with the joy of discovering hidden culinary gems. “The camaraderie within our group enhances the overall experience, turning every ride into a memorable and enjoyable event,” he adds. But although he loves bikes in general, there is a special place in his heart for a Harley-Davidson and in his personal collection he owns a Sportster, a Roadking, and for the tougher terrains he rides on the Royal Enfield Himalayan at the moment. Now, he has his eyes set on the Harley-Davidson Pan America, which he rode when in the US. “It’s too expensive an affair to transport my bike to every destination, so renting is the best way forward. Over the years I have experienced Triumph Tiger 900, Harley-Davidson Pan America, Harley-Davidson Street Glide, Royal Enfield 500 /350 and even those 100cc [bikes] for my trips across the Far East,” he says. But while riding a bike, be it in India or abroad, he insists on wearing a US-certified DOT (Department of Transportation) helmet and riding gear for his safety. Wani also carries his GoPro with 1TB of storage to capture the entire experience of his journey. @nidhisingal Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback Flip through café menus in hipster neighbourhoods or browse through fancy grocery stores, and you are likely to find an abundance of kombucha flavours, making you wonder what this distinctly tart, bubbly beverage is all about. While kombucha is relatively new to India, having been introduced only a few years ago, this sour, slightly effervescent drink, which is a fermented beverage made from tea and sugar, dates back to 220 BC! While the precise origin of kombucha is slightly hazy, the first recipes are believed to have originated during the early Qin Dynasty in China. A couple of centuries later, a Korean doctor reportedly brought the method for kombucha production across the sea to Japan, where he served on the court of Ingyo, Japan’s 19th emperor, and lauded the virtues of the drink. “The story goes that the Japanese emperor was cured of various illnesses by drinking this magical tea. The Korean doctor’s name was Kombu, and so it was called Kombu-cha (Kombu’s tea),” says 45-year-old Aman Bhatia, Co-founder of Natural Superfoods LLB, which produces the brand Raw Kombucha. Bhatia and his friend Alankar Sharma (both software engineers) set up the company in 2019 when, on returning to India from the US, Bhatia realised there was a market for the product that is considered to have several health benefits. Of course, the Covid-19 pandemic put a stop to their plans. “We properly started marketing only in 2022. Since then, we have seen tremendous growth,” says Bhatia, who sells 20,000 units a month and hopes to increase it to 50,000 units monthly this financial year. The brand is available in both bottles (`99 for 250 ml; six flavours) and cans (`110 for 250 ml; three flavours). The most popular bottled flavours are lemon & ginger and lavender with blue tea, while passion fruit is popular in the can category. Besides being available online on Amazon, JioMart, etc., Bhatia also supplies to various F&B outlets in Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Jodhpur, Jaipur and Mysuru, amongst others. “There is demand from smaller towns because of international tourists,” he explains, saying that in India, it is gaining traction primarily in metros. Conventionally, kombucha is made using brewed black or green tea and sucrose. To prepare kombucha, bacteria and yeast in the form of a SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast)—a biofilm of microorganisms including acetic acid bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts—are added to the tea and sugar mixture and left to ferment. Different brands ferment for different periods. Bhatia, for instance, ferments in two cycles of 7-10 days each. “The fermentation produces a beverage rich in antioxidants, digestive enzymes, good bacteria and amino acids,” he says. The final product contains less than 1 per cent sugar. “Kombucha is a fermented food, full of antioxidants and probiotics that helps boost gut health and improve our immunity, making the body more efficient,” says Kavita Devgan, a Delhi-based nutritionist and author of books such as The Don’t Diet Plan and The Immunity Diet. “Better gut health also helps one lose weight and cut inflammation in the body, which helps cut the risk of multiple disorders,” she adds. But in the end, it all boils down to taste. “Our mango flavour is our biggest seller,” says Ashraf Ahmed, Marketing Lead at Goa-based Latambarcem Brewers, which sells the brand Borécha (meaning good tea in Konkani). The company, founded by brothers Ishan and Aneesh Varshnei, also manufactures Maka Di Beer. They started brewing kombucha in 2020 when having returned from the US, they were unable to find any kombucha brands in India. Today Borécha is available pan-India in six low-sugar and four zero-sugar varieties in 330 ml cans (`160). While their low-sugar flavours (containing 3 gm of sugar per 100 ml) such as mango and Hawaiian passion fruit contain probiotics, the zero-sugar flavours such as Fiji fruit punch contain prebiotics. The brand is available pan-India through online retail and at F&B outlets and airports in metro cities such as Delhi NCR, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, amongst others. You can enjoy it on Akasa Airlines and it recently set up a vending machine at Ashoka University. “There is a growing demand among the young and health-conscious,” says Ahmed. According to market research firm The Brainy Insights, the size of the global kombucha market is projected to grow to $9.60 billion by 2030 from $2.71 billion in 2021, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.1 per cent. The growth is primarily due to the adoption of a healthy lifestyle. So, is kombucha just a trend? “No, because it is about your gut health, and health can never be a trend,” says 40-year-old Isha Singh Sawhney, Founder of Bhu Kombucha. The New Delhi-based company offers nine flavours (at `250 a bottle), including the best-selling apple and cinnamon, and apricot. Sawhney started brewing kombucha at home in 2017 for herself after her uncle carted a batch of SCOBY for her from the US. “I think of myself as an accidental entrepreneur,” she laughs. A year later, she started stocking it at organic cafes in Delhi and slowly the business grew. Today Bhu is available in grocery stores and cafes in Mumbai, Pune, Goa, Lucknow, and Bengaluru, amongst others. She also has three collaborations, including with wellness resort Ananda In the Himalayas for whom she brews a special kombucha, which is honey fermented instead of sucrose. With a large number of other players such as Happy Booch, Atmosphere, Khukrain’s Kombucha, etc., supplying in different parts of the country, looks like the healthy fermented tea beverage is here to stay. @smitabw Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback The Douro River Valley, a meandering, terraced region that produces Portugal’s beloved port wine, is one of the country’s most charming areas. However, unlike the Rhine, Loire and numerous other major rivers in Europe, the Douro has never served as a strategic military site. And so, while driving through the winding roads, you are more likely to come across farms and sleepy villages rather than castles and stony ramparts. In fact, the only thing fortified here is the wine! But why does wine need to be fortified? Call it a happy accident or necessity being the mother of all inventions, it was originally fortified to prevent it from getting ruined on its arduous journey across the ocean to England. In the late 1700s, it became increasingly common to add some brandy—essentially a young, clear neutral spirit distilled from wine—during fermentation. This stopped the process before all the natural sweetness of the grape juice was converted into alcohol. Since wine was no longer fermenting, it ensured it never spoiled. However, a happy result of that was that you got a sweet, distinct, flavourful wine which became all the rage in England. Since it was being shipped from the city of Porto, it came to be called port wine. While there are 14 demarcated wine-producing regions in Portugal, the Douro Valley is the only one legally allowed to produce port wine—thanks to the Marquês de Pombal, who demarcated the region in 1756. Think of it a bit like the Champagne region of France. So, it’s not surprising that historically the region has focussed on the production of port; however, over the past century local vineyards have started producing other wines too. It’s this expanding offering that led the region to be named European Wine City in 2023. There are several wine tours from Porto (Portugal’s second-largest city) to the Douro Valley. It’s around a two-and-a-half-hour drive from the city, and a full-day tour typically includes a visit to a couple of historic quintas (wine estates)—there are over 200 of those—and a cruise on the river. I visit a small boutique estate called Quinta de Santa Julia from 1596. It produces only 200,000 bottles of wine every year, along with 20,000 bottles of olive oil, which happens to be one of Portugal’s largest exports. Here wine is still produced the traditional way—with grapes being stomped by foot. In fact, I find out that to make the finest port, many vineyards continue to do so. Machines break the grape seeds, releasing too many tannins, which makes the port bitter, my guide tells me. On the other hand, soft feet against stone keep the seeds intact. During harvest time (mid-September through early October), the grapes are poured into big granite tubs called lagares. A team of two dozen stompers line up across from each other, put their arms on each other’s shoulders, and march, military-style, to crush the grapes. The stomping can last three to four days. In fact, tourists are invited to join in, so if you happen to visit during the harvest season, do give wine-stomping a chance. But be warned that your legs will turn purple for at least a week! Another unique feature of the Douro Valley is that there is no artificial irrigation. The valley is spread across 250,000 acres, of which 45,000 acres are vineyards, producing some 80 different types of grapes. While the lion’s share of the harvest is set aside for the four different types of port wine—ruby, tawny, white and rosé—grapes are also being used for table wines. Driving through the region you enjoy steep, twisting valleys and neat terraces as far as the eye can see. Depending on when you visit, the hillside can shift in colour, from dull brown in winter to bright green in summer to glowing red and gold in fall. My next port of call is a store that specialises in Vintage Port—the most expensive and prestigious member of the port family. Though accounting for just a fraction of total port production, Vintage Port is the Douro Valley’s flagship style, produced only from a single vineyard in an exceptional year. It is produced from the best grapes, and samples are submitted to the Institute of Douro and Porto Wine two years after harvest. After being tested (and tasted) for quality assessment, vintage declarations are made. Vintage Port spends a short time ageing in the barrel—only two to three years—and is then bottled with the sediments. That is why its minimum bottle-ageing period is considered to be 15 years. The finest examples age well over 50 years. They continue to age in the bottle without getting ruined. The last Vintage was declared in 2016. It is thought that the first Vintage Port was made in 1775. Prices for these exceptional wines can shoot through the roof. “There is a saying in Portugal: buy some bottles of Vintage Port, forget about them for 50 years, and then sell them and buy a boat,” laughs my guide. “An apocalypse can happen, but there is no way that a Vintage Port is losing value,” she adds. So, if you happen to be in the Douro Valley, pick yourself a bottle of Vintage Port as an investment. Me? I just admire a bottle from 1885 for 90,000 euros, and wonder if anyone is actually going to drink it. ￼ @smitabw Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback If food was fashion, then it would be called Gaggan,” declares the menu at the swanky new Gaggan Anand restaurant called Gaggan at Louis Vuitton, nestled within the recently opened LV The Place Bangkok, a majestic edifice along Ploenchit Road in the Thai capital. This latest venture by the French fashion powerhouse promises guests an immersive journey into the maison’s universe, complete with a tech-driven exhibition, a chic patisserie, an expansive retail space and a one-of-a-kind fine-dining experience crafted in collaboration with maverick chef Anand. Since its grand unveiling in March, the sleek 40-seater restaurant has been fully booked, with reservations for its 17-course tasting menu, priced at 8,000 bahts (around Rs 18,500), pouring in from Louis Vuitton’s HNI client base. Anand, arguably the most well-known Indian chef in the world, is no stranger to running high-profile or booked-out restaurants. With two Michelin stars to his credit and a four-year stint atop the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list, his culinary journey has been well-documented, including an episode on Netflix’s Chef’s Table, which earned an Emmy nomination. But this collaboration with LV is unlike anything he has done before. Every aspect of the restaurant, from its decor to its tableware, has undergone meticulous scrutiny and approval from the LVMH headquarters in Paris. LV’s iconic motifs grace everything from plates and glasses to staff uniforms, even manifesting in the form of embossed ice cubes. Meanwhile, the chef, known for his quirky fashion sense, has undergone a noticeable transformation, appearing trimmer and clad in a bespoke “greige” ensemble crafted by the fashion house, perfectly complementing the restaurant’s upscale ambiance. What truly sets this collaboration apart is its sheer audacity. The menu showcases Anand’s signature dishes, now presented with a dash of LV flair. From the “Yoghurt Explosion” delicately perched on a base shaped like the brand’s monogram to the “Damier Momo,” a mushroom dumpling adorned with the iconic Damier print, each creation is a testament to the fusion of cuisine and couture. However, in classic Anand style, there’s a playful twist; with creations like the “Patrani Macchi” wrapped in an LV-embossed banana leaf, theatrically torched table-side setting the brand logo ablaze, and “Lick It Up,” a dish served without cutlery, compelling diners to pick up and lick their plates clean. While Anand’s unorthodox culinary style may seem at odds with LV’s conservative heritage, it is precisely this amalgamation of contrasting cultures that breathes an electrifying vitality into the restaurant. But why did LV opt to collaborate with Anand? Part of the rationale lies in LV’s recent penchant for unconventional partnerships, spanning trendy streetwear labels like Supreme and eccentric artists like Yayoi Kusama and Takashi Murakami, alongside their choice of new-age Creative Directors like Pharrell Williams and the late Virgil Abloh. Additionally, there’s an acknowledgment that food holds a certain allure. Chefs are the new icons and aligning with their persona allows fashion brands to resonate with diverse demographics and entice potential consumers. The Anand-LV venture represents just one instance of fashion intersecting with food. Many luxury brands have ventured into culinary collaborations, such as Chanel’s glitzy Beige restaurant led by chef Alain Ducasse in Tokyo, and Dior’s upcoming Monsieur Dior restaurant in Japan, helmed by chef Anne-Sophie Pic. Meanwhile, Giorgio Armani boasts its own F&B vertical, with more than 20 outlets, including restaurants and cafes worldwide. One particularly successful fusion of fashion and food is Gucci’s partnership with celebrity chef Massimo Bottura. In 2018, Bottura was brought on board to set up Gucci Osteria, a contemporary Italian eatery nestled adjacent to the Gucci Garden and boutique in the heart of Florence. The concept aimed to blend the sophistication and innovation of two iconic Italian brands, offering guests haute cuisine that lived up to Bottura’s culinary reputation within a setting tastefully curated by Gucci. Initially, the restaurant attracted diners who were eager to experience Bottura’s culinary genius. Those unable to secure a table at his three Michelin-starred Osteria Francescana, could dine at Gucci Osteria for less than half the cost. But, over time, Karime Lopez, head chef at the restaurant, crafted her own culinary identity, developing a loyal following and drawing in guests for her own distinctive creations. This experiment proved so successful that the restaurant was awarded a Michelin star the following year. Gucci went on to open three more such restaurants in cities such as Tokyo, Seoul and Los Angeles, two of which also subsequently earned Michelin stars. Gucci’s collaboration with Bottura, both strategic and personal, leveraged the childhood friendship between former CEO Marco Bizzarri and the famous chef in a mutually beneficial manner. Bottura’s deep personal commitment to the project elevated the Gucci Osteria brand into an extension of his famed Osteria Francescana, maintaining the same exceptional standards of food and service. He personally selected and mentored chefs such as Lopez and Takahiko Kondo, Antonio Iacoviello, Mattia Agazzi and Hyungkyu Jun to lead the various branches worldwide. And the triumph of Gucci’s collaboration with Bottura epitomises the seamless fusion of haute couture and haute cuisine. So, will fashion brands continue to be a part of the culinary industry in the years to come? My guess is yes. Food has become the ultimate fashion statement, and the haute couture revolution in the kitchen is just getting started. ￼ @RaajSanghvi Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback Great Ocean Road – Twelve Apostles Embark on a scenic four-hour drive from Melbourne along the Great Ocean Road (considered one of the most picturesque drives in the world) and arrive at the stunning Twelve Apostles—a collection of limestone stacks off the shore of Port Campbell National Park. These mammoth structures rise from the sea and are best viewed from above—in a helicopter! A 16-minute ride costs AUD$165 per person while a 25-minute ride is for AUD$245 per person. While they were once connected to the mainland cliff, centuries of erosion has left them isolated from the shore, making them appear as lone majestic warriors. While there, visit Gibson Steps and climb down 86 stairs to the white sandy beach, surf or simply enjoy a walk along the soft sand with the cliff as your constant companion. Insider tip: There are only eight apostles still standing, the others having been eroded. Port Campbell is the nearest town and has some great accommodation in terms of hotels and camping sites. Ballarat Wildlife Park This is one experience you are unlikely to forget in a hurry. An hour and a half drive from Melbourne is the Ballarat Wildlife Park, that allows you to get up, close and personal with some of Australia’s most famous native animals. Think hand-feeding kangaroos (who are friendly enough to surround you as long as you have enough snacks for them), petting koalas, and interacting with wombats and emus. You also get a chance to see the world’s smallest penguin species, crocodiles and Siberian tigers. Insider tip: The Koala encounter costs AUD$55 per person and you can pat the koala but the local state law bans you from holding or carrying it. THE LUME Melbourne THE LUME Melbourne is quite unlike any other art gallery, as here you can engage in an immersive dining experience surrounded by art. Currently, it has an exhibition of Leonardo Da Vinci’s works. You get to experience pages from his notebooks, machine inventions brought to life from his sketches, an exact 360-degree replica of the ‘Mona Lisa’, AI and VR technologies that bring his iconic works to life, and a digital experience spanning his incredible life story. But it is the Renaissance-themed dining experiences that are most memorable. These specially-ticketed events involve a three-course meal by a celebrity chef, surrounded by the iconic figures of Da Vinci’s ‘The Last Supper’. Insider tip: The next meal is on June 20 by Chef Johnny Di Franscesco, priced at AUD$295 per person and can be booked online. Bellarine and Geelong Wine Region While Yarra Valley is the more popular wine region in Southern Australia, the Bellarine and Geelong region punches way above its weight, producing a series of award-winning wines such as Chardonnay and Shiraz. It takes just over an hour from Melbourne to reach the wine country. Stop at any of the 40-odd winemakers and enjoy a tasting. Many also have cafes and restaurants where you can unwind over great food and of course, wine! Walk through the vineyards, go on a tour of the cellar or simply indulge in some great wine. Insider tip: The wine tasting itself is quite reasonably priced at around AUD$20 for 12-14 wines, but if you don’t have a sober driver with you, you are better off booking a wine tour from Melbourne which can cost up to AUD$200 per person. While in the region, also taste craft beer and gin. The Q Train Dining on The Q Train—Australia’s premier rail restaurant—is quite an experience. The train travels along the historic and scenic Bellarine Railway—between Drysdale and Queenscliff. Drive down one and half hours to Drysdale from Melbourne and board The Q Train. Over the next three hours, enjoy a five-course meal on board, where each dish showcases local produce and ingredients accompanied with Australian (specifically Victorian) wine, beer, and cocktails (drinks have to be paid for separately). All meals are freshly cooked in the train’s kitchen and there is also a vegetarian option, provided you book it in advance. The train stops briefly at Queenscliff, where you can get down to stretch your legs before it makes its way back to Drysdale. The experience including the meal costs AUD$139 per person.

    "article_content": "Feedback India took 60 years to become a $1-trillion economy in 2007, reaching $2.7 trillion by 2018. In the decade spanning 2018 to 2028 it is poised to witness a remarkable transformation, with a projected doubling of its nominal GDP to $5.94 trillion by 2028, becoming the third-largest economy in the world. This translates to creating and adding one “new” India to the current one, presenting an unparalleled opportunity for investors and businesses to join this burgeoning economic miracle. Intrinsic to this is the pace of growth. By compounding at a high rate on a large base means that India is one of only three economies in the world that can generate more than $400 billion in annual economic output, which will rise to more than $500 billion from 2028. India’s rise today resembles China’s path over 2007-2011 when its nominal GDP grew from $3.55 trillion to $7.55 trillion, although at a slower pace. Government Infrastructure Spending Central to this growth story lies the government’s strategic infrastructure spending, where central government capex has been increasing at a CAGR of 27% over the past five years. This strategic investment is a catalyst, effectively “crowding in” private capital expenditure. As infrastructure improves, businesses gain greater confidence in expanding their operations, leading to a virtuous cycle of investment and growth. Historical analysis shows that the railways have a multiplier effect of five times, with the road sector offering a similar opportunity in terms of growth gains. Leapfrogging Technologies India’s infrastructure development is not merely focussed on expansion but also on embracing cutting-edge technologies. The country is adopting new technologies in several sectors, with priority accorded to “green” ones, as part of climate change and sustainability targets. India’s per-capita electricity consumption was around one-third of the global average in FY22 and is likely to rise significantly going forward. To this end, renewable capacity is projected to increase from 76 GW in 2018 to 500 GW by 2028. The significant increase ensures that two-thirds of the incremental supply is expected to come from renewable sources. India is already the world’s third-largest producer of solar energy and fourth-largest producer of wind energy—further growth here will not only reduce import dependence but will also reduce inflation volatility and create new demand for solutions such as electric vehicles, cold-storage chains, and green hydrogen-powered trucks and buses. Corporate Profits Corporate profits are soaring, contributing significantly to GDP growth. India Inc.’s net profit as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) was close to 5% in Q2FY24, and more than double of the 2% recorded in Q2FY21. This surge in profitability is a powerful indicator of the vibrant and expanding Indian business landscape. Today both Indian and multinational corporates are focussed on the India market. India remains a favoured destination for global investors, and, as per the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), India secured the third-highest foreign direct investment (FDI) for new greenfield projects in 2022. Increased Tax Buoyancy This economic dynamism is accompanied by a remarkable increase in tax buoyancy at the corporate and individual levels. Tax collections have grown at an average annual rate of 15% over the past five years, creating a broader and deeper tax base. The GST system has rapidly expanded the tax net, increased collections, and formalised the economy. This robust tax revenue gives the government the resources to invest in critical infrastructure projects, creating a virtuous growth cycle. Rising Per Capita Wealth As per capita wealth increases, consumption rises, further fuelling the engine of economic growth. This cycle of wealth creation is crucial for sustained economic development. IMF data shows India’s per capita GDP is expected to increase from $1,974 in 2018 to $3,985 in 2028, translating into significant improvements in living standards for millions of Indians. Opportunity for the Banking Sector As per capita GDP ratchets up to the $4,000 inflection point, financialisation of assets is also expected to double, moving away from the traditional saving routes of land and gold. The publicly-owned India Stack is interoperable, democratises data, is decentralised and will continue to drive financial inclusion—be it with Aadhaar for 1.3 billion Indians or UPI, the world’s largest payment network. Further, strong regulators for banking, capital markets, and insurance have had a deep impact on borrower behaviour. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code significantly changed borrower behaviour with errant promoters losing control of their enterprises in the event of a default. Unlocking Human Potential India has a young population of 1 billion under 35. So it will clearly continue to enjoy this demographic dividend even as population growth is set to witness a slowdown with Total Fertility rates (TFR) slipping below replacement levels. More importantly, globally there is an inverse correlation between female literacy and TFR, which has been relevant for India. Hence going forward, greater female labour force participation would also be a key growth driver. The Decade of Indian Dominance In conclusion, the next decade presents an unparalleled opportunity for investors and businesses to be part of this remarkable story. The government has touched the right chord via policy efforts across key reform areas. Going forward we expect the private sector to supplement the compelling consumption and investment story. This decade belongs to India. By capitalising on its inherent strengths, India is poised to become a global economic powerhouse and a leader in sustainable development and human empowerment. The world is watching with anticipation as India embarks on its next chapter of growth and prosperity. ￼ The author is Cluster CEO, India and South Asia markets (Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka) of Standard Chartered Bank.

    "article_content": "Feedback As we stand at the threshold of a new era, the potential for transformative change in India is both palpable and promising. The next five years present a critical window of opportunity for our nation to shape its trajectory, and central to this vision must be the prioritisation of healthcare. As Chairman of Apollo Hospitals, I see a vision that extends beyond healthcare to encompass holistic well-being and progress. The trajectory of life expectancy in India from the 1960s to 2013 has undergone a remarkable transformation. Currently, an 80-year-old patient grappling with health issues stands a significantly improved chance of survival and a healthier life, owing to technological advancements in healthcare, the expertise of skilled clinicians, myriad therapeutic treatments and a comprehensive array of preventive health offerings and platforms. These elements collectively contribute to ensuring a higher quality of life for individuals in the decades to come. Healthcare Transformation A nation’s progress is intricately linked to the health of its citizens. Therefore, a robust and inclusive healthcare system should be our foremost priority. Over the past 40 years, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have changed the world. They have become the leading cause of death and suffering in most countries, contributing to 71% of global deaths. Close to 30% of these are those between 30 and 60 years of age. Alarmingly, WHO also predicts one in four Indians has a risk of dying from an NCD before they reach the age of 70. This health crisis not only affects individuals but also poses a substantial economic burden. A World Economic Forum report estimates that India could incur a staggering cost of $4.58 trillion between 2012 and 2030 due to NCDs and mental health conditions. Preventive healthcare measures have never been more important. Prevention is not just better than cure; it is the foundation of a healthier society. Harnessing the Power of Technology The digital revolution is upon us, and we must harness its power to revolutionise healthcare delivery. India has taken rapid strides here and digital health is bringing healthcare within the reach of 70% of our population residing in rural and remote areas. We are positioned to not only bridge gaps in our healthcare delivery but also to have the capability to contribute to global universal health coverage goals through its telemedicine and digital health tools. Hence, increased advances in technology, and interest and activity from innovators, provides an opportunity for India to solve some of its long-existing challenges in providing appropriate healthcare to a large section of its population. The integration of AI and machine learning can further assist in early diagnosis and personalised treatment plans. The power of digital and physical is coming together to build an efficient and impactful healthcare model. Primary care, diagnostics, secondary and tertiary care, and retail health, all linked and enabled through a dynamic integrated digital platform are pivotal to this. India’s moonshot for health equity lies in embracing and leveraging medical technology, treatment and research. Looking ahead, the future of healthcare lies in automation, digitisation, robotics, 3D printing and in deep science, genomics and molecular biology. Healing the World in India The transformation of India into a hotspot for medical tourism an be traced back to the 1980s when private hospitals entered the scene, organising the healthcare market. Prior to this development, healthcare access was elusive for many. Today, India offers treatment to international patients at a mere fraction of the cost, approximately a tenth, providing access to the best doctors equipped with relevant skills and leveraging the latest technological advancements, ensuring excellent clinical outcomes. The Indian healthcare industry is on a par with the best in the world in terms of infrastructure, technology, specialist doctors and nurses. The country has the finest and one of the largest pools of doctors of global repute and paramedics in South Asia. India’s expertise in highly specialised areas like organ transplant, cardiology, oncology, etc. has made the country a hotspot for medical value travel. Further, to build a sustainable healthcare system, we need a strong foundation of skilled healthcare professionals. Investment in medical education and research is imperative. We must attract the brightest minds to the field of medicine, offering state-of-the-art facilities and fostering a culture of innovation. Research institutions and medical colleges should collaborate seamlessly to drive advancements in medical science and contribute to the global pool of knowledge. In conclusion, the next five years present an unparalleled opportunity for India to redefine its healthcare landscape. By prioritising universal healthcare access, preventive measures, technological innovation, medical education, and fostering collaboration between the public and private sectors, we can pave the way for a healthier and more prosperous nation. As we embark on this journey, let us remember that a healthy India is not just a goal; it is the cornerstone of our collective well-being and prosperity. To a flourishing nation, today and always. Here is wishing everyone good health, happiness and boundless prosperity in the New Year. The author is Chairman & Founder of Apollo Hospitals.

    "article_content": "Feedback It is widely acknowledged that this is India’s moment. There is a growing groundswell of opinion that India, over the next five years, would become the third-largest economy in the world and recent forecasts indicate that it could well be a $7-trillion economy by 2030. The bold climate commitments, including the net-zero goal, underline India’s response to the existential crisis of climate change and frequent extreme weather events that threaten to undermine progress. Thus, India is forging a new growth paradigm of a low carbon development model that is unique and unprecedented, posing challenges of a much higher order of magnitude compared to any of the growth models witnessed hitherto. While the challenges are many, we are at the cusp of an era that is full of opportunities. Favourable demographics, rising incomes, urbanisation and aspirational consumers on one hand, and the evolving world of AI, digital, rapid technology development on the other have pervasive implications across the economy. It is evident that competitiveness is central to reaping the benefits of India’s strengths and achieving the Prime Minister’s inspiring vision of Amrit Kaal, which envisages rapid growth with social equity and environmental sustainability. I would term this approach as Responsible Competitiveness. No single organ of society can accomplish all of this and, hence, partnerships hold the key—partnerships that leverage complementary strengths and enable meaningful contribution, not only from governments but also from all organs of society including enterprises and civil society. In this context, certain megatrends promise to provide a springboard to create new vectors of growth: digital, sustainability and innovation. Several big-ticket policy reforms, which were set in motion over the past few years, have been leveraging these megatrends. To illustrate with an example, India’s digital stack is receiving global recognition for its population-scale capabilities. This powerful digital infrastructure has unlocked efficiencies both financial and operational, facilitated inclusion, enabled upskilling, created new business models, empowered the economy and promoted fair and transparent governance. Going forward, the potential impact is even greater: (a) As a medium to connect: For example, ONDC opening up markets through domestic and cross-border e-commerce particularly for MSMEs and micro-enterprises. (b) As a medium to lower logistics costs as demonstrated by the Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) (c) And as a medium to enhance productivity through effective service delivery, e.g. Skill India and Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission Similarly, relating to sustainability, the slew of policy initiatives have set the nation on a firm path of green growth and innovation, particularly relating to energy transition. The pathways to clean energy require new supply chains to be built, requiring deep collaboration between government, industry, research institutes, service providers and many more. Initiatives like Mission Hydrogen can unlock private capital and open up new market opportunities. Civil society can also partner in the national effort through Mission LiFE and green credit. There is also a growing realisation of the importance of adaptation and building resilience across the various sectors of the economy, especially among the most vulnerable. Indian enterprises can play a leading role as a catalyst for leveraging the power of partnerships towards addressing the complex growth agenda. As the economic engine of society, Indian enterprises tend to be better placed to garner and allocate resources efficiently, generate a multiplier effect and reduce drags and friction across value chain partners. This proposition is best understood through some sectoral examples of significant opportunities. Inherent in these examples are various partnerships involving farmers, large enterprises, MSMEs, governments, research institutions and a range of service providers spanning testing laboratories, logistics providers, training services and many more. India has huge potential in the agri-food sector, given its inherent strengths. While the government can contribute through policy, enterprises can invest in translating market signals into productive output and in creating capacity among farmers through inputs such as climate-smart agriculture. Such an approach will boost investment, ensure viability, and align the value chain constituents. Similarly, a partnered approach to creating a competitive wood-based industry can generate large economic multipliers, enable significant carbon sequestration and livelihood generation. Our country has 30 million hectares of degraded forest land capable of being converted into productive and green assets. An enabling policy framework that would permit enterprises to lease degraded forest land will attract investment and innovation in silviculture, enhance competitiveness, spawn new wood-based industries, enable import substitution to the tune of $4 billion annually, create large carbon sinks and generate significant rural employment of nearly 1.3 billion person-days. These sectoral examples link industry with agri and wood value chains and contribute to the cause of ‘manufacturing competitiveness’. Similar opportunities can be created in the services sector, which has been leading economic growth and exports in recent years. In this context, tourism represents a sector with immense opportunity. The finance minister announced in the Union Budget the development of 50 tourist destinations as part of focussed initiatives to realise the potential of the Indian tourism industry. As per estimates, the industry can generate $60 billion and create 60 million jobs by 2030. An enabling policy framework, together with a partnered approach across industry, governments at central and state levels, MSMEs and other constituents, can crowd in private investment, spark capacity building and guest handling and soft skills training and other services, and set in motion a significant and inclusive economic multiplier. Each of these opportunity areas represents a pathway to securing growth with sustainability and shared prosperity. More importantly, it will provide large-scale opportunities to productively engage a wide spectrum of skill sets besides providing significant avenues for migration of agrarian skills to adjacent, higher order livelihoods. A partnered approach can hasten the realisation of our shared national vision. This would be a worthy agenda not only for the next five years but also well beyond.

    "article_content": "Feedback The India story has come a long way since the economic reforms of the 1990s to now being the fastest-growing large economy globally, creating economic opportunities for hundreds of millions. But as a nation, it’s equally important for us to ensure that this growth story is sustainable and inclusive. The world has only five more years in its quest to reach the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Interestingly, the United Nations General Assembly has proclaimed 2024–2033 as the International Decade of Sciences for Sustainable Development (IDSSD) and this should form the basis or foundation of collective action. Rooted in the 2030 Agenda, this decade seeks to harness a more effective and inclusive global approach to sustainability based on the synergistic co-operation of all sciences and all knowledge forms in an integrative and transformative way to inform policymaking and the implementation of the SDGs. It is no secret that these challenges are linked in some way or the other to the fact that the world’s production and consumption models are unsustainable. India is particularly at risk, given it is the most populous nation in the world. Plastic and electronic waste are increasingly choking our natural ecosystems. For me, there are five key facets that would stand out for India specifically as it strives not just to meet its own SDG goals but also to embrace a future that is increasingly defined by sustainable economic development. These are, in no particular order, women, water, technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship. While each of these elements can be looked at independently, they can also have a strong and symbiotic relationship with each other. Women are the most impacted not just by the challenges posed by climate change, but are also among the most vulnerable stakeholders in the overall social and economic development paradigm. The moment you make women the central actors, whether in education, in business, in addressing climate change or driving innovation and technology, the impact becomes manifold. Gender parity is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. There has been progress over the last decades, but the world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030. Likewise, in India, women and girls represent half the country’s population and therefore, also half of its potential, but have not benefitted proportionately from the country’s economic prosperity. Gender inequality persists everywhere and stalls social progress. Women in the labour market still earn 23% less than men on average globally and women spend about three times as many hours in unpaid domestic and care work as men. Addressing just this one aspect (gender inequality in the labour market) can accelerate social and economic benefits for communities and nations collectively. I place ‘water’ as the second important element specific to fostering social and economic upliftment over the next five years. Water and sanitation constitute the sixth SDG. While India has in recent years made significant progress in this regard, there is still much that needs to be done. The opportunity exists for India to lead the way in accelerating water conservation efforts—more so given that we are still primarily an agrarian society and agriculture consumes the bulk of water. I see technology and innovation as two sides of the same coin. While India may have traditionally lagged when it came to innovation, there is a huge opportunity today to accelerate this. Once again women can be at the forefront of this. The Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), set up under NITI Aayog, is one notable initiative that seeks to select, support and nurture technology-based innovations that solve sectoral challenges of national importance and societal relevance through a grant-based mechanism. India needs many more such initiatives driven in partnership with both civil society and businesses to help turn the corner. While India has been on a rising trajectory with regard to the Global Innovation Index (GII), moving up from rank 81 in 2015 to 40 in 2023, there is more that can be done. A greater emphasis of women embracing STEM subjects in school and college and a greater inclusion of them in technology can be a strong driver of change. Finally, India needs to create a more enabling ecosystem to drive more young people, including women, to embrace entrepreneurship. Women are natural entrepreneurs and India needs to do more to encourage more women entrepreneurs to emerge as role models in the start-up ecosystem. A gender-inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystem will help stimulate greater economic creativity, resilience and foster positive change. It will also have a ripple effect that inspires, encourages and empowers greater innovation that eventually touches more lives. I am confident India will soon achieve its ambition of being a $10-trillion economy. But this economy needs to be equally prepared for vagaries that climate change brings with it and make sure the fruits of this economic growth reach the last mile. What’s required is collective effort and when 1.5 billion people come together then surely they can do magic and the world will follow. The author is Chairperson of HCLTech.

    "article_content": "Feedback At the recent United Nations COP28 climate summit in Dubai, two terms took centre stage in discussions: mitigation and adaptation. The former refers to efforts made to decrease carbon emissions, urging nations to commit to reducing the release of greenhouse gases. The latter focusses on the adjustments that countries need to make to address these transformations. Though it has one of the lowest per capita CO2 emissions and energy consumption rates in the world, India has done remarkable work on both counts. Qatar has the highest CO2 emissions per capita at 36 tonnes per person; for the US, the figure is around 15 tonnes per person, while in India it is only 2 tonnes, much lower even than the world average of 5 tonnes. In simple terms, it means that the average Indian household consumes only a tenth of the electricity consumed by an average household in the US. Notwithstanding this, India has not only met but also exceeded its commitment made at the COP21 summit held in Paris in 2015 by generating 40% of its power from non-fossil fuels. The achievement is more impressive if one were to consider the strong relationship between income, health, water, infrastructure, education, life expectancy, and energy consumption per capita. India’s proactive approach towards sustainable energy sources has allowed it to surpass expectations almost a decade ahead of schedule. These climate initiatives were recognised as the fourth strongest globally in the latest Climate Change Performance Index brought out by the NGO Germanwatch e.V., which assesses the performance of countries on four indicators—total emissions, renewable energy deployment, energy use, and climate policy. In fact, India outperforms every major economy. India is now the most populous nation with 1.4 billion people, almost a sixth of the world’s population of 8 billion, and its energy needs are increasing at a fast clip, more than that of any other country in the coming decades. Peak power demand in India touched 239.9 GW on September 1, 2023, much more than the Central Electricity Authority’s projection of 230 GW. This forces the country to rely on fossil fuels for power generation even though it has an installed non-fossil fuel capacity of 179.33 GW, with an additional 128 GW under development or bid out. Adani Green Energy (AGEL) has a locked-in growth trajectory up to 20.4 GW and an operating renewable portfolio of 8.4 GW, the largest in India. AGEL’s operating portfolio has cumulatively offset over 41 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. We are playing a crucial role in India’s impressive strides in renewable energy by building the world’s largest renewable energy park. Just 150 km away, in Mundra, we are creating one of the world’s most extensive and integrated renewable energy manufacturing ecosystems for solar and wind. As announced by Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani, the group is committed to achieving 45 GW of renewable energy by 2030; this will help cut annual emissions by an amount equivalent to 80 million tonnes of CO2. But renewables alone will not address the growing demand for electricity; storage solutions, like pumped hydro and green hydrogen, will be required to address the intermittency of renewables and the variability of demand. Decarbonisation is a priority for the group, with five businesses—Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, AGEL, Adani Energy Solutions Limited, ACC and Ambuja—committed to achieving net zero by 2050 or earlier. To make green hydrogen adoption feasible, its cost must decrease drastically from the current $3-5 per kg. Once this happens, green hydrogen and derivatives will start becoming cost-effective against fossil fuel alternatives in sectors like mobility, shipping, fertilisers, and as green feedstock for industry and chemicals with the right regulatory support. As we embrace clean technologies, it is crucial not to overlook the conventional sources of energy production that enable the country to ensure holistic, aspirational, and equitable growth for the vast multitude. This necessitates a careful and calibrated phasing down of thermal energy while reducing our carbon footprint and paving the way for a sustainable and eco-friendly future.

India became the first country to land near the moon’s South Pole, and the fourth country to soft land on the moon. This success put India’s capabilities in space technology in the global spotlight. Even as Chandrayaan-3 symbolises the new India raring to make its mark on the global space sector, there is a huge transformation taking place with space emerging as a sunrise sector in India. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) continues to be a beacon of innovation, but the game changer in future will be through the participation of the country’s private sector. The past year has already seen a slew of announcements and initiatives by the government to strengthen the private space ecosystem. The creation of the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) ignited the non-government entities (NGEs), creating a much-needed support system to participate in India’s space economy. The much-appreciated Indian Space Policy 2023 laid the foundation for a structured and dynamic space sector, encouraging private sector participation in a range of activities from manufacturing rockets and satellites, launching them, operating earth stations, and disseminating satellite data to developing downstream space applications. The year saw IN-SPACe implement multiple initiatives to encourage and handhold the private sector. The seed fund scheme for start-ups, pricing support policy, mentorship support, transfer of Isro technology to the private sector, design lab with simulation software and testing facilities for space objects, international outreach platforms for NGEs, and skill development are some of the key initiatives to encourage innovation and develop space capabilities of NGEs. The result of these efforts is visible with the number of space start-ups now nearing 200 and investment in these start-ups increasing from $6 million in 2019 to $125 million in 2023. We are witnessing a growing interest from foreign players in Indian start-ups as well as legacy space companies. With the revised FDI policy that is around the corner, we should see higher investments in the space sector in the coming years. The year also saw the unveiling of an ambitious decadal vision and strategy for the Indian space economy. We have set an aspiration for the Indian space economy to reach $44 billion by 2033, from $8.4 billion now and from a 2% share in the global space economy to 8% by 2033. NGEs are at the heart of this vision with a focus not just on technological advancement but also on making space technology accessible and affordable for a wider societal impact. Some of the key milestones that I personally would like to see by 2029 in India are: 1. Dedicated manufacturing clusters, supported by states, with plug-and-play facilities for producing small satellites, payloads, launch vehicle subsystems, ground station equipment and subsystems catering to the global market requirements. The next few years should see India evolving into a significant global supplier, with active participation from Isro’s vendors and new space start-ups, by integrating into the global supply chain for space systems. 2. Currently all GSO communications satellites are either owned by Isro/NSIL or by foreign companies. We would like to see the Indian private sector participate in the huge expansion of the need for communication satellites. 3. An Indian Earth Observation (EO) constellation, being managed and operated by private players. 4. A global data processing and dissemination platform managed by Indian private players. In the coming years, as the space data requirement increases exponentially, attaining Atmanirbharta in space data will be a strategic and commercial imperative. Currently, a large chunk of our space data requirement is being met from foreign satellites, which should gradually shift to Indian sources. And both the EO constellation platform and data processing platform will be an essential step towards Atmanirbharta in space data and data products. 5. Complete digital connectivity, even in the remotest parts of the country, made accessible and affordable through satellite broadband. Bringing high-speed internet to the remotest parts of the country through satellites will catalyse socio-economic development, offering opportunities for education, healthcare, and economic change in previously inaccessible regions. 6. India to become a global hub for the launch of small satellites with at least three small launch vehicles owned and operated by private players and the spaceport in Kulasekharapattinam, Tamil Nadu, providing the required launch infrastructure. 7. Downstream applications developed by NGEs with the use of space data and images. These can be to monitor changing climate, extreme weather, use of natural resources, address challenges in agriculture, clean energy, drinking water, tele-education, telemedicine, and much more, thereby creating new economic opportunities in the country. Apart from this, Isro will continue to make great strides in the research and development of next-generation space technologies and carrying out interplanetary missions for space exploration, taking Indian presence deep into space from the moon to Venus and more. The next five years promise to unveil a new era in the Indian space sector, where the focus is not just on technological advancement but also on global collaboration, on leveraging space for socio-economic benefits and on inclusive growth. The integration of policy reforms, private sector dynamism, and technological advancements will position India not just as a participant but as one of the leaders in shaping the future of global space endeavours!

    "article_content": "Feedback Sorry, I don’t have answers. I do have some points to ponder. And I am not going to share lofty statistics on the growth of the Indian mutual fund industry. I am going to share what brings me to work every day after doing the same job (so far!) for 25 years. There is excitement and optimism all around about India’s global standing as a nation, her economy and capital markets. On capital markets, the positivity is not just related to performance—absolute as well as that relative to emerging markets—but also the robust participation by domestic investors in equity markets, directly and via mutual funds. While direct equity investors have no doubt a big contribution in the vibrancy of markets, there is a lot of trading as well as futures and options activity, and the long-term impact on market movement is muted. Neither is there a concept of net inflow nor has the “non-promoter non-institutional holding” of listed entities risen in any meaningful manner over the years. Hence, from mid-2021 through to end-2023, in the face of significant FPI outflows, it is said that domestic investors—mainly via mutual funds—have supported the markets, preventing a meltdown, unlike previous such scenarios. Whether flows sustain markets or rising markets pull in more flows is as interesting a question as whether the chicken came first or the egg or if you are numerically oriented, the circular reference error. Most market commentators seem to suggest that there are a lot of greenhorns out there in the markets who have entered after 2020; they have not seen the nasty side of the markets and a bulk of the flows in the markets is because, well, the markets are going up. This is true. When people are investing, they start with the right intent i.e. SIPs are done for decades; invest systematically because you don’t know when markets can go down; they never go up unidirectionally; when they fall you automatically average; equity mutual fund investments are done for the long term, etc. Experience shows, despite all this, at the first hint of trouble, flows tend to be held back and even withdrawn altogether. But somewhere in finding a balance between the scepticism around “this time is different” and the inevitability of “habits change with generations”, cohorts of people and their behaviours and reactions to situations change. Hence, our baggage of past experiences needs to be rebalanced between being an asset and a liability. I hate to use clichés, but this is how demographic dividend might look like in action. Are we prepared? As I said earlier, I agree that rising markets do pull in people and a market fall can scare the most convinced; the role of human psychology in investing is critical too but there are a few other considerations to keep in mind. The last big correction before 2020 was in 2008-2009 and a longish lull in markets was last seen between 2011-2013. In 10-15 years, a lot of investors have become experienced enough to understand that corrections are a feature and not a bug. Some even see it today as the most profitable feature. In the past 15 years, however, a new cohort of investors has come into the markets who are wired differently. Their education levels, socio-economic background, risk appetite, aspirations, the economic and market messages they have received, the India they have seen and how they react to stock market losses are very different. When they start earning, they don’t place deposits in public sector banks or post offices at 9%, not everyone opens a public provident fund (PPF) because it gives 10% and they are not thinking jobs and careers in a 10-20-year bracket. Even if you gave them something with 10% assured return, they would still choose something that was easily accessible on the friendliest UI/UX or simplified in a YouTube video; sorry, shorts or an Insta reel. Most youngsters now are opening accounts on an app or paying money on an app, saving or buying investment on an app and it is the app and its UI/UX, it’s gamification that matters and not the underlying bank or broker or even an investment idea. This is not about my view on markets and retail participation alone. The biggest dynamic that one needs to be aware of today is that an overwhelmingly large proportion of our investors are going to be young in the coming years. Twenty years ago, if the median age of the investor in mutual funds was 45-55 years, in the next 10 years it will be a 30. And a 30-year-old with a very different journey to that point and a very different route map onward. This is the biggest dynamic the industry needs to prepare for. We are way too complex, way too boring and unnecessarily intellectual. The entire digital ecosystem and changing consumer trends have made the industry democratic and meritocratic. In the past, most mutual fund companies were owned by a bank, insurance company, NBFC or broker or some sort of conglomerate. Today, professional managers with no institution buttressing their claim to competency but a reputation and track record to boot, are setting up their mutual fund companies, thanks to regulations in no small manner. More and more new players will come in based on the rise in market size, global investment opportunities, and the ability to create products and deploy investment acumen. But success will lie not just in managing money and generating returns, but it will depend a lot more on accessibility, communication quality, and, most importantly, relatability. How does one stay young and keep an organisation young despite the much desirable grey of experience and competency is what I wonder most about nowadays.

    "article_content": "Feedback Against the uncertain global backdrop, India has been in the spotlight for being the fastest growing major economy. Foreign investors are acknowledging India’s growth prospects. India as an emerging market clearly stands out. In recent years, India’s economic growth has surpassed expectations. For instance, during the peak of Covid-19 in FY21, India’s GDP contracted by 6.6% compared to the estimate of a contraction of 9.5%. At the onset of Covid-19, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was proactive with its monetary easing and liquidity support. It needs to be commended for the host of measures it introduced. The gradual lifting of restrictions by states saw both demand and consumer confidence come back sharply from September 2020. Strong GDP growth has continued in the current fiscal with Q1 GDP increasing by 7.8% and Q2 GDP by 7.6%. RBI has increased its GDP target for the year from 6.5% to 7%. The onset of the Russia-Ukraine war saw spiralling oil prices and inflation started hitting the Indian economy from April 2022. But the RBI reined in inflation through a series of calibrated measures. The one key challenge that India faces is its dependence on oil. The trajectory of oil prices always needs to be watched as India is the third largest importer of oil in the world. The oil import bill has a very large influence on India’s current account balance. For instance, the Israel-Palestine conflict is the latest event causing enormous geopolitical concerns. Further escalation could be detrimental to inflation, oil prices, and international trade. The finance ministry needs to be commended for not becoming overzealous in its stimulus package during the pandemic. If India had not kept the fiscal in check during the pandemic, inflation levels could have been out of control as we witnessed in several developed economies. In my opinion, both the government as well as the RBI did a truly outstanding job in managing the economy during the last three years. Financial Services Industry I am extremely positive about the financial services industry in India. Some of the positive signs are as follows: 1. Financial penetration in India is extremely low which implies a huge potential for growth. For example, the mortgage to GDP ratio in India is 11% compared to 20-30% in most East Asian economies, 69% in UK and 52% in US. 2. Similarly, India’s mutual fund penetration is 16% of GDP compared to 149% in the US and 75% in the UK. This means that with a population of 1.4 billion people, barely over 2% invest in mutual funds and equities. The potential to grow, therefore, is huge. 3. The introduction of Unified Payments Interface is helping India to transform into a cashless society. 4. Lastly, India is expected to be a $1 trillion digital economy in FY27. This will be one-fifth of the total economy at that time. Housing and the Real Estate Market The housing and real estate sector holds the key for unlocking the potential of the Indian economy. Housing is one of the largest employment generators in the economy with linkages to nearly 300 industries. The demand for housing remains insatiable in a country like India, which has a huge housing shortage, estimated at over 29 million units. There is a tremendous potential for growth in housing loans as the penetration level of mortgages in India is extremely low compared to other countries. The demand for housing in India will always be strong due to factors such as government’s thrust on affordable housing, favourable demographics, increasing urbanisation and rising aspirations. Two-thirds of India’s population is aged below 35, and unlike the West, in India people do not buy a home when they are in their 20s. The average age of a first-time home buyer in India is generally between 37 and 39, and with two-thirds of the population being below 35 years of age, it means two-thirds of the population has not even contemplated buying a home yet. Therefore, there will be a structural long-term demand for housing, and housing loans, in India. Climate Change and ESG Climate change is a global issue which cuts across multiple channels—ranging from physical catastrophes, weather-related disruptions, business model disruptions, technological developments, regulatory risks and changing customer preferences. As a result, the investor community is increasingly demanding higher benchmarks on climate-related disclosures. ESG, hence, is becoming an important criterion for evaluating a company. Increasingly, some investors and proxy advisors are actively monitoring responsiveness to ESG factors and comparing a company’s ESG performance to that of its peers. I do believe that we will see greater shareholder activism on ESG issues in India, with a special focus on how organisations are addressing climate change. The macroeconomic fundamentals in India remain very strong. I expect the reform process to continue in the months and years ahead. An extremely strong government focussed on growth, a well-regulated system and enormous growth opportunities in the economy make India the perfect destination for foreign capital. India is a strong domestic consumption-based economy and penetration levels are so low in India that the scope for businesses to continue growing remains immense.

    "article_content": "Feedback Panerai, the luxury watchmaker that blends Italian design with Swiss technology, recently opened its third and largest boutique in India, in Mumbai. Another one is likely to open in Bengaluru soon. Jean-Marc Pontroué, CEO of Panerai, in a free-flowing conversation with Business Today, talks about why Panerai will not manufacture diamond watches, how smartwatches are a disruptor but in a good way, and a lot more. Edited excerpts: How important is India as a market for Panerai? For us it [India] is one of the fastest-growing markets. We are still at the beginning of expansion in India. It’s still a business that is polarised between Delhi and Mumbai. But over the next decade, it will be one of the most promising markets for the luxury industry in general, and for watches in particular. Panerai has been present in India for many years now. We started with a boutique in a hotel some 13 years ago. We will continue to expand our retail footprint in key cities in India in the future. Will you be looking at multi-brand outlets? Multi-brand is one of the potential facets of our expansion. It’s not like we are purely in a mono-brand development scenario. We, however, believe that it is in key cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, that our customers can best experience the brand’s boutiques. Going forward, in terms of strategy, will you continue to focus on the US and Europe or will Asia play a more important role? The US remains the number one market for Panerai. But we have a good balance between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. The brand has a strong position in some of these key markets. We are opening 45 new boutiques around the world this year. Our big flagship stores are called Casa Panerai. These are approximately 250 sq. m and spread over two floors. We are opening in New York, Milan, and Paris. We opened one in Sydney, another one in Amsterdam, and one in Taiwan. We will soon have another in Bengaluru. So it is not really that we are prioritising any one region. We are just tracking all these business opportunities geographically to make sure that Panerai is present wherever lovers of luxury watches are living or travelling to. Do you feel that smartwatches are a disruptor for the luxury watch market? Smartwatches are a great product and I’m not one of those in the watch industry who are afraid of such devices. Smartwatches are encouraging people to wear watches. Half of the people in the world don’t wear watches. So, first, it is telling people that wearing watches is natural. Second, it’s not the same business. It can have some influence on what we do for sure. Because you have only two wrists, you cannot wear hundreds of watches. I’m a big fan of it because it has been a disruptor in our industry. It has led the new generation to realise that wearing watches could be a good way to get information about your health, performance, news, etc. But that is a functional business, while ours is an aspirational business. Panerai is about passing on your watch to your kids. It’s an investment. A smartwatch lasts for two or three years and is then replaced. It’s a consumable, one that you use and throw. We are not in that business. Do you feel that watches are still a sound investment? We have 28 models with retail price higher than the original price. We developed a model for a charity auction where the estimated price was between 60,000 and 180,000 Swiss francs but was bought by a Taiwanese collector for 355,000 Swiss francs. For us, it was important because it shows the desirability of the brand. Panerai has been traditionally about men’s watches but now there are a lot of unisex watches. Will we have a specific range for women? Men remain 75-80% of our customers, but we now see a growing number of women wearing big watches. The 38 mm dial in different colours and with coloured straps is a growing point of interest. Over the last few years, an increasing number of women are buying our watches, even though the brand is extremely ‘masculine’. We don’t want to change the positioning and the messaging of the brand. We will not make diamond watches. I know India is a big market for stone watches. But we won’t do so. Nearly all global luxury watch brands happen to be European. Would you expect any new watch brand to come up from any other parts of the world? You know, I never say never, ever. Nobody would have expected that disruption would come from the US when it came to smartwatches. So, you never are protected from being sure that everything will continue to come from Switzerland. By the way, only 3% of watches come from Switzerland. 97% are of non-Swiss origin. The value is, however, 80% Swiss. Customers buy a slice of history. They have been buying our storytelling since the 1860s. It’s very hard to be taken seriously in the higher-end watch segment if you don’t have at least 100 years, 200 years, or 300 years of history. And that’s what is perhaps protecting our business from new arrivals compared to other fashion accessories. @smitabw Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback There has been a surge in initial public offerings (IPOs) from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in recent years. More than 90 SME firms have already gone public in the first five months of 2024. In fact, FY24 saw a record 204 SME public issues, according to data from Prime Database. While this surge indicates a vibrant and growing ecosystem, it has also sparked a debate regarding some firms misusing the segment for personal gain. There have been instances of issues being oversubscribed hundreds of times and stock prices surging despite the absence of any supporting growth in the companies’ fundamental metrics. To ensure better oversight, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi)—the capital markets regulator—may tighten listing norms. A couple of months ago, speaking about the SME IPO space, Sebi Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch said the regulator had reasons to believe that some entities were misusing the segment for price manipulation. “The reality is that these are relatively small entities, the market capitalisation is small, and the free float is small. It is relatively easy to manipulate both at the IPO level and the trading level,” she had stated. Some experts argue that the existing regulations, which offer lenient listing and disclosure requirements for SMEs compared to mainboard companies, may inadvertently fuel speculation and expose investors to heightened risk. “There are concerns with SME IPOs, as the issue size is small and the segment has much more lenient listing and disclosure norms compared to the main exchange or the mainboard. This has led to high speculative activity, and many companies’ valuations are unheard of,” says market veteran A.K. Prabhakar. The rapid pace at which SME IPOs are being offered raises several concerns, says Aurelia Menezes, Partner at law firm King Stubb & Kasiva. “This may lead to a compromise in the due diligence process, potentially bringing lower-quality companies to the market. An influx of SME IPOs might overwhelm investors, leading to insufficient demand and underperformance of these IPOs post-listing,” Menezes explains. Another problem she highlights is valuation. “With many companies rushing to go public, there might be pressure to accept lower valuations, which can be detrimental to both the companies and their investors. Ensuring thorough regulatory oversight becomes challenging when the number of offerings increases significantly, potentially leading to lapses in compliance,” Menezes adds. Even though there have been reports of price manipulation by some firms, G. Chokkalingam, Founder and MD of market research firm Equinomics Research, believes that an uptick in SME IPOs is healthy for the economy. “SMEs can drive the economy and also participate in employment generation. Hence, aggressive resource mobilisation by SMEs through IPOs is good for the economy,” Chokkalingam says. When asked what the changes to the existing rules could be, Prabhakar suggests, “Maybe the lock-in period for IPO applicants can be three to six months, and subsequent buyers in the segment should hold the shares for a minimum of three months before selling. It would keep fly-by-night corporations in check.” Menezes says it is vital to ensure that only fundamentally strong companies are listed, and this will maintain investor confidence and market integrity. “Many retail investors may not be familiar with the risks associated with investing in SMEs. Education programmes can help mitigate potential losses,” she says. But, at the same time, she says the regulator must consider smaller firms’ potentially limited ability to meet extensive reporting requirements, so a balanced approach can ensure compliance without excessive burden. “Post-IPO monitoring can help maintain market discipline and protect investors from potential fraud or mismanagement.” Chokkalingam proposes that the regulator encourage the splitting of shares before IPOs. This can help to keep a check on rallies in SME stocks with very low retail floats driven purely on perception. Splitting of shares and increasing the supply of shares in the markets could curb over-valuation in some SME counters. “They can also broaden public holdings and expand retail holdings by encouraging a larger share of public ownership, up to 49%.” These experts also feel that there is a need for a minimum threshold for SME IPOs. “By setting a threshold, the market can avoid an influx of very small, potentially volatile companies that might underperform and harm the overall perception of SME IPOs. Institutional investors might be more willing to invest in SME IPOs if there is a minimum standard, which can provide more stability and liquidity to the market,” Menezes says. Chokkalingam feels that reducing the minimum trading lot and the number of allottees could encourage greater participation by investors, avoiding the concentration of holdings by a limited number of investors. An official statement from Sebi is yet to come. That being said, there are indications aplenty that the capital markets watchdog is tightening the noose around those who aim to misuse the SME IPO space. @prashuntalukdar Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback In a break from the past two terms and indicating the changed dynamics, as many as 71 ministers (excluding the Prime Minister) were sworn into the Council of Ministers of the National Democratic Alliance government headed by PM Narendra Modi. These include 30 Cabinet ministers, five Ministers of State with independent charge, and 36 Ministers of State. In the first term of the NDA government, 46 ministers were sworn in, and 58 in the second. The Council was, however, expanded in the middle of those terms, and that could hold for NDA 3.0, too, given the compulsions of a coalition government. The Council can have a maximum of 81 ministers, including the PM. However, with its 240-seat strength in the Lok Sabha, the Bharatiya Janata Party has retained key ministries including home, finance, defence, external affairs, agriculture, commerce and industry, railways, and roads and highways. Allies such as the Telugu Desam Party, Janata Dal (United), Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), and Janata Dal (Secular) have also been given allocated portfolios like Civil Aviation, Panchayati Raj and Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying, and Heavy Industries and Steel. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has retained the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions; the Department of Atomic Energy; and the Department of Space. Other allies, including the Apna Dal, Shiv Sena, and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), have got Ministers of State portfolios. By retaining most of the senior ministers in their earlier portfolios, sources point out that the government intends not just to indicate that the BJP retains political heft but also ensure continuity in policy. “Before the General Elections and the Model Code of Conduct, the Prime Minister had directed ministries to continue work and ensure that 100-day agendas were prepared. With the formation of the government, ministers will spearhead these and ensure they are implemented at once,” said a source, noting that officials are also comfortable working with the same ministers. While taking charge, ministers made clear their key priorities and held meetings with their officials. In the finance ministry, for instance, the preparation of the Budget is underway, and officials are awaiting policy direction from the PM and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on how to tweak schemes and allocations. Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, soon after assuming charge for a second term, held a review meeting with officials. At that meeting, the secretaries of commerce and the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade presented briefs on the current proposals and action items. Markets and investors also seem comforted by the NDA’s strategy, and equity markets have recovered smartly from the initial meltdown when poll results were trickling in on June 4—the benchmark BSE Sensex dropped nearly 6% that day. In a note, financial services firm Nomura pointed out that 22 current Cabinet ministers were also a part of the earlier Council of Ministers, and this represents a sense of continuity. “After the election outcome, the key investor concerns were about political stability and policy continuity. Any escalation of such concerns leading to a sharper fall in the markets could also adversely impact domestic flows, which have been resilient post-Covid,” Nomura said. It added that, over the course of the past week, those concerns have abated. “The composition of the Cabinet... also indicates policy continuity at the moment,” it said. Some changes in policy orientation will be inevitable. Rating agencies and industry players feel the government may have to put labour, land, and farm reforms on the back burner to accommodate coalition partners. The first glimpse of this was visible with Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri stating after taking charge that the privatisation of the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd, once touted as India’s biggest ever such exercise, is completely off the table now. But investment in and capital allocation for infrastructure, manufacturing, renewable energy, and electric mobility sectors are expected to get a boost, keeping in mind the Viksit Bharat 2047 (Developed India) vision. In the Interim Budget presented in February, the government made a record allocation of Rs 11,11,111 crore for the infrastructure sector. With the Cabinet in place, the focus has shifted now to the Budget for 2024–25, expected to be presented in July, for further indications of the government’s path. To start with, the new Cabinet will work on the 100-day action plan prepared while the elections were underway. Some of the measures that require Parliament’s approval and fund allocation are expected to be tabled during the Budget. For now, it appears to be business as usual. But investors will closely monitor the speed of decision-making by the new coalition government and actual implementation on the ground. The results of the upcoming assembly elections in the states of Maharashtra, Haryana, and Jharkhand will be the next inflection point for the coalition. These are interesting times indeed. @surabhi_prasad, @richajourno Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback With the national Democratic Alliance (NDA) securing another term, all eyes in the private healthcare sector are on the potential reforms to the flagship health insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat. The ambitious scheme, launched in September 2018, aims to provide health coverage of Rs 5 lakh per beneficiary family per annum to over 500 million citizens and has been touted as the world’s largest health protection programme. Although Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PM-JAY) claims to have reduced out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for millions of families, it has faced operational challenges. The industry says one of the major issues is delayed reimbursements to private hospitals, which has led to cash flow problems and hampered their operational efficiency. The delays in reimbursements have discouraged some hospitals from seeking empanelment under the scheme. Private hospitals have swiftly reached out to the newly-appointed Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda to convey their concerns and advocate for more efficient payment processes. Girdhar J. Gyani, Director General of the Association of Healthcare Providers in India (AHPI), a body representing private hospitals across India, emphasises the significance of timely payments. “The original PM-JAY scheme included a clause to pay 1% interest if payments were delayed by more than one month. Implementing this clause would ensure timely payments and encourage more hospitals,” Gyani states. As Modi embarks on his third term, stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem are hopeful that addressing these concerns will not only streamline the scheme but will also encourage broader participation from private hospitals and ensure quality healthcare reaches every corner of India. Rate decisions continue to be another pressing issue, with Gyani advocating for rates to be determined based on scientific studies and linked to inflation, with annual revisions. He highlighted that the current rates are generally low, necessitating a thorough review with inputs from private industry representatives. “The National Health Authority (NHA), the implementing agency of Ayushman Bharat, should consider allowing co-payments. This would enable beneficiaries to seek treatment from specialist hospitals for serious ailments,” says Gyani. He also recommends standardising the empanelment process across states and issuing smart cards for interoperability. To make PM-JAY more effective in smaller towns, Gyani proposes incentivising the private sector to establish 100-bed tertiary care hospitals in Tier-III towns. Per the latest data on the PM-JAY website, over 340 million Ayushman cards have been issued, and about 68 million hospital admissions worth Rs 90,204 crore have been authorised through a network of 30,001 empanelled healthcare providers, including 12,971 private hospitals. In states or UTs where AB-PMJAY has not been implemented, the NHA has directly empanelled hospitals to ensure beneficiaries can still access healthcare facilities. Beneficiaries of state schemes merged with AB-PM-JAY can also use healthcare services in any empanelled hospital nationwide under the portability feature of the scheme. The scheme also focuses on strengthening primary health centres. At Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres, comprehensive healthcare services are provided free of cost, covering maternal and child health, non-communicable diseases, essential drugs, and diagnostic services. In its manifesto for the General Elections, the BJP pledged to further expand the scheme to include senior citizens and transgender persons. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to strengthen the health and wellness centres, upgrading district hospitals, and enhancing secondary care centres. The ongoing efforts under the PM-Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission aim to build a robust infrastructure, especially at the primary level, the manifesto stated. “The government faces high expectations in the healthcare sector, with a multifaceted agenda aimed at improving access, affordability, and quality of care,” says Sabine Kapasi, Advisor, Public Health and Healthcare Services Strategist at the United Nations. She stresses the importance of broader financial protection, adopting a ‘One Health’ approach, and strengthening public-private partnerships. Kapasi says the new government should prioritise ensuring cash inflow into insurance infrastructure, subsidising insurance costs for higher penetration, standardising health treatment prices to prevent exploitation, and achieving full saturation and adoption of the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission. @neetu_csharma Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback Sometimes, timing is everything. Take ITC’s hotels business for instance. The last quarter of FY24 was the best ever for the business. The segment saw revenues of Rs 898 crore, up 15% year-on-year (YoY) and a profit of Rs 267 crore, an increase of 34% YoY. The standout was an improvement in margins, primarily driven by higher revenues per available room. To sum up, it does seem like an appropriate time to demerge the business, a decision that was first made public last July. With ITC’s shareholders giving their go-ahead in early June, it is expected that the new entity will be listed in 15 months. The contours of the merger will have ITC Hotels issue equity shares to ITC’s shareholders. It will eventually result in 60% being held by ITC’s shareholders proportionate to their shareholding in the conglomerate with the other 40% remaining with ITC. In revenue terms, the hotels business saw a spike of more than 15% to get past Rs 3,100 crore in FY24. That’s still only 3.61% of ITC’s overall sales but it is significant. The profit before interest and taxes increased by 37% to Rs 765 crore—still barely 3% of the conglomerate’s overall profit—but the timing is most interesting. “Every business vertical of ITC is doing well, and the demerger is taking place at the right time,” says Deven R. Choksey, Chairman and MD of wealth management and investment advisory firm DRChoksey Finserv. He backs the future of the hotel industry and thinks a lot of it will be driven by a strong revival in tourism. “Hotels are the new hospitality opportunity in India. Just the organic part is enough to drive the business for ITC.” A report put out by Axis Securities after ITC released its FY24 numbers states the margins were “led by higher realisation, structural cost interventions and operating leverage”. Today, the hotels business that was launched in 1975 through the acquisition of a property in Chennai, has brands such as Mementos, Welcomhotel, Storii, Fortune Hotels and WelcomHeritage. In all, it has over 120 hotels spread across 70 locations. “Their asset-right strategy is a good approach given the access to capital,” says Choksey. In the hospitality industry, an asset-right strategy refers to owning properties and managing for others. In an interaction with Business Today earlier this year at its Kolkata headquarters, Sanjiv Puri—ITC’s Chairman & Managing Director—had said the timing of the decision to demerge the hotels business was right since it had matured. “Institutional synergy is critical here concerning brands and much work is taking place,” Puri had said. A report put out by Emkay Global right after the demerger was announced was of the view that though the value unlocking following the decision was unlikely to be material, there would be an improvement in ITC’s returns profile. “The retention of a 40% stake in the new entity is to provide stability and sustain cross-business synergies,” it had said. ITC’s FMCG business (its non-cigarettes portfolio), which is over Rs 21,000 crore or almost a quarter of its total sales, gains the most from the hotels business. The foods portfolio—the largest chunk of the overall FMCG pie—works very closely with ITC’s hotels business. The intention is to grow the packaged foods part, where inputs from the chefs play a big part in delivering better products. The asset right strategy has been received well by the analysts. “The management does not see the need for any large capex in the business ahead. If a need does arise (such as an opportunity to acquire a trophy property), the new hotel entity will have the choice of both the debt and equity routes for raising capital,” said Emkay in its report. Plus, the hotels business is likely to be strong on the back of zero debt. Meanwhile, the ITC stock too has seen a lot of interest in the recent past. From a low of Rs 158 in March 2020—when the pandemic hit—it recovered to hit a high of Rs 490 last July. “The hotels business is well-placed, and expansion will not be a problem for ITC. In fact, there may not be a big need to look at buyouts since organic growth itself is such an attractive proposition,” says Choksey. A lot of action is clearly waiting to play out at ITC’s hotel’s business. @krishnagopalan Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback For the Adani Group, cement is a core business today. In just under three years, the conglomerate has grown its capacity from almost nothing to a total of 75 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), positioning itself as the second-largest player in the industry, trailing only UltraTech Cement’s 140 mtpa capacity. It is worth noting that a significant portion of the growth has been inorganic, starting with the big-ticket $10.5-billion deal to acquire Ambuja Cements and ACC. The latest one is the buyout of Hyderabad-based Penna Cement Industries for Rs 10,420 crore. Currently, Penna Cement has a total capacity of 10 mtpa and another 4 mtpa is under construction. Once the deal is closed, the total capacity of the Adani Group’s cement business will expand to 85 mtpa. The group aims to achieve a production capacity of 140 mtpa by 2028, while market leader UltraTech Cement has set its sights on reaching a capacity of 200 mtpa. From a strategic point of view, the acquisition of Penna Cement (through Ambuja Cements) will strengthen Adani’s position in south India, which has historically witnessed low capacity utilisation. Of Penna Cement’s existing capacity, 90% comes from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, and the rest from Maharashtra. The additional capacity will come up in Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and Jodhpur in Rajasthan. The deal also includes limestone capacity, but specific details have not been disclosed. “Along with its ongoing expansion plans, Ambuja Cements targets increasing capacity to around 113 mtpa by FY27 and further accelerate growth to reach its target of 140 mtpa by FY28,” says a report by financial advisory firm Emkay Global after the Penna deal was announced. Clearly, valuation is not the only factor being taken into account for the Penna deal; 90% of Penna’s capacity comes with railway sidings, in addition to some of it being supported by captive plants and waste heat recovery systems. Most importantly, Penna has five bulk cement terminals, which aligns with the capabilities of the Adani Group. Effectively, it will allow the conglomerate to put its ports to good use, with cement moving through the sea route. The earlier buyout of Sanghi Industries was similar. Housed in Gujarat’s Kutch region, it also has one bulk cement terminal in the state and another one in Maharashtra. That opens up not just the domestic market, but also an opportunity in the neighbouring Middle East. Ajay Kapur, CEO and wholetime director of Ambuja Cements, said in a statement after the Penna deal, that the bulk cement terminals “will prove to be a game changer by giving access to the eastern and southern parts of peninsular India, apart from an entry into Sri Lanka, through the sea route.” The objective is to make Penna Cement “highly competitive on cost and productivity, and improve its operating performance.” In FY23, Penna Cement witnessed a net loss of Rs 193 crore, while its revenue was Rs 3,150 crore, according to a report by brokerage firm Motilal Oswal. Even the smaller buyout of My Home Group’s cement unit in April was in line with the sea route strategy. The deal, struck for Rs 414 crore, came with a grinding unit of 1.5 mtpa, but located in Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu. A cement industry executive calls the high capex outlay on infrastructure an opportunity. “Obviously, those like UltraTech and Adani stand to gain with their manufacturing plants located across the country. Plus, the dedicated freight corridors could allow cement to be transported from markets like the south to central or north India,” he says. Looking ahead, Emkay Global’s report says consolidation will play a key role in boosting market share for major players. “Short-term challenges may persist as players seek market share gains, but long-term consolidation—with larger players expanding organically and through acquisitions—is expected to improve pricing discipline and enhance profitability.” @krishnagopalan Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback A meeting between officials of Google’s parent Alphabet and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin came as a shot in the arm for Indian drone manufacturers. Reports suggest that the tech giant is planning to set up a factory in the southern state to manufacture drones. The Indian government’s efforts to give the industry a boost appear to be bearing fruit. In 2021, the government announced a subsidy of Rs 120 crore under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the manufacturers of drones and their components. Then, in the Interim Budget 2024–25 presented earlier this year, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman increased the outlay for the sector under the PLI scheme to Rs 57 crore from Rs 33 crore the previous year. In 2022, then Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Singh Thakur had said that India aims to become a global leader in drone manufacturing. Flagging off the Drone Yatra 2.0—an initiative to send drones to villages to apply pesticides to farms—he had said the country would require at least 100,000 drone pilots by 2023. Subsequently, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) recognised 63 remote pilot training organisations in 2023. But is the sector keeping pace with the government’s ambitions? Data from research firm Tracxn shows there are 384 drone start-ups in India. The list includes ideaForge (India’s first listed drone manufacturer), Newspace Research and Technologies, Garuda Aerospace, Marut Drones, and General Aeronautics. A separate study by data platform Statista estimated that Indian drone companies would generate revenues of Rs 225 crore in 2024, against world leader China’s Rs 12,740 crore. Clearly, India is far behind in the drone manufacturing race and certainly far away from its goal to be among the world leaders. Can Google’s entry change this scenario? “The entry of a tech giant is expected to liberalise the ecosystem as such companies accelerate partnerships. Also, it will generate new jobs such as testing pilots, engineers, etc.,” says Amandeep Panwar, Co-Founder and Director of agritech firm BharatRohan. But he adds that the Competition Commission of India and the government should not encourage a monopoly. Priyanka Agarwal Chopra, Managing Partner at start-up incubator IIMA Ventures, says Google’s entry could have a multiplier effect. “With the entry of a big company into the picture, newer technologies are expected to be introduced. Also, India will find a place on the global map of the drone industry, opening up new opportunities for existing start-ups,” she says. There are some who have expressed fears, considering Google’s conflict with some internet-based businesses over its billing policy. ideaForge’s CEO and Co-founder Ankit Mehta says that there’s no need for any organisation to feel threatened since it is a highly use-case specific technology. “As drones are used across agriculture, videography, defence, land mapping, etc., no one company can pose a threat to the entire ecosystem,” he says. Further, Vikram Ramasubramanian, Partner at start-up investment platform Inflection Point Ventures, says there’s definitely room for more companies to enter. He says there are 30–40 drone companies that have approached his firm for funding. “Adoption will automatically get a boost if a tech giant ventures into the space because such a company will bring with it an entire ecosystem, from manufacturing technologies to global connections and projects,” Ramasubramanian adds. The sector can, perhaps, rightfully expect heightened interest now. @sudi_journolife Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback Indians have always coveted the glitter of gold. That desire has stood the test of time, despite challenges from newer financial instruments that promise to deliver better returns. This is visible in the latest data from the World Gold Council. In its report, Gold Demand Trends 2023, it said Indian gold bar and coin demand rose 7% year-on-year in 2023 to 185 tonnes, while jewellery demand dropped 6% to a still substantial 562.3 tonnes. However, physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds hit a record of 42 tonnes by year-end. One reason why gold has remained a popular asset is its traditional role as a hedge against inflation. Besides, adding gold to portfolios can help with diversification. Considering this insatiable demand, multiple forms of gold investments have been introduced over time: from minted products (coins and bars), gold bonds, and digital gold to gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. Each of the options comes with its advantages and drawbacks. Physical gold risks theft and burglary, while gold ETFs and bonds have custodian risks and others not present with physical gold. The avenues Physical gold—gold coins, jewellery, and bars—can be purchased from a jeweller or a bank. The advantage here is that you have direct ownership, plus it holds sentimental value for many Indians. But one must consider the associated risks here, like storage, safety, making charges, and the risk of receiving less than the market value when sold. Vikas Singh, MD & CEO of precious metals processing firm MMTC-PAMP, says, “Minted products provide tangible ownership, can be held for long durations, are passed down generations, and hold deep cultural significance. Minted gold and silver products are some of the most preferred forms of investment.” Next comes digital gold. As the name suggests, investors can buy, sell, or hold gold in a digital format. Like buying physical gold, with digital gold, you own the gold you purchase. The metal for each transaction is stored in insured vaults monitored by a trustee. There are no storage costs here, and investors can buy or sell 24/7. But these transactions attract goods and services tax (GST) and other charges, which affect the overall returns. Ajinkya Kulkarni, Co-founder and CEO of fixed income product platform Wint Wealth, says, “Digital gold is still an unregulated space. Hence, investors should avoid it, even if a company offers them cashback or other rewards. It is also inefficient from a taxation point of view, since investors need to pay a 3% GST charge when buying digital gold. For example, if someone buys `1,000 worth of digital gold, she only receives the gold equivalent of `970 in her digital account. The capital gains on digital gold are taxed on par with physical gold.” Then follow sovereign gold bonds, or SGBs—government securities expressed in grammes of gold, providing an alternative to possessing physical gold. Investors are required to make the payment in cash at the issue price, and the bonds will be redeemed in cash upon reaching maturity. There is no buying or redemption cost on SGBs if purchased in the primary market and held till maturity. It also fetches a 2.5% interest per annum, taxed at slab rates. Even the capital gains on SGBs are tax-free if held until maturity. Though SGBs are listed on stock exchanges, liquidity could be challenging. They can be bought online through the website of scheduled commercial banks. And last, there are gold ETFs that directly invest in gold, and the units of these ETFs are listed on stock exchanges. Gold ETFs provide a more transparent way of investing in gold compared to the other two formats. It can be bought or sold at market-linked prices, involves no storage, and is highly liquid. But it also requires a demat account and attracts brokerage charges and a nominal expense ratio. Gold ETFs help resolve concerns over purity, storage, and liquidity. The ETF units are stored in your demat account. You can buy as much or as little as you want from asset management companies, hold your units for any length of time, and sell when you’re ready. Cost factor In reviewing the costs tied to digital gold, gold ETFs, and physical gold, one should also bear in mind how these may influence long-term yields. Let’s delve into each option. Digital gold platforms usually charge a fee for the purchase, sale, or deposit of gold. There can also be transaction fees, management fees, or service charges. These costs can erode overall returns on investment. It is crucial to know about these charges and make an informed comparison between different providers before investing in this instrument. Gold ETFs entail a different expense structure, which commonly includes expense ratios that reflect the management cost of the fund. Transactions on the stock exchange might attract additional brokerage fees. High expense ratios can depreciate returns over time. Therefore, Col (Retd.) Rakesh Goyal, Founder and CEO of Let’s Invest Wisely, advises investors to choose ETFs with lower expense ratios and avoid frequent transactions to minimise brokerage costs. Lastly, acquiring physical gold entails making charges and GST. Goyal says there will also be additional costs for secure vault storage. Notably, transaction costs associated with physical gold are comparatively higher than those associated with digital gold and gold ETFs. Another important factor is taxation, and each option has different implications. For example, gains from digital and gold ETFs may attract a capital gains tax, while physical gold may attract GST on purchase and capital gains tax on sale. Under the Income Tax Act, typically, a 20% tax on long-term capital gains (LTCG) plus a 4% cess, totalling 20.8%, is applicable on the sale of gold. Capital gains from paper gold, including gold mutual funds, gold ETFs, and SGBs (if sold before maturity), are subject to a 20.8% tax on long-term gains. For a holding period under three years, short-term capital gains (STCG) tax applies based on the individual’s income slab. However, gold ETFs bought after March 31, 2023, will incur short-term capital gains tax at slab rates, regardless of the holding duration. Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.com, says, “According to Section 56(2) of the Income Tax Act, gold gifts from parents, spouses, or children are exempt from income tax. However, gifts from non-relatives exceeding `50,000 are taxed under the income from other sources category. While gold jewellery received as wedding gifts may be tax-exempt, selling these gifts attracts capital gains tax. It’s essential for individuals to be cognizant of these tax implications when entering into gold transactions or receiving gold gifts.” In the case of physical gold, 3% GST is applied while buying, plus making charges for jewellery. There is no GST on gold ETFs, gold funds, and SGBs. Regulatory frameworks, too, play a pivotal role. Physical gold is often subject to local regulations, while gold ETFs fall under market regulations. Gold ETFs are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), while gold bonds are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). But there is an absence of regulation on digital gold. That aside, among the various avenues, digital gold and gold ETFs offer higher liquidity than physical gold. They can be bought and sold swiftly on platforms. In contrast, physical gold transactions involve more time and effort. Risk factor There are primarily three risks associated with digital or ETF-based gold investments. “Both gold ETFs and gold mutual funds share a common risk, primarily tied to market fluctuations stemming from the potential volatility in gold prices. On the other hand, SGBs introduce a different risk factor: sovereign default risk. This risk arises because SGBs are not directly backed by physical gold; instead, they represent a derivative of gold issued by the government through the RBI,” says Shetty. Counterparty risk: When you invest in digital gold or gold ETFs, you are exposed to counterparty risk. This means that the value of your investment is dependent on the financial health of the entity that issued the product. If the issuer goes bankrupt, your investment will be impacted. In contrast, while owning physical gold you have direct possession of the asset, eliminating counterparty risk. Custodial risk: In digital and gold ETFs, your gold is typically held in custody by a third party. There is a risk associated with the security and reliability of the custodian. If the custodian faces operational issues or fails to safeguard the gold properly, it could jeopardise your investment. In physical gold, you have direct custody of your investment. But you still need to ensure proper storage and security measures to protect against theft or damage. Tracking Error: ETFs may not perfectly track the price of gold because of factors like management fees, tracking errors, and market conditions. This means that the value of your investment might not precisely mirror the movements in the price of physical gold. The value of physical gold is directly linked to market prices, and there is no tracking error here. However, selling physical gold may involve transaction costs and may not be as convenient as selling ETF investments. Which is better? The growth of digital gold and gold ETFs reflects evolving investor preferences for convenience and accessibility. But there is no one-size-fits-all answer in terms of which avenue is the best, and investors will have to use discretion while making the choice. It must be based on an analysis of which option aligns best with the investor’s specific needs. Physical gold can serve as a meaningful heirloom to be passed down through generations or used personally. Digital gold is best for minimal investments or to avoid any issues regarding the metal’s storage and purity. And gold ETFs are great for diversification. Shetty of BankBazaar cautions that gold is a conservative investment, and its returns just about outpace inflation. There can be periods where returns could be flat or negative. It would be wise to allocate about 10% to gold in a portfolio. Thus, investors should choose the type of gold investment as per their short- and long-term goals. For those interested in preserving wealth, physical gold might be the best choice. If liquidity and cost-effectiveness are more important, then digital gold and gold ETFs may prove more valuable. It is important to have a well-balanced portfolio that weighs the pros and cons of each gold investment option. Kulkarni of Wint Wealth suggests that gold ETFs are best for short-term sellers as they can be bought and sold during stock market hours. Whatever the option, investors should think long and hard about the avenue that best suits their needs. @imNavneetDubey Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback Gold has been on a tear since the beginning of 2024. On March 21, it touched an all-time high of Rs 66,943 ($2,224.80) per 10 gm. Considering this, investors may be forgiven for thinking that it’s time to go big on gold. Why not make the most of this rally? But there lies the rub. The recent surge in prices to all-time highs has come despite an increase in uncertainty about the trajectory of the yellow metal, which has left many market veterans puzzled. Gold is a traditional hedge at times of high inflation or economic uncertainty—global and domestic. And though there is continued economic uncertainty in light of the Israel-Hamas war, the worst of the inflationary surge of 2021 and 2022 seems well and truly to have passed. Besides, it is also a time when central banks across the globe have raised interest rates, especially in the US, to levels not seen since after the oil crisis of the 1970s. Often in the past, increased interest rates have dampened gold demand by offering a relatively stable investment option like the US Treasury bond, in particular, that promise steady returns with minimal risk. The paradox of the current gold run becomes clearer when it is compared with cryptocurrencies. They, too, have seen a sharp rise in prices, especially Bitcoin, the largest of the crypto assets. In this case, though, the trigger seems to be the US Securities Exchange Commission’s decision to allow exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in this space. But, as mentioned earlier, that’s not the case with gold, where the increase in price has coincided with an outflow from ETFs. How then should investors approach this commodity? Is it prudent to invest in an instrument that has been so unpredictable recently? And are there factors that could boost prices further? The Tailwinds Gold is available in a range of options. Physical gold—including jewellery, coins, and bullion—is the traditional form. But there are also digital options—like gold bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds. Investment guru Jim Rogers believes the primary factor boosting gold is the fact that countries have continued to print money to boost economic activity to increase liquidity. “The reason gold is going higher is because governments everywhere are printing so much money, and I’m an old peasant. All of us old peasants know that when there’s a problem, we better have some gold under the chair. We better have some gold in the closet. So, I own gold,” Rogers tells Business Today. Rogers mainly buys physical gold, he says, but dabbles a little in paper and gold indices. “But these days, I have more physical gold and silver than paper gold.” The reason, he explains, is that gold and silver will remain valuable, unlike virtual assets like cryptocurrencies. “I don’t think Bitcoin is going to replace gold, and I don’t think it’s going to replace silver. Cryptocurrencies have become trading vehicles for many people, but not for me. You know, many of the crypto assets have gone to zero, in my view. They will all go to zero someday. One of the things that India has taught me over the years is that you’ve had gold and silver for thousands of years. So I’m still more optimistic about gold and silver than I am about cryptocurrencies,” adds Rogers. Another factor boosting gold is the global response to the inflationary spike that followed in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Central banks across the world embarked on an interest rate-raising spree, but at the same time sought to diversify their reserves, and gold was the best instrument to do that. This is borne out by data from the World Gold Council. After a dip in 2020 and a slight rise in 2021, central bank purchases of gold more than doubled to a record high of 1,081 tonnes in 2022, dipping only slightly to 1,037 tonnes in 2023. Experts say the trend is expected to continue in 2024. Considering the central role played by the US Federal Reserve—the most influential central bank—its interest rate trajectory will be key in 2024, too. The year began with expectations of multiple rate cuts this year, but those hopes have since waned. Ravindra Rao, Head of Commodity Research at Kotak Securities, says, “Currently, the market anticipates a 54% probability of a quarter-point rate cut by June, potentially extending to July should inflationary pressures persist,” he says. He feels gold holds promise over a six-month horizon. “On the price front, COMEX Gold prices seem poised to remain above the $2,150-mark, the previous all-time high. Such sustainability would empower the bulls to potentially drive prices towards $2,250–2,300 per troy ounce, corresponding to Rs 68,000 per 10 gm in the MCX (based on the prevailing USD-INR rate),” says Rao. Amit Goel, Co-founder and Chief Global Strategist at money manager Pace 360, highlights the ETF outflows to argue that gold is currently an under-invested asset class. “Redemptions in gold ETFs have reached nearly 30% from their peak in 2020, marking eight consecutive quarters of net redemptions—a historical first. The stage is set for a multi-year bull run, and we anticipate gold reaching levels of $2,400–2,500 by year-end.” Jateen Trivedi, VP of Research at LKP Securities, predicts that gold will outshine other investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, and potentially even real estate in 2024. Though he believes real estate will do well, especially in India, he feels gold is the top choice in such uncertain times. It is perhaps a reflection of the disruptions of the past five years, then, that domestic gold prices have doubled in the last five years. The Headwinds It won’t be smooth sailing for the yellow metal, however. There could be some volatility in the months ahead. Chirag Mehta, CIO at Quantum AMC, says, “Gold prices could remain choppy in the months ahead as the market reacts to geopolitical developments and US monetary policy. Given the imminent turn in the US interest rate cycle, the medium-term outlook for the precious metal looks promising.” Besides, hopes of multiple interest rate cuts by central banks appear to be receding. That’s why global gold ETFs have witnessed net outflows. And though Indian gold ETFs saw an inflow of Rs 657 crore in January, that was, perhaps, because investors sought to diversify their portfolios. A delay in the anticipated easing of monetary policy is a concern because, historically, gold has delivered robust returns during periods of US Fed policy easing. Easing tends to bring down bond yields and weakens the dollar, which enhances the appeal of gold, a non-interest-bearing asset. “Actually, there is no direct relationship between the US interest rate cut and gold price. However, a rate cut largely influences the value of the US dollar, which is inversely correlated with bullion price,” says Hareesh V., Head of Commodities at Geojit Financial Services. One major event that could cause a significant spike or dip in the domestic price of gold is the upcoming General Elections. “Elections often bring about uncertainty and volatility in financial markets, leading to fluctuations in currency values. Any unexpected outcomes or policy announcements following the election could impact the rupee’s value and subsequently affect gold prices,” says Trivedi. He adds that the full Budget after the polls will be important, and any announcement on imports can impact prices significantly. There are other elections, too, this year, including the one in the US. Some outcomes will be domestically contained, but others may spill over onto the global stage. “Gold’s strong bounce at the start of March has taken it to new all-time highs. This suggests a market itching for a trigger,” says a World Gold Council report. But should there be an atmosphere of stability, investors may see limited returns. Periods of stability have coincided in the past with static gold prices. Research indicates that between 1992 and 2003, gold prices remained more or less within the Rs 4,300–5,000 bracket. The returns generated were, in fact, lower than those from savings accounts and provident funds, according to Adhil Shetty, CEO of fintech platform BankBazaar.com. But since 2003, returns have surged more than 1,000%. The Outlook Harshad Chetanwala, Co-founder of financial planning firm MyWealthGrowth.com and a Certified Financial Planner, says investors are often lured to the yellow metal when prices rise. Such an approach might not yield the desired outcome, as gold prices can remain static for long periods. Moreover, going overweight on gold may prove damaging. Chetanwala suggests that investors refrain from investing in gold jewellery because of the costs associated with it. He urges investors to build a gold portfolio gradually, as it is essential for diversification, and not worry about price fluctuations. “Given gold’s current price trend, it is advisable to include gold in your investment portfolio, keeping a recommended exposure of 10-15%,” notes Shetty. However, when considering gold purchases during price surges, investors must align their decision with financial goals and understand the potential risks. Chetanwala suggests investing in gold through sovereign gold bonds (SGBs), underscoring the benefits of the annual interest and exemption from capital gains if held until maturity. He believes it’s an optimal investment choice for those who are not overly worried about the maximum limit of 4 kg per PAN. Mrin Agarwal, a financial educator, agrees. She favours SGBs over physical gold because it doesn’t entail costs, offers tax-free returns on maturity, and doesn’t face storage or safety issues. She recommends a 15% allocation to gold in a portfolio and says investors must be clear about the holding period of the investment. If the holding period is eight years or more, SGBs are the better choice, whereas gold ETFs are recommended for shorter holding periods. Chasing short-term gains in such uncertain times with a volatile asset like gold is at present may not be the ideal investment choice. But considered in the cold light of reason, it essential for a diversified portfolio. @imNavneetDubey Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback It was the end of the month. X (name withheld on request) received that all-important notification on his phone informing him that his salary had been credited. He immediately opened the banking app on his phone to transfer funds to various accounts to meet daily expenses, set aside savings and investments, etc. He also transferred some money to his wife, a homemaker, to cover her monthly expenses. But then a doubt crept into his mind. Would the money transferred to his wife’s account be considered taxable income for her? Should he then file income tax returns for her? Faced with this dilemma, he reached out to experts. They reassured him that, in most cases, transferring money between spouses for everyday expenses is not taxable. This is because a married couple is considered one economic unit for tax purposes. But there is a catch here: the transfers are not taxable, provided the sums are not large. If, for instance, the transfers are large sums or are being done for reasons other than meeting shared expenses, then it’s possible that there could be some tax implications. “Generally, an individual transfers a certain amount to their spouse, who is a homemaker and does not earn any income regularly, solely for meeting personal and household expenses; such transfers are not subject to tax in the spouse’s hands. This is known as ‘pin money’. Any amount can be termed ‘pin money’. It depends on the individual’s total income, total household expenditure, and justification for the quantum of savings,” explains Prabhakar K.S., Founder and CEO of Shree Tax Chambers. However, if it is more than a reasonable quantum and is kept in the bank as a recurring or fixed deposit, or if invested in shares or mutual funds, then the income earned, like interest or capital gains, is clubbed with that individual’s income. In other words, if the money is being transferred to gain some tax benefits, then beware; there may not be any benefit to be had. Of course, the situation is different if the transfer is to another relative. Suresh Surana, Founder of tax consultancy RSM India, says, “Section 56(2)(x) of the Income Tax Act (I-T Act) provides that receipt of any sum of money or property without adequate consideration will be subject to tax in the hands of the recipient under the heading ‘income from other sources’.” Nevertheless, transferring residential property to a spouse will trigger the clubbing provisions of rental income. “Section 27 of the I-T Act directs that an individual transferring any house property otherwise than for adequate consideration to his or her spouse (not in connection with an agreement to live apart) shall be deemed to be the owner of the house property so transferred. Accordingly, rental income accruing on such property shall be taxable to the deemed owner under the heading ‘Income from House Property’,” says Surana. The HUF Route There are, however, some other legal means beyond transfers that a married couple can use to reduce taxes. One such method is forming a Hindu Undivided Family, or HUF. This is a creature of the law akin to trusts. But where it differs from a trust is that it consists of all males lineally descended from a common ancestor, their wives and daughters. From the income tax point of view, an HUF is a separate legal entity with an independent set of tax liabilities and exemptions. For instance, you can receive rental income from a property on behalf of an HUF. The tax authorities levy taxes on profits generated from the family business under the HUF, with exemptions that provide greater leverage for tax savings. This way, an HUF can help reduce tax outgo. This entity can also run a business, generate income, and invest its funds in shares, stocks, mutual funds, real estate, and other asset types. Its asset pool may include gifts, assets received through inheritance, and those pooled by its members. However, individuals who are part of the HUF will not be eligible for any tax relief on additional income from pooling the assets, like interest earned from them. Additionally, an HUF enjoys basic exemptions like individual tax deductions under provisions like sections 80, 80D, and 80DDB of the I-T Act. Further, a member of an HUF can avail of a 100% exemption on any income received from business done by their HUF, which is taxable in the hands of the HUF. HUFs can also obtain bank loans to purchase residential property and give loans to their members on mutually agreed-upon terms. But transferring property to an HUF imposes certain restrictions. For instance, the property can be transferred only with the consent of all the claimants or by the eldest member of the family, who alone can dispose of it. However, a coparcener, or an HUF member who holds inheritance rights to the property, can challenge this. Besides, if a minor is involved, then a court’s permission is required for disposing of the property. Plus, managing an HUF can be a complex affair, involving legal formalities, separate accounts, and compliance with tax laws. Surana says, “While HUFs offer some level of asset protection, they are not immune to partition risks. Disputes among coparceners or changes in family dynamics can lead to partition, resulting in the division of assets. Though it is notable that there shall not be any income tax implication in the case of full partition under the I-T Act.” Other Ways and Means There are other provisions in the I-T Act that help married taxpayers maximise their tax savings. Gifts received under some circumstances are also tax-free. For instance, gifts received from a spouse, those that are valued at or below Rs 50,000, or as the result of a bequest excluding rental or other income earned from them, are free of tax. Additionally, gifts received in contemplation of the death of the donor, from a registered trust, or any money or property received at the time of the partition of HUF are also tax-free. “Section 56(2)(x) of the I-T Act provides tax implications on any sum of money or property received by an individual or HUF without consideration or in cases that involve the transfer of property for inadequate consideration. However, the aforementioned provisions shall not apply in specified circumstances, one of them being a monetary gift received by an individual on the occasion of marriage,” says Surana of RSM India. But gifts received on occasions other than marriage or wedding anniversaries are taxable if received from people who are not close relatives as defined under the I-T Act. “In a scenario where the transfer of funds is in connection with an agreement to live apart, then the income earned from such transferred money is taxable in the hands of the transferor,” says Sudhakar Sethuraman, Partner at consultancy Deloitte India. Apart from gifts, transferring money to a spouse’s account to support their financial needs can also help save taxes. But there should be a proper loan agreement between the spouses. For instance, money given to start a business venture could be treated as a loan if it’s expected to be repaid with interest. Prabhakar of Shree Tax Chambers says, “If the husband loans money to his wife to start a small or medium business, the income earned from that business does not get clubbed with the husband’s income for tax purposes.” However, if the husband waives the interest component while giving the loan, the income will get clubbed with his income. Another money saver is a joint home loan. A couple can avail of deductions up to Rs 4 lakh on interest paid on a home loan (Rs 2 lakh each). In addition to that, they can avail deductions of up to Rs 3 lakh on the repayment of the loan’s principal (Rs 1.5 lakh each under Section 80C). However, this option works only in cases where both the husband and wife are taxpayers. An education loan for a spouse is also eligible for tax deduction under Section 80E of the I-T Act. The interest paid in a financial year will be allowed as a deduction. There is no limit on the deduction as such. In other words, this can be availed of even if one exhausts the Section 80C limit of Rs 1.5 lakh. The benefit can be availed of for a maximum of eight years, or until the last interest is paid. It also applies in the case of joint education loans available for children’s education. A couple can also opt for medical and family health insurance and claim a deduction of up to Rs 50,000 under Section 80D for premiums paid (Rs 25,000 each). “The limit is provided based on the category of persons covered in the policy and the type of payment (insurance premium, preventive health check, etc.). Married couples could each claim this benefit to the limit specified by going in for higher coverage and also by including their respective (dependent) parents in their health insurance policy,” says Sethuraman of Deloitte. Under both the old and new tax regimes, deductions can be availed of on contributions to the National Pension System (NPS) up to Rs 50,000 per person. Married couples can contribute Rs 50,000 each to the NPS, making it Rs 1 lakh per annum. It is important to note that this deduction is over and above the limit of Rs 1.5 lakh per individual per annum under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. And when it comes to children, there are also exemptions associated with education expenses. Sethuraman says, “The tuition fee paid for children’s education is allowed as a deduction under Section 80C, capped at Rs 1.5 lakh per annum. If a couple is spending this amount every year on each of their two children, then each parent can claim Rs 1.5 lakh as a deduction under Section 80C.” It’s apparent that there are many legal ways of blunting the hit from taxes. But all such decisions must be taken in consultation with a tax professional. @imNavneetDubey Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback During a recent visit to Bengaluru, I had a chance to speak to some key venture capitalists about the outlook for deals in the coming months. Quite a few of them were of the view that the funding winter was finally tapering off. Deals were being cooked and it wouldn’t be surprising, they said, to see even larger deal sizes being put through. However, they were waiting a tad bit longer, and all eyes were on June 4, the day the results of the General Elections would be declared. “The general consensus is that there will be policy continuity, but VCs would still like to wait till after June 4 to be absolutely sure,” a key VC player told me. Latest figures from GlobalData seem to support the theory that the funding drought, which Indian start-ups had to grapple for nearly two years, is finally coming to an end. GlobalData says Indian start-ups raised $3.1 billion in VC funding between January and April 2024, by way of 375 funding deals. In terms of value, this translates into a 13.8% rise year-on-year, though the rise in volume terms is 1.1%. However, this clearly marks a trend where deal flow is no longer just a trickle. In fact, Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData says India emerged as a notable exception to register improvement in deal volume and value at a time when several peer countries were either witnessing a decline in deal volumes or value or both. Bose says it is noteworthy that India, apart from being a key Asia-Pacific country standing just next to China in VC funding activity, is also among the top five markets globally, both in terms of VC funding deals volume and value. Long-time serial entrepreneur Krishnan Ganesh, an authoritative voice in the VC ecosystem says it was always expected that the winter wouldn’t continue forever, since start-ups are an asset class which cannot be ignored for long. It’s a high-risk, high-return ecosystem and there would be merit in deploying funds there. The June 4 election results date is a momentous occasion and while deals are in the pipeline, VCs would wait to be absolutely sure of the outcome since that would also have a bearing on valuations. But the lessons learnt by start-ups and VCs remain relevant despite the pick-up in deal activity. Deals are taking longer to be signed—what was done in a month takes four months now, valuations have become much more reasonable and ticket sizes are smaller. There is a clear tempering, a slowing down, Ganesh tells me. Pearl Agarwal, Founder and Managing Partner of pre-seed stage venture capital firm Eximius Ventures agrees and says trading multiples have reduced from 15-20x revenue multiple to 5-8x. She says pre-seed deals are of the order of $1-2 million, seed deals $3-5 million, and they are seeing series A up to $15-20 million as well, but larger deals beyond that are difficult. “So companies need to prove scale before being able to raise that amount now,”she tells me. Which are the sectors VCs are betting on? There’s some fear of missing out (FOMO) as far as Generative AI is concerned and VCs want a piece of that pie. Clean energy, mobility and derived demand sectors like batteries and recycling of batteries are other areas. For instance, Agarwal’s firm is upbeat about fintech, online media & gaming, healthtech, SaaS, and the consumer sector, particularly vertical commerce. She feels the intersection of Gen AI and these sectors will lead to several new opportunities. Then there is the Bharat piece—infrastructure, e-commerce and products/services in vernacular languages also interest VCs. Ventures based on India’s digital public infrastructure (DPI) is another interesting area. An entrepreneur who is building his own fintech on top of the DPI stack agrees that there’s VC interest building up. But there’s tremendous caution. This entrepreneur tells me a leading global tech VCs has put a $10-million profit as a criterion for investing, indicating how careful global VCs have become after the meltdown. PEs also eyeing more deals Grant Thornton Bharat’s Monthly Dealtracker shows similar upmove in activity on the private equity (PE) side as well. The April edition of Dealtracker shows a surge in PE activity, the highest since May 2022. There were no billion-dollar deals, but 12 high-value transactions exceeding $100 million were seen, totalling $3.8 billion, signalling robust activity. However, the same caveat relating to the outcome of the elections applies to PE deals as well. “The landscape hints at a promising future for India's investment climate, supported by a growing consumer market, a thriving tech start-up ecosystem, and supportive governmental policies. However, the outcome of Lok Sabha elections and global economic trends remain crucial influencers in the near term,” Grant Thornton Bharat says. Sudhir Dash, Founder & CEO of boutique PE firm Unaprime Investment Advisors, and a PE veteran, tells me that the PE space is looking carefully at June 4 since no PE investor wants policy disruption. However, there’s enough excitement to keep the PE space buzzing and control deals are being cooked with sizes of $100 million to up to $2 billion. One good example of PE interest is the race for Haldiram Snacks, the 87-year-old foods company where a clutch of top PE firms are reported to be interested in a control deal at a valuation of a hefty $8.5 billion. This, Dash reckons, is a call on the potential of the Indian consumer market. Healthcare, manufacturing, and BFSI lending businesses are other key areas where PE interest is peaking. On the BFSI side, with bank balance sheets cleaned up of legacy issues and NBFCs also showing robust growth, PEs are looking with interest at the financial services space. More names like Haldiram’s, from the consumer space, may see PE interest, besides regional consumer brands from south India. Personal care and cosmetics brands are also witnessing heightened PE interest. Clearly, the discussion in investment circles is now moving from the funding winter to a return of activity. The caveats: good governance and a stable policy environment are essential. Sourav Majumdar is Editor, Business Today. Views are personal Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback Artificial intelligence (ai) is all set to fast-forward India’s digital economy, enhancing governance, social inclusion and push for an exponential multi-sectoral growth that includes data-driven intelligence and insights. Within the realm of AI, Generative AI (Gen AI) is a major leap from traditional AI models that are primarily leveraged for classification or predictive tasks. Gen AI can don the creativity hat and create novel content across text, images, software code, audio, video, and 3D models by developing deep predictive power through continuous training on large data sets. Government’s Aims The Indian government is leaving no stone unturned to put India on the global AI map. The government is boosting AI adoption through many initiatives, such as the INDIAai portal for R&D, an applied AI research centre in Telangana for industry-academia collaboration, Bhashini for vernacular language digital services, and international partnerships like the US-India AI Initiative for knowledge sharing and joint R&D efforts. Further, because AI could create a tectonic shift in the digital economy, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and National Payments Council of India (NPCI), too, have entered the fray and are mulling over introducing ‘conversational payments’ on the UPI, which is expected to use an AI-powered system to add an extra layer of security. When launched, this will be a game changer in the payments landscape. In fact, India’s banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector is one of the key beneficiaries of this AI revolution. Critical use cases include fraud detection and prevention, compliance and risk, customer servicing, and cybersecurity. Similar trends can be extrapolated for the Indian banking sector where banks are enthusiastically conducting Gen AI proof of concept (PoC) to test productivity gains and transform customer experience even in the public sector. Fraud detection and prevention is viewed as the most critical use case for Gen AI in financial services. Around 76% of financial services executives say this is the area where Gen AI is likely to find most application in the near- to mid-term. With its ability to consume large data sets to base its predictive outcomes on, Gen AI can be used to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent activity. In the Indian context, there are multiple evidence-based examples that complement this global trend. For instance, one of the leading Indian public sector banks is expected to build new AI models that can help generate actionable insights for accurate business forecasting, facilitate hyper-personalised offers for customers and enable data-led insights for fraud detection, prevention and mitigation. Also, the Department of Telecom (DoT) is expected to introduce an AI-powered platform to prevent frauds using disconnected mobile numbers by real-time flagging to both banks and the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). About 68% of KPMG’s survey respondents said compliance and risk is the second priority area for Gen AI in their companies. It can be used to automate labour-intensive compliance tasks, such as SEC filings, bringing a higher degree of accuracy. In risk management, Gen AI could be used to better simulate different risk scenarios and stress test investment strategies and portfolios because of its ability to trawl humungous unstructured data sets. Contextualising for the Indian banking sector, the RBI recently announced its use of AI to gain deeper insights into the operations of supervised entities. The tools that RBI uses encompass early warning system, stress testing models, vulnerability assessments, cyber key risk indicators, phishing, and cyber reconnaissance exercises, targeted evaluations of compliance with know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) norms, and data analytics. Customer servicing and marketing/sales is tagged as the third most popular Gen AI use case in the banking sector. Financial services companies have already adopted AI to improve customer-facing processes, such as help desks and robo-advisor services. About 66% of financial services executives surveyed say their organisations are likely to use Gen AI to enable more sophisticated chatbots and virtual assistants, and 62% predict it will be used for customer services and personalisation. In fact, a majority of the top Indian private sector banks are in advanced stages of adopting private large language models (LLMs), trained on internal data sets, to leverage Gen AI, in order to drive efficiencies across specific functions and processes. Another important use case of Gen AI is cybersecurity. Due to the fast-improving stature of India across various performance dimensions, it is featured among the top 10 destinations facing cyberattacks. According to the Data Security Council of India (DSCI), cybersecurity defenders detected 400 million instances of malware spread across a network of 8.5 million endpoints in 2023. In cybersecurity, Gen AI trained on enormous data sets, including both malware-related and synthetic data, can predict cyber threats, simulate security scenarios and pinpoint anomalies—providing a richer, real-time defence strategy. CISOs need to be particularly cautious and proactive in their AI cyber strategy as AI can equally equip the hackers as well with Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) models to notoriously lower the threshold levels for launching malicious attacks. While the Indian banking sector has started seeing green shoots of Gen AI applications and use cases, enterprise-scale adoption will be a bumpy road full of challenges and bouts of adrenaline spikes. Hallucinations: Gen AI hallucinations can lead to the generation of factually inaccurate or misleading information, which can adversely impact decision-making, communication and customer interactions leading to reputational risks if not controlled and governed appropriately. Data security: The most critical responsibility of a bank is to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data of its customers and partners. While most LLM models are stateless and do not store the prompts, it is imperative to either create private LLM models or cautiously use open source LLM models in air-tight containers in the banks’ infrastructure. Infrastructure: Running LLMs require high-performance servers or cloud computing resources with Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to support overwhelming computational demands of model training which can have cost/budget implications. Copyright infringement and data leakage: Lack of enterprise-wide AI governance controls and guardrails can lead to employees ingesting confidential strategies and sensitive data sets into LLMs, which can lead to leakage of proprietary information, which is already raising red flags in terms of the misuse of proprietary data. The need to use large training data sets simply cannot be done away with, if we are to utilise the capabilities of LLMs. So, an appropriate governance model precluding proprietary third-party data needs to be put in place. Indian policymakers will play a key role in developing guardrails and a robust AI regulatory framework to realise the digital value of Gen AI. But there is a need to focus on putting together guardrails without either complicating or stifling the innovation required to push the cause of Gen AI. Tenets such as fairness, transparency, accuracy, consistency, data privacy, explainability, accountability, robustness, monitoring, updating, and the imperative of human oversight have been much debated in regulatory circles and could soon be formulated as policy. Further, The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) presented a report a few months ago stating that an independent statutory authority may be deputed, and use case-based risk-regulatory framework may be formed. With respect to the concerns on usage of proprietary data, new upcoming AI regulations may mandate organisations to ensure bias-free AI model training. Further, there could soon be customer protection-oriented regulations related to possibility of deep-fakes and synthetic content as well as instructions for transaction on B2C/B2B apps. It will be imperative that AI models undergo sandbox and stress testing before release. While the recently passed Digital Personal Data Protection Bill is a positive first step in ensuring AI readiness, it will be interesting to see how India transitions from established policy position and recommendation phase to that of implementation. To sum up, it is portended that India will soon establish a leadership position in the global rankings of Gen AI adoption. And, in this endeavour, the banking sector too is well-poised to use Gen AI and leapfrog into the future.

    "article_content": "Feedback Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) is rapidly transforming the business landscape. With every passing day, its influence in shaping business operations is proving to be more real than hype. Companies that do not recognise or leverage its transformative potential may find it hard to remain economically viable over the next decade or so. PwC’s 27th Annual Global CEO Survey: India perspective, accordingly, highlights the imperative for companies to reinvent—especially with Gen AI—not only to stay the course but also to increase revenue and profitability. While CEOs in general have been upbeat about the Indian economy, numerous social challenges barricade India’s road to economic prosperity. A well-defined strategy comprising the following five action steps can perhaps help businesses gain a competitive advantage while remaining viable in the long run. Building Trust Technological preparedness and the availability of skilled talent have positioned India as an attractive investment and manufacturing destination. India has risen to the fifth position as an investment destination for global CEOs, up from the ninth position it held in 2023, PwC’s 27th Annual Global CEO Survey has revealed. Moreover, the country has also improved its Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) ranking. Nonetheless, businesses continue to be pinched by the burden of compliance, governed as they are by over 1,500 Acts and nearly 70,000 compliances. But what if a company were to shift its perspective and view regulatory compliance as an opportunity and not a barrier? Regulatory compliance can help businesses build trust with their stakeholders and position themselves as ethical and responsible leaders. For instance, if businesses were to show that their business operations comply with the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, that can reassure customers that their data is being handled responsibly. Customer Preferences For Indian business leaders, changing customer preferences is the top reinvention driver. The survey shows that 61% of respondents said that customer preferences had led to changes in how their companies created, delivered and captured value in the last five years. It follows, therefore, that companies that focus on continued reinvention to meet the changing preferences of customers will stay ahead of the curve. Recent PwC research suggests that companies can fulfil customer needs by working across industry boundaries. Retail companies can leverage Gen AI, for instance, to enhance customer engagement and personalise product recommendations. Also, with more customers using their smartphones to research products before buying them, it has become imperative for businesses to reach the customer at the pre-purchase stage, even before the choice to buy a particular product is made. Using Gen AI Gen AI is helping maximise productivity and efficiency across industries, serving as a co-pilot or intelligent assistant to the human workforce. Indian CEOs acknowledge the transformative potential of Gen AI and anticipate that it will deliver significant benefits. Around 71% of Indian CEOs expected Gen AI to increase employee efficiency over the next 12 months, while 70% believed it would improve their own performance. However, these findings underscore the societal responsibility that CEOs have for ensuring their organisations use AI responsibly. For one, companies need to be certain that the data sets used to train large language models (LLMs) are inclusive and diverse. Stringent tests need to be conducted on Gen AI systems to verify their reliability, safety and relevance before deployment. More importantly, there is a need to establish robust internal governance procedures and provide human oversight. Decarbonisation At the COP28 summit in 2023, leaders yet again underscored the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Rapid decarbonisation of the energy system is a necessity, and 130 countries at the summit pledged to triple the world’s installed renewable energy generation capacity. Half of the business leaders polled in our survey believed that regulatory complexities were holding back decarbonisation efforts. Simplifying regulatory processes can accelerate climate action by the private sector. Also, with major Indian firms committing to net-zero targets, it is imperative for businesses in a climate-conscious world to meet investor and customer expectations on sustainability. Cybersecurity With businesses increasingly embracing digital transformation, the risk of cyberattacks has grown. It is, therefore, not surprising that cybersecurity figures high among Indian CEOs’ concerns around factors impacting the growth of their businesses. Cybersecurity fears have become more acute with the advent of emerging technologies, like Gen AI. A majority of Indian CEOs believe Gen AI would increase cybersecurity risk and, therefore, it’s important for businesses to put the necessary checks and balances in place. The increased pressure Indian business leaders expect over the next few years is a sign that continuous reinvention will be needed. Staying ahead then will require every business leader to challenge conventional wisdom, embrace change and leverage potential opportunities, although this will look different for different industries.

    "article_content": "Feedback Artificial intelligence (AI) is finally coming of age in India. We already have a large, technology-savvy young population working in various fields of digital technology, both in services and products. According to industry body Nasscom, over 1.5 million engineers graduate annually. The IT industry alone employs almost 5.5 million engineers directly. India is the second-largest generator of digital data, only behind China. It is the fifth-largest economy in the world today and one of the biggest markets for any technology, both in business and customer applications. The country ranks among the biggest markets for almost all big tech firms. The Union government’s Digital India initiative and the robust IndiaAI Mission plan, combined with the impetus to semiconductor manufacturing through the PLI scheme, has put in place the key building blocks. The interest shown by the private sector has also contributed to this momentum. Big companies have been experimenting with AI through pilot projects and limited deployment for several years. With the advent of Generative AI (Gen AI) and its visible benefits, Indian companies are recommitting themselves to scaling to deliver business value and gain a competitive advantage. While some are building an AI strategy from the ground up, others are taking one use case or application to improve efficiency, manage risks, or improve experiences in their core areas. For example, a leading Indian non-banking financial company has built a Gen AI agent to put together and analyse a potential borrower’s balance sheet and profit and loss (P&L) documents, along with business information available about the company as well as the sector on the internet, to generate a credit assessment memo. Underwriters can, therefore, focus on decision-making rather than gathering information on SMEs. A big Indian retailer is using a customised Gen AI agent to offer a far more personalised experience to its customers than its older generation of rule-based AI could. Another large retailer is leveraging AI to reduce employee churn on the shopfloor. As a professional services firm, we, too, have been increasingly using AI to provide our clients with a better experience. For example, AI integrated into our vast tax knowledge repository allows us to offer more efficient and faster analysis for clients. What CEOs must consider before accelerating AI strategies: Corporations undergoing digital transformation for the past few years are now leveraging AI alongside digital, cloud, and automation capabilities. Those who were moving slowly are accelerating. Four ingredients are particularly critical in this effort. The first is identifying areas where the technology will deliver maximum impact and the highest ROI (return on investment). CEOs must assess reliability and do a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. As we argued in our recent report, “AIdea of India: Generative AI’s potential to accelerate India’s digital transformation,” the cost implications of full-scale AI deployment are huge and leave little margin for error, as there are significant one-time investments and recurring operational costs. CEOs and senior leadership should roll up their sleeves and try out various AI tools to understand the real challenges and opportunities—it wouldn’t be a surprise if they uncover a new course for the organisation and the entire industry! Also, there are far too many flavours of AI available today, in both open-source and closed-source AI models. Organisations also need to compare customising ready-made solutions versus building their own. The second factor to consider is that large-scale AI implementation is not just a case of overlaying the technology on top of the existing IT systems; in order to get the best results, the firm may need to remodel the current technology infrastructure and processes. In some cases, work processes may have to be re-engineered with an AI-first outlook. Legacy data as well as data being generated and captured need special attention. While most big AI foundational models can use both structured and unstructured data to train from, organisations need to ensure that the data is clean, accurate, and above all, without bias before starting to use the data for AI training. The third aspect is to have in place a proper AI governance structure. Even as policymakers globally develop regulations, companies, too, must build guardrails to prevent misuse by employees or outsiders. Ethical and responsible AI also requires checking for biases that can creep into either the data or the weights used in the algorithms. When it comes to the human capital dimension, one could argue that there are two patterns playing out. First, there are mixed signals in some quarters with respect to the impact on jobs. A balanced and pragmatic approach, combining the best of humans and technology, would not only be valuable but also the most sustainable strategy. Simultaneously, Gen AI is expected to create and exacerbate talent shortages as more organisations embark on their transformation journey. The best way to address the shortage and deal with the impact on jobs is to retrain the workforce in AI skill sets. Enterprises may need to recruit individuals with natural language processing (NLP) and traditional AI/ML backgrounds, followed by providing them with targeted training. The productivity benefits of a wide-scale AI deployment in the private sector combined with new AI-based business opportunities and ecosystems can truly supercharge the Indian economy, adding trillions to the country’s GDP annually over the next few decades. The government and the private sector must continue working together to take full advantage of the AI opportunities. After all, AI holds the promise of changing lives and the economy in the same way that electricity did two centuries ago. ￼ Rajiv Memani is Chairman and CEO of EY India.

    "article_content": "We don't support landscape mode yet. Please go back to portrait mode for the best experience Once growing at a fast clip, the rural market and the mass-market consumer goods categories have been under stress for three years. While green shoots are visible, with rural growth returning for FMCG and two-wheelers, manufacturers’ hopes are riding on a good monsoon and government spending Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic introduced the work-from-home routine, Ramesh Sharma (name changed on request), a corporate professional living in Delhi, started spending more on his food and groceries. Sharma, 45, has always been particular about the quality of his diet. But now, he buys more organic groceries and cold-pressed cooking oils and juices even though they are costlier and add to the general inflation in his food and grocery bill. Meanwhile, domestic worker Kusum is scouting for a second-hand refrigerator for her family of five. After multiple repairs, her fridge stopped working this summer. Kusum’s husband is a driver, but they don’t have Rs 10,000 for a new fridge. Her budget: Rs 3,000-4,000 for a second-hand one. With rising expenses, buying new appliances remains a dream. \" The company’s strategy has been penetration-led volume growth. So, I wantto get back to volume growth as quickly as possible and not linger on with just value growth \" Suresh Narayanan CMD Nestlé India Consumers like Sharma and Kusum are familiar to Kamal Nandi, Business Head & EVP of Godrej Appliances. A veteran of the consumer durables industry who tracks purchasing patterns, Nandi says the inflationary cycle that began in 2021 has throttled demand for mass-market home appliances. “For the past two to three years, the mass-market categories of essential appliances like refrigerators and air coolers have been subdued,” he says. In refrigerators, sales of single-door direct cool models have been contracting 5-10% a year since the pandemic. These models account for 70% of volumes. “Whatever growth was recorded was in the premium segment. Last year (2023), the refrigerator market remained flat as the mass segment de-grew by 6-7% [by volume]. In 2022, the mass segment was flat, but premium grew by 20-22%,” Nandi says. Overall growth was 7%, against 10% in 2021. The picture is not much different for TVs: Sales of 32-inch or smaller sets, the preferred choice of over 80% of Indian consumers, are under severe stress. Avneet Singh Marwah, CEO of Super Plastronics Pvt. Ltd, which makes smart TVs under licence for popular brands such as Kodak, Thomson and Blaupunkt, says sales of smart TVs larger than 40 inches have overtaken 32-inch TVs post-Covid. “Demand for 55-inch and larger smart TVs is the highest, followed by 40- and 42-inch TVs, while the 32-inch models are de-growing,” he says. In 2023, TV sales had declined by up to 15% year-on-year due to subdued demand in smaller (cheaper) categories. Marwah says the current demand is primarily from households that are upgrading. The trend: practically no demand from poorer households, whose incomes do not give them leeway for discretionary spends. But affluent consumers continue to buy. Ditto in rural areas, where most buyers are not making purchases while a handful opts for premium products. The home refrigerator market remained flat in 2023 at Rs 25,000 crore or 13 million units after growing 8-10% between 2010 and 2019. It sank in 2020 and perked up in 2022 on the back of premium models. The TV market shrank to 12 million units in 2023 from 15 million in 2019. The story is different for home air-conditioners. Although ACs are considered expensive consumer goods that add to electricity bills, the market is surging, helped by the low household penetration of only 7%. (While some 80% of the households have TVs, household penetration of refrigerators is about 33%.) Industry veterans such as Nandi and B. Thiagarajan, MD of AC major Blue Star, say sales are growing at 20-30% this summer. Daily essentials such as branded packaged foods and personal care items are also feeling the chill. Take India’s branded FMCG market, valued at Rs 5 lakh crore and ranked the world’s fourth largest. With consumers spending less, the volume offtake has continuously fallen since early 2022. While offtake in urban markets had slowed significantly in recent quarters, the steep decline in the rural market was a drag on overall growth. Between the March and December quarters of 2022, FMCG volumes in the rural market had shrunk by 6-10% every quarter. Rural India, which has nearly 70% of India’s population, accounts for 36% of FMCG sales. While rural consumption has shown signs of recovery since 2023, most leading FMCG players remain “cautiously optimistic”. \" Monsoon impacts the agri economy and rural consumption. And I think in that sense, most likely, the worst is past us, and from here onwards, we do see a gradual recovery in rural consumption \" Rohit Jawa CEO & MD HUL Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), the country’s largest FMCG firm, reported a 5.7% drop in its net profit in the March quarter to Rs 2,406 crore, while revenue stood almost flat at Rs 14,693 crore. HUL has been marking up prices during the past two years to offset the faltering volume offtake. Now, it is passing on the benefits of lower commodity prices, either by reducing MRP or increasing pack size. This impacted its top-line growth not only for the quarter but for FY24. While its revenue for the year was Rs 59,579 crore, or 2% higher than the Rs 58,154 crore it had posted in FY23, its net profit margin of 16.73% was the lowest since FY19, the year before the pandemic. Rohit Jawa, CEO & MD of HUL, notes that rural consumption is recovering, but urban has been more resilient, especially at the premium level. “Over the last few years, because the inflation or price increases are quite sizeable, they had an impact on rural,” Jawa said in a post-earnings call in April. He said that, in FY24, “volume recovery remained gradual due to high levels of cumulative inflation over the past few years, coupled with a weak monsoon affecting rural demand. Urban, organised trade and premium portfolio stayed resilient and led growth for FMCG overall”. HUL is now betting on spending more to lure urban consumers towards its premium portfolio. “ Despite some recovery in this segment post-Covid-19, the lowest 20% still face challenges in returning to their pre-pandemic financial status \" Rajesh Shukla MD & CEO PRICE HUL’s peers are facing similar challenges. Poor offtake by low-income households in urban and, especially, rural areas is hurting their sales growth. The crisis is severe in the hinterlands, where incomes are lower than in urban areas. Suresh Narayanan, Chairman & MD of Nestlé India, says the food and beverages major is ramping up its rural distribution and getting into smaller packs as it is “still impacted by inflation”. “The company’s strategy has been penetration-led volume growth. So, I want to get back to volume growth as strongly and quickly as possible and not linger on with just value growth,” he says. Nestlé India, a subsidiary of Swiss F&B giant Nestlé S.A., aims to increase its direct reach to 6 million outlets in the next four or five years, up from the current 5.1 million. Nestlé India, which has relatively low exposure to the rural market, grew its volume offtake even during the worst period of 2022 and 2023, when most of its peers registered subdued growth. Narayanan says Nestlé’s focus on growing its rural reach helped. Urban-focussed Nestlé used to get some 10% of its sales from the rural market in 2015. Over time, its share has grown to over 20% as it has increased its distribution reach from 20,000 villages in 2018 to 200,000 by early 2024. \" In the past few years, vehicle prices at the entry-level segment went up much faster than buyers’ income levels [of that segment]… Further, the inflation scenario resulted in less money for mass-market consumers \" R.C. Bhargava Chairman Maruti Suzuki India Ltd The auto sales numbers show diverging consumption trends among poorer and affluent households. Sales of two-wheelers and passenger cars were affected similarly: entry-level passenger cars have few takers, while consumers flock to dealerships to drive away in (costlier) SUVs. In April-May, sales of SUVs jumped 19.4% year-on-year, extending its lead over all other passenger car segments as domestic sales grew to 362,212 units. In comparison, during the first two months of FY25, overall passenger car sales, excluding SUVs, declined 17.4% YoY, while sales of mini cars were down 18.1% and compact cars 15%. In April-May 2024, domestic sales of Maruti Suzuki’s mini cars, the Alto and S-Presso, declined 18.7%, and sales of compact hatchbacks, including some popular models such as the Swift, Baleno, Dzire, and WagonR, fell 15%. Maruti’s overall passenger car sales, excluding SUVs, declined 15.2%. But its SUV sales jumped 33.5%. R.C. Bhargava, Chairman of India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki, says the company had to mark up prices of entry-level cars. “In the past few years, vehicle prices at the entry-level segment went up much faster than buyers’ income levels [of that segment]… Further, the overall inflation scenario resulted in less money for mass-market consumers,” he says. Bhargava says the entry-level car segment can have healthy growth when two-wheeler users can upgrade, but that is still some time away. The two-wheeler market has been giving manufacturers and dealers sleepless nights as demand for entry-level models has been badly affected in rural India. Manish Raj Singhania, President of the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, says the premium end has been doing well. “Anything premium—be it two-wheelers or passenger cars—was doing very well [for the past few years]. That was not a cause of worry. We were worried over the demand in entry-level segments,” says Singhania. After falling for several quarters, sales of two-wheelers, especially in the entry-level segment (up to 125cc), have grown since the festive season in October. Singhania says people suffered during the pandemic, with many losing jobs and savings. Thus, despite being a necessity in the hinterlands, sales of small cars have been hit. Poor sales in the rural market also affected overall industry growth. While demand for entry-level cars has fallen, SUVs, considered premium, have taken the lead and captured nearly 64% of the passenger vehicle market in India. “Also, there has been a significant rise in prices of entry-level cars. But we expect the demand to come back, albeit slowly,” he says. The gap between household types is widening. Gautam Duggad, Head of research for institutional equities at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, says weak growth in rural consumption during the past two years was primarily due to lower disposable income growth and poor monsoons. Rajesh Shukla, MD and CEO of People Research on India’s Consumer Economy (PRICE), says the pandemic has significantly impacted the bottom 60% of India’s income pyramid, eroding savings while increasing debt. “Despite some recovery in this segment post-Covid-19, the lowest 20% still face challenges in returning to their pre-pandemic financial status,” he says. This group, primarily consumers of low-end two-wheelers and FMCG products, now thinks only about essential spending, emergency savings, and repaying debt. \" Aspiration and relevance are increasing in rural areas, but affordability remains challenging. We aim to crack affordability, which we see as a key driver for growth in these markets \" Sudhir Sitapati MD & CEO GCPL High inflation and limited job openings are not helping matters. PRICE’s ICE 360° surveys show that the average annual household income among the poorest 20% has fallen by 21% from Rs 1.4 lakh in 2016 to Rs 1.1 lakh in 2023. If adjusted for inflation, the real income levels in 2023 are even lower. The average annual household income of the upper middle class has increased by 33% and that of the richest 20% by 51%. “The Indian economy is witnessing a significant shift towards premiumisation, driven primarily by the large middle class and affluent consumers who prefer high-end products in segments such as luxury cars, upscale houses, leisure holiday trips, high-end apparel, and personal care,” Shukla says. Growth in premium consumption is not confined to metropolitan elites; the aspirational households in boom towns, niche cities, and developed rural areas contribute significantly to this trend. The financial distress in rural households has hurt manufacturers of consumer products across sectors. Data from Motilal Oswal shows that real agricultural wages contracted by 0.4% in FY24 and 0.8% in the March quarter. Real non-farm wages contracted by 0.1% for the third successive year in FY24, following a contraction of 1.1% in FY23. During the past three years (FY22-FY24), urban consumption has outpaced rural consumption in each quarter, in contrast to FY20-FY21, when rural consumption grew faster. Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist at Bank of Baroda, says high inflation and rising prices have kept demand low. “Demand has been muted in rural and urban areas; demand has come from only one segment. People are spending more on services than goods and sectors such as tourism and hospitality, but here, too, it is only the middle- and high-income groups that are spending,” he says. Sabnavis says bank credit for other personal loans has also been increasing by double digits, and people seem to be borrowing for consumption. Net household savings, which touched a high of Rs 23.29 lakh crore in FY22 as the pandemic-led lockdown and mobility restrictions dampened consumption, have, however, fallen sharply since then due to various factors, including the release of pent-up demand, more credit demand, and the use of savings to fund current expenditure. Per NSO data, gross financial savings of households rose nearly 14% to Rs 29.73 lakh crore in FY23 from Rs 26.11 lakh crore in FY22. Of this, savings in the form of gold and silver ornaments rose to Rs 63,397 crore in FY23 from Rs 61,327 crore in FY22. But financial liabilities of households rose to Rs 15.57 lakh crore in FY23, a 73% jump from Rs 8.99 lakh crore in FY22. \" We have not seen any change, be it in consumption or sales, from rural India. Amul has penetrated rural India very deeply and gets 38% of its sales from centres with a population of fewer than 20,000 \" Jayen Mehta MD GCMMF (Amul) Net household savings in financial instruments fell to Rs 14.16 lakh crore in FY23 from Rs 17.12 lakh crore in the previous fiscal, a multi-year low. Price rises, or increases in the cost of living, have also impacted spending capabilities for many households. Retail inflation has remained above the Reserve Bank of India’s target of 4% (with a leeway of two percentage points either way) for as many as 56 months up to May this year. According to some, the problem is deeper-rooted. “Demonetisation and implementation of GST during 2016-2017 hurt the MSMEs, which support a significant portion of livelihoods… then came the pandemic,” says a former FMCG industry executive who now advises leading corporates. While a full-fledged recovery in demand, especially from rural and low-income households, may be some time away, things are looking up. Sanjiv Puri, President of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), says things are looking up. “We are seeing some green shoots of a pick-up in the rural economy. The monsoon is better, which will help have better crops and this augurs well for the rural economy,” he said at a press conference in mid-June. Sales of two-wheelers at the dealer level have grown by 33% in April, albeit on a low base, continuing a slow recovery that began last October. Maruti Suzuki’s Bhargava says it may take over two years for consumers to return to the small-car market. “Small-car sales will revive after the two-wheeler volumes reclaim their levels before BSVI came into force and prices went up. I guess we have to wait at least till late 2026 before customers are back as the impact of these high prices will be absorbed by the increase in the purchasing power of people in that category,” he says. In the FMCG market, demand from rural households is gaining pace. The latest data from Nielsen IQ shows that while volume offtake in the rural market remained muted till March 2023, volumes have begun to grow. From 4% last July, rural volumes have grown 5.8% in December and at a relatively fair rate of 7.6% in the March quarter. In fact, in that quarter, volume growth in the rural market outpaced the urban growth (5.7%) after more than three years. Mohit Malhotra, CEO of Dabur India, which has greater exposure to the rural market than its peers, is riding the wave. He says there was an uptick in rural consumption in the March quarter, with rural growth ahead of urban for the first time in three years. “Rural growth is kind of coming back. We’ve seen 120-150 basis points improvement in rural India. While urban growth is almost the same or a little bit down, rural growth is picking up, and that’s happening sequentially in the two to three months we have seen,” Malhotra says. From contracting at a rate of 5%, rural growth is now closing towards 6% or growing at 130 basis points ahead of the urban rate, Malhotra says. “We are optimistic that with the expected normal monsoons, improving macroeconomic indicators, government spending, and lower inflation, FMCG demand will see a gradual uptick primarily driven by rural, [and] that augurs well for Dabur,” he says. According to Sudhir Sitapati, MD & CEO of Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), the company has launched a drive to grow rural sales. “One of the areas we are focussing on is rural distribution, particularly for new categories… Aspiration and relevance are increasing in rural areas, but affordability remains challenging. We aim to crack affordability, which we see as a key driver for growth in these markets,” he says. Others like Nestlé’s Narayanan say the market will be watching out for a good monsoon, and with a new government in place, some re-injection of money into the market will help revive demand. \" We’ve seen 120-150 basis points improvement in rural India. While urban growth is almost the same or a little bit down, rural growth is picking up, and that’s happening sequentially in the two to three months we have seen \" Mohit Malhotra CEO Dabur India HUL’s Jawa is also banking on a better monsoon. “Monsoon does have an impact, as we all know. It might not be the only impact, but it impacts the agri economy and rural consumption. And I think in that sense, most likely, the worst is past us, and from here onwards, we do see a gradual recovery in rural consumption,” he said in the April earnings call. He expects urban consumption to remain “more resilient, especially at the premium end”. The one brand that is not worried is Amul, whether in rural or urban India. Demand for its milk and milk products is steady. On June 3, it marked up retail prices of milk. Jayen S. Mehta, MD of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, which owns Amul, says, “We have not seen any change, be it in consumption or sales, from rural India.” Mehta says Amul has penetrated rural India very deeply and gets 38% of its sales from centres with a population of fewer than 20,000. Challenges, however, remain. Repeated increases in milk prices have added to the overall food inflation as value-added dairy products have become costlier. Between July 2021 and June 2024, the price of packaged milk has gone up by 24.5%. Overall, food inflation continues to remain a concern for consumer goods makers. In May, CPI inflation moderated to 4.75%, down from 4.8% in April. But food inflation has stayed above 8.5% for four months up to May 2024. \" We are seeing some green shoots of a pick-up in the rural economy. The monsoon is better which will help have better crops and this augurs well for the rural economy \" Sanjiv Puri President CII Dipti Deshpande, Principal Economist at CRISIL, says, “In May, the food inflation rate remained unchanged at 8.7% as inflation in cereals and pulses rose unexpectedly. We expect some softening from June due to a high base effect.” Meanwhile, white goods makers such as Godrej are sensing a groundswell of demand in the mass-market categories, which Nandi says are now on par with premium ones. But they would like the government to lower taxes on electronics and appliances to make them more affordable. The industry wants GST on large appliances to be lowered from 28% to 18%. “Now, with the election verdict, it is expected that the government will try to prop up rural consumption through some populist measures in the Budget,” says Duggad of Motilal Oswal. Leading players are keeping their fingers crossed: inflation, shifting consumer preferences, and weather-related disruptions could limit the revival. “Last year, companies hoped demand would recover after the rains, but it did not happen. Tractor and two-wheeler sales continue to remain low. The expectation is that demand will recover further this year due to some pent-up demand and the expectation of a good monsoon,” says Sabnavis. Analysts at Motilal Oswal are more cautious. While hopes may be running high and the rural economy—based on its indicators—may not decline again this year, it may be challenging to grow more than 5% in FY25.

    "article_content": "Feedback Navigating the intricacies of startup evaluation within the dynamic realm of investing deters many. Choosing the right parameters and comparing the right multiples requires expertise in the specific sectors and a good grasp of the nature of the market. Venture capitalists (VCs) and other investors employ different criteria and methodologies to evaluate startups at various stages of their growth, from the nascent pre-seed stage to the more mature late-stage. With the green shoots and thawing in the funding winters, this article delves into the evaluation metrics and considerations that investors and VCs focus on throughout the life of a startup. Incubating innovations The pre-seed stage marks the very beginning of a startup’s journey. At this stage, the company is typically just an idea or concept, with a prototype or minimum viable product (MVP) in the works. Funding at this stage is often abstracted to be a bet on the founders. And this is true to some extent, as we look for a strong, cohesive team with a clear vision and complementary skills. Prior experience, industry expertise, and a proven ability to execute often play out to be key to successful ventures. However, as VCs, we also evaluate the uniqueness and potential of the idea, assessing whether the startup addresses a significant problem or gap in the market, and consider the size and growth potential of the target market. Intellectual Property (IP) adds tangible value to startups and is considered a form of risk mitigation by strategic partnerships, collaborations, or acquisitions by larger companies seeking to access innovative technologies or strengthen their IP portfolios. We evaluate the extent to which a startup's IP creates barriers to entry for potential competitors and contributes to long-term value creation. We seek a clear, compelling vision and a well-thought-out plan for turning the idea into a viable business, so early signs of traction, such as user interest, initial customer feedback, or pilot results, can significantly influence investor confidence. The seed stage involves building a more concrete foundation for the startup. At this point, the startup should have an MVP or prototype and initial user feedback. As investors, we want to see how the startup plans to generate revenue and achieve profitability, so the team’s ability to execute the business plan becomes even more critical. Investors assess whether there is a clear and scalable business model and a viable market for the product. This includes evaluating customer feedback, user engagement, and early sales or pilot results. The size and dynamics of the target market are also scrutinized- investors prefer large and growing markets with less competition. While early-stage financials may be speculative, we expect realistic financial projections and a clear understanding of key metrics such as customer acquisition cost (CAC) and lifetime value (LTV). Powering growth phase This period is about scaling the business. At this point, startups should have a solid product, some market validation, early revenue, and a second-level team. We focus on revenue growth, user growth, and other key performance indicators (KPIs) like ARPU and GMV because consistent and robust growth, position in the market, and competitive advantages inform the funding decision at this stage. For example, effective customer acquisition strategies and high retention rates are critical indicators that we scrutinize in relation to CAC and MAU to paint a clearer picture. It acts as an indicator of revenue predictability and stability. We look for efficient operations and evaluate how effectively the startup is using its capital to achieve growth and managing factors influencing the Churn Rate. This includes evaluating the scalability of the product, business model, and operational processes in a highly competitive environment. A clear and defensible market position is essential at this stage. For some startups, this could happen with traction on the overseas front. Following this phase, funding is used to expand the business, enter new markets, and further scale operations. By this stage, the business model should be well-established and proven. Investors look for consistent revenue streams and a clear path to profitability with plans for market expansion, including crucial geographic and product line extensions. Investors would want to see strategies and opportunities for capturing a larger market share. Detailed financial and operational metrics, such as gross margins, customer lifetime value, and churn rates, are closely analyzed. The startup’s organizational structure and management team are evaluated for their ability to handle rapid growth. This includes assessing the quality of hires and the effectiveness of internal processes. We also examine the startup’s approach to risk management, including regulatory compliance, intellectual property protection, and contingency planning. Demystifying late stage growth By Late-stage funding, the startup should be a well-established player in its industry. Usually, Investors focus on the potential for a successful exit, such as an IPO or acquisition. This includes analyzing the IPO readiness, potential acquirers, and overall market conditions. However, funding at this stage also facilitates plans for strategic initiatives, such as entering new verticals or acquiring other companies, which are assessed for their potential to drive growth. This includes a deep evaluation of competitive dynamics and market share. Detailed financial performance, including profitability, revenue growth, and cost management, is scrutinized to ascertain the startup’s position as a market leader or strong contender. Strong corporate governance practices and a capable board of directors are essential. Investors want assurance that the company is well-managed and positioned for long-term success. The intrinsic value of a startup depends on its sector. There are many innovative approaches to evaluating startups and novel metrics to study. You can look into the Scorecard Valuation Method or Berkus Method, but the success of startups hinges on a few fundamental factors and a good understanding of market potential. It starts with gauging the scalability in technology and business operations that pave the way for rapid expansion and market penetration, with diversifying revenue streams that mitigate risk and ensure stability.

    "article_content": "Feedback The concept of sustainability has undergone a remarkable evolution in the last 50 years. What started as a niche idea has now matured into a global imperative affecting every aspect of human life. A pivotal moment was the Brundtland Commission Report in 1987, which helped mainstream the idea of sustainable development. In the early 2000s, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and CSR gained popularity and today, sustainability has transitioned from its green origins to embracing a more human-centric approach that recognises the interplay between social, economic, and environmental dimensions. India stands at the forefront of this paradigm shift. Its commitment to sustainable development is evident through its ambitious climate policies and targets, and India Inc.’s push for adopting sustainable practices. The government is focussing on various levers like renewables, EVs, green hydrogen, material circularity, etc. to realise its ambitious goals. One notable initiative is Mission LiFE launched at COP26—an India-led movement transforming individuals into “pro-planet people”. Additionally, government initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Mission and the Ujjwala Scheme ensure sustainability efforts are inclusive. Indian companies are increasingly realising the importance of ESG in driving long-term value creation and are adopting sustainable practices to minimise their environmental footprint. Per data, India is leading the emerging economies, with around 79 Indian companies committed to the Science-Based Targets Initiative. Additionally, the introduction of frameworks like the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), along with Sebi’s mandate on BRSR reporting for the top 1,000 listed companies are noteworthy developments. However, despite the progress, a huge gap remains between the organisations’ sustainability intentions and their execution capabilities. A PwC report from April 2024 reveals a mere 31% of companies are disclosing their net-zero targets and only 51% of companies are disclosing their Scope 3 data in India, which serves as a reminder of the gap between the commitments and reality—showcasing how corporates are failing to humanise sustainability. This highlights the urgent need for a mindset shift—moving away from token gestures to genuine transformation. Sustainability needs to move beyond the boardrooms of corporations or corridors of government to the individual level, where it becomes ingrained in people’s consciousness. Making human-centric sustainability a lived reality requires a multi-faceted approach. One of the key strategies for achieving this transformational shift is through education and awareness. Organisations should prioritise investing in employee training and education. Additionally, sustainability training plays a critical role in aligning with business goals and contributes to long-term growth.ReNew’s Project Surya aims to reshape the lives of 1,000 low-income women by helping them leapfrog into the modern clean energy sector, providing them with better livelihoods. Additionally, ReNew is training the youth through a first-of-its-kind climate curriculum aligned with the core principles of the LiFE movement. As the climate crisis intensifies, the curriculum aims to prepare the next generation to join the movement and lead a more sustainable lifestyle. Further, corporations and governments should look at humanising sustainability by giving it a face that the masses can relate to. Appointing ambassadors and recognising champions is an effective way to communicate with diverse communities. The efforts do not stop here. Brands can play a critical role in popularising sustainability and influencing consumer behaviour. A 2017 study reveals that 87% of consumers have a positive image of a company that supports social and environmental issues, and 88% of consumers remain loyal to them. The role of effective leadership cannot be overstated. Top executives must inspire and motivate employees at all levels by integrating sustainability into the core business strategy. Lastly, humanising sustainability requires a fundamental shift, one that moves beyond traditional notions of success and embraces the well-being of humanity and the planet. Human-centric sustainability requires us to acknowledge that growth should not come at the cost of people’s rights, health, and quality of life. It is about having a more equitable society. At the core, it’s about cultivating a more fulfilling and sustainable lifestyle, in favour of a simpler way of living. As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, leadership and collaboration will drive this transformation. Moving forward, we should consider humanising sustainability as a survival imperative, where leaders, corporations, and individuals converge to navigate a holistic future. Views are personal.

    "article_content": "Feedback Nearly one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 originated from sectors like iron & steel, manufacturing, construction, etc. These sectoral greenhouse gas emissions pose a significant challenge due to technological and financial hurdles and are classified as “hard-to-abate” (HTA) sectors. Current commercially available decarbonisation technologies (renewables, energy efficiency, electrification, etc.) can only achieve 50-60% reductions—closing the gap, therefore, necessitates developing newer solutions. Particularly for HTA sectors, hydrogen has been identified as a key solution. Many of these sectors require chemical feedstocks, or heavy-duty freight solutions, and face significant barriers towards using low-carbon technologies like renewables. Clean hydrogen offers a versatile alternative, capable of direct use in fuel cells, and as feedstock for producing derivatives, making it crucial for addressing limitations of renewables and enabling deep decarbonisation. It is projected that beyond 2030, clean hydrogen demand from HTA sectors could exceed 150 million tonnes per annum (MTPA). While ‘Clean Hydrogen’ has various production pathways, Green Hydrogen (GH2), produced through electrolysis using renewable energy (RE), is the most scalable, clean, and safe method and is likely to see the greatest adoption. This is where the opportunity lies for India to play a significant part in the global value chain. India has the fourth largest installed RE (around 5% of global capacity). The RE market in India is cost competitive with tariffs at $30-50 per Megawatt hour (MWh), lower than countries like Australia, the US, and EU. Setting up RE is the most expensive step in GH2 production with round-the-clock RE amounting to 50-70% of total project cost. India, therefore, possesses a noticeable cost advantage. This becomes even more apparent, when compared with the landed cost of green ammonia, which is $800-1,000 per MT for delivery from Middle East to the Far East. Industry players believe that landed cost of green ammonia exported from India to destinations like Japan or South Korea will be in a similar range, if not lower. Further, as technology matures, production costs are expected to decline and provide further impetus towards making India cost-competitive. Why the Urgency? Global hydrogen ambitions, driven by stakeholders rushing to comply with regulations, creates a definitive call to action for all prospective producers of GH2 worldwide. Upon reviewing global hydrogen capacities and commitments to ‘Net Zero’ by countries and companies, particularly in HTA sectors, it appears that 2030 will be a pivotal year with significant increases in both demand and supply. Case in point is the EU RE Directive, which mandates 42% of industrial hydrogen to be green by 2030. Other significant markets like Japan and South Korea, too, have set targets. From a supply perspective, too, significant GH2 production capacity is expected to come online globally by 2030. This makes it imperative for India to invest, develop, and scale the ecosystem. While India may not be the first mover, it can establish itself as the leader by creating cost efficiencies, offering stable supply, and cementing partnerships worldwide. Enabling India’s Ambitions To leverage these advantages and fulfil its ambitions of becoming a global hydrogen hub, India must also implement several key enablers: 1. Empower the Grid: Typical transmission infrastructure construction timelines can range up to three years or more, while solar and wind projects are usually completed in under two years. As India scales RE capacity, it also needs to invest in building a robust, reliable, and climate resistant transmission network to effectively evacuate RE power. 2. Boost Electrolyser Manufacturing: Currently, India is short of local electrolyser manufacturing capacity and requires 60-100 GW to meet the 5 MTPA target set by the government. The industry, hence, needs to step-up with more R&D and manufacturing capacity to bridge the gap. 3. Mandate Demand to Ramp-up Supply: As entrepreneurs seek to establish and scale GH2 and derivatives capacity, the government can help accelerate final investment decision (FID) in these projects by assuring a minimum demand offtake through mandates. 4. Incentives & Subsidies: The central and some state governments have provided significant incentives for GH2/derivatives manufacturing and RE by waiving electricity duties, additional and cross-subsidy surcharges, and capital subsidies to help reduce the overall cost of production. More states with GH2 potential need to join the movement to further encourage investment in this space. 5. Develop Cost-effective GH2 Export Infra at Ports: The Indian government has identified Kandla, Thoothukudi, and Paradip ports for development as GH2 hubs for handling and shipping GH2/derivatives. As part of the Harit Sagar initiative, the government has issued guidelines for 13 major ports to establish green ammonia bunkering/refueling facilities by 2035, which will be needed as production rises. The government has taken many initial steps to kick-start the GH2 economy in India. However, competition from the EU, Middle East, and Australia is fierce. To stay ahead, we are likely to witness continued launch of concerted programmes in India encompassing regulatory policies and incentives, to drive production and cross-sector adoption as well as export of GH2. GH2 offers India a golden opportunity to emerge as a global energy powerhouse—action is crucial. Views are personal. Anujesh Dwivedi is a partner, Deloitte. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback At 8.2%, India’s FY24 GDP growth is the talk of the global economy. And the economy will continue to grow at a healthy clip despite the increasing base. The Reserve Bank of India, for instance, has upped its FY25 growth forecast from 7% to 7.2%. But it’s not as if there aren’t gaps in this growth story. For long the subject of discussion among economists, the consumption economy is evidence that this growth is uneven. And this uneven growth—where the upper end of consumers spend higher amounts while the mass market and rural economy are yet to come back to pre-pandemic levels—continues to affect consumer-facing businesses. The FMCG sector, seen widely as the barometer of the consumption economy, is still coming to grips with the stress in the mass- consumption and rural segments. India’s branded FMCG market, valued at Rs 5 lakh crore and the world’s fourth largest, has been feeling the pinch, with volume offtake having fallen continuously since 2022. Inflationary pressures and a weaker-than-expected monsoon affected the FMCG sector in FY24 as well. However, the upper end of the market, not just in FMCG but also in consumer durables and cars, has continued to grow. High-end TVs are witnessing robust demand, while carmakers are seeing higher sales of SUVs even as smaller passenger cars see dipping sales. This paradox is also reflected by studies like the PRICE ICE 360° survey, which shows that the average annual household income among the poorest 20% has fallen by 21% from Rs 1.4 lakh in 2016 to Rs 1.1 lakh in 2023. Adjusted for inflation, the real income levels in 2023 are even lower. On the other hand, the average annual household income of the upper middle class has risen 33% and that of the richest 20% by 51%. In our cover story, Arnab Dutta and Surabhi take a close look at the consumption conundrum that FMCG and other consumer-facing businesses are facing. But there is optimism since green shoots are visible of late. Data from Nielsen IQ shows that while volume offtake in the rural market for FMCG products remained muted till March 2023, things have begun to improve. From 4% in July last year, rural volumes have grown by 5.8% in December and at a relatively fair rate of 7.6% in the March quarter. Though volume growth in the rural market in January-March outpaced the urban volume growth (5.7%), it took more than three years for this to happen. There is cautious optimism now, and hope that with increased government spends aimed at the bottom of the pyramid and a good monsoon, this uptrend could continue. Talking of government spends, Surabhi and Richa Sharma get you glimpses of what Modinomics 3.0—the economic agenda of the new NDA government—could contain. The consensus among experts is that fiscal consolidation will remain a priority, but with greater dependence on allies like the TDP and the JD(U), the government will have to look at measures to keep them satisfied. All eyes will be on the Budget now. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited. For reprint rights: Syndications Today Add Business Today to Home Screen Home Market BT TV Reels Menu Menu"

    "article_content": "Feedback For long the subject of discussion among economists, the consumption economy is evidence that this growth is uneven. And this uneven growth—where the upper end of consumers spend higher amounts while the mass market and rural economy are yet to come back to pre-pandemic levels—continues to affect consumer-facing businesses. These D-Street veterans are some of the most astute investors who are on the hunt for investment opportunities outside the listed space, to get smart returns whenever these start-ups get listed or when valuations go up and they want to exit. Over 10 years since it stormed into India in 2013, Amazon has spread its wings across businesses and platforms. And although it faces stiff competition, it also has a robust business strategy The top companies in this year’s list demonstrate a culture of empathy, the willingness to invest in and provide flexibility to employees and embrace diversity and inclusion as key tenets of their HR strategy. As BT unveils the mystery of Megha and its rise, what comes through is the story of an ambitious regional EPC company, India’s second-largest by revenue We bring you this year’s BT-PwC India’s Best CEOs list—a line-up of India’s sharpest and most effective business leaders who have guided their companies through choppy waters and remained resilient in the wake of unforeseen challenges Central to the new Zomato growth menu is Blinkit (formerly Grofers), the quick commerce company Goyal bought for a substantial Rs 4,447 crore in June 2022. That was a big bet at a time when the Zomato stock was floundering, and the investors had to be convinced the deal was worth going for despite the steep asking price. But Goyal went with his instinct and picked up Blinkit, which today is one of the key reasons why it is racing towards what could be its first full year of profits. The aspiration is to hit $7 trillion by 2030. This momentum has been brought about by a few key factors—a big push on infrastructure spending by the government, a massive focus on leveraging digital public infrastructure, and a clean-up of bank balance sheets enabling them to push lending for growth. The buzz around GIFT City was in ample evidence at the recent Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit, where the PM and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman underscored the seriousness of the government’s intent to ensure the IFSC becomes a major player in the frenetic world of global finance. Today, the buzzword across the Indian start-up ecosystem is ‘profitability’. Chastened by earlier setbacks, both VCs and start-ups are realising that the path to profitability is the only route to survival: start-ups must have a clear profitability game plan, and be sustainable and scaleable. If there was an award for the most number of pivots, twists and turns in strategy, e-commerce firm Snapdeal, founded by the duo of Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal, would qualify hands down. From the financial sector to manufacturing, entertainment and the pharma sector, women leaders are showing the way, proving to be role models not just for other women, but also men. The trend then is long-term bullishness with short-term volatility. Amid this choppiness, Indian bellwether companies have, by and large, fared well, and held their ground as far as market performance is concerned. The BT500, the much-awaited ranking of India’s most valuable companies—where we rank the Top 500 in terms of their average market capitalisation (m-cap)—reflects this. Ever since the pandemic subsided, Indians have come out in droves, with revenge shopping initially, and then backing it up subsequently with some serious spending on luxury goods and experiences. Not surprisingly, various estimates peg India’s luxury market to grow rapidly over the next few years, as global brands make a beeline for Indians’ wallets and the country’s luxury brands capture the imagination of the world. Amul, under MD Jayen S. Mehta, is putting in place a strategy that involves cashing in on adjacencies and grabbing the opportunity in organic food products. The $3-billion Indian online gaming industry was growing smartly. Then came the onslaught in the form of the 28 per cent GST from the government. What this has done is throw the gaming industry—which has also spawned unicorns— into disarray, with many of them looking to downsize in the wake of the tax burden that they feel makes their operations unviable. The Chandrayaan mission’s success has also rubbed off positively on around 400 private sector firms that have, over the years, formed part of the vendor ecosystem for the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), the agency that forms the core of India’s space programmes. With a net worth of Rs 1.2 lakh crore, Ambani is keen to leverage his balance sheet and draw on Reliance’s huge footprint across telecom and retail to leapfrog into the financial services space Buffeted by problems from all sides, Think and Learn—the corporate name Byju’s goes by—is battling a sharp valuation markdown from one of its investors, Prosus, which has reduced the firm’s valuation from the earlier $22 billion (which made it the world’s most valued edtech firm) to just $5.1 billion now. With the world’s top leaders set to arrive for the G20 Heads of State and Government Summit in Delhi in September, India, by way of the G20 presidency this year, has emerged as the driving force in a wide range of areas, wielding enormous influence in shaping the future of the world. At the centre of all this is Prime Minister Narendra Modi Cut to August 2023, and Adani appears to be succeeding in getting his beleaguered group out of the crisis. While a Securities and Exchange Board of India probe into the allegations is ongoing, the group is working overtime to ensure it balances its growth ambitions with its capex plans, even as it deleverages key companies and cleans up their balance sheets.

    "article_content": "Feedback Vodafone Idea FPO: Aditya Birla Group Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla called Vodafone Idea's follow-on public offer (FPO) as a turning point for India's telecom industry, adding that the event marked the \"start of Voda Idea 2.0\". Shares of Vodafone Idea rebounded more than 11 per cent in the trading session on Thursday after the securities issue in FPO were listed. The stock kicked-off the trading session at Rs 11.80 but was seen at Rs 13.10 within a few minutes, as the session progressed and buyers lapped up shares near the FPO price of Rs 11. At the Vodafone Idea FPO ceremony at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) , Birla said the firm will stage a strong comeback after the fundraising. Birla said robust engagement from both foreign and national investors in the FPO was heartening, adding that the country deserved three telecom players. He said AB Group is committed to telecom with a cumulative investment of ₹1,70,000 crore. He further said the proceeds of the fund raise have been earmarked for a significant capex. Incorporated in March 1995, Vodafone Idea is a telecommunications player, which provides voice, data, and value-added services across 2G, 3G, and 4G technologies, such as short messaging and digital services for enterprises and consumers. It offers mobile and fixed services to more than 30 crore customers in 17 countries. Jefferies India, Axis Capital and SBI Capital Markets are the book running lead managers of the Vodafone Idea FPO, while Link Intime India is the registrar for the issue.

    "article_content": "Feedback BofA Securities has upgraded Vodafone Idea 's rating as it believes it offers highest leverage for tariff hike as pure-play telecom operator. BofA believes a 5 per cent average revenue per user (ARPU) jump leads to 12 per cent earnings per share (EPS) increase Vodafone Idea. Vodafone Idea is seen to improve its 4G network coverage on the back of its recent fund raise. BofA Securities said it should help arrest market share decline and make it competitively better placed. That said: \"VIL is not a Buy as we await further clarity on funding position improvement post FY26 as the spectrum moratorium ends. Our FY25/26 EPS moves to Rs (2.7 oer share)/(1.5 per share) as we factor recent capital raise. We reduce our WACC to 10.1 per cent from 10.6 per cent and roll forward our DCF. Our PO increases by to Rs 14.50 from Rs 9.40 earlier,\" BofA said in a May 2 note. BofA has also upped it target for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Industries Ltd and believes Indus Towers to be an indirect beneficiary of tariff hikes. \"We also increase Bharti & Jio Ebitda to factor higher hikes. Our Bharti EPS rises by 5-6 per cent and but RIL EPS reduces by 2-3 per cent (due to higher D&A). We think Bharti/RIL would likely use improving cash-flows to invest/grow their fibre broadband, enterprise, data centre and digital biz. Most of these are high margin sticky businesses, helping these companies diversify cash-flows from cellular biz and add new growth drivers,\" it said. The brokerage has a price target of Rs 1,430 on Bharti Airtel against Rs 1,300. It suggested a target price of Rs 3,340 on RIL from Rs 3,250 earlier. On Indus Towers, BofA Securities said Vodafone Idea's improving cashflows should aid business in terms of sustained business and better multiple. It also factored in new 4G/5G tenancies from Vodafone Idea on back of its recent fund-raise. \"As a result, our FY25-26 EPS moves up by 2-4 per cent and outer years’ EPS increases as well. We also reduce our WACC to 10.3 per cent from 10.8 per cent. Our PO moves to Rs 410. Indus Towers trades at FY25E Ebitda of 7.2 times vs average global multiple of 12 times,\" it said.

    "article_content": "Feedback Consumers plagued by constant promotional calls might soon find relief as the Centre is getting ready to introduce new guidelines, sources told Business Today TV. These rules will crack down on unwanted calls from unregistered phone numbers, imposing fines and labeling them as unfair trade practices. It's the first time penalties are being considered for violating privacy and infringing on consumer rights. The government's proposal includes holding banks, insurance firms, real estate developers, brokers, and other entities responsible for contacting people through unregistered numbers, as outlined by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). Sources further added that three separate series of numbers is being planned to enable consumers to identify the numbers and the purpose of the call. '140' for Marketing, '160' for service calls and '111' for communication by government agencies to inform citizens. Recently, the Consumer Affairs Department discussed these issues with various stakeholders and distributed draft guidelines to handle the issue. Stakeholders included Department of Telecommunications, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL), Airtel, Vodafone, and Reliance Jio, Cellular Operators Association of India and other regulatory bodies, the official added. The upcoming rules, titled 'Guidelines for Unsolicited and Unwarranted Business Communication 2024', aim to hold accountable companies benefiting from these unsolicited calls, especially those made by commission agents linked with banks, insurance firms, and real estate companies. Such calls are deemed misleading and unfair under sections 2(28) and 2(47) of the Consumer Protection Act 2019. Additionally, the proposed guidelines will forbid any calls that violate TRAI's number series regulations and go against the consumer's consent and preferences. Telecom service providers will be mandated to prevent unethical practices and will face consequences for non-compliance, including punitive measures. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_content": "Feedback Mukesh Ambani is reportedly venturing into Africa in his chase for mobile broadband customers beyond India. Ambani will be offering a range of 5G shared network infrastructure solutions along with a Ghana-based company. Radisys, a Reliance Industries arm, will reportedly provide key infrastructure, applications and smartphones for Next-Gen InfraCo, which is planning to begin operations by the end of this year. The company “is based on a premise of building affordable digital services in emerging markets,” Harkirit Singh, the executive director of NGIC, was quoted in a Bloomberg report. Bharti Airtel runs mobile broadband services in 14 African countries. The Sunil Bharti Mittal-led company is the second-largest telecom operator in the continent. NGIC owns exclusive right to offer 5G services in Ghana for a decade, though its license is valid for 15 years. The company’s capital expenditure for three years is $145 million, according to report. The company is looking to replicate the success of Ambani’s Jio Infocomm. NGIC is flanked by Nokia Oyj, Tech Mahindra Ltd., and Microsoft, which recently intensified its focus on the telecom sector after bringing two cloud networking companies under its flank in 2020. Ghana has three main operators: MTN Ghana, Vodafone Ghana and state-run AirtelTigo. Singh feels NGIC's partners, combined with its technological capabilities and 5G license, give the company an edge in the market. Two African firms — Ascend Digital Solutions Ltd. and K-NET — hold 55% in the new company. The Ghana government will own just under 10% of NGIC, while local mobile operators and private investors will retain the remaining shares in the firm. The Reliance-NGIC partnership is also a diplomatic win for India, which has sought to counter China’s surging influence in Africa via measures such as digital inclusion. Reliance does not own any equity in NGIC at present but NGIC may provide option to accept part of their payments as equity in the future, Singh told Bloomberg.

    "article_content": "Feedback As much as 99 per cent of portfolio management schemes managed to make money for their high networth clients during the second quarter of FY24. The benchmark equity index BSE Sensex gained just 1.71 per cent to 65,828.41 on September 30, from 64,718.56 on June 30. On the other hand, the broader BSE MidCap and BSE SmallCap indices gained 12.39 per cent and 15.21 per cent, respectively, during Q2FY24. With a gain of 41.62 per cent, Invasset LLP’s Growth Pro Max Fund emerged as the top gainer in the list. It was followed by Aequitas Investment Consultancy’s India Opportunities Product (up 30.14 per cent) and Samvitti Capital’s PMS Active Alpha Multicap (up 27.50 per cent). While sharing the mantra of the outperformance of Growth Pro Max Fund, Anirudh Garg, Partner and Head of Research, Invasset, said it is a quant-based Portfolio Management Service (PMS) firm, where a quantitative algorithm entirely drives the decision-making process. Garg added that they follow four investment styles. Firstly, there’s value investing, involving the calculation of intrinsic value using discounted cash flow, and acquiring assets below this value with the intention of selling them above it. “Additionally, we place significant emphasis on special situations, change-based investing, and growth investing, predicated on the idea that each bull market introduces a new leader,” he said. The money manager also said their third investing style is commonly known as quality-focused investing, closely aligned with the strategies employed by legendary investors like Warren Buffett and Bharat Shah. “This approach involves the acquisition of assets with high Return on Capital (ROC), high Return on Equity (ROE), robust free cash flows, effective management, substantial market share, and a steadfast long-term commitment to their respective sectors,” he said, adding that the fourth style is pension fund investing, aimed at achieving returns surpassing those offered by fixed deposits. “At Invasset, we have amalgamated these four distinct investment styles,” Garg said in an interaction with Business Today last month. The last change they made in the portfolio was in November 2022. Commenting on Samvitti Capital’s PMS Active Alpha Multicap, Prabhakar Kudva, Director and Portfolio Manager, Samvitti Capital told Business Today last month that they worked on building models that help them identify sectors and businesses with significant earnings tailwinds. This includes sectors such as defence, PSU banks and power. Data collated by PMS Bazaar further highlighted that other PMS schemes including Badjate Stock & Shares’ Aggressive and Green Lantern Capital’s Growth Fund also gained over 25 per cent during Q2. Credent Asset Management’s Growth Portfolio (up 24.90 per cent), Investsavvy Portfolio Management LLP’s Alpha Fund (up 24.64 per cent), Maximal Capital’s Pathfinder Value Fund (up 23.70 per cent), Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates’ Ace Midcap (up 23.36 per cent) and Ace Multicap schemes (22.89 per cent) also managed to get the place in the top 10 gainers in Q2FY24.

    "article_content": "Feedback Over the last six months, small-cap investments have generated significant wealth for investors. While the benchmark index BSE Sensex saw a modest 4.52 per cent rise from May to October, the BSE MidCap and BSE SmallCap indices witnessed substantial rallies, surging by 23 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively, in the same period. Notably, Equitree Capital Advisors’ Emerging Opportunities small-cap PMS scheme delivered an impressive 56.07 per cent return to its investors during this timeframe. In an interaction with Business Today , Pawan Bharadia, MD of Equitree Capital Advisors, explained that as a deep value investor, his firm strategically invests in under-researched companies with strong fundamentals. “We are generally the first professional investors in these categories of companies. Our long-term investment approach ensures exceptional returns for our investors and has made us one of the top performing PMS,” he said adding the average holding period of companies are three-five years. Equitree Capital Advisors’ Emerging Opportunities gained 5.83 per cent in October when the BSE Sensex and broader indices declined 3.38 per cent. The strategy has delivered a 32.98 per cent CAGR return in the past two years and a 53.85 per cent in the past three years. He added that the aim is to accompany these businesses throughout their entire growth trajectory. “If the underlying businesses experience a 25-30 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and considering our early-stage investments, the valuations appear quite reasonable. As these businesses progress and mature, it attracts the attention of larger institutional investors, resulting in a performance reminiscent of a multi-bagger,” explained Bharadia. He further added that they are sector agnostic. “We do a reasonable level of due diligence of the business, promoters and the management while investing,” the market watcher said, adding their average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 15-16 times, which is not expensive. Bharadia, who prefers to keep 12-15 stocks in the portfolio, added that the domestic equity markets may see some volatility going ahead due to the forthcoming elections. However, being a long-term investor one should use this volatility and build a long-term portfolio for wealth creation. While sharing his views on various sectors, he added that banking as a sector should do well. “Our large focus is on manufacturing, engineering and infrastructure businesses. China plus one thing is playing out and now the Europe plus one thing playing out. Many of these companies established in the global supply chain are emerging as the biggest beneficiaries,” he said adding infrastructure continues to be a very large opportunity in the Indian context.

    "article_content": "Feedback The ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, which began on October 7, remained on top of market participants’ minds through the week. After falling more than 450 points in a knee-jerk reaction on Monday (October 9), the benchmark equity index BSE Sensex settled 0.43 per cent, or 287 points, higher at 66,283 for the week ended October 13. Meanwhile, the headwinds pushed crude oil prices higher by 3.5 per cent in the past five trading sessions. Will the continuing geopolitical confrontation between Israel and Hamas bear any influence on the Indian markets? Also, what would be the best strategy for investors? Anand Shah, Head-PMS and AIF Investments, ICICI Prudential AMC, in an interaction with Business Today said it is too early to predict the outcome of the conflict and its long-term impact on commodity markets, but it will be safe to assume that in the near term energy prices will remain elevated. Given that the world is already dealing with inflation, this will be an additional burden on countries that are susceptible to imported inflation. “The long-term impact of the Israel-Hamas war on Indian equity markets is likely to be muted. However, in the short term, given India’s high dependency on oil and gas, this may be marginally negative for the Indian economy and equity markets. Whilst in the medium term, if the conflict escalates, and if energy prices remain high, it could keep inflation levels high leading to higher interest rates for longer. Elevated inflation for longer can potentially depress equity market valuations globally,” Shah said. Asked what strategy one should adopt amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions and state and general elections in the coming months, Shah added that the impact of geopolitical tensions and elections have always been transient and they have no bearing on the long-term performance of broader markets. “We advise investors not to alter their investment strategy and stick to one’s own asset allocation strategy with discipline. The macro events may impact prospects of individual sectors and/or companies and thus we as active fund managers would have to adjust the portfolios accordingly,” he added. Shah remains positive on select manufacturing, manufacturing-allied businesses and banks. On the other hand, he is underweight on select consumer, technology and pharma businesses. “The capital-intensive businesses (which are also cyclical in nature) went through challenging times from 2010 to 2020. Their profitability dipped due to low pricing power and high leverage (debt to equity) as they came out of the 2003-11 capex cycle. Since then, the leading businesses within this space have not only fixed their balance sheet but have also improved their competitiveness. From here on we see that they will not only benefit from their business restructuring but also cyclically benefit from lower competitiveness. This is likely to lead to better pricing power resulting in higher profit growth and superior ROE,” Shah said. Of late, ICICI Prudential PMS Contra Strategy, which has completed its five years, managed to deliver around 20 per cent CAGR return to investors since September 2018. The figure shows the strategy has turned a lump sum investment of Rs 1 crore to around Rs 2.4 crore during the same period. Sharing his view on the success of the strategy, Shah said their call on companies in sectors like manufacturing (metals, industrial products, and auto ancillaries) and manufacturing allied (logistics, corporate banks, and utilities) which are coming out of tough macro cycle contributed to the strategy’s success. “Revival in earnings in all these sectors aided the portfolio in generating a reasonable alpha over its benchmark. This was primarily due to the investment framework (BMV) set in place to identify resilient businesses which can offer better growth potential at reasonable valuations. The portfolio also benefitted from businesses that have high entry barriers, sectors that are in the consolidation phase or companies that are in a special situation,” he said adding banks, ferrous metals, telecom, finance and transport services form the top five sectors of the portfolio at present. Commenting on the ongoing Q2 result season, Shah said the overall earnings growth to be driven by select cyclical, industrial and capital goods players which is a key positive from our standpoint. A few sectors could report strong numbers albeit on a low base. The delayed festive season could weigh on the margins and profitability of consumer-facing companies.

    "article_content": "Feedback Ace money manager Siddhartha Bhaiya-led portfolio management services advisory Aequitas Investment Consultancy on December 18 announced temporarily suspending the inflow of funds into their domestic PMS and AIF. Data collated by PMS Bazaar showed that Aequitas Investment Consultancy’s India Opportunities Product PMS scheme has topped the chart in terms of one-year performance. The scheme has delivered an 86.88 per cent return to investors in the last one year till November 30. The announcement came at a time when the benchmark BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty are hovering at their record high levels. Aequitas CAT-3 Long Only AIF scheme Aequitas Equity Scheme-1 also gained the most 84.65 per cent in the past one year. Aequitas Investment Consultancy in a note said that the decision has been made due to our minimum margin of safety requirements before investing in stocks. “We continue to remain bullish on the long-term prospects of both our country and our portfolio holdings. However, the current frenetic and euphoric rally in the small and midcap index over the last 6 months has reduced the number of stocks that fit within our valuation framework,” it said adding they see a bubble building in the IPO and SME markets. The spate of QIPs and secondary offerings is also sucking out the liquidity from the system. Aequitas further said that despite these challenges, the valuation and growth prospects for our portfolio companies look reasonable and they will continue to hold them. On a year-to-date basis, the BSE Sensex has gained over 17 per cent so far to 71,315.09 on December 18, 2023 against 60,840.74 on December 30 last year. The NSE Nifty index also advanced 18 per cent during the same period. The BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices have also rallied over 40 per cent each YTD. “Our offshore fund which is currently in a very nascent stage will continue to accept funds. For those of you who are contemplating /are in the process of opening accounts with us, we would encourage that the accounts be opened so that all administrative activities are completed so that we are primed to infuse capital when the fund manager is comfortable,” Aequitas said.

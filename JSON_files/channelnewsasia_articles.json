Yellen told a news briefing in Atlanta that Biden's new tariffs are aimed at protecting electric vehicles , solar energy products and semiconductors from excess Chinese capacity created by Beijing's over-investment. The administration refuses to allow US firms in these sectors \"to be put out of business\" by coordinated Chinese dumping of exports, she said. Other countries are taking similar actions, Yellen said, noting this month's G7 leaders statement opposing China's industrial and business policies. Related: New US tariffs will not lead to a full-blown trade war with China, say observers Commentary: What do Biden’s big new China tariffs mean for the rest of the world? But Biden's tariff announcement last month left in place punitive duties of up to 25 per cent on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of other Chinese imports, from toys to internet routers, which were imposed by Trump in 2018 and 2019 under a Section 301 investigation into China's misappropriation of US intellectual property. \"Given that China has not done anything, really, to address those concerns, we thought it was inappropriate to remove those tariffs,\" Yellen said. Asked about Trump's proposals to impose a 10 per cent tariff on all goods imported into the US, and 60 per cent or more on Chinese goods, Yellen said they \"would affect all of our trade partners and all of our trade\". \"And I believe that is a substantial enough programme that it would both raise costs to consumers broadly on all the imports they buy and harm American businesses, many of whom rely on imported goods for their supply chains,\" she said. \"It would significantly raise their costs.\" Related: G7 summit turns to simmering tensions with China Source: Reuters/fs Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Subscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Download here Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Join here Related Topics China tariffs Janet Yellen Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-gLFZnrJLOLc')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-aQnJMIU0bys')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-8e8G0xCqBgA')); Also worth reading Content is loading...

Nasyrah Abdul Rohim Jalelah Abu Baker @JalelahCNA Nasyrah Abdul Rohim & Jalelah Abu Baker 15 Apr 2024 04:57PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Patients with depression who have not responded to conventional psychiatric treatment may soon be able to get more personalised care, thanks to a new method currently being trialled. Doctors will be able to zoom in and stimulate a specific spot in a patient's brain to attempt to treat the treatment-resistant depression, by using an individualised functional MRI to find the ideal location. The existing method treats the same spot for all patients. Two clinical pilots on the new treatment are being conducted by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in collaboration with National University of Singapore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. They will run concurrently till March 2026. A first in the region, the trials will study the efficacy of such treatment called personalised Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), IMH and NUS said in a media statement on Friday (Apr 12). “The hope is if it works for treatment-resistant depression, it will be extended to other hard-to-treat conditions, perhaps things like obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, autism and other conditions,” said Dr Tor Phern Chern, senior consultant at IMH’s Department of Mood & Anxiety, and head of Neurostimulation Service. WHO THE TRIALS WILL BENEFIT Both trials will only recruit individuals who have undergone conventional psychiatric treatment for depression and failed to achieve remission, and they will be screened for suitability. Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder among adults in Singapore. The 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study showed that 6.3 per cent of the Singapore adult population – or one in 16 adults aged 18 and above – has experienced the disorder at some point in their lifetime. However, depression is a treatable condition. Mild cases may be managed with psychotherapy, while moderate to severe cases are typically managed with antidepressant medication to alleviate the symptoms, the media statement said. Related: Commentary: Do you really have a mental disorder? Or are you just going through a tough time? 'It’s okay to seek help': Why do people in Singapore struggle with mental health issues? But some patients do not respond well to medication, failing two courses of different drug treatments – where a course would consist of adequate doses taken over a four- to eight-week duration, and with adequate adherence during a major depressive episode. Such patients may see an alleviation but not a remission in their symptoms despite having been compliant with taking their antidepressants. Clinically, this is known as treatment-resistant depression. There are no local studies on the prevalence of such depression. HOW IT WORKS “For everyone, the pattern of brain networks is different. So, for every person, where (we) should be targeting (for treatment) is different,” said Associate Professor Thomas Yeo from the Centre for Sleep and Cognition at NUS. Assoc Prof Yeo, along with a research fellow, developed an algorithm to identify the unique spot in the brain. He added that with improvements in technology, a scan will take up to just 20 minutes and will produce better images of the brain compared with 20 years ago. “Based on algorithms developed by my group, we're able to extract individual brain networks with a limited quantity of data. So this means that with just 10 or 20 minutes of MRI scan, we're able to estimate very high-quality personalised brain networks,” he said.

In pilots done with Americans who had treatment-resistant depression, about 80 per cent of patients achieved remission with the therapy. Dr Tor said that the research will also go some way in reducing the stigma around mental illness. “If we can localise the part of the brain … do something to it, and make the depression go away, that shows definitively that depression is a biological illness and not something that just lives in your head,” he said. The two trials are funded by a grant of S$1 million (US$735 million) each from Temasek Foundation and the National Medical Research Council, which was set up by the Ministry of Health to fund medical research.

The Agong, as the king is called in Malaysia, is chosen based on the country’s unique rotational system, with a fixed order of the nine hereditary sultans taking turns to become head of state for five years. WHAT SORT OF AGONG WILL SULTAN IBRAHIM BE? The question everyone is asking in Kuala Lumpur now is: What sort of Agong will Sultan Ibrahim be? The short answer is that he will not be very different from how he has been as Sultan of Johor, though he will now have to keep in mind that he represents his brother rulers as well. He is no longer speaking for the state of Johor but the whole nation .

(Photo: Mohd Rasfan/Pool via Reuters) Related: Commentary: Malaysia king’s role comes into sharper focus as country sails through bleakest COVID-19 days What we do know is that Sultan Ibrahim strongly believes in multiculturalism. He has made it clear many times in Johor, that he treats all his subjects as Bangsa Johor - an inclusive Johorean identity - and that he does not like the racial polarisation of Malaysian politics. In one famous incident in 2017, he reprimanded a Johor laundry operator for a signboard limiting its services to only Muslims, warning business owners with blatant discriminatory practices that their licences may be revoked. “Don’t mess around with your narrow-minded religious prejudices,” he said at the time. The new Queen, Raja Zarith Sofiah Sultan Idris Shah, is someone who shares her husband’s belief in Bangsa Johor and multicultural Malaysia. Many may not know that she graduated from Oxford University with a major in Chinese Studies. SAGE ADVICE AND WISE COUNSEL Although Malaysia is a constitutional monarchy, the sultans are powerful in their own right. As Johor ruler, Sultan Ibrahim is already part of the constitutional body called the Conference of Rulers which is the final arbiter of anything to do with Islam and Malay adat (customs and traditions), including federal laws. A new role he will take on is to provide the prime minister with advice and counsel. As a tradition inherited from the British, the prime minister regularly meets with the Agong when Cabinet is in session to brief him on all government policies. The Agong will provide his views on government policy - widely seen to be a non-partisan and non-political view - which will be taken into account by the prime minister. Retired British prime ministers have said that the advice given by the late Queen Elizabeth II was very important in how they made their decisions. There is no reason to think it will be different in Malaysia’s case. Related: Commentary: Malaysia at 60 - one country, three visions Commentary: Tension between Malaysia's monarchy, PAS reflects the rapidly changing dynamics in politics HOPES FOR MALAYSIA’S POLITICAL STABILITY In recent years, the monarchy has played an important role when the politicians are unable to get their act together . When the first Pakatan Harapan government fell apart in 2020, it was the current Agong, Sultan Abdullah of Pahang, who selected Muhyiddin Yassin to be prime minister. A year later, when Muhyiddin lost his majority , it was the Agong again who selected Ismail Sabri Yaakob as his successor. After the inconclusive general election results in November 2022, again it was left to the Agong to assess which of the coalition leaders, Muhyiddin Yassin or Anwar Ibrahim, could command the majority in parliament. It’s unsurprising if Malaysians see the monarchy as the salve when the political class is cracked. The Agong is the one who will fix their mess, unwavering. With hopes that the political tumult will end with current Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim at the helm, who similarly holds a vision of multicultural Malaysia, Sultan Ibrahim can be the beacon of stability the country needs.

While some view childhood punishments as badges of honour, others have endured profound trauma that continues to haunt them throughout their lives.

Lim Boon Leng Lim Boon Leng 14 Jun 2024 06:00AM (Updated: 14 Jun 2024 09:50AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: A man was recently jailed for causing the death of his son by forcing chili into his mouth as a form of punishment. The tragic outcome of this heartbreaking event brings to attention the perennial debate on corporal punishment in our society. Many adult Singaporeans have harrowing stories of punishments they endured as children, ranging from caning to being forced to kneel or getting locked out of the house. While some view these punishments as badges of honour, believing they contributed to their character development, others have endured profound trauma that continues to haunt them throughout their lives. Corporal punishment in Asian cultures, including Singapore, is deeply rooted in our historical and cultural traditions. Values include obedience, respect for authority and strict discipline. Many parents continue to resort to corporal punishments as they were subjected to similar treatment during their upbringing. They believe the tough love from these harsh punishments is necessary for a child’s proper behaviour and eventual success. Conversely, “Western-style” positive parenting is often stigmatised as being too lenient and ineffective, leading to concerns that it will result in poorly behaved children. As the saying goes: Spare the rod and spoil the child. MORE HARM THAN GOOD However, scientific studies have found that physical punishment increases the risk of broad and enduring negative developmental outcomes for children. Research indicates that physical punishment can lead to increased aggression, antisocial behaviour, anxiety, depression and lower self-esteem. Children subjected to physical punishment are more likely to experience mental health problems and engage in violent behaviour as adults. These findings highlight the long-term consequences of corporal punishment, suggesting it does more harm than good. Furthermore, no study has ever found that physical punishment enhances developmental health. Today, many parents defend the use of corporal punishment by claiming that they were raised with such methods and turned out just fine. However, this perspective overlooks the lasting psychological and emotional harm that many individuals endure as a result of these punitive practices. While a parent may believe that a physical punishment is justified, the thin line between discipline and abuse is often blurred. A child may perceive seemingly appropriate punishment as abusive and be traumatised by the experience. Also, just because someone appears to be functioning well does not mean they have not been adversely affected by their experiences. The impact of corporal punishment can present itself in many different ways, including difficulties in forming healthy relationships, managing emotions and coping with stress. Related: Commentary: How can we expect children to be honest when we lie to them? Commentary: Singapore parents need to let go of the cane and guilt POSITIVE PARENTING AS AN ALTERNATIVE Parents often resort to physical punishments out of frustration or a lack of alternative methods of discipline. We all recognise that parenting is inherently challenging, especially in a busy and competitive society like Singapore. In moments of stress and anger, it can be difficult to resist the urge to use physical punishment as a quick fix. However, it is crucial to recognise that these actions are more about alleviating our parental frustration than educating or guiding the child. Positive parenting provides a compassionate and evidence-based alternative to corporal punishment. This approach emphasises nurturing, guidance and non-violent discipline to create a supportive environment for children's growth. Positive parenting techniques include setting clear and consistent boundaries, using time-out and rewarding positive behaviour. Research has shown that positive parenting is effective. A meta-analysis published in the Psychological Bulletin revealed that positive parenting practices are linked to higher academic achievement, improved mental health and better social skills in children. Additionally, positive parenting helps to strengthen the parent-child relationship by fostering trust and open communication. I often recommend The Parenting Pyramid, developed by the Arbinger Institute, to parents as I find it to be a particularly useful approach to parenting. The pyramid emphasises that effective correction relies on effective teaching, which in turn depends on a strong parent-child relationship. The foundation of the pyramid is the parents' personal well-being, underscoring the importance of a healthy, positive mindset when parenting. Related: Commentary: Why I choose not to be a ‘helicopter’ parent Commentary: The hidden plight of parents who are abused by their own children TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM CORPORAL PUNISHMENT Transitioning from corporal punishment to positive parenting can be challenging for parents who were raised with it. However, with the right support, it is entirely possible. Parenting workshops, community support groups and educational resources can provide parents with the tools and strategies needed to implement non-violent discipline. Health professionals, educators, and community leaders play a crucial role in promoting these resources and supporting parents through this transition. Finally, most instances of child abuse occur under the context of punishment . This tragic incident, where a father caused his son's death through punitive discipline, underscores this reality. As the judge stated, \"It could have been prevented if you (the father) did not adopt such a method to discipline your child.\" He added, \"This method of disciplining a vulnerable victim, or any such method ... should be discouraged ... at all costs.\" Dr Lim Boon Leng is a psychiatrist at the Gleneagles Medical Centre.

Signs of pet neglect can go unnoticed by neighbours and friends, but animals can’t speak for themselves and must rely on us to help, says Aarthi Sankar of SPCA Singapore. Signs of animal neglect can go easily unnoticed since it may not always leave visible marks and animals cannot express their distress.

Aarthi Sankar Aarthi Sankar 15 Jun 2024 06:00AM (Updated: 15 Jun 2024 12:25PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Imagine that you hear your neighbour’s dog whining loudly for hours on end. Or you see a pet cat caged up for days in the common corridor. What would you do - speak to your neighbour, or report it to the authorities? A significant legal precedent was set in April when a man received a 20-day jail sentence for neglecting 43 cats in a flat devoid of food and water. This was the first time a jail sentence was imposed for a conviction related to neglect, under Singapore’s Animals and Birds Act. In 2023 alone , the SPCA investigated 915 cases involving animal welfare. These cases generally fall into two broad categories: Abuse and cruelty, where there is intentional infliction of pain, suffering, or death; and neglect, characterised by a failure to provide basic needs for an animal, resulting in prolonged suffering due to inadequate living conditions. Alarmingly, more than two-thirds of the cases reported to the SPCA last year involved issues of neglect. There are many reasons why animals end up neglected. Some people lose interest in their pets; a once-beloved puppy that captivated everyone’s attention becomes a dog that no one wants to care for. Additionally, there are individuals who fail to sterilise their pets, resulting in more animals than they can manage. In other cases, psychological issues lead people to compulsively hoard pets, eventually overwhelming their ability to provide proper care. It is heartbreaking that in all these situations, the animals are the ones who suffer the most. CHALLENGING TO IDENTIFY SIGNS OF NEGLECT On the surface, neglect might appear less severe than overt acts of animal cruelty, but its impacts are profoundly distressing. Neglect leads to prolonged suffering and can result in permanent harm or even death. Signs of animal neglect can go easily unnoticed since it may not always leave visible marks and animals cannot express their distress. Residents usually do not have the opportunity to enter someone else’s home to directly examine an animal's condition, making it difficult to detect when pets are not being properly cared for. To spot signs of neglect, observers should look for indications such as pets kept in cramped, unsanitary conditions typical of hoarding situations, or confined in unsuitable housing like tiny cages or left on balconies for prolonged periods. These environments fail to provide necessary space or comfort, clearly signalling neglect. Neglect may also manifest in pets lacking necessary medical attention , evident through visible untreated injuries or signs of distress, and improper weight management, where pets may appear to be underweight or overweight. Related: Commentary: Pet owners are still choosing dogs from pet stores instead of shelters. Why? IN FOCUS: Why are people cruel to pets and wildlife? CONTEXT IS KEY WHEN DEALING WITH CASES OF NEGLECT Often, animal neglect can indicate broader issues within a household, such as the neglect of other dependents like children or the elderly. It can also arise from a significant shift in financial or living conditions. In other instances, a neighbour might be overwhelmed by personal challenges, such as illness or caring for a family member, which could affect their ability to care for their pet. It is not uncommon for reports to surface about animals appearing in poor condition, only to discover upon further investigation that these pets are elderly, with owners diligently managing chronic health issues as best as they can under challenging circumstances. While the instinct may be to immediately report such cases to the SPCA or authorities, there are situations where a more nuanced approach could be more beneficial. If you feel safe and comfortable, initiate a supportive conversation with your neighbour or friend. This approach can often alleviate the situation more effectively and immediately for the animal. Helping or sharing practical advice can lead to immediate and significant improvements in the animal's welfare. Sometimes, owners may sim ply lack the necessary resources or knowledge to provide proper care for their pets. Related: Commentary: When children are cruel to animals, there’s usually an underlying trigger Commentary: Blanket bans on emotional support animals may not be the right move When it comes to posting on social media about suspected neglect, one must consider the potential impact on the animal's welfare. While it might seem like a quick way to raise awareness and prompt action, public shaming can have several negative consequences that may ultimately make the situation worse. Public shaming can lead to increased stress and defensiveness from the pet owner. If they feel attacked or embarrassed, they may become less willing to accept help or advice, which can delay or even prevent improvements in the animal's care. However, if repeated attempts to assist or communicate with your neighbour fail, or if they respond with hostility, it becomes necessary to escalate the matter to the authorities and the SPCA. If you do decide to report a case, providing detailed information, including photographs or videos, can significantly expedite the investigation process. Although the SPCA does not have enforcement powers, we collaborate closely with authorities to gather as much evidence as possible and prioritise critical cases. Related: Commentary: In regulations on pet ownership, are some animals more equal than others? Commentary: Do we need to do more to protect our community cats? CHALLENGES IN ENFORCEMENT Investigating animal neglect is challenging and can take a long time. The definition of \"unnecessary pain and suffering\", as outlined in the Animals and Birds Act, is often difficult to prove. Since animals can't speak for themselves, they rely on humans to intervene and help. The authorities focus on helping pet owners improve rather than punishing them immediately, usually starting with a warning or a fine. However, our responsibility towards animals goes beyond legal obligations; it is a duty rooted in kindness and empathy. When we choose to bring an animal into our lives, we must also embrace the lifelong responsibility of their care. After all, how we treat the most vulnerable among us speaks volumes about who we are as a people. Aarthi Sankar is Executive Director of SPCA Singapore.

The survey by the UN Development Program, Oxford University and GeoPoll posed 15 questions by randomised telephone calls to people in 77 countries representing 87 per cent of the world's population. The key finding was that 80 per cent of respondents want their governments to increase efforts to fight against global warming. Poorer countries beat this drum the loudest, with 89 per cent in favour, though appetite is also high in the wealthy G20 nations (76 per cent), according to the survey. China (73 per cent) and the United States (66 per cent) - the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters - also saw a majority of respondents in favour of climate action. Related: Drought, heatwave threaten harvest in China’s agricultural regions Searing heat scorches US from Chicago to East Coast \"As world leaders decide on the next round of pledges under the Paris Agreement by 2025, these results are undeniable evidence that people everywhere support bold climate action,\" said Cassie Flynn, UNDP global climate director. A majority of respondents in 62 of the 77 countries surveyed said they supported a quick transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy. These included China (80 per cent) and the United States (54 per cent), but in Russia just 16 per cent of poll participants were in favour. Worries about global warming have also increased, the survey found, with 56 per cent saying they think about climate change at least once a week. Over half (53 per cent) of those surveyed said they were more worried about climate change than last year, compared with 15 per cent who said they were less worried. Related: UN climate chief laments lack of progress at key talks Sea swamps Bangladesh at one of world's fastest rates Leading the rise in climate anxiety is Fiji, where 80 per cent are more concerned compared to a year ago, followed by Afghanistan (78 per cent) and Türkiye (77 per cent). Saudi Arabia saw the lowest increase in climate fears, with 25 per cent more worried, followed by Russia (34 per cent), Czech Republic (36 per cent) and China (39 per cent). More than two-thirds of survey respondents (69 per cent) said that global warming had impacted their life decisions, such as where to live or work and what to buy. But Achim Steiner, head of the UNDP, said these concerns do not necessarily translate into electoral and consumer decisions. \"I would do more. But the others won't. So I will not do anything,\" Steiner said of what he called people's \"perception gap\" on climate action.

William Denselow Louisa Tang William Denselow & Louisa Tang 18 Jun 2024 10:49AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BRUSSELS: Cheap and heavily subsidised Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) are flooding the market – this was the warning from senior European Union officials that sparked a probe into unfair trade practices late last year. Now, the bloc has taken action. The European Commission announced last Wednesday (Jun 12) that it will impose higher tariffs of up to 38.1 per cent on Chinese EVs, causing Beijing to issue threats of retaliation. Since then, concerns have arisen that trade disputes with China could put the brakes on the EU’s climate targets. The EU plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It has also committed to making all new cars and vans zero-emission from 2035. The additional tariffs were the result of an EU probe into alleged unfair state subsidies given to China’s car manufacturing industry that posed an economic threat to European rivals. It was also a bid by the bloc to tackle Chinese industrial overcapacity flooding the EU. The level of tariffs set for specific EV makers depended on the level of state subsidies received by the firms. They come on top of an existing 10 per cent levy on cars imported into the EU. The tariffs are set to kick in on Jul 4, but could be adjusted as Chinese companies have until then to provide evidence that could challenge the EU’s findings. The European Commission’s anti-subsidy investigation will continue until November. China has rejected the allegations of unfair trade practices, calling the EU's move “protectionist behaviour”. Related: China warns it could file suit with WTO against EU tariffs on Chinese EVs EU’s move to hit Chinese EV makers with higher tariffs will not affect pricing much: Experts CHINESE EVs MUCH CHEAPER According to analysts, Chinese brands are set to make up an 11 per cent market share in Europe this year. This is set to rise to 20 per cent come 2027. These brands can be nearly 30 per cent cheaper than their European competitors. While European officials hope the additional tariffs could raise more than US$6 billion annually and help level the playing field, there are worries that they will complicate the EU’s ambitious climate plans. Some fear that costlier vehicles could reduce demand and undermine the bloc’s goal to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2035. Electrified vehicles accounted for nearly half of all new car registrations in the EU last year. China-EU business consultant Bart Horsten said that consumer confidence is based on the security of a product’s future, and that a potential buyer could be put off by the uncertainty of how much an electric vehicle costs. “Also, the regulations are changing often,” he added. Several European countries, including Germany, have also warned that trade disputes can lead to a surge in prices.

According to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, the EU needs to build eight times more EV charging stations per year by 2030 to hit its emissions targets. Observers said it is possible for the bloc to reach its EV goals, but only with the right ambition and political stability. ABB E-mobility, with its new range of fast charging stations, is one of the firms trying to get the expansion of the EU’s charging infrastructure back on track. “We can learn from a market which is ahead, so we know from looking at that market what will be coming towards us,” said Mr Floris van de Klashorst, the firm's senior vice president of products and hardware platforms. “(This will put) us in a place where we can make sure that our products are also future-proof, and that is super important,” he added.

(Photo: AFP/STR) 18 Jun 2024 05:47PM (Updated: 18 Jun 2024 09:24PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn BEIJING: The task of controlling floods in China is becoming increasingly arduous, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday (Jun 18), calling for all-out efforts to safeguard lives and property as powerful storms pounded provinces from the interior to the eastern coast. About a dozen people have been reported killed in floods or rain-induced mudslides in recent days with the annual flooding season in southern Chinese provinces in full swing. In the city of Meizhou in Guangdong province, low-rise buildings tilted perilously on subsiding ground next to raging rivers, or lay half-submerged as flood-waters burst the banks, video on social media showed. In Guangdong province, at least five people have been killed and 13 trapped due to flash floods and mudslides, according to state media, with over 1,400 houses having collapsed and 8,000 hectares of crops damaged. Xi called for all-out efforts to fight floods in the south, urging every possible attempt to rescue those lost and trapped, the official Xinhua news agency said. He also instructed rescuers to \"guarantee the security of people's lives and property, and overall social stability\", Xinhua added. Related: Drought, heatwave threaten harvest in China’s agricultural regions Rain and shine: Northern China swelters in heatwave as torrential downpours soak the south Deaths during China's annual summer floods have fallen sharply from the thousands each year in the 1990s, as authorities beefed up flood control measures, such as dam construction. Yet extreme weather in recent years, including record-breaking rainfall, has made China vulnerable to intense flooding and disasters such as sudden mudslides, often in its mountainous but populated areas. In Shanghang, a county in southeastern Fujian province, four people were killed after rainfall in 15 townships broke records over a 24-hour period, Xinhua reported. Communication and power infrastructure in disaster-stricken areas in Shanghang have not fully recovered, with the region facing the risk of more landslides. In the far western region of Xinjiang, flash floods engulfed a car on Tuesday, and four people remained missing, state media said. In the mountainous area of Changji in Xinjiang's northwest, emergency officials said heavy rainfall had brought flash floods and mudslides that blocked roads in one town. Also on Tuesday, officials in the southwestern region of Guangxi upgraded a flood warning advisory, adding that about 23,600 people were affected in 10 counties. Flash flood warnings were also issued in the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangxi, where heavy rain fell for two days, state media said. Weather forecasters expect more heavy rain in Guangxi region, and the provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui, which could lead to more landslides and flooding. The waters in many rivers have exceeded warning levels, official media said. Meanwhile, China's north is wilting under some of the year's hottest weather. The mercury was expected to soar to up to 39 degrees Celsius in Beijing and the surrounding areas of Tianjin and Hebei on Tuesday, the National Meteorological Centre said. Authorities have also moved to offer drought prevention and disaster relief in seven provinces across China's north, east and centre. China is enduring a summer of extreme weather, which scientists say is made more common by climate change. Greenhouse gases, of which China is the world's biggest emitter, are a key contributor to climate change.

Marketing for e-vaporisers, including through social media and influencers, is largely targeted at youths, which contributed to its widespread usage amongst this age group. Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam said this in reply to MPs' questions in Parliament on Wednesday (May 8). She added that while the Tobacco Act applies to all vaping-related content published in Singapore and by Singapore-connected persons or entities, the Internet and social media is a global ecosystem and having these domestic laws does not mean that harmful content or advertisements would not come from a foreign source or foreign influencer. She highlighted several measures that have been put in place by the Ministry of Health (MOH), including allowing enforcement action to be taken against platforms found with inadequate processes to detect and remove vaping-related content. She also said that the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has been monitoring illicit sales of e-vaporisers via social media, e-commerce and messaging platforms and carrying out operations to remove such content. HSA is also reviewing the legal penalties to strengthen the deterrence against the advertising, importation and distribution of e-vaporisers, said Ms Rahayu. 08 May 2024 12:32pm Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn There is a global rise in the use of e-vaporisers among youths.

(File photo: REUTERS/Bazuki Muhammad) 21 Jun 2024 02:18PM (Updated: 21 Jun 2024 02:36PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn KUALA LUMPUR: Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) said its buyer BlackRock will not be involved in privatising Malaysia Airports after criticism in Muslim-majority Malaysia over the US firm's alleged ties to Israel. GIP, Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional and others are part of a consortium that has offered to take over Malaysia Airport (MAHB) in a privatisation deal that would value the airport operator at US$3.9 billion. The plan has come under criticism and protests from some ruling party and opposition lawmakers in Malaysia, a staunch supporter of the Palestinians, over GIP's ties to BlackRock's significant investments in Israel, which is fighting a war against the militant Palestinian Hamas group in Gaza. MAHB's planned privatisation is the latest focus on protests in Malaysia, following boycott campaigns against such Western brands as McDonald's and Starbucks over the war in Gaza. GIP said its existing leadership team will \"retain full control and responsibility for the strategic direction and operation of GIP and the companies in which we have invested\" after its acquisition by BlackRock, state news agency Bernama reported on Friday (Jun 21), citing a written reply from GIP head of transport Phil Iley. Related: Malaysia’s privatisation of airport operator with BlackRock entity faces a bumpy ride, but likely to go ahead A GIP spokesperson confirmed the Bernama report. Khazanah did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Iley said the firm would provide MAHB with as much operational support and assistance as needed despite being a minority shareholder. \"If we are successful with our transformation, we would very much consider re-listing MAHB on the Malaysian stock exchange in the future,\" he wrote. Khazanah has said GIP would not hire staff to directly manage MAHB, while Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has described claims that 25 per cent of MAHB would be owned by a pro-Zionist company as baseless, without naming the company, Bernama reported. Under the deal GIP and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority would own 30 per cent of MAHB, while the majority stake would be held by Khazanah and the Employees Provident Fund, Malaysia's largest pension body. The fund did not respond to a request for comment on GIP's statement. BlackRock's US$12.5 billion acquisition of GIP is expected to be completed in the third quarter.

Uchida delivered the speech on behalf of governor Kazuo Ueda. The deputy governor also said Japan's underlying inflation is likely to gradually accelerate towards the BOJ's 2 per cent target, as rising wages and prices heighten inflation expectations. The BOJ ended eight years of negative interest rates in March and has signalled its intention to raise short-term rates further from the current range of 0-0.1 per cent. The central bank also decided at last week's policy meeting to announce a plan in July on how to trim its huge bond buying in the coming one to two years. Uchida said the scale of the BOJ's bond tapering will be \"significant,\" repeating a comment made by governor Ueda in last week's post-meeting news conference. The BOJ said on Friday it will hold a series of meetings with bond market participants on July 9-10 to collect their views, which will be taken into account in deciding on the taper plan at its next policy-setting meeting on July 30-31. Many market participants expect the BOJ to raise rates again some time this year, though they are divided on whether the timing could come as early as July or later in the year. The central bank has also been under pressure to embark on quantitative tightening (QT) and scale back its nearly $5 trillion balance sheet to ensure the effects of future rate hikes smoothly feed into the economy.

Richard Yu, chairman of Huawei's Consumer Business Group, was speaking at the opening of a three-day developer conference in the southern Chinese city of Dongguan, where he said the company's Harmony operating system was now available on more than 900 million devices. \"Harmony has made major breakthroughs. You can say in 10 years we've achieved what it took our European and American counterparts more than 30 years to do, in terms of building the core technology of an independent operating system,\" Yu said. HarmonyOS is Huawei's proprietary operating system which it launched in 2019, when US technology restrictions cut it off from Google support for the Android operating system it used in smartphones. The company's Ascend artificial intelligence infrastructure - the most powerful from a Chinese company - was now the second most popular after Nvidia, which dominates the market for AI chips, Yu added. Operating systems and other software has been dominated by Europe and the United States for a long time, although the era of internet of things has given Huawei an opportunity to overtake them, he said. Huawei's smartphone business has gone through a renaissance since the Mate 60 launched last year with a improved China-made chip. Harmony-equipped smartphone sales have risen 68 per cent in the first five months of the year, Yu said. In the first quarter of 2024, Huawei's HarmonyOS surpassed Apple's iOS to become the second best-selling mobile operating system in China behind Android with a 17 per cent market share, research firm Counterpoint said.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/Illustration/File Photo 21 Jun 2024 06:05PM (Updated: 22 Jun 2024 02:37AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SAN FRANCISCO : Amazon is planning a major revamp of its decade-old money-losing Alexa service to include a conversational generative AI with two tiers of service and has considered a monthly fee of around $5 to access the superior version, according to people with direct knowledge of the company's plans. Known internally as “Banyan,” a reference to the sprawling ficus trees, the project would represent the first major overhaul of the voice assistant since it was introduced in 2014 along with the Echo line of speakers. Amazon has dubbed the new voice assistant \"Remarkable Alexa,\" the people said. The sources include eight current and former employees who worked on Alexa and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss confidential projects. Amazon has pushed workers towards a deadline of August to prepare the newest version of Alexa, three of the people said, noting that CEO Andy Jassy has taken a personal interest in seeing Alexa reinvigorated. In an April letter to shareholders, Jassy promised a “more intelligent and capable Alexa,” without providing additional details. The company's plans for Alexa including pricing and release dates could be altered or canceled depending on the progress of Project Banyan, the people cautioned. \"We have already integrated generative AI into different components of Alexa, and are working hard on implementation at scale—in the over half a billion ambient, Alexa-enabled devices already in homes around the world—to enable even more proactive, personal, and trusted assistance for our customers,\" said an Amazon spokeswoman in a statement. The service - which provides spoken answers to user queries, like the local weather, and can serve as a hub to control home appliances – was a pet project of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos who envisioned a technology that could emulate the fictional voice computer portrayed on television’s Star Trek series. For Amazon, keeping up with rivals in generative AI is critical as Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have garnered more favorable attention for their so-called chatbots that can respond almost instantaneously with full sentences to complicated prompts or queries. The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 set off a frenzy of investing in AI firms and has pushed chipmaker Nvidia past Amazon and others by market capitalization, briefly becoming the world’s second-most valuable company. Apple too is pushing ahead with its own AI strategy, including updating its Siri voice activated software embedded in iPhones to include more conversational answers. Some of the Amazon employees who have worked on the project say Banyan represents a “desperate attempt” to revitalize the service, which has never turned a profit, and was caught flatfooted amid the rise of competitive generative AI products over the past 18 months. Those people said they have been told by senior management that this year is a critical one for the service to finally demonstrate it can generate meaningful sales for Amazon. Accessed primarily through Amazon TVs and Echo speaker devices, Alexa is popular mostly for setting timers, quickly accessing the weather, playing songs or answering simple questions. Amazon’s hopes for goosing sales in its e-commerce operation through the service have fallen flat, mostly because users like to first see the products they are buying for easy comparison. The Seattle retailer cut thousands of jobs in the unit in late 2023, part of a major restructuring after a pandemic-fueled e-commerce surge lost steam. 'MUST WIN' With an embedded AI, Amazon expects Alexa customers will ask it for shopping advice like which gloves and hat to purchase for a mountain climbing trip, the people said, similar to a text-based service on its website known as Rufus that Amazon rolled out earlier this year. Some said they’ve been told by senior management that 2024 represents a “must win” year for Alexa, which along with the Prime membership and Kindle and Fire devices are the brands most closely associated with Amazon. But an AI-powered version of the service demonstrated in September has yet to be released to the broader public while competitors have pushed out multiple updates to their chatbots. In the demonstration, Alexa lost its robotic tone and answered questions like the start time for a football game. \"You can now have a near-human-like conversations with Alexa,\" promised Dave Limp, Amazon's hardware chief at the time, who has since left the company. Amazon is working to replace what it refers to internally as “Classic Alexa,” the current free version, with an AI-powered one and yet another tier that uses more powerful AI software for more complicated queries and prompts that people would have to pay at least $5 per month to access, some of the people said. Amazon has also considered a roughly $10-per-month price, they said. There is no tie-in with Amazon's $139-per-year Prime membership being considered, the people said. As envisioned, the paid version could perform more intricate tasks such as composing a brief email, sending it and ordering dinner for delivery from Uber Eats, all from a single prompt, some of the people said. It could also eliminate the need to repeatedly say \"Alexa\" during a conversation with the software and offer more personalization, they said. But the people said they struggled to see why customers would be willing to pay for a service, even a revamped one, that is offered for free today. Amazon has also been plagued by false starts in developing the AI and other challenges such as hallucinations – when software produces false or misleading information – and poor employee morale in the division. Some of Amazon’s plans for the service were previously reported by Business Insider, including its struggles with the performance of the underlying AI and its hopes for a paid service, however Reuters is first to report the tiered pricing, internal deadline and potential monthly fee. Amazon is also aiming to supercharge the home automation offered through Alexa, the people said. Alexa now can wirelessly connect to so-called smart devices so that they can be controlled by voice, allowing a user to, for example, turn the porch lights on every day at 8 pm. But Remarkable Alexa could learn from users so that it powers on the television for a favorite weekly program or turns on a user's coffee pot after a morning alarm goes off, which is possible today through prompts that Amazon calls Routines. Some of the people noted that for such a service to work properly it will require customers to buy additional Alexa-enabled devices. The company had been working on devices last year to get the service into more rooms of the house, such as Alexa-enabled home energy consumption trackers and a carbon monoxide detector, people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters.

The Biden administration on Thursday said it would ban the sale of antivirus software made by Russia's Kaspersky Lab in the United States, citing what it said was the Kremlin's influence over the company which poses a significant security risk. Announcing the ban, US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters that \"Russia has shown it has the capacity and ...the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponise the personal information of Americans\". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Kaspersky was a \"very competitive\" company on international markets and that Washington's decision to restrict its sales was a \"favourite technique of unfair competition from the United States\". Kaspersky, which has said it will pursue legal options to try to preserve its operations, has said it believes the US decision was not based on \"a comprehensive evaluation of the integrity of Kaspersky's products and services\" and that its activities did not threaten US national security. The company has said it is privately managed and has no links to the Russian government.

REUTERS/Daniele Mascolo 21 Jun 2024 10:07PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn MARANELLO, Italy : Ferrari will use its new production site to boost manufacturing flexibility and shorten the time needed to develop and roll out new models, rather than to increase output, the CEO of the Italian luxury sports carmaker said on Friday. Ferrari's so called e-building in its home town of Maranello, northern Italy, for which it has invested around 200 million euros ($214 million), will also produce its first fully electric (EV) car, expected to be launched at the end of next year. \"This building will allow us to shorten time to market or product development time,\" CEO Benedetto Vigna said at the plant's inauguration, adding these two activities sometimes currently overlap on existing assembly lines. Vigna said Ferrari was not pushing for volume but for value. \"So, more money per car basically. We want to grow the company but not because we increase volumes,\" he said, adding a key tool to expand revenues from car sales was personalisations. Personalisations are the touches that a customer requests to make the model more suited to their tastes, both inside and out. \"We want to have more tools, technology tools ... more flexibility to accommodate the need of more personalisation of our clients,\" Vigna said. Ferrari's first EV will cost no less than half a million euros, Reuters reported earlier this week, and a second EV model is already under development. The 42,500 square metre (457,466 sq. ft) new facility, which adds to the existing one in Maranello, gives Ferrari an additional car assembly line. It increases the company's overall theoretical output capacity to around 20,000 cars per year, versus less than 14,000 it delivered in 2023, Reuters has reported. The company will also make key in-house components for EVs at the new plant, including axles, motors and battery assembly. However, it will also use it to produce hybrid and traditional combustion-engine models, as it has plans to offer in the future a mix of the three engine types, to serve different kind of clients. \"The plant ... reflects the principle of technological neutrality,\" Ferrari said in a statement. It \"will allow Ferrari to reorganise and reallocate all production activities more efficiently among its existing facilities in Maranello, increasing its ability to adapt quickly to production needs,\" it added. The new plant will roll out its first cars in January of next year, while series production of Ferrari's first EV will start in January 2026, Vigna said.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo 21 Jun 2024 10:37PM (Updated: 22 Jun 2024 01:32AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn :Multiple artificial intelligence companies are circumventing a common web standard used by publishers to block the scraping of their content for use in generative AI systems, content licensing startup TollBit has told publishers. A letter to publishers seen by Reuters on Friday, which does not name the AI companies or the publishers affected, comes amid a public dispute between AI search startup Perplexity and media outlet Forbes involving the same web standard and a broader debate between tech and media firms over the value of content in the age of generative AI. The business media publisher publicly accused Perplexity of plagiarizing its investigative stories in AI-generated summaries without citing Forbes or asking for its permission. A Wired investigation published this week found Perplexity likely bypassing efforts to block its web crawler via the Robots Exclusion Protocol, or \"robots.txt,\" a widely accepted standard meant to determine which parts of a site are allowed to be crawled. Perplexity declined a Reuters request for comment on the dispute. The News Media Alliance, a trade group representing more than 2,200 U.S.-based publishers, expressed concern about the impact that ignoring \"do not crawl\" signals could have on its members. \"Without the ability to opt out of massive scraping, we cannot monetize our valuable content and pay journalists. This could seriously harm our industry,\" said Danielle Coffey, president of the group. TollBit, an early-stage startup, is positioning itself as a matchmaker between content-hungry AI companies and publishers open to striking licensing deals with them. The company tracks AI traffic to the publishers' websites and uses analytics to help both sides settle on fees to be paid for the use of different types of content. For example, publishers may opt to set higher rates for \"premium content, such as the latest news or exclusive insights,\" the company says on its website. It says it had 50 websites live as of May, though it has not named them. According to the TollBit letter, Perplexity is not the only offender that appears to be ignoring robots.txt. TollBit said its analytics indicate \"numerous\" AI agents are bypassing the protocol, a standard tool used by publishers to indicate which parts of its site can be crawled. \"What this means in practical terms is that AI agents from multiple sources (not just one company) are opting to bypass the robots.txt protocol to retrieve content from sites,\" TollBit wrote. \"The more publisher logs we ingest, the more this pattern emerges.\" The robots.txt protocol was created in the mid-1990s as a way to avoid overloading websites with web crawlers. Although there is no clear legal enforcement mechanism, historically there has been widespread compliance on the web and some groups - including the News Media Alliance - say there may yet be legal recourse for publishers. More recently, robots.txt has become a key tool publishers have used to block tech companies from ingesting their content free-of-charge for use in generative AI systems that can mimic human creativity and instantly summarize articles. The AI companies use the content both to train their algorithms and to generate summaries of real-time information. Some publishers, including the New York Times, have sued AI companies for copyright infringement over those uses. Others are signing licensing agreements with the AI companies open to paying for content, although the sides often disagree over the value of the materials. Many AI developers argue they have broken no laws in accessing them for free. Thomson Reuters, the owner of Reuters News, is among those that have struck deals to license news content for use by AI models. Publishers have been raising the alarm about news summaries in particular since Google rolled out a product last year that uses AI to create summaries in response to some search queries. If publishers want to prevent their content from being used by Google's AI to help generate those summaries, they must use the same tool that would also prevent them from appearing in Google search results, rendering them virtually invisible on the web.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo 21 Jun 2024 11:45PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Spotify introduced a new streaming plan for users in the United States on Friday, after raising prices for its premium plans earlier this month. The new basic plan will start at $10.99 per month for eligible users. It will have the streaming benefits of a premium plan, but no monthly audiobook listening time. Premium plans allow users to listen to offline ad-free music and 15 hours of audiobook listening time per month. Spotify raised the prices for premium plans earlier in June, the latest step by the Swedish music-streaming service in its push to increase margins. The company raised prices of its individual plan to $11.99 from $10.99 per month, duo plan to $16.99 from $14.99 and its family plan to $19.99 from $16.99 in the United States, its largest market by revenue. Spotify has been trying to boost its margins in recent months by lowering marketing spending and through layoffs, after relying on promotions and hefty investments to drive user growth. The audio-streaming giant is looking to introduce a new expensive plan for its most ardent users later this year, Bloomberg News reported last week, with the plan likely to cost $5 more per month for access to better audio and fresh tools for creating playlists and managing song libraries.

It used to be the go-to place for youths to hang out in the 2000s, but Cineleisure Orchard fell out of fashion and now has many vacant units. CNA speaks to tenants and shoppers to chart the rise and fall of the once-popular mall on Orchard Road, and to find out if it can regain its popularity. In its heyday, Cineleisure was a vibrant location with shoppers, mostly youths, hanging out until late at night. (Photo: CNA/Tang See Kit) Tang See Kit @SeeKitCNA Tang See Kit 03 Jun 2023 06:00AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: When F&B business owner Daniel Tan decided to take up a shop space at Cineleisure Orchard earlier this year, he was not unaware of the “bad publicity” surrounding the shopping mall. The once-popular mall had come under the spotlight for dismal sights of boarded-up shopfronts and empty stores. On online forum Reddit, a post titled “What happened to Cineleisure?” garnered more than 100 comments as users reminisced about the mall’s heyday as a popular spot for youths in the 2000s. More recently, the mall’s search for new tenants was mentioned by Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan, as part of an update on the authorities’ rejuvenation plan for Orchard Road. But for Mr Tan, the director of Ah Chew Desserts Cineleisure, setting up shop at the shopping mall still made business sense given a central location that would help it to expand into the tourist market. The rent was also “slightly lower” than other malls along Orchard Road. So far, the move seems to be paying off. Since it opened on Mar 31, business on weekends has been comparable to its former location at Novena. While weekdays remain “relatively quiet”, Mr Tan is optimistic and believes that will change soon with the addition of new F&B tenants. The ongoing revamp of neighbouring *SCAPE , when completed by early 2024, will also add to the appeal of the area, he added. “I think we can throw all the recent bad publicity away,” Mr Tan told CNA. “The crowds will be back.” That is the hope of other tenants at Cineleisure too following years of slow business. “To be honest, business has not been the best since opening (in 2020), especially in recent times where the mall has been deemed ‘dead’ by many media articles and netizens,” said Mr Rodney Sim, group commercial manager of restaurant-bar GudSht. “The overall footfall at Cineleisure has been quite low, compared to other popular malls within the vicinity.” Related: Heart of the Matter: Same, same, but different? How to make malls in Singapore less cookie-cutter? The entry of Ah Chew Desserts has helped, said Mr Sim and three other businesses that this reporter spoke to separately. Footfall at the mall appears to have got another boost with the opening of fast-food giant McDonald’s two weeks ago. When CNA visited Cineleisure at around noon on May 30, the near 100-seater fast food restaurant was bustling with a consistent stream of patrons. This was in contrast with the quiet sight in the shopping mall that CNA observed at lunchtime during a visit on May 3. That said, much of this increased footfall remains concentrated on the ground level for now, with businesses on the higher floors yet to feel a boost. “It’s still too early to say if things are getting better,” said Mr Trazo Marsouvinie who works at mobile phone accessories shop Beadstreet on Level 2. “TEMPORARY CLOSED” SIGNS, EARLIER CLOSING TIMES Having worked at Cineleisure for a decade, Mr Trazo has seen the mall in its heyday as a vibrant location with shoppers, mostly youths, hanging out till late at night. “Those days were very enjoyable. The atmosphere was always great with all the people,” he recalled. Back then, business was brisk given the mall’s proximity to telco operators and mobile phone retailers nearby. “When people get their new phones, they come here to get their accessories,” said the 35-year-old sales representative. “Now, the crowd is less and people don’t stay very late anymore.” Sales have since halved. And with the absence of crowds, Beadstreet – the longest-running tenant at Cineleisure currently – has brought forward its closing time. “Last time, we closed at 11pm or 12am on weekends. But now, we close at 9pm every day,” Mr Trazo said. Beadstreet is one of the three remaining retail shops in the mall. The other two, also located on Level 2, are menswear label Benjamin Barker and streetwear fashion store Exit. With a restaurant serving up Hainanese food and a tufting art and craft shop making up the numbers of businesses on Level 2, nearly half of the units there were last seen boarded up. Elsewhere, the cinema, which used to take up Level 4 to 6, currently operates only on Level 5 and 6. Levels 4 and 8 are vacant, with “Temporary closed” stickers pasted over the lift buttons for these floors. Level 9 is taken up by indoor trampoline park Bounce Singapore, while Level 3 is home to several fitness studios and hair salons. Down in the basement, which used to have a food court and a variety of F&B offerings, only sushi and salad chain Maki-San is open for business now. File photo of Cineleisure Orchard in 2006. File photo of Cineleisure Orchard in 2006. WHAT WENT WRONG? The transformation of Cineleisure from popular mall to a comparative ghost town has been years in the making, according to those that CNA spoke to. “Even before the pandemic, there were already a lot of shops closing. The (crowd) also started to slow down,” said Mr Trazo. Competition from newer and revamped malls along Orchard Road may have been one reason. The prime shopping strip welcomed several new malls in 2009, such as ION Orchard, Orchard Central and 313@Somerset. Mandarin Gallery, which is located next to Cineleisure, also went through a S$200 million facelift before reopening in 2010. Being located slightly off the main Orchard Road has made it hard for Cineleisure to compete for shoppers. The mall also does not benefit from connections with other shopping malls. “It is a case of out of sight, out of mind,” said Associate Professor Ang Swee Hoon from the Department of Marketing at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School. At the same time, Cineleisure was losing its sweet spot. “With so many shopping malls to go to, there has to be something distinctively relevant to shoppers for them to want to go to Cineleisure,” added Assoc Prof Ang. “That sweet spot, unfortunately, is missing.” Millennials who witnessed Cineleisure during its peak in the late 1990s to the early 2010s described the mall as having everything under one roof, ranging from budget-friendly fast-food chains and a cinema, to a variety of streetwear and accessories shops that appealed to the younger crowd. Mr Darren Foo, 34, recalled spending hours at the mall every weekend with his friends. “We always came here for movies, to eat, to shop. I used to buy all my shoes here,” he said. “We could be here from like 2pm to 10pm. In between, maybe we’d go to Spinelli which was nearby at HMV Heeren.” Cineleisure was also home to a LAN gaming shop, an arcade, shops filled with Neoprint machines to take instant photos and a karaoke chain at one point. In addition, it was the go-to spot for events, ranging from celebrity autograph sessions to auditions for the Singapore Idol singing contest, which never failed to attract large crowds. “There were a lot of fun things to do, and you wouldn’t get bored,” said Mr Darren Yang, owner of fashion store Exit, who recalled spending his teenage days at the mall with friends. “It was like a collection of all the cool stuff for the young people.” Cineleisure Orchard back in 2019. (File photo: Cineleisure) But that cool factor faded as tenants made their exits. Gaming shop E2Max, for one, ceased operations at the end of 2015. On its part, Cineleisure went through a facelift in 2019 and announced several new tenants, such as indoor playground operator Amazing Castle which was making its debut in Singapore. However, that did not seem enough to attract shoppers, especially the young, whose preferences for shopping and leisure activities may have changed amid the rise of e-commerce and mobile games, some shoppers and tenants told CNA. At the same time, the cinema business – a key driver of footfall at the mall – was facing stiff competition. By 2019, the number of screens and seats operated by exhibitors in Singapore had ballooned to all-time highs. But the number of cinema-goers was falling with the arrival of online streaming services .

Then COVID-19 struck in early-2020, dealing a huge blow to the retail industry. More tenants at Cineleisure pulled down their shutters, including long-time tenant and popular sneakers store Leftfoot which has since relocated to nearby Mandarin Gallery. The mall did attract some new tenants during the pandemic, such as WeTuft, Exit and GudSht which cited reasons such as favourable rents, the mall’s central location and past success. For example, setting up in Cineleisure “just felt right” for GudSht as the F&B brand is targeting the “80s and 90s kids” who used to hang out at the mall, said Mr Sim. For Mr Yang, setting up shop in Cineleisure had an additional “full-circle moment”. “When we were young, this was the hot place to be,” he told CNA. “I always came here with my friends so this place holds some memories for me.” “In fact, our first unit is one of the stores we went to a lot during secondary school days. We even have old photos of ourselves in the store which used to sell graphic tees,” said the entrepreneur. But while business owners still see value in having a presence in Cineleisure, shoppers were no longer enticed to hang out at the mall. Mr Foo, for one, heads off immediately after his session at a gym on Level 3. Gesturing to the stretch of storefronts being boarded up, he said: “There’s nothing to see now.” MORE CAN BE DONE Some of these hoardings will be coming off, as a handful of new tenants start operations this month. Art supplies store Overjoyed will open in the basement on Jun 10, according to its manager who was in the middle of tidying up the unit when CNA visited earlier this week. Meanwhile, hoardings in other parts of the basement show confirmed names of tenants – sushi and yakitori restaurant Shujin and Taiwan Night Market which will be modelled after Taiwan’s famous Shilin and RaoHe night markets. These two F&B tenants are set to open this month as well, according to a spokesperson from Cineleisure. The fate of the empty units on Level 2 and 4 remain unknown for now, with some covered up by plain white hoardings while others display contact details for leasing inquiries. Renovations appear to be underway at Level 8, which has a “Do not enter” sign displayed prominently near the lift lobby. The mall’s spokesperson told CNA that there are further plans “to unveil new tenants presenting unique concepts” in the third quarter. “Located in the youth-centric Somerset precinct, Cineleisure has always been the ‘headquarters of youths’. In our quest to continue providing unparalleled lifestyle experiences for the young and young at heart, Cineleisure will offer a vibrant gourmetainment experience around the clock,” it added. Related: IN FOCUS: They were 'the place to be' for generations of shoppers. But what lies ahead for department stores? Experts said more can be done. Currently on the list of upcoming openings, the Taiwanese night market-style food place stands out as the most interesting but its appeal remains to be seen. “(It will be) a way forward if there are enough shoppers who crave for such food, and remain craving for them,” said NUS’ Assoc Prof Ang. Beyond F&B, Cineleisure needs to spruce up its mix of retailers. Overall, it needs unique tenants that complement each other to provide shoppers with “a holistic and targeted experience”, said Ms Lim Xiu Ru, a lecturer at the Singapore Polytechnic’s School of Business. Shoppers and tenants are also hoping for other improvements. Those that work at the mall say there are still crowds on weekends. However, Level 2 is usually quiet as most visitors prefer to take the lifts straight to their destinations, such as the cinema and the fitness studios on the higher floors. One reason is the mall’s layout on Level 2, which requires shoppers to walk the entire level before getting to the next set of escalators. While the design came with good intentions to direct footfall to the stores, tenants and shoppers said adjustments can be made now that the level has largely emptied out. “This has been around for a long time but it wasn’t that bad previously when there were shops around. Now it’s just walking through a very long and boring corridor,” said Ms Jessica Lim who was at Cineleisure for a yoga class. “It’s doing more bad than good,” said Mr Wong who runs WeTuft, noting that this has resulted in long queues for the lifts. Being located at the far end of Level 2, WeTuft has received feedback from customers “about the long walk” to get to its studio. “This needs to change,” Mr Wong added. Meanwhile, others hope there can be events or activities to drive footfall. “Our biggest concerns are whether the footfall will continue to be this low,” said Mr Sim. “We hope to see more in-mall events that Cineleisure used to do in the past to draw crowds in and liven things up.” Since opening at Cineleisure in March, Ah Chew Desserts says business on weekends has been comparable to its former location in Novena. (Photo: Facebook/Ah Chew Desserts) FIND A NEW NICHE But most importantly, the once-popular mall needs to figure out a new niche for itself along the country’s premier shopping belt, said Ms Lim. The polytechnic lecturer suggested breaking away from Cineleisure’s long-standing image as a place for young people, given “a limited addressable market” amid falling fertility rates. Younger consumers also have varied niche interests these days. “Mall operators, which seek to serve a growing segment and/or focus on trends that provide sufficient opportunity to grow, will do better,” she said. One possibility is to tap into “the element of nostalgia” by targeting older millennials who frequented the mall during their adolescence and still hold fond memories of the place. Another is to double down on attracting fitness enthusiasts who now form a key group of the mall’s visitors. This can be done by revamping and curating Cineleisure’s tenant mix and offerings around health, fitness and leisure, Ms Lim said. While a cinema remains important, experts said it should no longer be depended on solely to pull in the crowds. “If Cineleisure offers the same movies as in other cinemas, then it begs the question ‘Why watch at Cineleisure?’” said Assoc Prof Ang. The cinema operator could look to satisfy potential gaps in the market by screening non-mainstream films, although it will still have to contend with the stiff competition from at-home streaming. “The movie industry is no longer like what it was during its heyday,” she said. Cathay Cineplex, owned by listed-entertainment firm mm2 Asia which acquired all of Cathay’s cinema business in Singapore in 2017, declined to comment for this story. For now, the older tenants are holding out. “Hope things will pick up soon when the new F&B shops open,” said Mr Trazo. “If not, it’s very hard for us to sustain already and it will be a pity because we have been here for so long.” Source: CNA/sk Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Subscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Download here Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Join here Related Topics retail shopping malls In Focus Orchard Road Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-HV0OZZ2ujTs')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-3K4bSuQvna4')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-89SGU-oGcr8')); Also worth reading Content is loading...

Analysts had differing views on whether prices in the private and public property markets are diverging and if this can lead to more inequality. Condominiums in Singapore. (File photo: CNA/Syamil Sapari) Chew Hui Min @ChewHuiMinCNA Chew Hui Min 22 Jul 2023 06:00AM (Updated: 10 Aug 2023 05:14PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Ms Chen and her husband, who live in a 3-room flat, hope to move to a condominium with dog-friendly facilities and gated walking areas in about five years’ time. The 29-year-old professional and her husband bought a resale flat last year as they were not willing to wait four to five years for a Build-To Order (BTO) unit. However, the couple don’t think they can bank on using the profit from selling their flat to finance a new home. Amid high private property prices, she wonders if their upgrading plans will work out as they’re not sure what the situation will be when the five-year minimum occupation period (MOP) for their Housing & Development Board (HDB) flat is up. “A lot can change in five years … historically, prices of private houses have only increased, not decreased. Supply, that is land, is finite but demand doesn’t have a ceiling,” she said. “No one’s certain of where prices will be in five years.” While flash estimates show private property prices dipping in the second quarter of 2023 by 0.4 per cent, they are still at an all-time high, having risen about 28 per cent in the past three years. In particular, new launch condo prices have risen substantially higher than resale units. A common measure to assess housing affordability is the ratio of the median or average home price to median household income - which reflects how many years it takes to purchase a home if one saves one’s entire income. A 2023 Urban Land Institute (ULI) study comparing housing prices in the region found that the median private home price in Singapore was 13.7 times the median household income. The same ratio for HDB flats was 4.7. Related: Singapore most expensive Asia-Pacific city to own or rent private home, says study Dr Lee Kwan Ok, a researcher who contributed to the study, said that housing is usually considered not attainable and unaffordable in a city if the ratio goes beyond five. “Therefore, HDB (4.7) is quite attainable while private housing (13.7) is not,” said the deputy head at the Department of Real Estate at NUS Business School. “It is true that public housing is more attainable in Singapore compared to other Asian global cities. But, it is questionable if private housing is more attainable.” Data from the study show that private homes in Singapore are the most expensive in the region, but the nation’s high median income means that housing affordability is in the middle of the pack compared to many other cities. Dr Lee noted that compared with many other global cities, Singapore private housing “does not do too bad”, as the housing-to-income multiple is much higher in other Asian cities: 29.3 in Beijing, 35 in Shenzhen, 26.5 in Hong Kong, 17.8 in Tokyo and 17.3 in Seoul. ATTAINABILITY OVER THE YEARS In Singapore, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Private Property Index for non-landed property, which reflects the price of condominiums, has risen substantially over the last decade, but so have household incomes. In 2022, the median household income was S$10,099, a 33 per cent rise from S$7,566 in 2012. In the same period, the median condo price rose from S$1.07 million to S$1.59 million. An analysis of median private housing prices in Singapore compared with median household income shows that the ratio fell from 11.73 in 2012 to 10.87 in 2015, then slowly rose to 13.14 in 2022. But this masks the different trends for new launch and resale condominiums. According to the 99-SRX price index for resale HDB and private housing, property prices have been growing below median income over the last 10 years, but new private housing prices have outpaced income. “Where median income increased around 39 per cent in the in the last 10 years, resale condos increased 32 per cent while new sale condos increased 74 per cent,” said Mr Luqman Hakim, chief data & analytics officer at 99.co. Data from the URA analysed by OrangeTee & Tie Research & Analytics show that the median price of a new launch condo was S$1.95 million last year, about half a million dollars more than the median price of a resale condo, which was S$1.39 million. Comparing this with household income data, the housing affordability ratio for new launch condominiums has risen substantially in the last five years, from 10.84 to 16.06 - meaning that it now takes about 16 years of income for an average household to afford a median new launch unit. Conversely, it has stayed flat for resale condos at about 11 to 12 times median income. HDB resale flats have remained affordable in the last decade, as the ratio has remained under five. And while private housing is above the affordability threshold, it should be noted that private housing accommodates less than 30 per cent of Singapore's population, meaning that it was never affordable for the median income, and arguably not meant to be. ATTAINABLE FOR INCOMES OF S$12,000 AND ABOVE At S$1.6 million, the median condominium unit is affordable for a couple with a combined income of about S$10,500, based on the 99.co affordability calculator. This assumes the hypothetical couple can take a housing loan of up to S$1.2 million, or 75 per cent of the value of the property, for 30 years at 4 per cent interest. They must also have set aside funds for a down payment, legal fees and other expenses. Of course, this does not take into account that many middle-income families have car loans and many other household expenses. It also assumes that they don't have a first property, and won't incur the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD). But this simplistic example shows that private property can be attainable for about 40 per cent of income earners in Singapore - provided their other financial commitments are minimal. A more realistic estimate would be that it is available to the top 30 per cent of households by income. For those whose household incomes are just above the median income of S$10,099, executive condominiums are another option. ECs have one other advantage - there’s no need to pay the ABSD upfront. “We still see good value and reasonable price points in some new sale and resale condominium projects, including ECs, that are attainable for households that generally have joint incomes of S$12,000 and above,” said Mr Luqman. The crowd at a new condominium launch on Jul 1, 2023. The crowd at a new condominium launch on Jul 1, 2023. New launch condos are another story, as their prices have jumped since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the median price of new launch condos closer to S$2 million. Median psf price for new launches also crossed the S$2,000 mark last year. But it's well known that condo launches are often full of interested buyers, with thousands thronging showflats for popular developments on weekends. Grand Dunman, dubbed a \"mega launch\" as it is the only development with more than 1,000 units this year, attracted about 10,000 people on the first weekend of preview, Huttons estimated. And they're not just there to browse, as recent condominium launches have clocked impressive sales, even amid high interest rates and an uncertain economic outlook. Grand Dunman, which is on the city fringe and a short walk from the Dakota MRT station, sold more than 520 units on its launch weekend. Other launches in the first quarter of 2023, such as Tembusu Grand, also did well, selling 53 per cent, or 340 of its 638 units, during its launch in early April at an average selling price of S$2,465 per sq ft. Related: Commentary: Will fresh supply of private homes ease property prices in Singapore? Singapore announces new property cooling measures, additional buyer's stamp duty doubled to 60% for foreigners Mr Leonard Tay, head of research at Knight Frank Singapore, said the robust demand for new homes has been fueled by the \"continued aspirations\" of Singaporeans who grew up in an era of \"steadily improving affluence\" and have the resources to purchase these new homes, said Mr Tay. Who are these buyers? Reports from property firms after each launch indicate that the majority of buyers are first-time Singaporean property buyers. Mr Luqman said that he’s noticed in recent five years that purchasers of new private residential projects are already staying in private property. “The trend was different prior to that where purchasers of such properties are likely upgraders from HDB,” he said. He thinks that profits from the sale of current private property to purchase a new launch plus growing incomes likely contribute to the large crowds seen in new launch showrooms in spite of a substantial increase in prices. The Business Times reported on May 28 that the Reserve Residences in Upper Bukit Timah sold the majority of units (520 out of the 635 units released) at an average price of S$2,460 per sq ft. The report mentioned that those aged between 31 and 40 made up 41 per cent of all buyers, but it also attracted those between 21 and 30 years of age, which comprised 22 per cent of buyers. Mr Luqman said that anecdotally there are more millennial households at new condo launches. Analysts said this younger crowd could have higher disposable income, and/or have some help from their family. “These households typically have dual incomes and smaller family sizes, something which is less common comparing to previous generations, leading to higher disposable incomes which can be used for financing their properties,” said Mr Luqman. Meanwhile, some analysts think they could have got a leg-up from asset-rich parents. Mr Tay said that household income is one indicator housing affordability, but is not the only source of household capital. \"At least two generations of Singaporeans have benefitted from asset appreciation from developing to developed nation status in the last 50 years,\" he said. \"The savings amassed largely by the baby boomers and in part by Generation X might also have been redeployed to fund their children’s private home aspirations in recent years.\" He added that families upgrading from HDB flats bought through the BTO process would also be able to use the profits from the sale after the five-year MOP to make the transition into the private market. “Historically, a family's ascension up the property ladder was not as closely tied to the assets of their parents. But we've seen this connection strengthen over time,” said Dr Lee Nai Jia, head of real estate intelligence at PropertyGuru. Are rental properties still a worthwhile investment in 2023? Listen to Money Talks: Related: The Big Read: Why are buyers still snapping up new condos despite soaring prices? Commentary: Even with million-dollar HDB flats, housing is still affordable for the average person HOUSING & SOCIAL MOBILITY Given that HDB flats - which house 78 per cent of the Singapore population - remain affordable to most Singaporeans, what is the significance of having some of the most expensive private residential real estate in Asia? After all, Singapore has one of the highest home ownership rates in the world. If condominium price increases are much faster and greater than HDB price appreciation, some potential buyers will choose to invest in private condos, said Dr Lee Kwan Ok. As a result, the markets will diverge further and this may lead to unequal financial outcomes among households. Dr Lee Nai Jia thinks that the quest for property isn't solely a matter of securing a roof over one's head. A potential consequence of two diverging housing markets is the deepening divide within society, particularly between asset-rich parents and those without such advantages, he said. “It's intrinsically tied to the aspiration of social mobility … Therefore, we need to rethink housing solutions that don't just address affordability, but also foster a healthy social fabric and personal development,” he said. “Such an economic chasm poses a threat to societal stability. This is precisely why the government's strategic emphasis has been directed towards preserving our social contract and prioritising the accessibility of public housing.” But Professor Qian Wenlan, director of NUS’ Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies, does not see a sharp divergence materialising and thinks that the majority of the Singapore population would be more concerned about the affordability of public housing. Furthermore, she sees the spillover effect also moving in the opposite direction, with public housing prices possibly affecting private property prices. “The injection of supply downstream will mitigate inflation in the public housing market, which may even have a spillover effect on the property market as a whole,” she said. “By and large, we expect public housing to remain highly affordable to the majority of the population, especially since the government’s policy is to price BTO flats according to median incomes rather than market demand.” \"PRIORITISING WHAT REALLY MATTERS\" Analysts agreed that in general, the Singapore government has done a good job at housing the nation. This is unlike cities like Seoul and Hong Kong where residents “struggle a lot” due to housing attainability, said Dr Lee Kwan Ok. “For example, public housing supply is limited and private housing prices are very high in Seoul, so many young people give up their marriage and childbirth due to housing unaffordability,” she said. “In Hong Kong, the waiting time for public rental housing is very long, and many are forced to turn to private housing which is very unaffordable.\" Sociologist Tan Ern Ser said that in a society like Singapore, social mobility is always possible to all, but the probability of moving up is unequal across classes. He thinks the government has been making make public housing more affordable and attractive, with new housing developments, such as Bidadari, Tengah, and the Southern Water Front, for instance; while persuading Singaporeans to redefine success in less material terms. “I don’t think we could solve this problem of the bifurcation of public and private housing satisfactorily, but we could aim to live a ‘good enough’ life, prioritising what really matters: our mental and physical health, family and friends, and community life,” said Dr Tan.

Standing outside his parents' bakery at Sims Vista Market and Food Centre with loose change jangling, Mr Sim would have a box of tau sar piah (filled pastry biscuits) in one hand and plastic bags in another. This would be his introduction to the family business. \"It was a family thing,\" he recalled. \"Everybody started from young, we came here and we helped out.\" During the Lunar New Year, Mr Sim would be mobilised to help make pineapple tarts, love letters and prawn rolls with hae bee hiam (spicy shrimp condiment) . If the Sim family were making goodies, the whole block would know it, he recalled. But as his path took him into teaching, little did Mr Sim expect that he would one day be continuing in the family legacy. FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS Hung Huat Cakes and Pastries started off from a humble pushcart. Before hawker centres were developed in Singapore, Sim's paternal grandfather was a pushcart vendor who sold traditional min jiang kueh (folded pancakes with various fillings) in the Geylang area. After the government relocated street vendors like Mr Sim's grandfather into hawker centres, the business found a home at Sims Vista Market and Food Centre , where it remains today. Mr Sim's parents - his mother, Mdm Liau Cheok Wan was an apprentice at a traditional bakery, while his father Mr Sim Heng Hung was a carpenter - would eventually take over the reins from his grandfather. The bakery was right beside the carpentry factory, and that was how the couple met. After getting married, they decided to leave their jobs and run the business full-time. \"My mom has the background, and even though my dad wasn't trained as a baker, he loves eating all these things,\" said Mr Sim. \"So he is always thinking about new ways and things, so together then they started doing more and more pastries. A lot of recipes are actually created on their own.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Hung Huat Cakes & Pastries (@hunghuatcakesandpastries) And along the way things changed. Mr Sim's parents moved on from selling min jiang kueh, and expanded to selling different kinds of homemade pastries. These days, they are particularly well known for their Teochew mooncakes, pineapple tarts and kueh bangkit (tapioca cookies). But it was never on the cards that Mr Sim would follow in his parents' footsteps. \"Since young, my parents told me, you have to study … if not you’ll end up like me. They are the very traditional kind of family. So the mindset is always if you don't study, you end up doing things which are very tough. It’s a tough job, you wake up very early, you sweat it out, you work very, very hard, and things like that,\" he recalled. \"If you study hard, you get a better job, you sit in the air con ... But the funny thing is, now I ended up here.\" Mr Sim's journey to teaching had a few \"detours\" such as spending another year in junior college, he recalled. \"All these I believe added on to my life experiences. I had to experience a few ups and downs, failures and things like that, which I believe made me stronger,\" he said. \"I feel in a way indebted to very good teachers that I met, (and there were) quite a few of them. Even until today, I keep in contact with them.\" Inspired by these teachers, Mr Sim knew what kind of teacher he wanted to become. \"That ... experience forms a large proportion of my teaching belief, the way I taught, the way I spoke to my students and things like that. Without that ... I don't think I'll be able to do what I did in school as a teacher,\" said Mr Sim, who taught in a secondary school for about seven years. FIREFIGHTING \"EVERYWHERE\" Being a teacher came with its highs and lows, said Mr Sim. \"To say that it's perfect, I'd be lying,\" he said. \"There were things that I really, really loved about the job, but there are also things that I really didn't enjoy.\" What he enjoyed the most was his interactions with students, as he was roped into the school's discipline committee. He eventually became a discipline master. \"That was the one thing that kept me going for very long,\" he recalled. \"What really fuelled me is really in this role .. I got to interact with the students, students from really very, very diverse backgrounds.\" Getting through to these students brought him satisfaction. \"I felt that I was in the right place, I'm doing what I'm good at,\" he said. \"You've got to have a lot of different tricks up your sleeve. The way you talk to different students ... It's really about the tone, the language and everything - you just really have to be very quick, very flexible.\" Pastries have been a big part of Sim Weijie's life. (Photo: CNA/Matthew Mohan) These interactions taught him a lot, said Mr Sim. \"As a teacher, if you're going in with the mindset that I'm here to teach, I'm just here to impart whatever I have to my students, then I think that's very wrong ... They have their own stories as well, and all these stories will teach us some things,\" he explained. But there were struggles, such as the heavy workload. \"While you are really trying to do your best as a teacher to engage the students meaningfully, you have so many other things. Projects, new initiatives, the admin, the sheer admin load and things like that,\" he said. \"As much as a teacher wants to give their 100 per cent for one student, they struggle, because they have so many people to take care of … It’s really a stop-gap. You are plugging gaps everywhere, you're firefighting everywhere.\" Dealing with some parents was also not easy, recalled Mr Sim. \"Another bigger issue that I feel is also the way general adults in Singapore look at teachers, especially when dealing with parents. That is a very, very challenging portion. Sometimes you just feel like you are like the customer service officer,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter what role you're holding.\" As time ticked on, Mr Sim felt that he had achieved what he had set out to do as a young teacher. \"(The goals were to be) the kind of teacher where I feel I am able to inspire. The kind of teacher where I feel I'm able to command a kind of respect not just from my students, but from my colleagues,\" he said. A feeling of being jaded also started to seep in. \"I wanted to be fair to my students. I didn't want to be the kind of teacher where I am already slacking, getting a bit laid back, and then at the same time, I’m just waiting to draw my pay every month, waiting for time to pass,\" Mr Sim explained. \"I didn't want to become that kind of teacher, I didn’t want to shortchange my job.\" At the same time, he saw that his parents needed help with the business. \"They were also thinking of retiring but at the same time couldn't bear to let go of the business,\" he said. And so he initiated a conversation about coming on board. \"It's something that I really want to preserve,\" Mr Sim said. \"And it is something that my parents spent so many years doing, it is a waste to let it go down the drain.\" While they were \"happy but yet shocked\", Mr Sim recalled how his mother was apprehensive at first. She felt that it was a pity he was giving up his job as a teacher and was also worried that working together might affect their relationship. \"My closer friends, even though they were shocked at first when I told them this was my decision … They understood, they knew that this is … something I really want to do,\" he added Pineapple tarts are one of the shop's bestselling items. (Photo: CNA/Matthew Mohan) But the switch doesn't mean that he regrets going into teaching. Mr Sim said he would do it all over again, if given a second chance. \"The people I met, the experience I had, the friendship, the bonds that I built with my students and things like that, it is something really I dare say you can’t find many other jobs,\" he explained. \"So I think that's where teaching is really, really impactful.\" \"PART OF THE FAMILY\" A trade which was sometimes under-appreciated over the past decades, Singapore’s hawker culture was added to the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2020. However, hawkers continue to face numerous challenges including manpower pressures and rising food, rental and electricity costs. Given such factors, it is more challenging being a hawker now than it has ever been, believes food writer Annette Tan. An added complication is the plethora of dining options which Singaporeans now have, she added. \"To be in the food business in any capacity, you need to have passion. There's no other reason why anybody goes into food, it is such a difficult business to be in,\" added Ms Tan. And despite various programmes in place to encourage the uptake of the trade, according to the National Environment Agency (NEA), the median age of hawkers is 60 years old. However, chairman of the Federation of Merchants’ Associations Singapore’s (FMAS) hawker division Anthony Low believes that more young hawkers are now more willing to enter the trade as compared to when he made the switch two decades ago. Mr Low left the Singapore Armed Forces 23 years ago to run his father’s ngoh hiang stall. He was 29 then, and no one else would take up the mantle then. He believes that the inclusion of Singapore's hawker culture into the UNESCO listing has helped to raise the profile of and highlight the contribution of hawkers. \"Now at least people recognise our effort and give us the respect,\" he said. \"It is not a dying trade.\" While there are youngsters who start their businesses from scratch, those who take on the mantle of a family business as a \"truly rare breed\", author of bestselling cookbook Wet Market to Table Pamelia Chia told CNA. \"I have not met many people who come from a line of hawkers, a lot of the young ones that I've come across are starting their own businesses from scratch instead of inheriting them,\" said Ms Chia, who is also the founder of Singapore Noodles, a newsletter with the mission of keeping Singapore’s food heritage alive. \"When you actually have have folks who truly understand the craft, who have clearly shown that they have taken the time to learn things from their parents, or from fellow hawkers, then I think it's very encouraging for the hawker scene.\" At the same time, if nobody takes over these family businesses, or are wanting to learn the trade, it can pose a \"huge issue\" for Singapore's hawker culture, she added. \"Like everything in life, the hawker centres have to evolve, and Singaporeans have to be willing to accept this evolution,\" added Ms Tan. \"The hawker centre will always be a part of our lives ... but the food that the hawker centre is serving will be different.\" The career switch meant that Mr Sim had to take a pay cut, and he also had other concerns such as whether the work would take too much time away from his family. \"I had a lot of family support, from my parents especially and my wife. We managed to find ways to mitigate some of these challenges,\" he added. The job is by no means easy. It can be physically demanding and involves long hours, Mr Sim added. During peak seasons, work begins at 6am and ends at about 10pm. \"It is like (a) 14,15 hours kind of thing ... You're standing most of the time. So I say the biggest struggle is actually physical,\" he said. \"(My parents) are both in their 60s. They do things so fast, so quickly, because they have a system. They are basically like machines … when I work with them, I am struggling to keep up with them sometimes.\" Working with family does come with challenges, he admitted. \"There will definitely be disagreements, but I think we've worked out a system. Sometimes to agree to disagree, sometimes to know who is the most experienced, who is the best person to make a decision,\" said Mr Sim. \"Sometimes (there is) stress to keep up orders, but ... mental health-wise, I think it's definitely better than before when I was a teacher.\" There is also a need to cope with rising costs, and added to this is the perception among a minority that hawker food must remain cheap regardless. \"I feel that this can be discouraging for hawkers. Some hawkers really, really use the best ingredients which are not cheap, and they really try their very best to ensure that their food quality is good,\" said Mr Sim. \"There are still a lot of people out there who are very understanding ... Most of the people they will tell you say: 'It's okay, we understand that your price has to increase, costs are going up. As you continue to sell good food'.\" What's been an added benefit is that Mr Sim is not starting from scratch. After all, he has been helping out at the stall for most of his life. \"It is not ground zero,\" he explained. \"I've always had a taste for pastries. So when I went overseas, I will go for pastries, different pastries shops. I like to try, I like to eat, I also have this very particular taste for pastries, and in a way (certain) standards. So when I make certain things that it's not up to my own standards, I rather throw it.\" Sim Weijie serves a customer. (Photo: CNA/Matthew Mohan) His previous role as a teacher has also helped him in his job, said Mr Sim. \"As a teacher, you are doing everything. You are doing events, you’re doing management, you’re doing people relationship management,\" he said. \"Over here as a hawker, you do every single thing. Production, logistics, marketing ... cleaning up, taking the trash out ... I felt in the last few months when I started full time, there are so many things that I learnt. There is growth which is one of the things that makes up satisfaction for me.\" There is also a sweet sense of satisfaction that comes with growing one's own business as well as when people enjoy your food, Mr Sim said. Related: Commentary: If we want to preserve Singapore’s hawker culture, we need to be willing to pay for it And bit by bit, he is also breaking new ground. On top of making use of social media to market products, he has also introduced creations of his own. One of these new goodies is the Hokkaido Milk Mochi piah , a current bestseller. \"People really like it. The marketing portion is important. Getting the word out, the videos, the photos and everything. That is the thing that first attracts people. After that when they come down, it has to taste good,\" he said. Mr Sim hopes to eventually take over in the next few years, and for his parents to finally enjoy a well-deserved break, while helping out at the shop whenever they can. \"There are a lot of family businesses in Singapore but if you are talking about traditional food, pastries ... you’ll see less and less. Because of the nature of the work, the amount of commitment you have to put in, the hard work physically, the challenge. I probably say not a lot of people want to do it,\" he said. And skills and recipes are lost, as old \"masters\" of the trade retire and bakeries continue to close down, he added. The shop is \"part of the family\", he added. \"I cannot imagine not having this shop … This business is a place where my family members gather - my aunts, my uncles, my cousins come here and help ... It is a place and an opportunity to gather,\" said Mr Sim. \"It’s not just a business, It’s part of the family. It’s part of the family tradition, it’s a place where we gather, there are so, so many memories tied to this business. So this is one of the reasons why ... it is worth keeping.\" Source: CNA/mt Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Subscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Download here Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Join here Related Topics teacher hawker In Focus Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-MTkhHJRquTM')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-uVfXozHHU6E')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-kawDD3ZeL4c')); Also worth reading Content is loading...

While public bathhouses have been in decline for decades, saunas are surging in Japan. (Photo: iStock/Dimensions) New: You can now listen to articles. This audio is generated by an AI tool. Gearoid Reidy Gearoid Reidy 15 Nov 2023 06:00AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn TOKYO: In Japan, saunas suddenly seem everywhere. On Instagram, influencers and actors appeared to visit them daily, and the app was bombarding me with ads for mountain retreats with cold-plunge pools. Several friends who are dedicated “saunners” (a Japanese-English word used to refer to sauna devotees) insisted I give it a try. Local media speak of a “sauna boom” as they once had of the “tapioca boom”, with facilities popping up in central Tokyo just as bubble tea stores had before the pandemic, during a brief and intense social-media-inspired infatuation with the Taiwanese drink . Public bathhouses have been in decline for decades, with the number of sento baths in Tokyo dropping by nearly half in the last 15 years. By comparison, saunas are surging, with more than 12,000 facilities listed on leading portal site Sauna Ikitai. For old bathhouses that can afford the capital investment, steam room facilities are helping some to stay afloat. Finnish equipment makers are eagerly eyeing Japan as a growth market. It’s been suggested that steam rooms have perhaps taken golf’s place for clearing the minds of executives before they conduct multibillion-dollar deals. This sauna boom is the country’s third, according to experts, after the country first discovered the joys of getting sweaty when the facilities were first built in the athletes’ village for Finnish competitors at the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. The practice enjoyed a revival in the 1990s, when large bathhouses known as “super sento” became popular, usually featuring a steam room or two. A PROLIFERATION OF SAUNA RITUALS A key difference in this growth period is the proliferation of rituals that newcomers can follow, based on Finnish customs of cycling between intense heat, cold-bath immersion, a break in fresh air, then repeat. This is aimed at achieving the state of totonou - a buzzy word for contentment and clarity achieved, caused by the release of norepinephrine and endorphins. The Japanese tend to like this kind of practice, this “correct” way of doing things - think of the traditional ceremony of drinking matcha green tea, the right way to wear kimonos or indeed the frequently unspoken rules of public bathing etiquette. Related: Does using the sauna actually help you lose weight? And does it count as cardio? Commentary: Why are Singapore travellers so enamoured with Japan? Online guides dictate how much time one needs to spend in a sauna of what temperature (between 80 and 100 degrees Celsius, or 176 to 212 Fahrenheit), how long to endure the heat before subjecting oneself to a cold plunge, as well as the correct number of times to repeat the cycle to achieve totonou. A bewildering array of terms transmogrified into Japanese from various European languages, from aufguss to loyly, create the impression of a sophisticated hobby, like wine collecting, that rewards dedication and study. In the English-speaking West, sauna culture seems the province of meatheaded podcast bros and overbearing tech entrepreneurs. Not so in Japan, where polls indicate it’s equally as popular with women as men. Friends recommended it not for its physical health benefits, but for the mental, with one acquaintance going so far as to liken totonou to getting high. In search of psychological clarity, if nothing else, I visited one of the trendy new facilities in Tokyo’s Shibuya district. I followed the rituals as written: Ten minutes or so in the sauna; a minute in the cold plunge pool; another quarter of an hour taking in fresh air and awaiting inspiration. Nothing happened. I felt as likely to catch a cold as find inner peace. Was the sauna not hot enough? Had I chickened out of the frigid bath too early? I needed to go further. NEED FOR RELAXATION I reached out to the man most directly responsible for the recent craze, manga artist Katsuki Tanaka. He began writing about saunas in 2009, having become hooked on the experience after joining his local gym, and copying what he saw others do. His columns eventually became a collection of essays entitled Sado, a play on the word for tea ceremony, but using a different character to mean “The Way of the Sauna”. That became a hit comic book and in 2019 was turned into a TV show, all of which helped inspire the current trend. In the process, he popularised the sauna rituals and coined the word totonou. Then came COVID-19, which turbocharged the need for facilities where people could get away from life’s cares. “Spending so much time at home, surrounded by information on computers and smartphones, unable to go abroad, makes people want an experience that will satisfy your five senses,” Tanaka says. “Our lifestyles have hugely changed in the last few years.\" Related: Commentary: Should you take time off for leisure during working hours? Commentary: There is much more to mindfulness than mainstream hype That, he says, is the reason for a similar boom in camping. The need for relaxation might also be behind a recent surge in shisha bars serving waterpipe tobacco. I posited that one reason for the particular popularity in Japan might be the lack of other highs, legal or otherwise, that the nation’s drug laws ensure. The country’s ban on cannabis remains steadfast, though times are changing. Next year, the government plans to permit its medical use. Curiously, many CBD products are legal in Japan, hailed for their relaxing effects. (Products made from the high-inducing THC are illegal.) Inspired by Tanaka’s explanation - and on deadline for this column, which remained frustratingly incomplete - I sought mental clarity again. Back into the sauna, the cold pool, the fresh air, repeat. Nothing. My mind raced. Deprived of external stimulus, my hands yearned for my smartphone, for Twitter, Reddit, that fleeting dopamine hit. And then, after my third cycle - something! My fidgeting stopped. A strange sense of calm swept over me, a feeling that while I could move, I didn’t need to move. The muscles in my arms and legs twitched involuntarily. My mind went blank; I stopped worrying about my deadline, and with senses heightened, took in the ambient sounds of dripping water and instrumental music. Was this totonou? I’ve no idea. It faded quickly. So too might the sauna boom, just as the boba tea sensation did - streets in Shibuya and nearby Harajuku are now filled with boarded-up tea joints. Saunas are exposed to the risk of rising energy costs, and Japan’s falling real wages are bad news for pricey hobbies, with an average sauna visit costing around 2,000 yen (US$13) - that’s twice the minimum wage, around four times the government-controlled price for sento bathhouses. Some newer facilities can cost 3,000 yen and above. But hopefully they aren’t just a fad. We could all use a little inner peace.

A computer chip is inserted in their brains to act as a “mindwipe”. They leave all thoughts of home behind while at work, and completely forget about their work when at home. While the show explores the pitfalls of such a split in consciousness, there’s no denying it’s a tantalising prospect to be able to “flick the off switch” and forget about work whenever you’re not actually supposed to be working . This is known as “psychological detachment”. People who can do it are happier and healthier, and experience less fatigue. But many of us struggle to detach and disconnect mentally from work, particularly when our jobs are demanding and stressful. It may not be enough simply to be physically away from work, particularly in an era when so many of us work from home. We also have to stop thinking about work when we’re not there - whether it’s fretting over your to-do list while out at dinner, thinking about your unanswered emails while you’re at your daughter’s soccer game, or lying in bed pondering what you’ll say at tomorrow’s board meeting. THE ART OF DETACHMENT Your choice of activity outside work can be crucial to this process of psychological detachment. To learn more about what strategies are most effective, my research surveyed nurses who were working shifts in hospital emergency departments in 2020, a highly stressful work environment. My colleagues and I collected data from 166 nurses, using a survey called the Recovery Experience Questionnaire. This included collecting information about the underlying psychological experiences associated with home-time activities, such as feeling relaxed while reading a book or going for a walk. Importantly, our survey results also showed nurses who were better able to forget about work had less fatigue and better physical and mental health. Our results identified three key strategies that helped our survey participants to reduce fatigue and mentally recover from work: Exercise, spending time with family and friends, and leisure pursuits. Related: Commentary: Should we really be listening to leaders’ advice on work-life balance? Why am I not motivated to work? How do I deal with burnout and fatigue? The physical benefits of exercise are well known. But exercising - whether it’s doing yoga, going for a run or playing netball - also brings mental benefits by encouraging you to focus deeply on what you’re doing rather than dwelling on outside thoughts. Friendship and social connection are also good for our well-being. Research suggests people who have plenty of friends and confidants are less likely to die from chronic disease. And one study found people who undertake a difficult task with the help of a friend have fewer abrupt changes in heart rate than those who tackle the task alone. Deliberately making time to spend with family, friends or pets can help us forget about work at home, and to centre our attention instead on what is important to us besides work. Many of the nurses in our study reduced the effects of fatigue during home time by pursuing hobbies and interests such as sewing or gardening. But you shouldn’t worry too much about what specific activity you pursue - the main thing is to pick something you find pleasurable and engaging, and which fits comfortably around your existing commitments. LEAVE YOUR WORK AT WORK Finally, switching off from work also means not letting your work come home with you. Where possible, complete all your daily tasks so these aren’t on your mind at home. Unplug from work-related technology by not checking work emails or texts. Of course, technology and working from home have now made separating work and home even harder. But setting healthy routines can help put mental as well as physical boundaries around your work time - even when your workplace is in the next room.

Brand Studio Brand Studio 12 Mar 2024 09:27AM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Brought to you by Struggling to ensure your child gets all the nutrients they need? You’re not alone. Many parents face the challenge of balancing their little one’s picky eating habits with the need for a well-rounded diet that fuels their growth and development. According to HealthHub, it’s recommended that a child’s daily diet includes an array of vitamins such as A, B, C, D, E and K . These nutrients can readily be found in a variety of fruits and vegetables, with many being particularly rich in Vitamins A, C, K and folic acid. Eggs and dairy products are excellent sources of Vitamin B12, while fish is high in Vitamin D. However, between hectic schedules, fussy eaters and the lure of convenient but nutritionally deficient snacks, ensuring your child gets all the goodness they need can feel like a Herculean task. Food allergies and the pressures of modern life can create additional challenges, potentially resulting in inadequate nutritional intake for children. FACTORS THAT AFFECT NUTRITIONAL INTAKE Understanding the myriad factors influencing a child’s nutritional intake is key to addressing dietary gaps and promoting healthy growth. Parents often attribute their children’s aversion to vegetables to their taste buds, but the reason may be more complex. Food neophobia , an apprehension towards new or unfamiliar foods, is common among children aged two to six. This fear often leads them to reject unknown foods, including vegetables. Instead, they tend to gravitate towards sweet flavours and a limited selection of fruits or vegetables they find palatable. Food neophobia in kids can make it challenging to ensure that they receive a well-rounded intake of nutrients. Such dietary limitations can significantly restrict their consumption of a broad spectrum of fruits and vegetables, each offering unique nutritional benefits essential during the critical growing years from ages two to 12 . Our contemporary fast-paced lifestyle brings additional challenges, notably an increasing prevalence of anxiety among children. In Singapore, for example, about 12.5 per cent of children aged 6 to 12 exhibit signs of emotional issues and/or behavioural issues. Research from Harvard University states that persistent stress can strain the body’s metabolic demands , depleting nutrient reserves and potentially impeding growth and development. Without a balanced diet, children face the risk of nutrient deficiencies. This connection between emotional well-being and dietary habits underscores the crucial need to address any underlying anxieties. Navigating the dietary needs of children with common food allergies like wheat, soy, peanuts, eggs, shellfish and milk adds another layer of complexity. These allergies pose substantial obstacles in ensuring a balanced intake of essential nutrients. If your children have food allergies, consider consulting a registered dietitian or healthcare professional to help create tailored meal plans that cater to these dietary restrictions. ENHANCING YOUR CHILD’S WELL-BEING THROUGH SUPPLEMENTS While a balanced diet typically provides adequate nutrients for children, there are instances where dietary supplements are beneficial. Herbal Pharm’s Beta Glucan supplement serves to complement the daily meals of children aged three and above, said Ms Logeswari Shivaprakash, chief operating officer of Herbal Pharm . “The supplement enriches their diet with key nutrients like Vitamins D3, A and C, along with Omega-3. These are vital for bone health, vision, immunity and overall well-being. Coupled with our patented Smart Chew technology that improves nutrient absorption, parents can have peace of mind knowing that their children are getting the optimal nutrition to flourish,” she shared. For kids involved in extracurricular activities, supplements can support their well-being and provide them with the energy they need to keep up with their busy schedules. Its key ingredient, beta glucan, is a bioactive polysaccharide found in yeast and mushrooms that supports immune function . Ms Shivaprakash added: “Beta glucan helps keep your gut healthy by balancing the good bacteria in your stomach and strengthening the walls of your intestines.” In addition to its primary ingredient, the supplement contains vitamins and minerals that support growth and development. For instance, Vitamin D3 is included to facilitate calcium absorption, enhance bone health and support immunity. The addition of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an Omega-3 fatty acid, plays a crucial role in cognitive development and visual function . DHA aids in transmitting signals between brain cells, promoting optimal neurological function and potentially reducing the risk of vision-related issues. Another Omega-3 fatty acid beneficial for brain development, cognitive function and memory is eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Its anti-inflammatory properties may alleviate symptoms of asthma, eczema and allergies, and promote better respiratory and skin health in children . Additionally, Vitamin A is vital for vision and eye health , while Vitamin C bolsters the immune system and may contribute to lower blood pressure . While dietary supplements like beta glucan can enhance a child’s nutrition, it is important to note that they should not be a substitute for a balanced diet and regular exercise. When selecting a supplement, parents should carefully weigh their child’s specific nutritional needs, potential allergies and personal preferences. “Other factors to consider include product efficacy, ingredients (whether they are natural, sugar-free or vegan-friendly) and brand trust. If you believe your child may benefit from supplements, do seek advice from a healthcare professional,” said Ms Shivaprakash. For busy parents seeking to enhance their child’s nutrition, Herbal Pharm’s Beta Glucan supplement offers a convenient solution. The article should not be taken as medical advice or used as a recommendation for any specific treatment or medication. Parents should consult a healthcare professional before introducing new supplements to their child’s diet.

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has taken on board feedback from the early adopters to enhance user choice, convenience and safety, he said. Replying to MPs’ questions in Parliament on Wednesday (May 8), he outlined the refinements as LTA proceeds with the installation exercise of the On-Board Unit (OBU). Mr Chee pointed out that the process will take a few years to complete. About two per cent or 18,000 vehicles out of almost one million vehicles in Singapore have installed the OBU. Of these, around 11,000 are fleet vehicles. Mr Chee said this phased approach gives the workshops time to prepare their workers and ramp up their resources. It also allows LTA to take in feedback from stakeholders and understand the areas for improvement before extending to other vehicles. One key refinement is the option of touchscreen, in-vehicle or mobile phone display for vehicle owners. The vehicle owner can also choose where to place the touchscreen display, subject to technical feasibility. For the initial phase of installation, LTA only allowed the processing unit to be installed on the passenger side. Vehicle owners will now be given the option to install the processing unit on the driver’s side. Service ambassadors will be present at the showrooms and workshops to explain the options to vehicle owners. Mr Chee said by providing more choices, the process becomes more complex and the workshops will need more time to complete the installation. However, the trade-off is necessary to give vehicle owners the flexibility to customise their preferred options, he said. 08 May 2024 12:41pm Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn The transition to ERP 2.0 is a major exercise as there are different vehicles with different designs and specifications, said Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat.

The Malaysian government is separately deliberating the area and sectors to be covered by the Johor-Singapore SEZ. Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan said this in response to an MP's question in Parliament on Wednesday (May 8). He added that the two countries are also working towards an agreement on the SEZ and will provide an update to the 11th Malaysia-Singapore Leaders' Retreat to be held later this year. Turning to how local heartland enterprises can be assisted to manage challenges arising from a potential shift in spending from Singapore to Johor, Mr Tan said that the Government will continue to revitalise the heartlands and help heartland enterprises transform to stay competitive. One example is the Heartland Enterprise Placemaking Grant announced this year to encourage business growth and footfall, said Mr Tan. 08 May 2024 01:17pm Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Since the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in January 2024, Singapore and Malaysia have been in discussions on early initiatives such as passport-free QR code clearance at land checkpoints and a one-stop service centre to facilitate business approvals.

In a ministerial statement in Parliament on Wednesday (May 8), Mr Shanmugam highlighted the global and regional drug situation, the threat from the drug trade and Singapore’s approach to that threat, attempts to spread misinformation and undermine aspects of Singapore’s drug policies, as well as Singapore’s plans to further strengthen its drug control policies. Mr Shanmugam told the House that Singapore has a strict national drug control policy that is necessary, effective and well-supported by Singaporeans. Its strict approach has saved thousands of lives. Mr Shanmugam said all things being equal, the number of drug abusers in Singapore should have gone up in the last 30 years as supply in the region has exploded and purchasing power has increased significantly. “But instead, the number has gone down. By that alone, I say we have saved the lives of thousands of potential abusers,” he said. “This is the war that we are fighting in Singapore and if we do not fight it or if we lose it, then thousands in Singapore will suffer,” he said. Mr Shanmugam told the House that Singapore is considering what else needs to be done to ensure that its laws can be properly supported. He stressed that there is broad support from the population because the Government has been upfront and open. “Our drug control policies have been effective. But the drug situation continues to be challenging - abroad certainly, but at home as well. And we have to respond robustly to these challenges so that we do not have a generation caught up with drug addiction, so that our children can inherit a country that is safe and free of drugs and have the same environment that we enjoy today,” he said. 08 May 2024 01:31pm Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Singapore is “fighting a war” - against those who profit from the drug trade at the expense of hundreds of thousands of innocent lives, said Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam.

    "article_content": "News Video Reports Chee Hong Tat on Transport Sector (Critical Firms) Bill 23:20 Min Singapore is making its essential transport services more resilient against possible future disruptions, said Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat. It is preparing for possible extreme scenarios that may happen in future, such as the risk of malicious actors gaining control and adversely influencing its key transport entities and jeopardising the provision of essential transport services, he said. Mr Chee, who outlined the key provisions of the Transport Sector (Critical Firms) Bill in Parliament on Wednesday (May 8), said the Government is taking a sector-specific, calibrated and targeted approach covering air, land and sea. He said this would better allow Singapore to customise the regulatory oversight needed for its transport ecosystem and balance these objectives with the commercial and business impact on transport entities and their investors. Under the Bill, the Bus Services Industry Act, Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore Act, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore Act and Rapid Transit Systems Act will continue to be administered by the relevant authorities. These authorities will also be responsible for designating relevant entities under the framework. The Bill will regulate entities within the transport sector that are involved in the provision of essential transport services in the air, land or sea transport sectors, and are strategically important within the sector. For land, public bus and rail services will be included, among other things. For aviation, they would cover, among other things, airport and ground handling operations, as well as passenger and cargo air services at Changi Airport. For maritime, among other things, port and marine services and facilities will be included. The regulatory authorities will have the power to designate entities. The Government intends to designate the relevant firms by the end of this year. The Bill will introduce legislative levers across the four Acts in three aspects. The first relates to ownership controls - to allow the relevant authorities to have oversight of significant changes in effective control of designated entities. The second set of controls pertains to the appointment of management by designated entities. These controls allow the relevant authorities to be kept apprised of any changes to the key personnel responsible for the management of critical transport firms and operations affecting the continued provision of the essential transport service. The third aspect involves operations and resourcing to ensure that companies are equipped and able to operate their services under all circumstances. Designated entities should notify their respective authorities as and when there are material developments or events. To help companies to comply with these requirements, the relevant authorities will issue a set of advisory guidelines after the Bill is approved by Parliament and comes into force. The Bill also has provisions for step-in powers via a Special Administration Order to cover designated operating entities and licensees across the air, land and sea transport sectors. This is to safeguard service continuity in extreme scenarios and unlikely events. Step-in powers will be exercised as a last resort. “Singapore’s connectivity is one of our greatest assets and something we must continue to safeguard carefully to protect the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans,\" said Mr Chee. 08 May 2024 02:38pm Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Singapore is making its essential transport services more resilient against possible future disruptions, said Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat.

Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday (May 8), he stressed the need to strike a balance between security, innovation, business viability, transparency and global competitiveness. He urged the Government to ensure that the Bill enhances rather than hinders the transport sector’s growth and resilience. He raised concerns over the potential impact on businesses, warning that bureaucratic hurdles could deter investment. He also called for clarity on compliance costs and the timelines for approval processes. Mr Yip also raised concerns about the impact on competition and consolidation within the sector, as well as innovation and costs for consumers. He also said transparency and an effective appeal process are paramount and added that the Minister’s broad powers require clear justification and accountability mechanisms to prevent misuse. 08 May 2024 03:24pm Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn The Transport Sector (Critical Firms) Bill seeks to enhance the Government’s oversight over critical companies in Singapore’s air, land and sea transport sectors, said MP Yip Hon Weng.

Hence, for succession, the appointment of an appropriate CEO and Chairman is naturally challenging. \"Why are we limiting our choices for good talent when we should be reconsidering our regulations to bring in the best?\" MP Poh Li San raised this question in Parliament on Wednesday (May 8). She asked if the Transport Minister could share the broad criteria for the Chairman and CEO for designated entities, such as nationality, professional background, experience and track record in the relevant transport industry. Under the Transport Sector (Critical Firms) Bill, Ms Poh also asked under what circumstances will decisions on changes in business ownership controls be blocked by the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and what level of flexibility and independence would investors have with regard to the non-transport related business arms of designated entities. Turning to the step-in powers of the Transport Minister to which the Bill accords, Ms Poh asked what are the trigger events for the Minister to exercise his step-in powers, and if exercised, how would MOT and its regulatory agencies take over or support the team to stabilise the situation. She also wanted to know if MOT would also have the powers to mandate competitors of the affected designated operating entity to take over its responsibilities to minimise service disruptions. 08 May 2024 03:31pm Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn The transportation industry is a demanding, complex and highly regulated business where suitable leadership candidates may not be readily available.

He was charged on Tuesday with making false statements before a parliamentary committee, in relation to a lie that his party’s f ormer lawmaker Raeesah Khan told in the House in 2021. The 47-year-old, who is also the Leader of the Opposition, pleaded not guilty to two charges under the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. “Until the legal process comes to a complete close, I will continue with all my parliamentary duties and town council responsibilities – including, but not limited to, meet-the-people sessions, estate walks, house visits, Hammer outreaches, amongst others,” he said in a Facebook post. The charges come two years after the committee said he had lied under oath during the hearings. Ms Khan’s case came about in November 2021 when she admitted to lying in parliament over a rape incident that she had alleged was mishandled by the police. She resigned later that month. In his Facebook post, Singh reiterated his not guilty plea to both charges. “When I first entered politics some years ago now, I was under no illusion as to the challenges that lay ahead in building a more balanced and democratic political system in Singapore. Even as the work continues, it has been my privilege and honour to be part of a Workers’ Party team that advances this cause. “I will continue to play my part in this endeavour and I thank all Singaporeans for your continued support for the efforts of the Workers’ Party. Let’s press on,” he said. Workers' Party secretary-general Pritam Singh arrives at the State Courts on Mar 19, 2024.

(Photo: CNA/Eugene Goh) If found guilty, Singh may be jailed for up to three years, fined up to S$7,000, or both, for each charge. A spokesperson for the Attorney-General's Chambers later said in response to media queries that the prosecution will ask the court to impose a fine for each charge if Singh is found guilty. The spokesperson added that the prosecution's position is \"based on the evidence presently available and considering the totality of the circumstances\". \"It will be for the court to decide whether Mr Pritam Singh is guilty of the charges. If he is found guilty, it is for the court to decide what the appropriate punishment should be,\" the spokesperson said.

The Workers’ Party chief was handed two charges on Tuesday (Mar 19) for making false statements before a parliamentary committee that was looking into the conduct of his party’s former lawmaker Raeesah Khan , who lied in the House in 2021. In a media statement, PAP organising secretary Grace Fu said there have been queries about whether the party will, through its MPs, be seeking to suspend Singh given that he has been formally charged. PAP MPs will not be doing so, Ms Fu said, adding that the party will not comment on the merits of the case as it is now before the courts. \"This is in line with parliament’s resolution to defer any sanctions in respect of Mr Singh’s, Ms Sylvia Lim’s and Mr Faisal’s respective roles in the matter of former MP Raeesah Khan’s untruth, until after the conclusion of the investigations and criminal proceedings (if any) against Mr Singh,\" she said. Ms Khan admitted to lying in parliament in 2021 over a rape case that she had alleged was mishandled by the police. She was then referred to the Committee of Privileges for breach of parliamentary privilege. Several witnesses, including Singh and WP vice-chairman Faisal Manap, testified during the hearings that took place in late 2021 and early 2022. In its final report in February 2022, the Committee of Privileges recommended that Singh and Mr Faisal be referred to the public prosecutor for lying while testifying under oath. The public prosecutor later referred both cases to the police . DUE PROCESS OF LAW, NATURAL JUSTICE Ms Fu also said that the PAP's decision not to seek Singh's suspension was consistent with its position in relation to a motion filed by Non-Constituency Member of Parliament Hazel Poa from the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) in September 2023. The PSP motion had called for then-Transport Minister S Iswaran to be suspended as MP, following his arrest and investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). This was later rejected , with parliament voting instead to consider the matter when corruption investigations against him concluded. Leader of the House Indranee Rajah said at the time that it would be \"premature\" for parliament to take any action against Iswaran, and that such situations should not be exploited for political ends. Both Singh and Mr Manap were under police investigation when the PSP motion was filed. Ms Indranee pointed out that they had not been suspended as MPs, and questioned if Ms Poa was calling for their suspension as well. Iswaran subsequently resigned from parliament and the PAP in January this year after CPIB gave him formal notice of the criminal charges filed against him . Following Pritam's charging on Tuesday, Ms Fu said: \"Parliament must deal rigorously with any MP who has committed wrongdoing, but suspending an MP is a serious action that must be done in accordance with due process of the law and natural justice. Parliament should not prejudge the outcome of the proceedings.\" In response to a query from CNA on Tuesday on whether PSP intends to file a similar motion calling for Singh's suspension, the party said that the circumstances in his case are different from those in Iswaran's. \"It is the PSP's stance that an MP or minister who is under investigation for corruption and suspended from official duties should be put on no pay leave until the investigation or criminal case is concluded,\" a PSP spokesperson said. \"If the MP or minister subsequently resumes their official duties after being cleared by the investigation or criminal case, they should be entitled to full back pay for the period during which they were on leave of absence. \"(Leader of the Opposition) Pritam Singh has neither been charged with corruption, nor has he been suspended from his official duties by the Workers' Party.\" Related: Timeline: How a lie by Raeesah Khan led to Pritam Singh being charged with lying Pritam Singh to continue all parliamentary, town council duties until legal process comes to 'complete close' Source: CNA/zl Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Subscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Download here Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Join here Related Topics Pritam Singh People's Action Party Workers Party Singapore Parliament Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-WnVsn3_79p4')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-2wRf4VPdf-o')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-mK-auvJ21os')); Also worth reading Content is loading...

Emil Chan Emil Chan 01 Apr 2024 04:04PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Members of Parliament will debate a law on Tuesday (Apr 2) that would retroactively validate tens of thousands of legal documents missing a statement that left them open to being challenged. A total of 87,000 digital Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) documents - certified between Nov 14, 2022 , and Jan 4, 2024 - did not explicitly state that they are deeds, as required by the current Mental Capacity Act. An LPA allows an appointed person to make medical and financial decisions on behalf of another individual should they lose mental capacity. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), which apologised for the omission on Mar 4, said the affected documents are still legally valid. Related: Singapore rolls out multi-agency effort to make pre-planning for old age more accessible The omission was discovered in October 2023 after MSF received feedback from a member of the public. Electronic LPAs certified on or after Jan 5, 2024, now include the required statement: “I intend this instrument to be a deed.” Nominated MP Usha Chandradas filed a question asking about the circumstances that led to the omission of that sentence, how MSF discovered the omission, if the ministry had assessed the potential loss or harm suffered by donees and doners, and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence. MP Tan Wu Meng (PAP-Jurong) asked why the omission had not been discovered sooner, if there were process checks such as proofreading or end-user experience validations when such key documentary processes are digitised, and if they were conducted by legally trained or laypersons. MOE AND THE ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT According to the parliament order paper released on Monday, questions were also submitted on the Ministry of Education’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons on the Israel-Hamas conflict . Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said in February that his ministry’s CCE lessons are not intended to be history lessons , nor are they meant to ascribe who is right or wrong, but are instead designed to help students reflect on how to safeguard cohesion and harmony in a multiracial society and to empathise with others. Mr Chan’s comments came after concerns arose online about what schools are teaching students about the conflict in Gaza, with some posts claiming that lessons only covered developments from the Hamas attack on Oct 7, without giving a historical context of the wider conflict between Israel and Palestine that dates back several decades. Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai (PSP) asked if and at which levels students are being taught about the Israel-Hamas conflict - either in the CCE curriculum or otherwise. He also wanted to know how the contents are differentiated among the various levels to take into account student maturity levels. Related: Commentary: Singapore students should be taught world affairs to avoid binary thinking Are classrooms the right space to discuss controversial issues? Mr Chan had also noted that some teachers may feel conflicted that the CCE lessons may be against their personal beliefs, with some teachers experiencing abuse due to online uproar about the CCE lessons. NCMP Hazel Poa (PSP) submitted a question asking if content and materials of the CCE lessons on the Israel-Hamas conflict could be made public, and whether any teacher has declined to deliver a lesson. MP Sharael Taha (PAP-Pasir Ris-Punggol) asked how, in light of the CCE lessons, the Education Ministry can ensure a safe space for students to share diverse views and arrive at their own conclusions on complex issues. VAPING In January, CNA reported that while demand for professional help to quit smoking remains strong, the evasive habit of vaping is tripping up efforts by healthcare personnel to help smokers stub out for good. In March, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said they were monitoring the use of “energy stick” inhalers in Singapore on worries that, like vaping, the sticks could become a gateway to drug abuse. MP Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast) asked for an update on MOH’s anti-vaping efforts, the size of HSA’s vaping enforcement team and the number summons on vaping offences issued by the authorities in the last three years.

Fabian Koh Fabian Koh 02 Apr 2024 03:15PM (Updated: 02 Apr 2024 04:03PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: The cybersecurity of internal virtual meetings by foreign militaries that are outside the scope of the overseas events they are attending are typically not covered by the host country, Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How said on Tuesday (Apr 2). The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) take a proactive approach to cybersecurity when involved in high-signature events, such as those involving high-level foreign dignitaries, and work closely with event organisers who are accountable for overall cybersecurity, he said in parliament. MINDEF and SAF, however, do not cover the cybersecurity of foreign militaries’ internal unilateral virtual meetings, which are outside the scope of these events, noted Mr Heng. He was responding to a question by Member of Parliament (MP) Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) on measures to safeguard the security of communications lines in Singapore , after a recent incident where a private military conference call in a Singapore hotel was intercepted. A recording of a German military phone call was leaked in March , after one of the participants, who was attending the Singapore Airshow, dialled in via an \"unauthorised connection\" . 04:09 Min Participants at international events and conferences, including those attended by military personnel and Government leaders and officials, do not as a rule expect the host country to provide secured means of communications. Even if a host country is to offer such means, it is questionable whether foreign participants are comfortable using it. Foreign guests who need to transmit sensitive information will typically arrange their own secured means. This is the practice of officials of the Ministry of Defence and Singapore Armed Forces when they attend meetings overseas. Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How said this in reply to an MP’s question in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). RESOLVING VULNERABILITIES Proactive efforts leading up to an event include identifying its digital footprint and cybersecurity risk areas, scanning the vendor websites and checking the commercial systems and applications used for the event, and working out cybersecurity incident escalation and reporting processes, explained Mr Heng. Event organisers are required to resolve any vulnerabilities uncovered through these checks prior to the events, he added. Noting that his reply applied to all such events and does not refer to any particular incident, Mr Heng emphasised the difference between the type of communication lines used. He said that secure measures are implemented for “conferences and meetings that are organised by Singapore that are of a sensitive nature – government meetings, military meetings – where communications are sensitive”, and they differ from the open platforms used by the general public. “Participants to international events and conferences, including those attended by military personnel and government leaders and officials do not, as a rule, expect the host country to provide secured means of communications,” said Mr Heng. “Even if a host country is to offer such means, it is questionable whether foreign participants are comfortable using it.” He said that foreign guests who need to transmit sensitive information will typically arrange their own secured means, such as encryption hardware or software, commercial secured or embassy lines, and other security measures. “This is the practice of MINDEF and SAF officials when attending meetings overseas,” added Mr Heng.

Tang See Kit @SeeKitCNA Tang See Kit 02 Apr 2024 04:38PM (Updated: 02 Apr 2024 04:50PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: The government will prescribe a list of regulatory fees where the Goods and Services Tax (GST) should not be charged after parliament passed a Bill on Tuesday (Apr 2). The GST (Amendment) Bill will provide greater clarity on the tax treatment for government fees and address the issue of GST being wrongly levied on 18 fees paid to six government agencies, said Transport Minister and Second Minister for Finance Chee Hong Tat as he tabled the Bill for a second reading. The erroneous GST charges were first made known in February by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) following an internal review. The government has said it will make at least S$7.5 million (US$5.6 million) in refunds to affected individuals and businesses. GST is generally levied on government services. These include, for example, fees for the use of public sports facilities or the rental of hawker stalls. Doing so ensures parity in tax treatment where services that can potentially be provided by or outsourced to the private or non-government sector are subject to GST, said Mr Chee. However, GST should not be charged for services that are regulatory in nature, or done for the purposes of control and regulation. 09:13 Min The Government will centrally prescribe a list of its non-taxable fees to provide greater clarity and certainty to everyone. Fees in the non-taxable list would include those for applications to approve a regulated activity. For example, applications for professional licences and their licence renewal fees will be non-taxable, and would include the 18 regulatory fees that the Government is refunding. All other fees that are not part of this list will be subject to the Goods and Services Tax (GST). As part of this change in legislative approach, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore will work closely with agencies to assess their fees instead of allowing self-assessment by agencies. MOF had reviewed all the regulatory and ancillary fees that currently charged GST and announced in February the refund of GST on 18 fees where GST was wrongly charged. It is now working with agencies on the remaining regulatory and ancillary fees which do not charge GST. There are more than 1,700 such Government fees which MOF is reviewing. If Parliament approves the Bill, the initial list of non-taxable fees will be published in the Gazette in end-April, when the Bill comes into force. MOF will continue to work with agencies to progressively prescribe their regulatory fees in the non-taxable list and aims to complete this by September this year. All fees that are not prescribed in the non-taxable list will be subject to GST. Second Minister for Finance Chee Hong Tat announced this in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). He pointed out that there are three categories of such fees. The first category, which involves the vast majority of fees, relates to services provided by the Government which are clearly and already charged with GST today. The second category comprises fees that are charged with GST today, but where there has been inconsistency in the interpretation of the law by agencies. For example, agencies may charge fees for examinations that an individual must undertake prior to being licensed as a practising professional in a regulated industry. Such examination fees should attract GST. For agencies that have been charging GST on such fees, the Government will validate these past GST collections. The third category is fees that are not charged GST but should be charged with GST. These include more than a hundred examination and inspection-related fees. Mr Chee said the Government will help to minimise the impact on the public by absorbing the GST in the first instance and imposing a freeze on these fees until end-2025. Hence, all affected fees will not increase immediately. Mr Chee said MOF will work closely with the agencies to review whether the fees can be reduced or even removed. If there are unavoidable cost increases, then the agencies would have to raise their fees. But they will do so only after end-2025 and will ensure that any increases are phased in gradually, taking into consideration the impact on affected stakeholders. Mr Chee told the House that the Government is proposing a clearer and more robust approach - one that ensures the correct GST treatment on Government fees by centralising the assessment and making clear the list of non-taxable fees via legislation. The 18 fees that were found to have been wrongly taxed comprised application fees for professional licences like a real estate agent licence, registering a Lasting Power of Attorney and administrative fees for renting out public flats. As most of them are for the processing of applications, rather than licence fees, agencies had wrongly deemed them to be taxable, authorities had said previously. At the moment, government agencies get to assess and determine what constitutes a regulatory fee, based on guidance provided through government circulars. But agencies “may not always be clear where to draw the line”, said Mr Chee. “This is not ideal and can give rise to wrongful charging of GST, as was the case for the 18 fees.” Related: What are the government fees wrongly charged with GST and who’s affected? Government to refund S$7.5 million in wrongly charged GST over last five years WHAT WILL BE DONE With the Bill, the government will prescribe a list of non-taxable government fees, such as those paid for applications of professional licences and licence renewal fees. The list will also include the 18 regulatory fees that are being refunded. In line with the change in legislative approach, the MOF and the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore will work closely with agencies to assess their fees, instead of allowing self-assessment by the agencies. Mr Chee said the initial list of non-taxable fees will be published in the Gazette in end-April when the Bill comes into force. He added that the MOF had earlier reviewed all the regulatory and ancillary fees that currently charge GST and is now working with agencies to review the remaining “more than 1,700” fees that do not charge GST. “MOF will continue to work with agencies to progressively prescribe their regulatory fees in the non-taxable list, and we aim to complete this by September,” Mr Chee told the House. Related: Interest rate for GST refunds determined by banks’ average prime lending rate: Chee Hong Tat WHAT IS GST CHARGEABLE? Mr Chee laid out the categories of government fees that will be subject to GST. The first, which makes up the vast majority, comprises fees paid for services provided by the government. Examples include the rental of public sports facilities, which are already levied with GST currently. “There is no change in the treatment of these fees,” he said. Another category includes fees that are not charged with GST now but should be taxed moving forward based on the government’s “clarified policy intent”. These include fees for examinations that individuals must take before being issued a licence, which some agencies are currently not charging GST. Other examples include inspection fees prior to the licensing and conduct of certain business operations. Overall, it is estimated that there are “more than 100” of such examination and inspection-related fees. Mr Chee said the government will help to “minimise the impact” by absorbing the GST on these fees in the first instance and impose a freeze on these fees until end-2025. MOF has also “separately asked the agencies involved to review their fees and charges, and to consider ways where they can streamline processes or reduce costs”. “We will work closely with agencies on this to review if the above-mentioned fees may be reduced or even removed,” the minister said. “If there are unavoidable cost increases, then agencies would have to raise their fees. But they will do so only after end-2025 and will ensure that any increases are phased in gradually, taking into consideration the impact on affected stakeholders.” Source: CNA/sk(rj) Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Subscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Download here Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Join here Related Topics Singapore Parliament GST Ministry of Finance Chee Hong Tat Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-UG6pLDckFxs')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-uLX6C1WMyO4')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-N8VJIZL851w')); Also worth reading Content is loading...

Ang Hwee Min @HweeMinCNA Ang Hwee Min 02 Apr 2024 04:38PM (Updated: 02 Apr 2024 05:35PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Progress Singapore Party's (PSP) Leong Mun Wai debated with Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing in parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2) as he called for the materials used in school lessons on the Israel-Hamas conflict to be made public. Mr Leong also said he and fellow PSP member Hazel Poa were \"always accused of being divisive\". But Mr Chan said he \"never accused anyone\" in the House of being divisive, adding: \"Please do not twist our words.\" The Education Ministry has been \"more than transparent\" on the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons that covered the Israel-Hamas conflict, Mr Chan said. \"We are not only prepared to show the parents the material, we’re prepared to explain to the parents how the materials are used, rather than to just give a deck of slides, which can be taken out of context,\" he said. The slides alone do not fully communicate how the Education Ministry teaches the subject, Mr Chan stressed. \"We welcome parents with concerns to come and see the teachers who will explain to them how the lesson is conducted. This is much better than just looking at a deck of slides without explanation.\" 19:36 Min In Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2), Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said he had addressed the questions on the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lesson on the Israel-Hamas conflict during the Committee of Supply debate in March, and his response can be found on the website of the Ministry of Education (MOE). Replying to a supplementary question from NCMP Leong Mun Wai on the need for transparency, Mr Chan said MOE is “being more than transparent” - it is not only prepared to show the parents the material but is also prepared to explain to them how the material is used. He said MOE is going out of its way to assure parents on how the lessons are conducted. Mr Leong and Ms Poa had initially filed parliamentary questions on the Ministry of Education's (MOE) handling of the CCE lessons that covered the Israel-Hamas conflict. Mr Chan asked Mr Leong and Ms Poa to refer to his previous speech on the matter in March when he said that the classes would be further customised for different age groups of students, and that teachers would get more support. The opposition MP responded by questioning if it was \"justifiable\" not to release the slides that were used in the lessons. He also asked the government to commit to making all materials used for CCE lessons public “so that parents would know what has been taught to their children”. “I have actually made an effort to go to the bookstore and got a textbook for CCE for Primary 6 students. From the content of the textbook, you cannot imagine that a complex and controversial current issue like the Israel-Hamas conflict will be taught to our children,” he added. Related: MOE lessons on Israel-Hamas conflict aim to help students reflect on safeguarding cohesion, respecting diverse views: Chan Chun Sing Teachers don't impose personal views, advocate for any party in school lessons about Israel-Hamas war: MOE Concerns about what schools are teaching about the conflict in Gaza surfaced in February, with some online posts claiming that students were presented with a narrative that was not neutral or objective. It prompted the Education Minister to address the issue, explaining on Feb 25 that the CCE lessons on the Israel-Hamas conflict are designed to help students reflect on how to safeguard cohesion and harmony in a multiracial society. They are not intended to be history lessons nor are they meant to ascribe who is right or wrong, Mr Chan said, a point he reiterated in parliament on Mar 4. Mr Chan said on Tuesday that it would take Singapore time to reach a stage where it can respond to crises as one united country. \"But to do that, we have to first understand and appreciate that we are very different. We have different backgrounds, we have different perspectives. And while we may be different in our outlook and perspectives, we can all share the same goal to unite and not let others divide us,\" he added. Mr Leong said that the PSP is “not particularly against” any topics raised in CCE lessons, “as long as there is a defined process”. “Every time we raise questions that may not be in line with what the government wants, we are always accused of being divisive. In this case, Minister of Education just said that we are not being united. “But I think what we are trying to do here … from the response the minister has given to us on this issue, does it reflect enough transparency and also clarity on the process of how the materials are being decided?” Mr Chan replied: “Please do not twist our words. I have never accused anyone in this House of being divisive.” Instead, Mr Chan said he meant that there are differing views in Singapore's population, and CCE lessons are meant to help people understand and respect those differences. Ms Poa also asked how many schools have organised dialogue sessions since Mr Chan said in March that MOE would rather meet with parents or members of the public face-to-face and explain how the slides are used. So far, some schools have received such requests, although most schools have not. The ones that received requests have engaged parents on the matter, said the Education Minister.

For the “most mature” students, lesson materials will be updated based on more recent events to help them better understand Singapore’s national interest, Mr Chan said last month.

An LPA allows a donee, or an appointed person, to make medical and financial decisions on behalf of a donor, should they lose mental capacity.

Justin Ong Guang-Xi @JustinOngCNA Ang Hwee Min @HweeMinCNA Justin Ong Guang-Xi & Ang Hwee Min 02 Apr 2024 06:58PM (Updated: 02 Apr 2024 07:06PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) is unaware of any harm arising as a result of a legal lapse involving electronic Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA) forms , which went undetected for nearly a year. The lapse occurred even though the form was approved for deployment by MSF through an “internal proofreading and vetting process”, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said in parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). A Bill was passed in parliament on Tuesday to retroactively validate these LPAs and remove any uncertainty about their validity. About 87,000 electronic LPA documents were found to be lacking a required statement that could leave them open to a potential legal challenge, MSF announced last month . The affected donors do not need to remake their LPAs, and no action is required by members of public, the ministry said at the time. LPA documents made through the hardcopy process are not affected. An LPA allows an appointed person, or donees, to make medical and financial decisions on behalf of another individual should they lose mental capacity. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Mr Chua said MSF is \"not aware of any actual harm suffered by donees or donors\". Many of those who made LPAs continue to have mental capacity, so their donees do not need to act on their behalf yet, he added. “It is possible that some donees have begun to exercise the powers in some of the affected electronic LPAs, but we are not aware of any challenge to the exercise of those powers by third parties,” he said. The electronic LPA forms were prepared by the staff of the Office of the Public Guardian, which is an agency under MSF that is responsible for safeguarding the interests of individuals who lack the mental capacity to make decisions for themselves. The forms were then vetted by the Public Guardian, as well as by a separate legal unit. “Unfortunately, no system of process checks can be 100 per cent accurate, as this case shows,” said Mr Chua. He added that the electronic LPA forms go through various parties, including certificate issuers who are familiar with the hardcopy forms, such as lawyers or doctors. “Despite this, it took nearly a year before a member of the public noticed the difference and wrote in to enquire.” Related: About 87,000 electronic LPAs lack required statement; Bill introduced to make clear documents are valid The Mental Capacity Act lays out that an electronic LPA must clearly state that it is intended to be a deed by the donor. Even though the significance and effect of an LPA are clearly explained in the electronic document, the affected electronic LPA documents – certified from Nov 14, 2022 to Jan 4, 2024 – did not expressly state that it is a deed, said MSF in March. On Tuesday, Mr Chua apologised again for the omission and for any inconvenience caused, noting that the electronic LPAs were revised to include this statement from Jan 5. During the debate on the bill, Members of Parliament (MPs) Don Wee (PAP-Chua Chu Kang) and Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) asked if affected donors would be informed that their LPAs are valid. Since no action is required by the donors with the passing of the Bill, MSF will not be sending individual notices, said Mr Chua in his response. Instead, a note will be affixed to the registration page of affected electronic LPAs to point to the retroactive validating provision when the Bill comes into effect, he said. Mr Wee also asked for an update on the overall LPA take-up rates. Mr Chua said that close to 210,000 Singaporeans aged 50 and above have made an LPA. 07:25 Min In Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2), a Bill was moved to provide for retroactive validation of Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs) which were affected by a missing statement. The electronic LPA form, unlike the hardcopy form, did not contain the required statement “signed (or marked) and delivered as a deed by Donor”. For approximately 87,000 electronic LPAs made between 14 November 2022 and 4 January 2024, this raised uncertainty as to whether they were validly made. The Bill assures affected donors that they will not have to remake their LPAs and removes any future potential complications. Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua told the House that to date, his ministry was not aware of any actual harm suffered by donees or donors. Since 5 January 2024, the electronic LPA had been revised to include the necessary statement. Mr Chua also spoke about the process by which the electronic LPA form had been approved. He said the Ministry of Social and Family Development had an internal proofreading and vetting process. The form was prepared by staff of the Office of the Public Guardian and vetted by the Public Guardian as well as a separate Legal Unit. Apologising for the omission, he said that “unfortunately, no system of process checks can be 100 per cent accurate,\" as this case shows.

Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee that oversees transport, Saktiandi Supaat has raised several parliamentary questions to the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). Among them is whether the authorities will consider stricter enforcement measures or legislative changes to “ensure greater accountability” and discourage dangerous driving. Parliament will next sit on May 7. Mr Saktiandi said in a Facebook post on Wednesday (Apr 24) that he has received feedback from residents expressing concerns about road safety, both generally and specifically in the Toa Payoh area. There is also growing concern about the adequacy of existing penalties for reckless driving, said the Member of Parliament of Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC. “There have been a number of multi-vehicle accidents lately but the recent cases in Tampines and on the PIE (Pan Island Expressway) on Apr 22 have deeply affected those involved and the wider Singaporean community.\" Two people, a 17-year-old student at Temasek Junior College and a 57-year-old woman, were killed following the accident in Tampines on Monday morning. The incident involved four cars, a van and a minibus. Six other people were taken to hospital, including a 42-year-old car driver who was eventually arrested . Later that same day, six people were taken to hospital after an accident along the PIE involving six cars and a taxi. Among the injured was a seven-year-old. “My heartfelt condolences go out to the families who have lost loved ones and are injured in these tragic incidents. It is truly saddening to hear of innocent lives being lost and the unnecessary pain and injury caused due to reckless actions by individuals,” wrote Mr Saktiandi. “I strongly believe that meaningful changes must be made to minimise such accidents, whether through revisiting and enhancing current mitigating measures or implementing stricter enforcement to deter dangerous behavior and protect law-abiding motorists and pedestrians alike.” Mr Saktiandi has asked the Minister for Home Affairs about the number of fatal accidents over the past five years and how many were due to reckless driving and speeding. He has also asked about whether there is a need to review the existing penalties under the Road Traffic Act and whether the ministry and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will consider stricter enforcement measures or legislative changes to ensure greater accountability and discourage dangerous driving. He has also filed a question asking whether there are plans to intensify campaigns or programmes in educating drivers on speeding and reckless driving and increase road safety awareness. In his parliamentary questions to the Minister for Transport, in light of the fatal accident in Tampines, Mr Saktiandi asked how can LTA deter the occurrence of similar accidents in high-traffic areas and how can driver awareness and education on road safety be enhanced, particularly on speeding and reckless driving. Mr Saktiandi also asked how can LTA minimise accident risks in future through road design and traffic management and whether there are plans to enhance data collection and analysis to better address current and future road safety challenges.

(Photo: CNA/Syamil Sapari) 06 May 2024 02:51PM (Updated: 06 May 2024 03:50PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Road safety and penalties for reckless driving will be in focus at the next parliament sitting on Tuesday (May 7), with more than 10 questions filed on the matter. The move to require all employers to have a process for workers to request for flexible work arrangements will also be discussed, ahead of tripartite guidelines coming into effect this December. The parliamentary questions on road safety follow public concern in light of several recent multi-vehicle accidents , including the one in Tampines that killed two people . A 17-year-old Temasek Junior College student and a 57-year-old pest control company employee died in the accident at the junction of Tampines Avenue 1 and Avenue 4 on Apr 22. A 42-year-old Saab driver was charged with four offences related to the incident. Muhammad Syafie Ismail faces one count each of dangerous driving causing death, dangerous driving causing hurt, dangerous driving, and failing to stop after an accident. All fall under the Road Traffic Act. Mr Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa-Payoh) asked how the Land Transport Authority (LTA) can deter the occurrence of similar accidents in high-traffic areas and how accident risks can be minimised in future through road design and traffic management. He also asked how many fatal accidents have occurred due to reckless driving and speeding over the past five years and whether there is a need to review existing penalties under the Road Traffic Act. Mr Saktiandi, who is also chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee that oversees transport, also wanted to know if the Ministry of Home Affairs and LTA will consider stricter enforcement measures or legislative changes to ensure greater accountability and discourage dangerous driving. Mr Desmond Choo (PAP-Tampines) asked if there is a need to raise the relevant penalties under the Road Traffic Act in view of the recent spate of fatal road traffic accidents. On road safety education, Ms Joan Pereira (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) asked if the government will consider requiring all drivers to attend periodic refresher courses while Mr Patrick Tay (PAP-Pioneer) wanted to know what measures are being taken to improve road safety education for both new and experienced drivers. In a question for written answer, Ms He Ting Ru (WP-Sengkang) asked about the number of times that enforcement action was taken in the last five years against drivers who do not slow down sufficiently when approaching a pedestrian crossing. FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS Members of Parliament also wanted to know if companies and workers would be receiving support following the launch of guidelines requiring all employers to have a process in place for workers to formally request for flexible work arrangements. The new tripartite guidelines, which take effect from December, state that employers should communicate their decision within two months of a request for flexible work arrangements. While employers have the right to reject such requests, the decision should be backed up by reasonable business grounds such as cost or productivity considerations. The guidelines also set out what are deemed unreasonable grounds for rejecting requests. Mr Edward Chia (PAP-Holland-Bukit Timah) asked if initiatives are being planned to support small- and medium-sized enterprises in offering this arrangement to their employees. He also asked the Minister for Manpower what additional measures are being considered to support Singaporean workers from potential job displacement, if their employers offer both flexible work arrangements and remote work. This question was asked in view of the increasing trend of companies hiring workers located overseas. Ms Cheryl Chan (PAP-East Coast) asked about the likely impact this move would have on senior professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) aged 45 and above. She also wanted to know which sectors may be more affected by the implementation of the guidelines, as well as the positive impact the adoption of the guidelines will have on the Singapore economy.

Of the more than 83,000 new jobs that went to non-residents in 2023, the bulk was due to a rise in the number of work permit and work pass holders in sectors such as construction.

Abigail Ng Abigail Ng 02 Apr 2024 03:06PM (Updated: 02 Apr 2024 04:49PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: The bulk of the increase in foreign employment last year was in jobs that do not \"typically\" fall under the types Singaporeans want to do, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said in parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). Dr Tan also urged against drawing divides as well as viewing resident and foreign employment as a \"zero-sum game\". The minister was responding to a question by MP Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied) on how the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will ensure that the bulk of new jobs created this year will go to Singapore citizens and residents. Last year, employment in Singapore grew by 88,400, with 83,500 of those jobs going to non-residents. 18:03 Min The fundamental objective of the Government’s approach is to strike a balance between ensuring that businesses have access to skills and manpower to grow and succeed, while creating opportunities for local workers to grow and progress, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng. Replying to an MP’s question in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2), he said this approach has helped locals to secure good jobs. Between 2013 and 2023, the number of resident Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs) increased by 380,000 and the number of Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass holders increased by 50,000. In growth sectors such as finance, infocomm and professional services, resident PMETs increased by 190,000 and the number of EP and S Pass holders climbed by 20,000. Dr Tan said more importantly, over the decade, resident income also increased - by 21.6 per cent in real terms. He cautioned against viewing residents and foreigners as a “zero-sum game” and continuing to draw divides. Dr Tan said thriving businesses with access to complementary foreign talent will not only lead to more job creation but also improve overall wage outcomes as businesses expand and improve their productivity. “By growing our economic pie, we will be better able to secure positive outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans,” he said. Dr Tan said Mr Giam \"seems to be under the misconception that a net increase in foreign employment means that jobs are not going to Singaporeans\". \"If that is so, then that view is fundamentally misguided.\" Of the 83,500 new jobs that went to non-residents in 2023, the bulk was due to an increase in the number of work permit and other work pass holders in sectors such as construction. That made up 64,800, or more than 77 per cent of the employment growth. \"These are not typically the type of jobs that Singaporeans want to do.\" The rest of the increase in non-resident employment - around 18,700 - was for Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass holders, which are for higher-skilled workers. The increase in resident employment stood at 4,900, although Mr Giam pointed out that Dr Tan did not provide a breakdown of whether these jobs were for professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) or not. \"The growth last year in EP and S Pass holders exceeded growth in resident employment as ... non-resident PMET employment is still recovering from the pandemic,\" the minister said. Related: Singapore's total employment grows by 88,400 in 2023 Resident employment has increased every year since 2019 as the government worked to protect jobs during the pandemic, but the number of EP and S Pass holders at the end of last year had not recovered to the level seen before COVID-19 hit. \"The larger proportion of growth attributed to EP and S Pass holders last year did not affect PMET resident employment at all,\" said Dr Tan. He noted that there is a global shortage of skilled talent, and that cities around the world are competing for investments and for human capital. \"To stay competitive and to nurture a vibrant corporate ecosystem, we need to ensure that our businesses can access talent and they can expand,\" he said. CLOSE TO FULL EMPLOYMENT FOR RESIDENTS As for jobs for residents, MOM said that Singapore is close to full employment. The resident employment rate was 66.2 per cent in 2023, which is among the highest rates among advanced economies. The resident unemployment rate and long-term unemployment rate were also low, at 2.7 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively. Between 2013 and 2023, the number of resident PMETs grew far more than the number of EP and S Pass holders, the minister said. Specifically, in growth sectors such as finance, infocomm and professional services, resident PMETs increased by 190,000, while the number of EP and S Pass holders grew by 20,000. Dr Tan pointed out that MOM regularly updates the qualifying salaries for EPs and S Passes to ensure that the holders are of high-quality and maintain a level playing field for locals.

SIM cards. (File photo: iStock) New: You can now listen to articles. This audio is generated by an AI tool. Abigail Ng Abigail Ng 02 Apr 2024 08:33PM (Updated: 02 Apr 2024 09:54PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: A new law was passed in parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2) that will allow authorities to target three groups of people who misuse local SIM cards to facilitate scams. The three categories listed in the Law Enforcement and Other Matters Bill are \"irresponsible subscribers\", middlemen who procure or provide SIM cards to scammers and errant retailers who use stolen or false credentials to register SIM cards which are sold to scammers. Police have faced difficulties in prosecuting the first two groups because they needed to prove knowledge or criminal intent, but the new law means a person could be liable in certain scenarios, without the prosecution having to prove so, said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo. But the intent is not to penalise those who give away SIM cards for legitimate purposes, she said, citing the example of people who register SIM cards in their names for family members' use. Most retailers also do not need to be concerned, said Mrs Teo, who is also Minister for Communications and Information. 34:44 Min “Every SIM card in the hands of a scammer is a weapon,” said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). She elaborated on how scammers have pivoted to using local SIM cards to reach prospective victims after being thwarted by measures such as blocking overseas calls that spoof local numbers and introducing the SMS Sender ID Registry. So, new offences are being introduced to target three groups of people who misuse local SIM cards to facilitate scams. The first group is irresponsible subscribers who give away their local SIM cards or provide their particulars to others to be used to sign up for local SIM cards. To address the challenge that the police face in proving knowledge or criminal intent, an irresponsible subscriber will be deemed liable in the following scenarios - they gave away their card for any gain, did not take reasonable steps to find out the identity and physical location of the recipient, or did not take reasonable steps to find out the recipient’s purpose for obtaining the card. The second group is middlemen involved in procuring or providing local SIM cards to scam syndicates. The police have also faced difficulties prosecuting such middlemen as it is hard to prove that they intended to abet an offence. A person who receives, supplies or possesses such local SIM cards may now be deemed liable without the prosecution having to prove knowledge or criminal intent if the cards were used for crime, or 11 or more cards were found in their possession. Criminal intent will also not have to be proven in cases of people buying, selling or renting a local SIM card registered with another person’s particulars. The third group is errant retailers, a small number of whom have used stolen or false credentials to register local SIM cards, which are then sold to scammers. There is currently no offence that specifically deals with such retailers and they might simply lose their contract with the mobile service provider. Making it a criminal offence will allow heavier punishment, including prison sentences, for employees involved in fraudulent registrations. The penalties for the new SIM card offences will be pegged to those for the misuse of Singpass credentials under the Computer Misuse Act. Changes to the law will also be made to allow the transmission of false messages for certain legitimate purposes, such as simulated phishing exercises to enhance awareness and vigilance against scams. Mrs Teo outlined other amendments being proposed. One is to allow the police to apprehend, not arrest, a person with a mental health condition who poses a danger to themselves or others, to take them for medical treatment - even if the timeframe of the danger is unspecified or not imminent. Another enables the police to not take further action for non-arrestable offences if the case is not serious or there are insufficient grounds to proceed. THREE GROUPS OF OFFENDERS Irresponsible subscribers or registrants are people who give away their SIM cards or let other people use their particulars to sign up for SIM cards. \"Often, they do so to earn a quick buck,\" said Mrs Teo. Current laws require the police to prove that the irresponsible subscribers knowingly gave away their SIM cards for unlawful purposes. With the new law, a person will be liable if they give away a SIM card registered with their particulars or allow their particulars to be used to sign up for one, despite knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that the SIM card would be used for unlawful purposes. Subscribers will also be liable if they give away a SIM card for any gain, did not take reasonable steps to find out the identity and location of the recipient or did not take reasonable steps to find out why the recipient wanted a local SIM card. Offenders can be fined up to S$10,000 (US$7,390), jailed for up to three years or both. Related: Singapore looks to crack down on those who sell, misuse local SIM cards for scams The second group targeted by the new law is middlemen who receive or possess local SIM cards with the intent to use or supply them for unlawful purposes. Those who supply SIM cards knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that they would be used for unlawful purposes will also be liable for offences. Prosecutors will not have to prove knowledge or criminal intent if the local SIM cards were used for crime, or if 11 or more local SIM cards were found in the possession of the middleman. They also do not need to prove criminal intent for people who buy, sell or rent a local SIM card registered with another person's particulars. The third group is errant retailers. Mobile service providers are required to implement measures to prevent fraudulent registration of SIM cards. These measures include verifying the identity of subscribers by checking their original IDs and scanning IDs instead of manually keying in the subscribers' particulars. A number of retailers have used stolen or false credentials to register SIM cards, which they then sell to scammers. A study of about 1,400 local SIM cards used in scams in the second half of last year found that 65 per cent of such SIM cards were sold by nine retailers. \"Such errant retailers should be held accountable. Not only do they tarnish the reputation of their peers, their actions cause many victims to suffer losses,\" said Mrs Teo. Offenders who receive, supply and possess local SIM cards or facilitate fraudulent registration of local SIM cards can be fined up to S$10,000, jailed for up to three years, or both, for a first offence. For second or subsequent offences, the penalty may be a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to five years, or both. Corporations and unincorporated associations such as partnerships and societies can be fined up to twice the maximum amount for individuals. QUESTIONS FROM MPS Member of Parliament (MP) Desmond Choo (PAP-Tampines) asked whether the Ministry of Home Affairs was working with online platforms, such as Telegram, where local SIM cards are bought and sold. In response, Mrs Teo said the police have been working with such platforms to take down accounts involved in scams and other crimes. However, it is currently not a crime to buy or sell second-hand SIM cards, so there are no legal grounds to request such platforms to take down accounts involved in the sales of SIM cards. \"Once the new offences come into force, and the second-hand sale of local SIM cards becomes illegal, we will consider issuing directions under the Online Criminal Harms Act to the platforms to require them to restrict access to accounts involved,\" she said. 36:18 Min In Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2), Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo responded to clarifications sought by Members of the House on the Law Enforcement and Other Matters Bill. The Bill was then passed. MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) raised concerns about a possible scenario where an elderly person's particulars are misused by family members or caregivers. Mrs Teo said the elderly person would not be liable for an offence if the police find that he or she has no reasonable grounds to believe that their particulars would be used to register for SIM cards. \"The police recognise that there are indeed situations where elderly might have been tricked into sharing their particulars,\" she said. \"The police will investigate such cases comprehensively and consider any credible evidence that the elderly person was unaware about how his particulars would be used.\" YELLOW RIBBON SYMBOLS MISUSED The minister also spoke about how Yellow Ribbon Singapore's symbols - which are registered trademarks used to galvanise society to support the reintegration of ex-offenders - have been misused by individuals selling merchandise or going door-to-door asking for donations, under the guise of supporting ex-offenders. Under the new law, the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises Act will be amended to give Yellow Ribbon Singapore the exclusive rights to use its symbols. Those who misuse the symbols can be fined up to S$10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both. In the case of a continuing offence, the offender could be fined up to S$250 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction.

Fabian Koh Abigail Ng Fabian Koh & Abigail Ng 02 Apr 2024 11:45PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: The police will have more powers to apprehend people with mental disorders who are deemed a safety risk to themselves or others, after amendments to the law were passed in parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). During an almost three-hour long debate, Members of Parliament (MPs) raised several concerns about the proposed changes in the Law Enforcement and Other Matters Bill, such as the stigma towards mental illness being further perpetuated as a result of the amendments. However, Nominated MP Dr Syed Harun Alhabsyi, who is a psychiatrist and honorary secretary of the Singapore Psychiatric Association, noted that the Bill was \"scoped within a very specific circumstance of a psychiatric emergency and only where there is a patent risk of suicide\". Dr Syed shared that he had personally dealt with psychiatric emergencies in his work. “Where suicide risk assessment, even for psychiatrists, is not a perfect science, my view is that it is fair and appropriate for police officers to exercise reasonable judgement without waiting for a suicide to be imminently clear or after such attempt at lethal harm has been actualised,” he said. MPs suggested further measures to strengthen the framework in handling cases involving those who are mentally unwell, including adequately training officers to deal with such situations and engaging mental health professionals in the process. 08:20 Min The Law Enforcement and Other Matters Bill gives some latitude for police officers to act with some urgency before a suicide attempt becomes imminent and before rescue could be more risky - both for the person who is under duress and for those who are trying to make a genuine attempt at rescue, said NMP Syed Harun Alhabsyi. Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2), he hopes the Government will look into three areas. Firstly, ensure that there is structured training for police officers in apprehending those who are attempting suicide. Secondly, ensure access to psychiatric evaluation and assessment without delay after the person has been apprehended. Thirdly, work more closely with mental health professionals in crisis work, such as having combined teams of law enforcement and mental health practitioners as collaborative first respondents. WHAT ARE THE CHANGES TO THE LAW? One change to the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act (MHCTA) allows police to apprehend those with mental health conditions who pose a danger to themselves or others, and take them for medical treatment. Under the Act, police can apprehend such individuals, as opposed to arresting them, bringing them to seek help and not a lock-up. The High Court had, in a previous ruling, determined that apprehensions are distinct from arrests under the Criminal Procedure Code, said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo in parliament. “This means that police officers do not have certain powers associated with arrest, which are essential when making apprehensions,” she said. “In particular, the High Court determined that the police do not have powers of search and seizure to ensure that the person is not hiding dangerous weapons or items.” This presents a problem as the police would be expected to hand over the person to the staff of the medical facility only after ensuring he or she was not in possession of weapons, said Mrs Teo. Another change amends the Police Force Act to make clear that relevant powers, such as those of search and seizure, are available to the police when making apprehensions, whether under the MHCTA or any other Acts. “This does not mean that the person will be needlessly roughed up. On the contrary, having assessed that the person may be suffering from mental health conditions, police officers are minded to carry out search and seizure with due care and respect,” noted Mrs Teo. 34:44 Min “Every SIM card in the hands of a scammer is a weapon,” said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). She elaborated on how scammers have pivoted to using local SIM cards to reach prospective victims after being thwarted by measures such as blocking overseas calls that spoof local numbers and introducing the SMS Sender ID Registry. So, new offences are being introduced to target three groups of people who misuse local SIM cards to facilitate scams. The first group is irresponsible subscribers who give away their local SIM cards or provide their particulars to others to be used to sign up for local SIM cards. To address the challenge that the police face in proving knowledge or criminal intent, an irresponsible subscriber will be deemed liable in the following scenarios - they gave away their card for any gain, did not take reasonable steps to find out the identity and physical location of the recipient, or did not take reasonable steps to find out the recipient’s purpose for obtaining the card. The second group is middlemen involved in procuring or providing local SIM cards to scam syndicates. The police have also faced difficulties prosecuting such middlemen as it is hard to prove that they intended to abet an offence. A person who receives, supplies or possesses such local SIM cards may now be deemed liable without the prosecution having to prove knowledge or criminal intent if the cards were used for crime, or 11 or more cards were found in their possession. Criminal intent will also not have to be proven in cases of people buying, selling or renting a local SIM card registered with another person’s particulars.

Another enables the police to not take further action for non-arrestable offences if the case is not serious or there are insufficient grounds to proceed. CONCERNS RAISED Dr Syed noted that when someone is on the brink of suicide and facing immense despair, the police and other Home Team officers remain their \"last hope for rescue\". \"Time is of the essence, and where reasonable grounds are sufficiently present to suggest a potential threat to self or others, my view is that apprehension may be necessary to save a life under such circumstances,\" he added. The authorities need to ensure the individual gets access to psychiatric evaluation and assessment without delay after the apprehension, he added. Dr Syed also called for police officers to undergo structured training in the apprehension of attempted suicide cases, coupled with input from care professionals and specialists in the field. “Such structured training would also be important to ensure that while there is some latitude and range for judgement by police officers on the ground, the exercise of such powers of apprehension continues to be done with propriety, with confidence and with safety in mind,” he said. His calls for training for frontline officers were echoed by MP Yeo Wan Ling (PAP-Pasir Ris-Punggol), who said such training to be made mandatory for \"all enforcers\", including full-time national servicemen. This should be conducted in a \"timely and frequent manner\", she added. MP Edward Chia (PAP-Holland-Bukit Timah) noted that police officers, often the first responders to incidents involving individuals in mental health crises, could also be subject to a significant emotional toll. Acknowledging the role of the Police Psychological Services Department, Mr Chia asked what more can be done for officers’ mental well-being. “It is crucial to provide the police with comprehensive knowledge and training on how to handle individuals with mental health issues,” said NMP Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim. “This includes understanding the signs of a mental health crisis, developing specialised responses and learning how to de-escalate situations effectively.” Some MPs also called for the police to collaborate with mental health professionals when attending to such cases. “While I recognise the importance of this measure in protecting the public, it is essential to consider the potential drawbacks. Police are not mental health professionals, and their interactions with individuals experiencing mental health crises can be complex and challenging,” Associate Professor Razwana said. There are also concerns about an over-reliance on the police in cases of mental health crises, said MP Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon). “One alternative that has been raised is that mental health professionals should lead the emergency response in such cases, where possible. This is already done in several cities,” he said. He cited the example of the city of Eugene, Oregon, where crisis counsellors from a community programme receive hundreds of hours of training, and send responders to 3 per cent to 8 per cent of police cases. 13:39 Min What specific challenges have law enforcement officers faced in dealing with people with mental health conditions that warrant a lowering of the threshold for apprehension? MP He Ting Ru asked this question in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). She raised several concerns. First, lowering the threshold from “reasonably imminent risk” to “reasonable likelihood that danger to life or personal safety may occur” would lead to different standards being applied to those with mental health conditions or illness, which would be discriminatory under United Nations guidelines. Second, whether any timeframes of “reasonable risk” would be applied and if so, what they are. Third, under what circumstances background checks for a history of mental disorder will be carried out and what records will be referred to. Fourth, what safeguards, guidelines or training will be available to police officers. Finally, what options are available to those who believe they were erroneously detained or subjected to excessive force or trauma. Ms He said she was worried about the amendments unnecessarily perpetuating stigma against people with mental health conditions. She also questioned if the police are best placed to respond to such situations. She noted that in recent years, many countries have taken steps to implement alternative strategies to provide support and de-escalate incidents. She suggested expanding the Crisis Response Team to respond not only to cases involving the risk of suicide but also to people experiencing mental health crises more generally. This could also help reduce the strain on the police, she said. MP He Ting Ru (WP-Sengkang) also brought up overseas examples of professionals working with the police to handle such cases. In 2017, Sweden introduced a psychiatric emergency response team, comprising an ambulance with two mental health nurses and one paramedic, to attend to mental health crises, she shared. Another approach is the United Kingdom’s street triage model, a partnership between the police and approved mental health professionals to advise and support those experiencing mental health crises. Noting that the Institute of Mental Health has partnered with the Singapore Police Force to pilot a Crisis Response Team to care for and support those with suicidal tendencies, Ms He asked if the initiative will be expanded even further. MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) said: “Clear guidelines are critical to prevent potential power abuses and ensure effective collaboration with mental health professionals. “While traditional training methods have value, equipping police with real-world case studies, hands-on experience, and access to mental health experts is vital.” The issue of stigma towards the topic of mental health was also a point of concern for MPs. MP Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah (PAP-Jalan Besar) said that through his dialogues with mental health advocates, they had raised concerns and sought to understand the Bill better. “There is an apprehension that, without careful implementation, these amendments could inadvertently contribute to the stigma surrounding mental health or lead to discrimination,” he said. HOW DID MHA ADDRESS THESE ISSUES? In her wrap-up speech, Mrs Teo responded to questions about whether the police should be accompanied by mental health professionals or community first responders when responding to cases that involve people with mental health conditions. The minister said that, for such an arrangement to work, there would need to be sufficient numbers of such professionals on standby round-the-clock, and for them to be able to respond immediately with police to all cases across the country. 36:18 Min In Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2), Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo responded to clarifications sought by Members of the House on the Law Enforcement and Other Matters Bill. The Bill was then passed. “Unfortunately, I think this will be very difficult to accomplish,” she said. “The practical approach is for the police, after dealing with the danger, to refer such persons to mental health professionals for treatment.” Training for the police is regularly updated and conducted by qualified professionals, she added. For example, officers undergo a mental health awareness course designed by the Agency for Integrated Care, which helps the officers identify and respond to people observed with indications of mental health conditions. Mrs Teo also confirmed that IMH and the police are already reviewing the suggestion to expand the Crisis Response Team. She agreed with Dr Syed that risk assessment is \"not a perfect science\". “It is not practicable to be too prescriptive. Doing so could bind the police officers’ hands or prevent them from acting quickly when they should,\" said Mrs Teo, who is also Minister for Communications and Information. \"Situations on the ground can be dynamic, and they need to be given the latitude to make quick decisions in difficult situations. \"The safety of the public and family members around such a person, and of the person himself, should be a priority.\" She added that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the police do not condone officers abusing their powers or acting inappropriately. Police ground response force officers wear cameras which ensure accountability and transparency. On the question of resourcing, MHA does not expect a significant increase in the number of referrals as a result of the amendments, because the threshold is \"still quite high\", the minister said. \"It’s not a case where suddenly you’re going to go out to make apprehensions. So there is no anticipated increase in resourcing needs. “The police intervene only when the person poses a danger to himself and others around him. The police do not get involved in cases involving persons with mental health conditions but who do not pose any danger to himself or others.\" She also addressed concerns about social stigma that mental health patients may face. \"We are actively working towards destigmatising mental health conditions, so that people do not hesitate to seek help,\" said Mrs Teo. \"Please be assured that the police do not seek to put more burden on such persons or their families.\" Source: CNA/fk(mi) Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Subscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Download here Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Join here Related Topics Josephine Teo MHA Singapore Police Force Singapore Parliament Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-FzkXSEbwwfw')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-s-NRdAS2Gh0')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-jq4BZw4v5HU')); Also worth reading Content is loading...

Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth Eric Chua revealed this in parliament on Wednesday (Apr 3), and noted that it was one of the options made available to provide for public access to golfing. \"Golfing is a land intensive sport and there is a need to balance the allocation of land to the sport, vis-à-vis the competing demands for land in Singapore such as for public housing,\" said Mr Chua. \"We recognise that it is important for the public to have continued access to the sport. The government is looking at how we can ensure continued access to golf courses.\" 02:45 Min The Government is looking at how to ensure continued public access to golfing. Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth Eric Chua said this on Wednesday (Apr 3) in answer to an MP’s questions about the closure of all three public golf courses by 2024. Mr Chua said the operator of the Mandai Executive Golf Course has been granted a two-year tenancy extension until the end of 2026. The Government has also worked with Keppel Club to set aside slots at the Sime course for public use at an affordable price and is exploring the possibility of introducing night golfing at the course. The Government will also look into the feasibility of public golfing facilities for the longer term, while balancing competing demands for land use, said Mr Chua. Related: Coaches disheartened by 'sudden' plans to shut Mandai public golf course, a 'perfect place' to learn the sport He was responding to a parliamentary question from Mr Louis Chua (WP-Sengkang), who had asked that if there are plans to convert any of the 14 private golf courses for public use. Another question raised was whether there are plans to ensure that the sport remains accessible to the general public, especially schools and students, given the impending closure of Singapore's public golf courses. Earlier this year, it was announced that the Mandai golf course will have to make way for a new outdoor adventure learning centre after its tenancy expires on Dec 31. Related: Outdoor adventure education sites to be consolidated from 8 to 4; public golf course to make way The Mandai golf course, located at Upper Seletar Reservoir, was opened in 1993. Taking into consideration the impending closure of the 18-hole public course at Marina Bay Golf Course, Mr Chua said that the government had earlier worked with Keppel Club to set aside slots at the Sime Golf Course for public use at an \"affordable price range\", comparable to other public courses. Currently, the majority of slots at the Keppel Sime Course – on both weekdays as well as weekends – are set aside for members of the public, he added. \"The government will also look into the feasibility of public golfing facilities for the longer-term, bearing in mind other needs of Singaporeans at the same time,\" Mr Chua said. In a supplementary question, Mr Louis Chua asked if \"a view to public accessibility\" would be a feature in lease extension agreements with private golf clubs. Mr Eric Chua replied that the ministry does take this into account both in the short and long-term. He noted that it is working with Keppel Club to see if more slots could be made available and exploring the possibility of introducing night golfing at the Keppel Sime Course. \"In the longer term, we will explore all other various options to make sure that public accessibility is one of our key considerations in doing this,\" he added.

Natasha Ganesan Natasha Ganesan 03 Apr 2024 05:27PM (Updated: 04 Apr 2024 09:17AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Singapore has plans to build a pool of about 100 nuclear energy experts in the medium to long run, said Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng on Wednesday (Apr 3). However, no decision has been made on the deployment of nuclear energy and Singapore is unable to commit to a timeline on taking a position regarding it. Dr Tan was responding to supplementary questions posed by Member of Parliament Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied) who asked how many scientists are currently at the Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Initiative, as well as the number of scholarships awarded each year to help build a pipeline of nuclear scientists and expertise. Mr Giam also asked if the government is building up the necessary regulatory policy frameworks that will be needed to oversee potential nuclear energy programmes such as nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. To this, Dr Tan said the government supports efforts to train scientists and experts in local and overseas universities. Over the last decade, the Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Initiative at the National University of Singapore (NUS) has awarded 30 scholarships for postgraduate studies in areas related to nuclear science and engineering. It has also developed a pipeline of around 40 researchers specialising in radiobiology, radiochemistry and nuclear safety. “We aim to build up a pool of about 100 experts in the medium to long run,” Dr Tan said. On nuclear fusion, the minister acknowledged that there is “a lot of excitement” in the fusion space. “To date, on a sustainable basis, the net energy input needed to create that nuclear fusion reaction far exceeds the output of the energy that we can harness,” he added. The closest system many countries have developed is based on tokamak, which is an experimental device to create a nuclear fusion reaction. This in turn produces energy to heat water and produce steam that drives turbines to generate electricity. But the technology is still in the development stage and the actual project has not come to fruition yet, said Dr Tan. He added that researchers from Singapore also have been sent to the United States to study how the technology will evolve. “For nuclear fusion, to answer the question, I think it's still quite nascent, and we are probably at least a decade away.” Nonetheless, the government is watching the space very closely and “nothing is off the table”, added Dr Tan. “We continue to keep our options open to all kinds of low carbon energy, including, of course, nuclear energy, both fission and fusion.” Related: Singapore deepening understanding of nuclear energy, but no decision made on deployment: EMA, NEA Could the future of Singapore’s power be nuclear or geothermal? 10:17 Min The Government has not made any decisions regarding the deployment of nuclear energy in Singapore and as such, it has no plans for uranium stockpiling. Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng said this in Parliament on Wednesday (Apr 3). He was replying to an MP’s question on whether Singapore has plans to stockpile uranium to secure energy sources ahead of other countries shifting towards nuclear energy, and what it is doing to prepare a core of local talent for the industry. Dr Tan said any deployment decision will require detailed studies of the safety, reliability, affordability and environmental sustainability of nuclear energy in the local context. So, what the Government is doing is steadily building capabilities to better understand and assess global developments on advanced nuclear energy technologies. It aims to build a pool of about 100 experts in the field, in the medium to long run, said Dr Tan. \"NOT ABLE TO COMMIT TO A PARTICULAR TIMELINE\" Mr Giam also asked Dr Tan when is the government going to take a position on whether to use nuclear energy as part of Singapore’s energy mix in the future. “Does the minister agree that it's important to provide some certainty or more certainty to both aspiring scientists and our people with regard to the use of nuclear energy?” he said. In response, Dr Tan said: “I think that the member presupposes that we made a decision on nuclear energy.” Reiterating that the government has not made a decision, Dr Tan said that Singapore has to wait for a small modular reactor or the newer generation of thermal reactors to be deployed commercially, and understand the safety profile before making a decision. This is because the safety buffer zone for conventional nuclear generators like the first and second generations is beyond Singapore's radius. At the same time, the government also recognises that radiological safety, the understanding of the operational capabilities and the engineering science behind it continue to be something that is “important and relevant” to Singapore, he added. Dr Tan pointed out that local talent continue to be trained, and are sent overseas and attached to institutions to learn, adapt to the expertise and absorb the knowledge. “(This is) so that at some point in time when we have finally made a decision, we will then bring them back here,” he said. “I think this as far as we can tell you. We will not be able to commit to a particular timeline. But that doesn't mean that we stop looking at it.” Earlier during parliament on Wednesday, Mr Giam had posed questions on Singapore's plans to stockpile uranium to secure energy sources ahead of other countries shifting towards nuclear energy, as well as what is being done to prepare a core of local talent to enter this industry. In his reply to the parliamentary questions, Dr Tan said that Singapore has no plans for uranium stockpiling. Any deployment decision will require detailed studies of the safety, reliability, affordability, and environmental sustainability of nuclear energy in the local context, he added. “We are therefore steadily building capabilities to better understand and assess global developments on advanced nuclear energy technologies.” The Climate Conversations: Is nuclear energy on the cards for Singapore?

Natasha Ganesan Natasha Ganesan 03 Apr 2024 02:38PM (Updated: 03 Apr 2024 04:48PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Owners of critical information infrastructure (CII), such as those providing water, electricity and banking services, will be required to report more types of cybersecurity incidents, including those that happen in their supply chains, under a new proposed law. This way, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) said it can be more aware of the cybersecurity threats that could potentially cause disruptions to Singapore’s essential services and work with owners more proactively to secure them. Tabled in parliament on Wednesday (Apr 3), the Cybersecurity (Amendment) Bill will update existing provisions relating to the cybersecurity of CII as well as expand CSA’s oversight to cover Systems of Temporary Cybersecurity Concern or STCCs. This refers to computer systems that are critical to Singapore and are at a high risk of cyberattacks because of certain events or situations. The Bill seeks to amend the Cybersecurity Act 2018, which establishes a legal framework for the oversight and maintenance of national cybersecurity in Singapore. The objective of the Bill, which would amend the Act for the first time, is to ensure that the law keeps pace with developments in the cyber threat landscape, as well as Singapore’s evolving technological operations, said CSA in a media release on Wednesday. A key aspect of the Bill is also to ensure that CII owners remain responsible for the cybersecurity and cyber resilience of the systems, while embracing new technological and business models such as cloud computing, said CSA. The intention to amend the law was first laid out by Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo last month when she spoke in parliament about her ministry’s spending plan. She said the law needed to change to reflect the increasing importance of ensuring the cybersecurity of the digital infrastructure and services that power Singapore’s digital economy, as well as allow citizens to meet their day-to-day needs. Related: Singapore studying digital infrastructure law to address 'security and resilience concerns' Local organisations not doing enough to protect against cyber threats: CSA WHAT THE BILL COVERS At present, CII owners are only required to report cybersecurity incidents concerning the critical infrastructure, and computer systems under their control that are interconnected or communicate with the infrastructure. If the new law is passed, owners will also have to report incidents targeting systems that are peripheral to CII. Besides critical infrastructure, the Bill will also allow CSA to proactively secure STCCs to ensure the cybersecurity of these systems. An example of an STCC would be the temporary systems used to support the distribution of critical vaccines during a pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine distribution systems deployed by healthcare organisations around the world were targeted by malicious cyber actors. In addition, CSA will create two new classes of regulated entities: Entities of Special Cybersecurity Interest (ESCI) and Foundational Digital Infrastructure (FDI). These two classes will be subjected to “light touch” regulations as they are not critical information infrastructure. ESCI, such as autonomous universities, may hold sensitive information or perform a function of national interest, such that their disruption could cause potential adverse effects on the defence, foreign relations, economy, public health, safety, or order of Singapore. Under the Bill, CSA will be able to designate and regulate ESCI for cybersecurity. The obligations imposed on these entities will not be at the same levels as that for CIIs, Singapore’s cybersecurity agency said. Where disruptions to a regulated system or entity pose less serious risks to Singapore, CSA's regulatory approach is calibrated such that the obligations are \"not so onerous\" that they place an undue compliance burden on the regulated entities, while protecting public interest, the agency said. Hence, ESCI - unlike CII owners - are not required to submit audit reports or risk assessments to CSA. They will also not be required to participate in national cybersecurity exercises. Lastly, the Bill also requires companies such as cloud service providers and data centres to be responsible for the cybersecurity of such digital infrastructure. This includes adhering to cybersecurity codes and standards of practice, as well as reporting prescribed cybersecurity incidents to CSA, which will also not be at the level of a CII, said the agency. CSA added that it had consulted extensively on the Bill, through stakeholder and public consultations. If passed, the agency said it will continue to consult closely with stakeholders to operationalise the Bill.

Under draft amendments tabled in parliament on Wednesday (Apr 3), entities may be designated by the relevant authority – Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) or Land Transport Authority (LTA) – if they are “key entities involved in the provision of essential transport services” in Singapore. They can be designated as a “designated operating entity” if they directly provide essential transport services in Singapore or a “designated equity interest holder” if they hold equity interest in the former. The Bill seeks to strengthen the resilience of \"key firms\" in the air, sea and land transport sectors in Singapore, and safeguard their provision of essential transport services, said the Ministry of Transport (MOT) in a press release on Wednesday. “The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the importance of our air and sea hubs, while mass public transport remains essential to ensuring safe and reliable commutes in Singapore,” said MOT's spokesperson. This review of sector-specific controls for the transport sectors complements the Significant Investments Review Act passed in January, said the spokesperson. The Significant Investments Review Act scrutinises significant investments, whether local or foreign, into entities that are critical to Singapore’s national security interests. It introduced a new investment management regime for specified entities identified as critical to national security. Entities designated under MOT’s sectoral legislation will not be designated under the Significant Investments Review Act at the same time, said MOT in a press release on Wednesday. Related: Singapore passes law to manage significant investments into critical entities: What you need to know IN FOCUS: 'No room for complacency' as fight for global investments heats up. What can Singapore do? Under the proposed amendments, designated entities will face three types of controls, said MOT's spokesperson. Ownership controls will ensure oversight of changes in their effective control “to safeguard against adverse influence”. For example, buyers and sellers may need to notify or seek approval from the authorities depending on the amount, and the designated entities must notify the authorities within seven days of becoming aware of these changes in ownership and control. Suggested controls over management appointments will ensure that the people who are “principally responsible” for the management of the designated entities are fit and proper, and not “inimical to national interests”, the spokesperson added. Under the proposed legislation, designated entities will have to obtain approval from the relevant authority when appointing their CEO and the chairperson of their board. This extends to directors of the boards if the designated entity is also a licensed operator, said the spokesperson. Current laws already require licensed public transport operators to seek LTA’s approval for the appointment of their CEOs and boards. If the Bill is passed, designated entities will need to notify the relevant authority of events that could “materially impede or impair” the provision of essential transport services in Singapore, said the MOT spokesperson. These operations or resourcing controls will ensure that designated entities have enough resources and capabilities to provide essential transport services, they added. If the Bill is passed, the Transport Minister, upon application by the relevant authority, can issue a special administration order to ensure the service continues, in the “extreme scenario” where the designated operating entity cannot provide essential transport services safely and reliably. Under the proposed laws, if designated entities breach these controls, including conditions for approval, they could be subject to remedial directions, including the disposal of equity interest and the removal of key appointment holders, said the MOT spokesperson. Breaching the controls and any of the remedial directions will also be considered an offence, and the penalties for these offences will take reference from existing penalties under the relevant Acts. A person may appeal to the Transport Minister within 14 days of being informed of the relevant authority’s decision on designation, and applications for approval for ownership or management appointments.

In a written parliamentary answer, Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said on Wednesday (Apr 3) that the guidelines that NParks will be releasing are meant to highlight the risk of using such devices. The guidelines will also recommend good training practices to be adopted by the community. He was responding to a question from Member of Parliament Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) about whether a ban of remote electric shock collars is being considered in the guidelines. \"Following the release of the guidelines, NParks will continue to monitor the situation before deciding if further measures are needed,\" said Mr Lee on Wednesday. \"Notwithstanding this, NParks will continue to investigate and take enforcement action in cases where animal training devices cause unnecessary pain or suffering to animals, and to raise awareness on the least intrusive, minimally aversive approach to animal training.\" The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) has called for a ban on the use of electric shock collars, saying that its use is banned or \"significantly restricted\" in several countries such as the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. This is not the first time the issue of electric shock collars for training animals has been raised in parliament. Last month, Mr Ng asked for an update on a study it had conducted on the use of such collars for training animals. Senior Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How said in parliament on Mar 7 he had personally tested \"a range of electric collars\" on himself. \"On a range of one to 10, in terms of spectrum, I probably got to about seven, and it (was) very painful – marks were shown on the skin. \"But it is not just the pain but also the shock of it because the animal or whoever is wearing the electrical collar won't know when the shock is applied,\" he said. In 2022, the multi-stakeholder Rehoming and Adoption Workgroup (RAWG) - comprising NParks, animal welfare groups, vets and dog trainers - published guidelines to standardise practices in dog rehoming and adoption, as well as training and behaviour rehabilitation. MND said in March that NParks further consulted other stakeholders in the animal community on the use of electric collars and were developing guidelines to highlight the risks of using aversive animal training devices. \"Ultimately, these guidelines recommend good practices to be adopted by the community, and are not meant to be legally enforceable,\" it said then. It added that when \"unnecessary pain or suffering\" is inflicted on animals, it will not hesitate to investigate and take enforcement action under the Animals and Birds Act. 05:42 Min Senior Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How said NParks is currently developing guidelines to highlight the risks of using aversive animal training devices such as electric collars. More details will be shared when ready. Mr Tan said he himself tried on some electric collars and experienced the pain and shock. On animal cruelty, Mr Tan said from 2019 to 2023, his ministry received about 1,250 alleged cases each year. Between 2019 and 2022, an average of about 60 cases per year were found to be related to animal cruelty. He said enforcement actions were taken against offenders. These ranged from warnings to prosecution, depending on the severity of the case. Mr Tan was replying to an MP’s questions in Parliament on Thursday (Mar 7).

A police officer arresting a suspect in Singapore. (File photo: CNA/Hanidah Amin) New: You can now listen to articles. This audio is generated by an AI tool. Fabian Koh Davina Tham Fabian Koh & Davina Tham 03 Apr 2024 07:38PM (Updated: 03 Apr 2024 09:12PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Parliament on Wednesday (Apr 3) voted to extend a law that allows the government to detain without trial people with links to certain criminal activity, especially gangs and secret societies. This is the 15th time that the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act has been extended since it was enacted in 1955. It was last extended in 2018 for five years, until Oct 20 this year. Opposition lawmakers from the Workers’ Party (WP) joined the People’s Action Party in voting for the extension. This was a shift from the WP’s position in 2018 when it voted against the extension and other amendments to the Act. The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) stressed the need for more safeguards against potential abuse of power, but it was not clear how the party voted on Wednesday. “Our objection to the Bill has been conveyed by Mr Leong Mun Wai in his speech. We did not take the additional step to register our dissent again,” said a PSP spokesperson. Minister of State for Home Affairs and National Development Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim said during the debate that the Act was first introduced in the 1950s, when gang activity was rampant in Singapore, and still remains relevant today. Powers to detain those associated with certain criminal activities are \"exercised carefully and sparingly”, said Dr Faishal, describing it as “an instrument of last resort”. “The (Home Affairs) Minister must be satisfied that detaining a person under the Act is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order. The power to detain someone under the Act is used only when prosecution is not viable, for example, because victims and witnesses refuse to testify for fear of reprisal,” he explained. The number of detention and supervision orders issued under the Act has declined over the years. From Oct 21, 2019, to Dec 31, 2023, 123 individuals were dealt with under the Act, with 86 detention orders and 37 police supervision orders issued. “This was fewer than the number of cases in the same period of the previous term of the Act,” noted Dr Faishal. “Even so, the number of orders issued is significant and the Act continues to be necessary and relevant, not only against secret societies but also other criminal activities such as unlicensed moneylending.” Watch: Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim on Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill STILL A BIG THREAT There are still active secret societies in Singapore, although not in the numbers and scale in some other countries. “Nevertheless, they are still a menace to law and order, public safety and security,” said Dr Faishal. “They recruit young Singaporeans and engage in illicit activities and violent conduct. That is why we must continue to clamp down on them.” Dr Faishal cited an incident in the wee hours of Nov 9, 2021, when gang members gathered at a rival gang member’s flat with deadly weapons including a machete, a knuckle duster and a karambit knife. As the member was not at home, they attacked his family members instead. In another incident on the evening of Jan 8, 2022, a gang clash took place at Circular Road, with one member stabbing a rival's leg with a knife. In both cases, gang members were dealt with under the Act, Dr Faishal said. The Act has also been used against organised crimes such as unlicensed moneylending, with a number of leaders and financiers of an unlicensed moneylending syndicate detained in 2019. The group was linked to over 1,800 cases of debt harassment in Singapore. “Without the Act, we would not have been able to do much against them. The victims and witnesses feared reprisal and were not willing to testify. The perpetrators would have been able to carry on with their violence and intimidation with impunity,” Dr Faishal noted. He reiterated that the Act is used in cases where prosecution is not viable, as witnesses are unwilling to testify in court for fear of reprisal. “Witness intimidation is a problem in Singapore too. Some countries have witness relocation and protection programmes. However, because Singapore is so small, witness relocation would not be feasible or effective,” he said.

For one, the Public Prosecutor’s consent must be obtained for a detention order or supervision order. The official must be satisfied that prosecution is not viable, before allowing executive action to be taken under the Act, explained Dr Faishal. There are also three committees, independent of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), ensuring that detentions are necessary, he said. The first committee scrutinises every detention and supervision order issued by the minister, examining evidence that was considered in issuing the order and submitting its report to the President to recommend the confirmation, variation or cancellation of the order. “A second committee considers every confirmed detention order at least once annually. It will consider whether the detainee continues to pose a threat to public safety, peace and good order, and whether the detainee should continue to be detained or released,” said Dr Faishal. A third committee reviews detention cases which are being considered for extension beyond 10 years, to determine if it is indeed necessary. “The Act requires the committees to have regard to public safety, the protection of individuals, and the safeguarding of sources of information, in their deliberation,” added Dr Faishal. Detainees are required to attend the first committee in person. They can be represented by lawyers and make representations to the various committees, he added. Every decision made under the Act can be subject to judicial review, as was made clear when the Act was last amended in 2018, he said. “I want to emphasise this point as I know that some members have raised their concerns as to whether the Act ‘ousts’ judicial review. It does not,” said Dr Faishal.

Mr Tan said the WP was “in cautious support” of the Bill, but maintained its objections to amendments to the Act made in 2018, when it voted against the extension. He recalled that in 2018, the WP had expressed concerns about amendments giving the Minister for Home Affairs the final say on whether detention is necessary. The WP had also expressed concerns about the insertion of a schedule of criminal activities covered by the Act which “may allow the ministers to bypass” questions about the severity of the cases or the possibility of prosecution in court; and the expansion of the minister’s powers to criminal activities conducted overseas, he said. Mr Tan noted that the present Bill did not seek to amend the Act, that the WP had supported the extension before the 2018 amendments, and that it accepted “the uncomfortable compromise that this law entails on the constitutional right to freedom”. The WP lawmaker also asked for information on the use of the detention provision, such as a breakdown of detention and police supervision orders by criminal activity, and whether any public prosecutor has withheld consent for an order. Dr Faishal replied that MHA generally does not release information about the use of the Act as it must “balance the call for transparency against the need to prevent prejudice to investigations and to keep witnesses safe”. When Mr Tan asked if such information could be provided to MPs confidentially as they debate the Act every five years, Dr Faishal said MHA had to be “very careful” about what it shares given the complexity of organised and transnational crime. PSP's Mr Leong proposed additional safeguards for MHA to require sitting Supreme Court judges to be on the advisory committees that review detainees' cases. This is currently the practice, but is not written into law, he said. He also suggested giving the President discretionary powers in the making or extension of a detention or police supervision order. The President currently acts on the advice of the Cabinet in these matters. Mr Leong also wanted to know if the Public Defender's Office – set up in 2022 – can represent detainees under the Act. Dr Faishal said detainees are not assigned counsel by the state, but can find their own lawyer, including pro bono representation. Dr Faishal said the current safeguards were carefully considered and worked for Singapore. He said it seemed that the PSP was “not able to point to any abuse of the system”, and urged the NCMP to “stop pursuing theory” and focus on whether the law has worked. Dr Faishal also said that the responsibility for law and order lies with the government rather than the President, and MHA therefore disagreed with Mr Leong’s suggestion. Mr Leong later pointed out that the President currently holds discretionary powers under the Internal Security Act (ISA), which also provides for detention without trial. Under the Constitution, if the government disagrees with an advisory board's recommendation that an ISA detainee be released, the President’s concurrence is required for continued detention. In response, Dr Faishal reiterated that the detention provision has worked in its current form. Related: IN FOCUS: Are Singapore’s youth fighting more - or simply filming more acts of violence? 'I feel very fresh': The former gangsters in prison getting their tattoos removed for free REHABILITATION AND SECRET SOCIETY RECRUITERS Mr Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) and Nominated MP Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim asked about the rehabilitation of detainees, including whether they have access to programmes for offenders who have gone through the regular court system. Dr Faishal said detainees are housed at institutions in Changi Prison Complex based on their security risk and rehabilitative needs, and placed on programmes targeting “specific behavioural and offending needs”. For example, detainees can receive job opportunities through Yellow Ribbon Singapore. They also have access to vocational training, religious counselling and education. “Where required, detainees undergo the gang renunciation programme or psychological-based correctional programmes to increase their self-awareness and equip them with pro-social skills to change their offending ways,” he added. Mr Murali Pillai (PAP-Bukit Batok) asked if MHA would consider using the detention provision against secret society recruiters who target youths. Young people are the “oxygen or lifeblood” of secret societies, said Mr Murali. Citing a study he was involved in, he said that the entry age for secret societies ranged from as young as 11 to 18. He added that secret societies have evolved methods specifically to target and recruit youths in communities and school settings. These activities start as “innocuous” social gatherings that lead to initiation ceremonies. Noting that recruiting people to join an unlawful society is a criminal offence, he asked whether secret society recruiters could be detained if evidence was not forthcoming. Dr Faishal said detention orders have been, and will continue to be, issued against secret society recruiters. He said MHA views recruitment of youths into gangs as “particularly aggravating as this perpetuates the gangland lawlessness, while corrupting our youths”, and that police pursue both enforcement and prevention measures. Community outreach programmes involve working with the Ministry of Social and Family Development, Ministry of Education and social service agencies. Talks at schools, prison visits for “wayward youths” and their parents and guardians, and the Streetwise Programme for youths are among the police’s educational efforts.

Justin Ong Guang-Xi @JustinOngCNA Justin Ong Guang-Xi 07 May 2024 03:54PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: The Tampines traffic junction where two people were killed after a multi-vehicle accident was designed in accordance with international safety standards, said Senior Minister of State for Transport Amy Khor on Tuesday (May 7). The junction of Tampines Avenue 1 and Avenue 4 includes sufficient line of sight for road users to see each other clearly, and appropriate road kerbs, lane and arrow markings installed conspicuously, said Dr Khor in parliament. She was responding to questions from Members of Parliament (MPs) about safety at the traffic junction. The road accident on Apr 22 led to the deaths of 17-year-old Temasek Junior College student Afifah Munirah Muhammad Azril and 57-year-old Norzihan Juwahib , a pest control company employee. Six others were injured, including 42-year-old Muhammad Syafie Ismail , who was charged with four offences, including dangerous driving causing death. Mr Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied) asked if there are plans to build more underground walkways so that pedestrians have safer alternatives than to cross busy junctions. Dr Khor said that the ministry has not received feedback on safety issues at the Tampines junction. \"Between 2019 to 2023, there were also no accidents with serious injuries or fatalities at that junction,\" she said. \"We have also reviewed the junction after the accident and we do not think that there is need to further enhance or implement measures to enhance safety at that junction.\" However, she said that pending police investigations into the accident, there will be a review of whether further measures have to be implemented to enhance road safety. 19:51 Min The Land Transport Authority (LTA) focuses on safety by ensuring that roads are designed with safety in mind, and that vehicles are safe for use on the roads, said Senior Minister of State for Transport Amy Khor in Parliament on Tuesday (May 7). In her reply to MPs' questions on enhancing road safety following the fatal accident in Tampines in April, she said that the Tampines junction at which the incident occurred is designed in accordance with international safety standards. She also stated that LTA continues to review, develop and implement programmes to enhance road safety, such as installing red-amber-green arrows to replace discretionary right turns at junctions. Dr Khor also said that as of 2023, LTA has implemented 371 School Zones and 40 Silver Zones in areas near schools and where there are higher proportions of senior residents, highlighting that Silver Zones in particular have reduced the accident rate among senior pedestrians within the zones by about 80 per cent. She also said that a critical factor besides safe roads and safe vehicles in enhancing road safety is safe motorists, stating that LTA supports the Ministry of Home Affairs to educate and engage motorists on road safety practices. INITIATIVES TO ENHANCE ROAD SAFETY Dr Khor said that the Land Transport Authority (LTA) continues to review, develop and implement programmes to enhance road safety, which include: The progressive implementation of red-amber-green arrows to replace discretionary right turns at over 1,200 traffic junctions, which have shown a 40 per cent reduction in traffic accidents The implementation of 371 School Zones and 40 Silver Zones, in areas near schools and where there are higher proportions of senior residents respectively The Friendly Streets initiative to make daily journeys to key amenities in neighbourhoods safer. Dr Khor added that LTA also uses data from sources such as traffic accident reports from Traffic Police, as well as feedback from the public, to design and implement road safety enhancements. The authority has introduced about 1,000 of these enhancements annually across Singapore, including speed humps and 3D road markings. LTA also conducts checks to ensure that vehicles are roadworthy, and supports the Ministry of Home Affairs to educate and engage motorists on road safety practices. \"Road safety is a shared responsibility, and we urge all road users to play their part, even as we do more to make our infrastructure safer for everyone,\" said Dr Khor.

Fabian Koh Fabian Koh 07 May 2024 02:10PM (Updated: 07 May 2024 03:58PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Penalties under the Road Traffic Act (RTA) currently are adequate to deter dangerous driving, and will not be increased for now, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim on Tuesday (May 7). The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had last raised penalties significantly in 2019, he said in parliament in response to questions from various MPs . “What the laws provide today are already quite stiff. We do regularly review different aspects of the framework. In this context, we have been studying the adequacy of composition amounts and the demerit points framework,” he said. MPs had raised questions about the road safety landscape in Singapore, after a recent accident in Tampines last month which killed two people, including a 17-year-old Temasek Junior College student. Assoc Prof Faishal noted that the accident shocked and angered many Singaporeans. “I am sure I speak for all of us in saying we were all deeply saddened as well.” PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT Multiple MPs, including the chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport Saktiandi Supaat, had asked if there was a need to review existing penalties under the RTA. Currently, for an offence of dangerous driving causing death, a first-time offender can be jailed for two to eight years, while a repeat offender could face up to 15 years in jail, said Assoc Prof Faishal.

(Photo: CNA/Calvin Oh) An offender could also additionally be disqualified from driving for a minimum of 10 years, starting only from the time that he or she is released from prison, he added. “Thus a first offender in a serious case could be jailed for a maximum of eight years and not drive for 18 years,” explained Assoc Prof Faishal. He said that since last month, the Traffic Police (TP) has progressively activated the speed enforcement function in red-light cameras across the island, especially at more accident-prone or violation-prone locations. More than 800 speeding violations have been detected by these cameras in the three weeks since they were activated. “Whilst enforcement cameras are useful for deterrence, it is not feasible to install them at all traffic junctions and zebra crossings, given terrain limitations and other constraints,” he said. In the last six weeks, the TP has also intensified ad-hoc enforcement, detecting close to 1,400 violations and arresting 29 motorists for traffic-related and other offences. In response to a question by MP Tin Pei Ling (PAP-MacPherson) on simplifying the reporting of traffic violations by the public, Assoc Prof Faishal said violations can be reported online via the Police’s E-Services or Police@SG app, with supporting evidence such as video footage. He also reassured the House that TP has been taking enforcement action based on such evidence. IMPROVING ROAD SAFETY Singapore’s roads have become safer, said Assoc Prof Faishal. The number of accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities has fallen by about 10 per cent in the last five years, from 7,822 in 2019 to 7,075 in 2023, he shared. However, the number of accidents resulting in fatalities has increased by about 12 per cent, from 117 in 2019 to 131 in 2023, he noted. “There were 71 fatal accidents in the first half of 2023, and 60 in the second half of the year,” said Assoc Prof Faishal.

An average of three fatal accidents per year – or about 2.4 per cent annually – were investigated under the offence of reckless or dangerous driving causing death, while an average of 29 fatal accidents each year – about 27 per cent annually – were speeding-related. He also emphasised efforts to improve road safety in Singapore and incentivise safe driving behaviour here. For instance, eligible motorists may attend the Safe Driving Course, and have four demerit points expunged from their record upon completion. “The course aims to re-educate and correct the poor driving behaviours of motorists who have accumulated a significant number of demerit points,” said Assoc Prof Faishal. Education and engagement efforts have also been ramped up, with TP working alongside partners and stakeholders, such as the Singapore Road Safety Council, SBS Transit and Grab, to organise events and campaigns to promote road safety, he noted. 06:04 Min Singapore’s roads have become safer, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim. In the last five years, the number of accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities fell by about 10 per cent - from 7,822 in 2019 to 7,075 in 2023.

There were 71 fatal accidents in the first half of 2023 and 60 in the second half of the year. Dr Faishal, who gave this update in reply to MPs’ questions in Parliament on Tuesday (May 7), said the top causes of the fatal accidents between 2019 and 2023 were failure to keep a proper lookout and have proper control of the vehicles. An average of three fatal accidents per year, or about 2.4 per cent of fatal accidents annually, were investigated under the offence of reckless or dangerous driving causing death. An average of 29 fatal accidents per year, or 27 per cent of fatal accidents annually, were speeding-related. Dr Faishal said the Ministry of Home Affairs has raised the penalties significantly and the laws are already quite stiff. It has been studying the adequacy of composition amounts and the demerit points framework. Turning to enforcement efforts, he said in the last six weeks, Traffic Police stepped up ad hoc enforcement, as well as progressively activated the speed enforcement function in red-light cameras across the island. TP will also be publishing a series of road safety videos in the second half of this year, he added. Assoc Prof Faishal added that TP works closely with the Land Transport Authority to modify or improve road infrastructure and enhance safety. OTHER SUGGESTIONS FROM MPS Responding to MP Joan Pereira’s (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) question on requiring drivers to attend periodic refresher courses, Assoc Prof Faishal said such courses are optional and cater to drivers who have not driven for several years. “We do not think it is useful to mandate the refresher course for all motorists. Only a minority of motorists are involved in accidents,” he said. He explained that the “very large majority” stay offence-free for many years, if not the entire period of their driving history. Most accidents happen because of poor road behaviour, rather than inexperience, he said. 30:17 Min Traffic Police (TP) is intensifying its education and engagement efforts, as well as working with various partners and stakeholders to promote road safety. It will be publishing a series of road safety videos in the second half of this year. Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim announced this in Parliament on Tuesday (May 7), in reply to MPs’ questions. Turning to questions on how the road infrastructure can be modified or improved to enhance safety, he said TP works closely with the Land Transport Authority on this. Dr Faishal told the House that the Government is strongly committed to doing all it can to keep Singapore’s roads safe. He stressed that road safety is a “shared responsibility” and urged all road users to play their part. Ms Pereira also asked if speed limiters should be mandated on all vehicles. “We have to balance the benefits with the costs. For now, we assess that it would suffice to mandate the installation of speed limiters for lorries,” said Assoc Prof Faishal, adding that the initiative is ongoing and will be completed by June 2027. He added that families of accident victims are referred to Social Service Offices or Family Service Centres, depending on their circumstances and support needed. Those requiring mental health support are referred to mental health helplines and counselling services, run by trained professionals or the Institute of Mental Health, he said in response to a question from MP Patrick Tay (PAP-Pioneer). “The government is strongly committed to doing all we can to keep our roads safe. However, I would like to re-emphasise that we cannot succeed alone. Road safety is necessarily a shared responsibility, and we urge all road users to play their part,” he said.

The skyline of Singapore's central business district is seen on Apr 29, 2024. (File photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman) 07 May 2024 11:25PM (Updated: 08 May 2024 01:37PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Indranee Rajah on Tuesday (May 7) refuted a Financial Times (FT) report that had characterised government meetings with top international banks as \"unusual\". The Apr 20 article, titled \"Singapore gives top-level briefings to reassure foreign banks on stability\", said the government had given international banks an \"unusual series of top-level briefings on geopolitics\". The purpose of this, the article said, was to reassure the banks that Singapore \"can remain stable and neutral at a time of rising tension between China and the West\". In a written parliamentary reply to Member of Parliament Louis Chua (WP-Sengkang), who had asked Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong about the objectives and key messages of such briefings, Ms Indranee took issue with the way these meetings were framed by FT. \"It is surprising that such a poorly sourced story, vainly searching for a point, could appear in a major paper like FT, especially after we had repeatedly clarified matters with the reporter, including telling her the briefings were not unusual,\" said Ms Indranee on behalf of the Prime Minister. The article was written by FT's Singapore and Southeast Asia correspondent Mercedes Ruehl. According to her LinkedIn profile, she has been in Singapore since 2020. Ms Indranee added: \"As for the suggestion the Government was somehow conducting these briefings under the radar, the FT did not report what we told its reporter: That almost all the briefings her article mentioned had already been publicised by the ministers on their own social media accounts.\" According to the FT article, citing sources with knowledge of the talks, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean led several such meetings. Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong and Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam were also involved in these meetings, according to FT. Citigroup and Standard Chartered were named in the article as some of the US and European financial institutions that took part in the briefings. Local banks were also involved, said FT. In her written reply, Ms Indranee said ministers and officials have been conducting such briefings for \"decades\". Parties involved in such meetings include not only financial institutions – international and local – but also groups such as businesses, non-governmental organisations, unionists and students. \"In brief, we engage as widely as possible,\" said Ms Indranee. In response to CNA's queries, an FT spokesperson said on Wednesday: \"We stand by our reporting.\" ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORTS Mr Chua also filed a question for the Prime Minister asking about plans to tighten anti-money laundering rules in the wake of a multi-billion-dollar case , Singapore's largest. Ten people have been charged and five of them sentenced – with jail terms ranging from 13 to 15 months. Ms Indranee said an inter-ministerial committee intends to provide an update on its findings in \"the coming months\". The formation of this committee was announced in October 2023. It is chaired by Ms Indranee, who is also the Second Minister for Finance. The committee is made up of political office holders from the Monetary Authority of Singapore and four ministries: Home Affairs, Law, Manpower, and Trade and Industry.

Davina Tham Davina Tham 07 May 2024 04:11PM (Updated: 07 May 2024 05:04PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Employers with workers on flexible work arrangements have no basis to cut their pay if their productivity is not affected, Minister of State for Manpower Gan Siow Huang said on Tuesday (May 7). She was responding to a question by Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Raj Thomas on how the tripartite guidelines on flexible work arrangement requests would interact with the progressive wage model. The new guidelines, which come into effect on Dec 1, require all employers to have a process for their employees to request flexible work arrangements. Employers must give fair consideration to the requests and respond within two months. They can reject a request on \"reasonable business grounds\", and must give the employee the reason in writing. The progressive wage model provides a structure for wages to rise along with training and productivity improvements. It covers lower-wage local workers in certain sectors, like cleaning and security. Mr Thomas asked whether an employer would have to reject a worker's request for flexible work arrangements if it meant the worker would work fewer days, bringing his or her gross wage below the prescribed floor of the model. Ms Gan questioned the assumption that pay would be reduced in the first place, saying that employers have to pay competitively to attract and retain good workers. \"For workers who are on flexible work arrangements, if their work output, productivity is not affected, actually there is no basis for employers to reduce their pay,\" she said. Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said that \"the spirit of the PWM (progressive wage model) should really lead the entire thinking\" behind the implementation of any guidelines. He said the guidelines on flexible work arrangements were based on tripartism and collaboration, and represented a \"very nuanced approach\". \"I think we are moving into newer waters, and I would seek an appeal to the understanding, the support and also the patience of all of us together as one united society, to come together to make this work for the betterment of all of our future generations of workers.\" Related: 1 in 2 workers in Singapore will quit their job if asked to be in office more often: Survey Want to WFH? Here's how to ask your boss when guidelines for flexi-work requests kick in this December Dr Wan Rizal (PAP-Jalan Besar) raised concerns from workers who may want flexible work arrangements but fear if their personal issues, like mental health, are aired in the process, that this could hurt their career progression. Ms Gan reiterated that employers must assess employees' performance and pay them fairly based on work done, and not discriminate based on health conditions that do not affect their performance. After the guidelines were announced, some employers told CNA that as managing remote teams becomes more common, they may rethink hiring local staff and look overseas for recruitment, particularly given the difference in costs. Members of the tripartite working group that drafted the guidelines, co-chaired by Ms Gan, have said that ensuring the local workforce stays competitive will be key as Singapore normalises flexible work arrangements. On Tuesday, Ms Gan reiterated that remote work and outsourcing are already global trends regardless of Singapore's guidelines. \"Even if foreigners are not working in Singapore ... they will still be competing with us when working in companies overseas,\" she said. It was more important for local workers to continually upskill and stay productive to compete for jobs not just in Singapore, but globally, she added. Related: Commentary: Why Singaporeans are less likely to quit when they work from home MP Cheryl Chan (PAP-East Coast) then asked whether Singapore would see more offshoring of jobs as a result of the flexible work arrangement guidelines. She also asked whether middle-aged professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) would be disadvantaged by the guidelines and by the redesign of job roles to accommodate flexible work arrangements. Ms Gan replied that flexible work arrangements were not limited to flexi-place arrangements (like working from home), and did not mean workers will be less productive. She added that businesses were driven by their own bottom lines in assessing talent and costs. \"I think we should not pretend that without flexible work arrangements, there'll be less offshoring,\" she said. \"I would also point out that elsewhere, in the US, for example, we are also seeing some tech companies putting out statements that remote work does not work for them. \"There seems to be some suggestion that actually, for certain sectors and for certain types of work, physical on-site presence, teamwork, all these are still very key.\" She said that some companies in Singapore have shared similar feedback, adding: \"For those, I think offshoring may not be a natural choice, and certainly would not be affected by these guidelines.\" Ms Gan said that the focus for middle-aged PMETs is on making sure they have the right skills and on their \"career health\" to make sure they stay employable. Addressing MPs' questions, she also reiterated that the guidelines do not mandate flexible work arrangements or set hard targets. \"For flexible work arrangements to be successful, it must make businesses sustainable for the employers,\" she said. \"It does not make sense to require businesses to offer flexible work arrangements, even when it negatively impacts business and affects employment prospects for Singaporeans.\" Deep Dive: How useful are guidelines for flexible work arrangement in Singapore?

Tang See Kit @SeeKitCNA Tang See Kit 07 May 2024 01:59PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: Having retroactive charges for the upgrading of hospital wards discourages patients from selecting lower-class wards at the start to secure more subsidies for expensive treatments, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Tuesday (May 7). Laying out the “different” payment considerations for those who choose to transfer to a different ward type during hospitalisation, he said: “When patients stay in a higher-class ward and then downgrade to a lower-class ward towards the end of their stay, they will receive subsidies based on the respective ward classes.” “This is fair,” Mr Ong said, adding that public hospitals will find ways to support patients financially if requests to downgrade to a lower-class ward are due to unaffordability issues. However, there is “a different consideration” when it comes to the upgrading of hospital wards, he said in his response to parliamentary questions from Member of Parliament (MP) Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast) and Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai. “We have to discourage patients from selecting lower ward classes to secure more subsidies for more costly treatments, such as surgery and ICU (intensive care unit), at the beginning of their stay and then switch to higher ward classes once these more expensive treatments are completed,” he said. He added that “many of these patients are not of lower income and could have chosen the higher ward class from the outset”. “That is why if a patient upgrades, the level of subsidies will be adjusted retroactively.” 05:02 Min When patients stay in a higher class ward and then downgrade to a lower ward class towards the end of their stay, they will receive subsidies based on the respective ward classes. “This is fair,” said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung. Replying to Parliamentary questions on Tuesday (May 7), he pointed out that where the request to downgrade is due to unaffordability because of complications or unexpected additional costs, public hospitals will find ways to support them financially. For upgrading of wards, he stressed the need to discourage patients from selecting lower ward classes to secure more subsidies for more costly treatments and then switching to higher ward classes once these treatments are completed. Mr Ong said many of these patients are not of lower income and could have chosen the higher ward class from the outset. That is why if a patient upgrades, the level of subsidies will be adjusted retroactively, he added. The issue of retroactive charging for patients who opt to transfer to higher-class wards first emerged in a letter published on the Straits Times' Forum page last month. In the letter, Mr David Kong wrote about how his 98-year-old mother was first admitted to the high-dependency ward in the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) as a Class C patient. But the ward, which accommodates five patients, was “consistently noisy” and his mother found it difficult to rest, he wrote. Mr Kong’s mother was transferred to a general ward a week later and the family opted for an A1 ward – a single room for a “quieter environment”. However, the family was told that doing so means that the hospital bill for their mother’s “earlier stay as a Class C patient would be retroactively changed to reflect her new Class A1 status”. The A1 ward is a private and non-subsidised ward type, based on SGH’s website. Describing this retroactive charging as “illogical and unfair”, Mr Kong said: “A patient should be charged Class C rates for the period she stayed in a Class C ward, not Class A1 rates for services and amenities she did not consume.” When CNA contacted the Ministry of Health (MOH) regarding the issue last month, a spokesperson said that it is important to ensure that government subsidies “are targeted at where they are needed most”. “If there are medical reasons why a patient may need to be isolated from other patients after surgery, our public hospitals will provide the necessary facilities subsidised at the patient’s chosen ward class,” the emailed reply said. “Patients are also counselled on the financial implications before upgrading their ward class, so they can decide whether they want to go ahead with the ward change,” it added. In his supplementary questions on Tuesday, Mr Ang, the MP, asked if patients who require an upgrade but are “not financially very strong” can appeal against the retroactive charges. Mr Ang also raised the scenario of patients who are not allowed to downgrade to a cheaper ward after having stayed at a higher-class ward previously at the hospital. “The only time they can escape this is when they are admitted to A&E then they can go to a lower-class (ward),” he said, citing feedback from his residents. Mr Ong replied that “everyone has the right to appeal” but authorities are “trying to stop a certain behaviour which (they) don’t think is right”. He added that patients are counselled financially at the beginning of every hospital stay, and decisions are made by patients “with their eyes open”. In cases where downgrades are not allowed, Mr Ong noted that “a very established process of means testing” is in place currently. “So long as they meet the means testing criteria, they can downgrade,” he said. “So, I think the specific cases the member might have come across might be a case where they didn't manage to meet the means testing criteria.” Mr Ong added that those with affordability issues can tap on MediFund – an endowment fund set up by the government for lower-income Singaporeans – which serves as the “last line of defense” to ensure those who need help can “always afford hospital stay in public health institutions”.

Over 150 properties, dozens of vehicles , gold bars, jewellery, crypto, cash and luxury watches make up the more than S$3 billion of assets seized or frozen since police operations began in August last year. Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam on Tuesday (May 7) provided a written response to a parliamentary question by Member of Parliament Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa Payoh). Mr Saktiandi had asked about the money spent to preserve the assets seized and how this sum would be covered. \"Expenses are incurred for the storage, maintenance and safeguarding of the seized assets, comprising properties, vehicles and luxury goods such as branded bags, watches and alcohol,\" Mr Shanmugam said. He added that these expenses include the engaging of specialised services from industry partners or service providers to oversee the handling, upkeep and value preservation of the assets. \"These expenses are borne by the state,\" said Mr Shanmugam. \"They are covered by the forfeited cash and the proceeds of sale of the forfeited non-cash assets, which are channelled to the state.\" Some of the seized items, like the \"thousands\" of bottles of liquor and wine, as well as ornaments like Bearbrick figures and branded bags, must be stored appropriately to maintain their condition, while the vehicles will have to be serviced. The police said in January that the total value of assets seized or issued with prohibition of disposal orders is more than S$3 billion to date. 02:31 Min Singapore police seized four cars worth about S$4.8 million, including two Rolls-Royces and a Porsche, from a property along Third Avenue on Wednesday (Oct 25). This was part of the S$2.8 billion worth of assets in Singapore's largest money laundering probe. The police also seized 56 Bearbricks from another location. Five people have been sentenced in relation to this case. Two of them were deported to Cambodia on Monday . Su Wenqiang and Wang Baosen , both 32, have been barred from re-entering Singapore. Authorities had seized more than S$5.9 million from Su in the form of cash, vehicles, luxury items and liquor. More than S$8 million in assets belonging to Wang – in cash, vehicles, property and collectible items – was seized. This includes his assets under his wife's name.

Matthew Mohan @MatthewMohanCNA Natasha Ganesan Matthew Mohan & Natasha Ganesan 07 May 2024 06:29PM (Updated: 07 May 2024 08:58PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: A Bill aimed at bolstering Singapore’s cybersecurity defences while accounting for changes in technology was passed by parliament on Tuesday (May 7). Under amendments to the Cybersecurity Act, owners of critical information infrastructure (CII) must now report more types of incidents including those that happen in their supply chains. This is to address the “inventiveness” of malicious cyber actors, said Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary. “As the tactics and techniques of malicious actors evolve to target systems at the periphery or along supply chains, we must also start placing our alarms at those places,” he added. The new law will allow authorities to regulate a new type of system called Systems of Temporary Cybersecurity Concern (STCC). These are systems that, for a time-limited period, are at high risk of cyberattacks, and if compromised, would damage Singapore’s national interests. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) will now also be able to manage entities beyond its current regulatory regime. These include Entities of Special Cybersecurity Interest (ESCIs). Attacks on ESCIs could have a “significant detrimental effect” on Singapore’s defence, foreign relations, economy, public health, public safety, or public order, because of the disruption of the function they perform, or the disclosure of sensitive information their computer systems contain, explained Dr Janil. The specific list of entities designated as ESCIs should not be disclosed publicly to avoid inadvertently advertising these entities as “worthy targets” to malicious actors, he added. CSA will now also be able to deal with situations where a CII is supporting an essential service from overseas. With the new changes, CSA can designate and regulate such CIIs so long as its owner is in Singapore and the computer system would have been designated as a CII had it been located in Singapore. Tabling the Bill for a second reading, Dr Janil said that it aims to tackle “shifts in the operating context” in cybersecurity, and strengthen the administration of the Act to address “operational challenges” CSA has faced. “The Cybersecurity Act has now been in force for six years. The core objectives continue to be relevant today. We’ve reviewed the Act, learning from our experiences, and taking into account changes in technology,” he explained. “In order to continue to ensure Singapore’s cybersecurity, a review and an update to the Act is needed as several aspects of our operating context have changed.” Related: Proposed law will require owners of critical services like water, banking to report more types of cybersecurity incidents Singapore studying digital infrastructure law to address 'security and resilience concerns' WHY IT MATTERS While Singapore implemented legislation in the form of the Cybersecurity Act in 2018, technology has evolved and business models have changed. For one, cloud computing is widely available and used. While it was once the norm for CII to be physical systems on premises and entirely owned or controlled by the CII owner, this is no longer always the case, said Dr Janil. Now it is also possible to aggregate and share common digital services and functions across borders. This means it is needful to review how Singapore can safeguard the cybersecurity of its essential services, he added. All this is happening amid a backdrop of increased use and reliance on digital technology. In Singapore, over 90 per cent of residents now communicate online and firms’ technology adoption rate has grown from 74 per cent in 2018 to 94 per cent in 2022. More are now online for longer and online for more varied purposes. This means that there is an increased “attack surface” as people are exposed to more cyber risks, said the Senior Minister of State. The cyber threat landscape has also evolved and malicious actors are increasingly finding new ways to their target. With all this in mind, it is “vital” Singapore updates cybersecurity laws to stay ahead of the curve, said Dr Janil. 29:35 Min Singapore is making a “major update” to its Cybersecurity Act, given the significant shifts in the digital domain, said Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary. It will have the power to keep pace with developments in technology and business practices and respond to evolving cybersecurity challenges in the cyber threat landscape, he said in Parliament on Tuesday (May 7). This means extending the regulatory oversight to other important systems and entities, and using a risk-based approach to regulate entities for cybersecurity and administer the Act more effectively. These will strengthen Singapore’s national cybersecurity and increase trust in using online services, said Dr Janil. A key provision involves Critical Information Infrastructure (CII). Dr Janil said regulating CIIs is no longer sufficient and it is vital to update cybersecurity laws to continue to stay ahead of the curve. Dr Janil pointed out that the 2018 Act was developed to regulate CIIs as physical systems, but new technology and business models have emerged. Hence, the need to better regulate CIIs to ensure that they continue to be secure and resilient against cyber threats, whatever technology or business model they run on. Under the Bill, the meaning of computer and computer system in specified portions will include virtual computers and virtual computer systems. The new definition will make clear that the CII owner is responsible for the cybersecurity of its virtualised CII. Another provision deals with essential services from overseas. CIIs that are wholly located outside of Singapore can be designated and regulated so long as the owners are in Singapore and the computer system would have been designated as a CII under the law had it been located wholly or partly in Singapore. The law will also be updated to address malicious cyber actors who target systems at the periphery or along supply chains. Dr Janil said Singapore must start “placing our alarms” at these places. It will require CII owners to additionally report incidents that affect computers that interconnect or communicate with the CII. The Government also wants to expand the Act to regulate a new Systems of Temporary Cybersecurity Concern. It deals with the cybersecurity of ICT systems that for a time-limited period are at high risk of cyberattacks and if compromised, would have a serious detrimental effect on Singapore's national interests. Provisions will also be introduced to cover new entities that could be attractive targets for malicious threat actors. These are Entities of Special Cybersecurity Interest, such as universities. Dr Janil told the House that the Bill is calibrated to address the risks to the nation, economy and Singapore’s way of life while balancing the compliance costs. He added that the Government will continue to refine its approach in consultation with stakeholders and consider new international practices as they emerge. LAWMAKERS’ CONCERNS Members of Parliament supported the Bill, although they also raised questions on how CSA would cope with more reports of cybersecurity incidents and the compliance costs associated with the new obligations. Ms Tin Pei Ling (PAP-Macpherson) wanted to know if the government would consider requiring CII owners to monitor and report incidents of those further down the supply chain - beyond their immediate suppliers - in the future. Given how entities could potentially be designated as STCCs or ESCIs, Nominated Member of Parliament Mark Lee asked how businesses will be informed of or reveal and appeal designations. Some MPs called for clarity on entities that fall under ESCI, which may hold sensitive information or perform a function of national interest. Nominated Member of Parliament Razwana Begum also raised concerns about the ambiguity of the terms “sensitive information” and “function of national interest”, pointing out that a lack of clear definition could lead to inconsistencies in regulatory decisions. Related: Local organisations not doing enough to protect against cyber threats: CSA IN FOCUS: How ready is Singapore for a major ransomware attack? GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE Addressing concerns on increased compliance costs, Dr Janil said that neither the Cybersecurity Act nor the amendments proposed in the Bill imposes “cybersecurity obligations” on the business community at large. Instead, what the new law will do is regulate only the cybersecurity of systems infrastructure and services that are important at a national level because their disruption or compromise could affect Singapore’s survival, security, safety or other national interest, he said. “This is a known and finite set of systems and entities. Our approach is a targeted and calibrated one, precisely because we recognise that regulation will involve compliance costs,” Dr Janil added. “Some compliance costs cannot be avoided where regulation is concerned. It's something we are mindful of. We do not seek to regulate without good reason.” 31:17 Min In Parliament on Tuesday (May 7), Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary responded to clarifications sought by Members of the House on the Cybersecurity (Amendment) Bill. The Bill was then passed. On designating entities as STCCs or ESCIs, Dr Janil highlighted that CSA’s practice has been and will be to provide “ample support” to regulated entities to guide them towards compliance. “This begins even before a system or an entity is designated,” he added. If CSA has reason to believe that a system or entity should be designated, the agency will first engage the owner to better understand the operating context, such as the cybersecurity measures that have already been implemented and the level of their cybersecurity capabilities, to ensure that any designation is appropriate. CSA will then work with the owner to assess what needs to be done for the entity or system to be in compliance with the Act as well as the support and lead time that the organisation needs, said Dr Janil. Entities that receive a designation notice can also appeal against it, while ​​a regulated entity may also appeal against CSA’s decisions, orders and directions as well as codes of practice and standards of performance, he added. Reiterating that he would not disclose any “specific real-life examples” of entities designated as ESCIs, Dr Janil said that publication and disclosure of an ESCI’s identity would be on a “case by case basis”. “The issue for consideration is not whether a regulated entity is a large company, an MNC (Multinational Corporation) or a SME (small-and-medium-size enterprises), the key consideration is whether a cyberattack on the entity could have serious implications on our national security or other national interests,” he added. “We do not take these decisions to impose obligations lightly.” Source: CNA/ng(ac) Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Subscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Download here Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Join here Related Topics cybersecurity Singapore Parliament Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-5AIqr30eakA')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-EEsoJhIWuvg')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-7CPuVMJnn8o')); Also worth reading Content is loading...

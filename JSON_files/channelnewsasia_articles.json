    "article_content": "CNA Insider analysis analysis CNA Insider European and American leaders have accused Beijing of violating market principles in the electric vehicle, solar panel and battery sectors. The programme When Titans Clash finds out if another China trade shock is on the cards. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: In recent weeks, leaders of the United States, France, Germany and other G7 countries have sounded the alarm bells about overcapacity in the Chinese economy in three areas: electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels and batteries. In response, Chinese President Xi Jinping says overcapacity does not exist. What is at stake for China and the West? The European auto industry is facing pressure from China’s EVs. While many consumers in Europe are buying EVs, it is Chinese brands that are gaining traction with their features and lower retail prices. At the same time, several car factories have shut in Europe, and thousands of job cuts have been announced. This includes the following: • In February last year, car maker Ford Motor said it would axe 3,800 jobs in Europe. • Last June, Swedish car parts manufacturer Autoliv said it would cut 8,000 jobs, mainly in Europe. • In October, Germany’s Volkswagen said it would cut 2,000 jobs in its software unit, Cariad. • In November, French tyre maker Michelin said it would cease operations at three sites in Germany by the end of next year, affecting more than 1,500 jobs. • This January, automotive supplier Bosch said it would cut 1,200 jobs in its software development division by the end of 2026. • In March, car maker Stellantis confirmed it was signing deals on at least 2,500 voluntary layoffs in Italy. This, after it announced last June its plans to close a 40-year-old plant in Austria, impacting 300 jobs. WATCH: Is China’s high-tech ‘overproduction’ killing jobs in the West? (46:48) “The auto industry is a huge part of the European economy,” notes Rory Green, chief China economist and head of Asia research at GlobalData TS Lombard. The industry’s turnover is about 7 per cent of the European Union’s gross domestic product. It employs, directly and indirectly, some 13 million people, or about 7 per cent of total EU employment. “Also, psychologically, it’s a big part of the history of industrial development within Europe,” adds Green. “And they’re quite rightly worried (about) Chinese competition both within Europe and globally.” It is in this context that we can understand why French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen raised the overcapacity issue in their meetings with Xi in the last two months. CNA documented the effects of the first China trade shock, in the US, in the first season of When Titans Clash in 2021. A landmark Massachusetts Institute of Technology study attributed nearly a million manufacturing job losses, and 2.4 million job losses in total, between 1999 and 2011 to competition from China, which entered the World Trade Organisation in 2001. Of course, a wave of factories moved to other low-cost countries too, and automation played a part in the downsizing of America’s manufacturing industry, which lost close to six million jobs. This led to all sorts of social problems, from drug abuse to depression. And in 2016, then presidential candidate Donald Trump focused on the China shock theory in his election campaign, saying little about automation or income redistribution. He won that election. And on his presidential campaign trail this year, the China factor features again. As US President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also raise the overcapacity issue, some economists warn of another impending China shock, this time in advanced manufacturing sectors. “The second China shock could be even larger than the first,” Green says. “What we’ve got now in China is … four things. The first is a 30 per cent share of global manufacturing. The second is relatively cheap wages. “The third, and this is key: advanced technological capacity. And then the fourth: massive, consistent, sustained state support for these sectors. The combination of those four factors is unprecedented in history. “A second China trade shock, this time (in) advanced manufacturing … is going to put a lot of pressure now on … Europe, on Japan, on South Korea and (yet) again, pressure on … the US.” In response to China’s “overcapacity”, Biden announced new tariffs last month on Chinese imports. The White House said the measures, which include a 100 per cent tariff on electric cars from China, are intended to protect American jobs. Over in China, the old growth model of property and infrastructure development no longer holds. Beijing announced the “Made in China 2025” vision almost 10 years ago and worked towards global competitiveness in three areas of clean technology: EVs, solar panels and batteries. With the country now facing high youth unemployment and lacklustre economic growth, these three clean tech sectors play an important role in powering its economy forward. But they face resistance arising from the overcapacity disputes. China has pushed back against the allegation of overcapacity. Chinese ambassador to the US Xie Feng said in April: “Globally, green capacity isn’t excessive but in dire scarcity. The problem now isn’t ‘overcapacity’ but overanxiety. “Calling for (a) stronger climate response on the one hand, and erecting green trade barriers on the other, would only raise the cost for one’s own low-carbon transition and also slow down the global development of clean energy.” There are others in China with a more pointed rebuttal. International relations professor Wang Yiwei, the director of Renmin University of China’s Institute of International Affairs, tells CNA the overcapacity allegations are a way to stop China from moving up the manufacturing ladder. “The automotive industries (in Europe and the US) are in a state of decline. They can’t accept the fact that China is overtaking them. So they can only blame you for ‘overcapacity’, especially during this US election year,” he says. “It isn’t me (Europe and the US) underperforming, it’s them (China) messing around. It’s them (China) who’ve violated market principles. Wang, who is also vice-president of the university’s Academy of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in a New Era, questions whether there really is excess in China. “China is aiming to achieve peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality by 2030 (and 2060 respectively). If we don’t promote electric vehicles, what else should we be doing?” he says. How is this tussle between China, Europe and the US unfolding? Are we witnessing the start of a trade war between Europe and China? Our documentary, When Titans Clash — The Overcapacity Debate , addresses these issues and asks experts across the globe for their perspectives. As Europe launches more investigations into China’s trade practices, and election rhetoric heats up in the US, I think we are entering a new phase in geopolitical rivalry. A new set of trade disputes and rerouting of global supply chains is only just getting started. Watch this episode of When Titans Clash here .

(Photo: cnsphoto via REUTERS) BEIJING: The death toll from heavy rains and flooding in southern China's Guangdong province this week rose sharply to 38 on Friday (Jun 21), state media reported. China has endured a spate of extreme weather so far this summer, with deluges in the south coming as a heatwave has swept across the north. Downpours in densely populated Guangdong this week sparked inundations and landslides, with some areas seeing record flooding. Authorities said on Thursday nine people had been killed around the city of Meizhou but the toll had jumped to 38 by mid-afternoon Friday. \"Due to the severity of the disaster ... the search and rescue of trapped people is difficult and time-consuming,\" state broadcaster CCTV said. More than 55,000 people were affected by the rains, it said, adding that over 2,200 homes and nearly 4,700 roads had collapsed. The disaster also damaged hundreds of power facilities and water pipelines as well as nearly 7,000 hectares of crops, according to CCTV. The broadcaster said direct economic losses as a result of the flooding were estimated at 5.85 billion yuan (US$805.7 million). Footage by CCTV on Friday showed an entire village inundated by muddy water that lapped against broken masonry and roofs with missing tiles. Trucks lined up along an embankment worked to pipe the floodwater out of the settlement and into a nearby reservoir. State media reported this week that some areas had endured \"once-a-century flooding ... (or) the biggest since historical records began\". The central government has allocated 105 million yuan (US$14.5 million) in emergency flood relief for flood-hit areas, state media said Friday. Aside from Guangdong, the provinces and regions of Guangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan and Guizhou have all been affected. While torrential rains have struck the south, northern China has sweated in temperatures well above 35 degrees Celsius. Authorities in several provinces have issued heat warnings since the start of June, urging residents to limit exposure to the sun and to stay hydrated. Rain showers provided some relief from the heat on Friday in the capital Beijing, where the mercury climbed to 37C last week. Scientists say climate change makes extreme weather such as heavy rains and heatwaves more frequent and intense. China is the world's biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases that are a major cause of climate change. Beijing has pledged to bring emissions of carbon dioxide - a potent greenhouse gas - to a peak by 2030 and to net zero by 2060.

    "article_content": "World World Palestinians at a damaged apartment block following overnight Israeli strikes in Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip (Photo: AFP/Bashar TALEB) GAZA STRIP: The Israeli army on Tuesday (Jun 18) said plans for an offensive in Lebanon were \"approved and validated\" amid escalating cross-border clashes with Hezbollah and a relative lull in Gaza fighting. The war in Gaza has heightened tensions across the region, with Israeli forces and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, exchanging fire on a near-daily basis. \"Operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\" as commanders met for a situational assessment, the army said in a statement. It came after Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz threatened Hezbollah's destruction in a \"total war\". The latest warnings came after Israel announced at the weekend a daily \"pause\" of military activity in Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah to facilitate aid flows , coinciding with the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday. In central Gaza, witnesses reported gunfire and artillery shelling near the Nuseirat refugee camp, where the civil defence agency said at least 13 people were killed in two separate strikes on a family home and a commercial building. Al-Awda Hospital said it received the bodies of \"six martyrs and 15 wounded as a result of Israeli air strikes on various areas in the central and southern Gaza Strip\". Witnesses and the Hamas government media office said there were some strikes and fighting elsewhere in northern and central Gaza. In a statement, the Israeli army said its operations continued Tuesday in central and southern Gaza including Rafah city on the border with Egypt. In a message for Eid al-Adha, US President Joe Biden has called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month, saying it was \"the best way to end the violence\". US envoy Amos Hochstein said the plan would ultimately lead to \"the end of the conflict in Gaza\" which would in turn quell fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. But Israel's top diplomat on Tuesday said: \"We are very close to the moment when we will decide to change the rules of the game against Hezbollah and Lebanon.\" \"In a total war, Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be hit hard,\" Katz said in a statement from his ministry. It came after Hezbollah published a more than nine-minute video showing drone footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including parts of the city and port of Haifa. Biden's proposal would bring an initial six-week pause to fighting and Hamas would free hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Amid mounting criticism over his handling of the hostage crisis, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu invited the relatives of killed hostages to his home, several families told AFP Tuesday. But one relative, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she would decline the invitation, saying, \"he remembered a little late to invite us\". In Jerusalem on Monday, thousands of Israelis protested against Netanyahu's government over its failure to negotiate the release of scores of hostages held in the Palestinian territory since Hamas's Oct 7 attack. Demonstrators rallied outside the parliament and near Netanyahu's residence, demanding early elections and chanting \"All of them! Now!\", referring to the release of hostages. \"We need to shut down the country in order to make the government fall,\" said Yaacov Godo, whose son Tom was killed during the Hamas attack, at the start of what activists describe as a week of anti-government action across the country. Israeli media said another rally was planned in front of the parliament building late Tuesday. In Rafah, where the Israeli military has said it would pause fighting along a key route in the city's east, witnesses saw Israeli military vehicles and reported shelling in other areas. The unprecedented October 7 attack by Palestinian militants on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. The militants also seized 251 hostages. Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,372 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry. United Nations rights chief Volker Turk said he was \"appalled by the disregard for international human rights\" and \"unconscionable death and suffering\". The United Nations has said aid access to Gaza has been severely hindered by factors including insecurity, the closing of crossing points to the territory, and Israeli procedural delays. Since the start of Israeli military operations around Rafah in early May, when the vital crossing was seized and closed, \"aid delivery and humanitarian access deteriorated further\", Turk said.

    "article_content": "Health Matters Health Matters New treatment options like immunotherapy and targeted therapy increase the chances of managing cancer like a chronic illness. Advancements in immunotherapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy are increasing cancer survival rates. Singapore, like most modern, developed countries, has been battling an increasing incidence of cancer. While numbers remain high, the cancer survival rate in Singapore has correspondingly increased. When the Singapore Cancer Registry (SCR) began tracking population-based cancer trends in 1968, the cancer survival rate was some 18 per cent. Today, the cancer survival rate has grown to almost 60 per cent. “The advancements in cancer treatment over the last few decades have been remarkable. Some patients with metastatic disease, where cancer has spread to other parts of the body, survive for more than five years, sometimes even up to 10 years”, says Dr Wong Chiung Ing. “That’s something we would not have expected when I started as a doctor more than 20 years ago.” Medical oncologist Dr Wong states that the new weapons available in the fight against cancer, such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy, are primary reasons for the increase in survival rates. Targeted Therapy and Antibody-Drug Conjugates The Singapore cancer data base also found that the 5-year survival period was higher for women, even in the later age group, where breast and lung cancer are the most common. In treating breast cancer these days, Dr Wong says the focus is on the use of medication to inhibit receptors that play a role in cancer cell growth. In 70 to 80 per cent of all breast cancers, the hormone receptors estrogen and progesterone are present. “Once we can accurately identify that the breast cancer is hormone receptor positive, treatment will be focused in using medication to stop estrogen and progesterone hormones from acting on cancer cells, causing it to stop growing and eventually die off.” The specialist in breast and gynaecological cancers at Parkway Cancer Centre adds that “since these receptors are found mainly in breast cancer cells, such targeted therapy will spare normal cells from the side effects of treatment.” When treating the human epidermal growth factor (HER2) receptor 2 that’s found in about 20-25 per cent of breast cancers, Dr Wong advocates the use of chemotherapy in combination with targeted therapy to achieve better outcomes. Advancements in this area also include the development of antibody-drug conjugates. “Antibody-drug conjugates, which in very simple terms are two-in-one chemotherapy and HER2 targeted therapy” explains Dr Wong, adding that “these are more focused in identifying HER2 positive cancer cells and killing them.” Inheriting a cancer risk According to Dr Wong, a very small five to ten per cent of breast cancers are linked to inherited gene mutations passed on from a parent. Should tests indicate that a patient has what’s known as the BRCA mutation, another course of action is taken. “Medications like PARP (poly-ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitors are used to treat this group of patients.” “PARP inhibitors work by preventing cancer cells from repairing themselves, thereby allowing them to die” explains Dr Wong. Unlike breast cancer, the other common cancer among women – lung cancer - is not usually caused by inherited gene mutations, says Dr Chin Tan Min a Senior Consultant in medical oncology at Parkway Cancer Centre. However, she notes a serious trend. “I'm seeing a fair number of Asian women who don't smoke, who unfortunately are diagnosed with lung cancer.” While there is no strong familial link in most patients, the specialist in treating lung cancers has observed mutations in the tumours of non-smokers. “We know now that a fair number of non-smokers with lung cancer may harbour these driver mutations … that keep firing away growth signals, resulting in growth of the cancer.” According to Dr Chin, targeted treatment works efficiently to stop the cancer growth. “There are different mutations which can be targeted with different types of targeted oral medication” she says, adding that “the list of available medications continues to grow as we find more targets.” New treatment options increase the chances of managing cancer like a chronic illness. A New Perspective to Treatment With each lung cancer diagnosis, Dr Chin looks for molecular signatures in the tumour before recommending the most appropriate treatment. This could range from surgery to systemic treatment involving chemotherapy, targeted treatment or immunotherapy. “Immunotherapy works by waking up the body’s own immune system to do its job of clearing foreign bodies, in this case, the cancer cells” explains Dr Chin. She adds that 80 per cent of patients on immunotherapy “tolerate the treatment without too many side effects.” Many of her patients on chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy also continue with their routines with some even well enough to go back to work, she points out. “We’re looking also at long-term maintenance treatment for a lot of these patients because cancer treatment has become very effective, and so we keep it going” says Dr Chin. Immunotherapy in particular has offered the medical oncologist a new perspective on cancer. “We’re finding that 20 to 30 per cent of stage four lung cancer patients who respond to immunotherapy are still well after five years.” That is significant, says Dr Chin, when compared to the one to two years survival rate of advanced stage lung cancer patients, before the era of immunotherapy. “So, immunotherapy is making us rethink. Maybe we can treat cancer like a chronic illness.” Produced in partnership with Parkway Cancer Centre.

(Photo: AFP/Munir Uz Zaman) PATUAKHALI: After cyclone gales tore down his home in 2007, Bangladeshi fisherman Abdul Aziz packed up what was left of his belongings and moved about half a kilometre inland, further away from storm surge waves. A year later, the sea swallowed the area where his old home had been. Now, 75-year-old Aziz fishes above his submerged former home and lives on the other side of a low earth and concrete embankment, against which roaring waves crash. \"The fish are swimming there in the water on my land\", he told AFP, pointing towards his vanished village. \"It is part of the advancing ocean.\" Government scientists say rising seas driven by climate change are drowning Bangladesh's densely populated coast at one of the fastest global rates, and at least a million people on the coast will be forced to relocate within a generation. \"Few countries experience the far-reaching and diverse effects of climate change as intensely as Bangladesh,\" Abdul Hamid, director general of the environment department, wrote in a report last month. The three-part study calculated the low-lying South Asian nation was experiencing a sea level rise in places more than 60 per cent higher than the global average. By 2050, at present rates of local sea level rise, \"more than one million people may have to be displaced\", it read, based on a quarter of a century of satellite data from the US space agency NASA and its Chinese counterpart CNSA. Sea levels are not rising at the same rate around the world, due chiefly to Earth's uneven gravity field and variations in ocean dynamics. Study lead AKM Saiful Islam said Bangladesh's above-average increases were driven by melting ice caps, water volumes increasing as oceans warm, and the vast amounts of river water that flow into the Bay of Bengal every monsoon. The study provides \"a clear message\" that policymakers should be prepared for \"mitigation and adaptation\", he said. Islam, a member of the UN's IPCC climate change assessment body, examined the vast deltas where the mighty Himalayan rivers of the Ganges and Brahmaputra reach the sea. \"In recent decades, the sea level rose 3.7 millimetres each year globally,\" Islam added. \"In our study, we saw that the sea level rise is higher along our coast ... 4.2 millimetres to 5.8 millimetres annually.\" That incremental rise might sound tiny. But those among the estimated 20 million people living along Bangladesh's coast say the destruction comes in terrifying waves. \"It is closing in,\" said fisherman Aziz about the approaching sea. \"Where else can we escape?\" The threat is increasing. Most of the country's coastal areas are a metre or two above sea level, and storms bring seawater further inland, turning wells and lakes salty and killing crops on once fertile land. \"When the surge is higher, the seawater intrudes into our houses and land,\" said Ismail Howladar, a 65-year-old farmer growing chilli peppers, sweet potatoes, sunflowers and rice. \"It brings only loss for us.\" Cyclones - which have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades - are becoming more frequent as well as growing in intensity and duration due to the impact of climate change, scientists say. Shahjalal Mia, a 63-year-old restaurant owner, said he watches the sea \"grasp more land\" each year. \"Many people have lost their homes to the sea already,\" he said. \"If there is no beach, there won't be any tourists.\" He said he had experienced cyclones and searing heatwaves grow worse, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius. \"We are facing two, three, even four cyclones every year now,\" he said. \"And I can't measure temperatures in degrees but, simply put, our bodies can't endure this\". Bangladesh is among the countries ranked most vulnerable to disasters and climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. In April, the nation of around 170 million people experienced the hottest month, and the most sustained heatwave temperatures, in its history. Last month, a cyclone that killed at least 17 people and destroyed 35,000 homes, was one of the quickest-forming and longest-lasting seen , the government's meteorological department said. Both events were pinned on rising global temperatures. Ainun Nishat, from Brac University in the capital Dhaka, said that the poorest were paying the price for carbon emissions from wealthier nations. \"We cannot do anything for Bangladesh if other nations, notably rich countries, do not do anything to fight emissions,\" he said. Bangladesh is running out of time, Nishat added. \"It is becoming too late to prevent disasters,\" he said. \"We are unequipped to bring change.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Whether the push by some companies for more workers to return to the office will exacerbate the climate crisis is an important discussion to have, says business leader Bhupinder Singh. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: It appears that flexible work has won the battle in the tug of war between employee preferences and traditional office mandates in Singapore. Starting in December, all Singapore companies must implement a process for employees to formally request flexible work arrangements . Globally, however, many companies, from tech giants like Google and Apple to traditional firms in finance, are increasingly urging more employees to come back to physical workspaces. The Guardian reported last month that Manchester United has made it compulsory for staff to work from their offices from June. Anyone who does not wish to conform can resign and claim an early bonus. Citigroup, HSBC Holdings and Barclays are also requesting more staffers to report to the office five days a week, due to regulatory changes that “make it trickier for Wall Street to allow working from home”, according to Bloomberg. The upsides to flexible work on improved work-life balance, employee well-being and productivity have been well-documented. But employee satisfaction aside, flexible work also has potential environmental benefits. The COVID-19 pandemic showed us a glimpse of this: According to Singapore’s National Environment Agency, electricity consumption at offices fell by 24.2 per cent in 2020 when work-from-home was predominant. The move away from traditional office set-ups, with their reliance on printed documents and disposable items, also helps reduce waste generation. Employees working from home are more likely to use reusable items, contributing to a decrease in plastic and paper waste. Still, some may argue that when people work from home, they increase energy usage at home. Indeed, data from the International Energy Agency shows that working from home could increase household energy consumption by between 7 per cent and 23 per cent compared to a day of working at the office, depending on various factors such as the size of their homes, cooling needs and the efficiency of appliances. Nonetheless, studies suggest that the overall energy footprint is still reduced. One of the largest contributing factors to carbon emissions, transportation, has seen large savings with fewer people travelling to the office. This is especially so for places where workers may have to drive long distances to reach their workplace, like in Europe or the United States. A study in the US showed that hybrid workers who work from home two to four days per week can reduce their carbon footprint by 11 per cent to 29 per cent. The reduction in daily commutes to the workplace by car has also shown a decrease in carbon emissions across various regions, from 90 per cent in Atlanta, 82 per cent in New York, and 70 per cent in the United Kingdom, according to a study by IWG and Arup. Despite the varying standards of public transportation and differences in size between the countries in Asia, it is likely that the level of carbon emissions will be below pre-pandemic levels due to the increase in hybrid work models around the region. While flexible work has shown environmental advantages, a well-managed return to the office can harness sustainable practices. Companies could potentially reduce their carbon footprint by adopting technology such as real-time energy monitoring and automating their office lighting and temperature controls, or incorporating renewable energy sources, such as solar panels. In terms of flexible work arrangements, companies could designate specific days for in-office work to synchronise employee schedules, thereby reducing the overall energy usage during off-peak times. Another consideration is to encourage employees to use public transport, carpool or cycle to work. Providing bicycle parking facilities and showers may make these options more attractive. Whether the push by some companies for more workers to return to the office will exacerbate the climate crisis is an important discussion to have, especially with 2024 shaping up to either match or exceed 2023 as the hottest year on record . As sustainability takes centre stage in the global business landscape, companies are beginning to pay closer attention to their social and environmental impact. Employees too are increasingly looking to their employers to demonstrate a commitment to sustainable practices. Ultimately, the decision to bring employees back to the office should consider not only business needs but also environmental concerns. By embracing flexible work arrangements and adopting eco-friendly practices, companies can demonstrate their commitment to both employee well-being and environmental stewardship.

    "article_content": "World World While there may be some green technologies that do not yet exist today, the world should be prepared with the necessary infrastructure and regulation so that they can be quickly adopted once created, experts told CNA on the sidelines of Gastech 2023. SINGAPORE: Calls for the pursuit of cleaner energy alternatives are gaining traction, as global fuel prices climb amid a drop in supply by major producers. The pursuit of decarbonisation can be aided by harnessing new green technology that is already available, and focusing efforts on the aviation and shipping industries - two of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise. Experts spoke to CNA on the side of the four-day Gastech 2023 event at the Singapore Expo, which brought together over 40,000 attendees from the natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and hydrogen sectors. While there may be some technologies that do not yet exist today, the world should be prepared with the necessary infrastructure and regulation so that they can be quickly adopted once created. Mr Mark Brownstein, senior vice-president of the Environmental Defence Fund (EDF), told CNA’s Asia Now on Thursday (Sep 7) that every country in Southeast Asia understands the severity of the climate crisis and the urgency to address it. “I think Singapore plays a huge role in helping to foster the transition to cleaner fuels in the shipping industry and the aviation industry. These are two parts of the global economy that are the hardest to decarbonise. I think Singapore has a huge opportunity to really help catalyse change in those key industries,” he said. He noted there are many technological solutions available, but they are just not being deployed quickly enough. “It's alarming because no matter where you go in the world, you're seeing the consequences of climate change – the floods, the droughts, the heat waves. It’s almost biblical in its impact,” he said. One of the biggest myths about climate change is that nothing much can be done, said Mr Brownstein, citing technological solutions such as electrifying transportation and reducing methane pollution from the oil and gas industry. Another myth is that the climate issue can be solved just by controlling carbon dioxide emissions. “Carbon dioxide is the key climate pollutant. It determines the total amount of warming that we will experience over time. But there's another culprit, methane , which affects how fast the world warms,” he explained. “The oil and gas industry here is responsible for about 40 per cent of total methane emissions. And the reason why methane is so important is it drives about a third of the warming that our planet is experiencing right now.” Mr Brownstein said the EDF will be launching a satellite in the next few months to provide regulators, industry investors and the general public with information on methane emissions from over 80 per cent of oil and gas operations worldwide. The International Energy Forum (IEF) estimates that nearly US$5 trillion in global upstream oil and gas investments are needed by 2030 to prevent a future energy crisis. This means raising annual investment from US$400 billion a year to about US$600 billion to meet current demand levels, IEF secretary general Joseph McMonigle told CNA’s Asia Now on Thursday. “It may seem odd for the head of an international energy organisation to be talking about this, but I'm worried about our continued progress on climate and the transition,” he said. “Because if prices get too high and the public starts to equate transition policies or action on climate with high prices, we are in big trouble … So it's really important we pay attention to these high prices and manage the transition.” Global oil prices earlier this week hit US$90 per barrel for the first time this year , on the back of the export cuts by the OPEC+ group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies such as Russia, set to continue for the rest of 2023. “There's a lot of skepticism about continued growth and demand, with China kind of being a big shadow over demand. The expectation was for a great turnaround from post-COVID times in terms of growth in China,” said Mr McMonigle. “The macro commodities market is factoring in fears of a global recession and economic data from China , and trying to translate that to demand scenarios that don't necessarily show up on the physical markets because they are quite tight.” Between China and India, there has been an increase in demand of almost 2 million barrels a day in the second half of this year, said Mr McMonigle. Along with the OPEC+ cuts, the pipeline from Iraq to Turkey has been shut since March, affecting global supply by about 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day, while Kuwait’s new refinery means it has been diverting exports there, reducing supply by about 500,000 barrels a day, he said. “So combined, all those countries are down about 4 million barrels a day from their individual peaks,” said Mr McMonigle. He noted that while Europe has been able to refill its inventories, he is worried about “some complacency setting in on the part of policymakers”, as a few weeks of cold weather is all it will take to deplete their inventories. “As we saw last year, this is not a situation that's confined to Europe. The high prices in Europe basically price other parts of the world out of the market,” he said. Ms Lynn Loo, CEO of the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD), told CNA’s Asia Now on Thursday that it is important to prepare for the adoption of future clean energy options, even though they may not exist yet. “The more we can reduce emissions now, that means the job becomes a little easier in the future ,” she said, citing the example of green ammonia which is being studied as marine fuel. “We need supply, we need infrastructure, we need bunkering facilities (and) storage facilities at the port site, to support this. More importantly, we need guidelines. We need to think about its safety because ammonia is a toxic compound, so safety is paramount.” Ms Loo said the GCMD has commissioned and completed a safety study on the suitability of ammonia as a marine fuel and whether it can be transported around safely. It has been forecasted that by 2050, more than half of all new fuel that needs to be transported – such as ammonia or hydrogen or methanol – will be carried by ships, she said. GCMD also surveyed 128 ship owners and ship operators of different fleet segments, sizes and geographies, to comprehensively understand the state of decarbonisation in the industry, she shared. “What we learned is that different companies are at different stages of their decarbonisation journey. There are some that have just started on their decarbonisation journey, and then there are others that are further along,” she said.

    "article_content": "World World The defence push is front and centre at the ongoing Singapore Airshow 2024, where industry players are participating in the trade show running from Tuesday (Feb 20) to Friday, before the public visiting days over the weekend. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Defence manufacturers have had to change the way they do business, in light of heightened geopolitical tensions around the world. These include working more closely with governments when brokering deals, such as creating joint manufacturing capabilities in their countries to give them a stake in the process. Countries are ramping up their defence capabilities to react effectively in urgent situations, from Japan boosting its defence budget to India committing part of its significant economic growth to defence. The defence push is front and centre at the ongoing Singapore Airshow 2024 , where industry players are participating in the trade show running from Tuesday (Feb 20) to Friday, before the public visiting days over the weekend. Geopolitics is “in a very strange place” at the moment, Ms Natasha Pheiffer, BAE Systems’ regional managing director for Asia, told CNA’s Asia Now on Tuesday. “With the current threat situation, all countries have to ensure that they boost their defences and security and that they therefore set up for any eventualities,” she said. “The threat environment keeps changing and therefore military forces need to keep up with that, and companies like ourselves have to ensure that we keep up with the technologies.” Mr Jeff Shockey, RTX’s senior vice president of global government relations, said his company’s mission is “kind of defending democracy around the world”. “What you're seeing as a result of the war in Ukraine, everything that's going on in the Middle East and the potential build-up in the Taiwan Strait … countries are becoming more focused on what they need to do to defend themselves and be prepared if they need to go further than that,” he told CNA’s Asia First on Wednesday. He said his firm is seeing global demand for its products in the United States and its allies around the world. Ms Pheiffer said that one of BEA Systems’ aims is to “protect those who protect us”. “So those war fighters on the frontline who are keeping the rest of us safe every night, we need to ensure that they go home safe to their families as well. And therefore, it's extremely important for us as a defence and security business, to ensure our technologies can do that,” she said. Despite the more tense geopolitical landscape, it has not necessarily become harder to seal defence deals, said Mr Shockey. Potential clients are now additionally looking at how they can “co-develop, co-produce and co-sustain” the weapons production, so they can build up their own defence and security ecosystems as well, which is something RTX takes into consideration when making deals. “We have to be more creative and understand the needs of our customers,” he said. Mr Shockey cited the example of a large deal announced in January this year to supply countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with GEM-T missiles, or the Patriot Guidance Enhanced Missile. According to the company’s website, the GEM-T missile helps to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles or enemy aircraft. “We are going to do co-production in Germany with German industry to meet their demand, but also build up their internal capacity. So it's deals like that where you're seeing more creativity,” said Mr Shockey. This comes at a time when the order books of the world's biggest defence contractors are reaching record highs. Ms Pheiffer noted that BEA Systems operates across the land, air, sea and cyber spaces, making it unique and adding to its competitive advantage, as not many companies have such diversification. “In some areas, obviously maritime is a lot more important because of what's happening in the environments around those countries, and in other land borders our land equipment and artillery equipment is a lot more favourable,” she explained. While the firm’s research and design and manufacturing capabilities are mostly in the US and Britain, it has a presence in places like Australia and Europe as well, said Ms Pheiffer. BAE systems is also involved in the production of Australia’s first nuclear submarines, to be delivered under the 2021 AUKUS partnership aimed at countering China's naval dominance in the Indo-Pacific. The firm also has “a fair amount of equipment in Taiwan” and is working very closely with the Taiwanese to become “self-sufficient” , according to Ms Pheiffer. “Another area for us which is extremely important as a company, is partnering with local companies across the region where we operate, and therefore Taiwan is one of those examples,” she said. Mr William Blair, Lockheed Martin’s regional executive and vice president for Asia and India, said that India’s significant economic growth has also translated into its national defence spending. He said that the firm has been in India for some five decades now, and has been a part of the evolution of the country’s aerospace and defence ecosystem. “It's really driven by their requirements (and) their budget and I think what's impressive is they are translating that to real capability,” he told CNA’s Asia First on Thursday. “India has both a policy and a budget (and) now, I think a sense of urgency to advance infrastructure, but also to advance their defence and security posture.” Mr Shockey said that one big challenge is meeting the demand for its products. His firm currently has a US$78 billion backlog in defence orders globally, and it is key to meet the needs of clients “who rely on us for part of their security portfolio”, he said. “We have the same backlog type on the commercial side. Overall between defence and commercial, it's almost a US$200 billion backlog,” he said, adding that it shows that customers like the products. Defence developers also have to understand and incorporate emerging technologies. Mr Shockey said that RTX has a technology roadmap, focusing on 13 specific types of technology, including artificial intelligence (AI) , and has invested some US$7 billion in research and development. “Years ago when we developed some of our really powerful radars, we invested in, again, technology. We're constantly updating our roadmap and making sure we're placing the right bets and using the right resources,” he said. Moving forward, one key area the firm will address is in drone defence , said Mr Shockey. For Lockheed Martin, the digitalisation of defence systems is a critical part of the 21st century and a key part of its operational platforms, said Mr Blair. The firm aims to address not just current cyber threats, but also anticipate future threats across all domains, including land, sea, air and space, he added. “We have to, and we do, build in those cybersecurity solutions to have the resiliency needed as the threat evolves,” he said.

(File photo: REUTERS/Edgar Su) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Brunei-based airline start-up GallopAir hopes to start operations by the end of 2024 should Brunei's aviation regulator approve the regional jet made by Chinese state-owned planemaker COMAC it wants to fly in time, the carrier's chief executive said. In an interview on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow , GallopAir CEO Cham Chi said COMAC was exploring setting up maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities in Brunei as it seeks more international customers for home-grown planes competing with the dominant Western manufacturers Airbus and Boeing. COMAC declined to be interviewed by Reuters. GallopAir, backed by Chinese investors, currently has no aircraft. However it last year placed the first overseas order for COMAC's C919 narrow-body airliner and the second foreign order for the Chinese planemaker's smaller and older ARJ21 regional jet. The only C919s currently in operation are four with China Eastern Airlines. Outside China, Indonesian low-cost carrier TransNusa operates two ARJ21 aircraft. \"When we started negotiating with COMAC they said if a customer can order more than 30 aircraft we can configure to put MRO in the customer country,\" Chi said. The aviation industry has been watching with curiosity whether a country outside China will allow operations by the single-aisle C919. The C919's design - a 158-192 seat challenger to Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX 8 models - is only certified in China. Chi said his airline was working with COMAC and Brunei's civil air regulator to get the air operator certificate and type certificate approval needed for GallopAir to start operating the ARJ21 jet out of the tiny country that shares the island of Borneo with Malaysia and Indonesia. But starting a regulatory approvals process for the C919 was at least two to three years away, Chi said, adding he wanted to see more flying hours from the plane before GallopAir takes deliveries. Chi said GallopAir was working with COMAC's customer service arm to source COMAC-trained staff required by Brunei authorities for the approvals process. China-based Shaanxi Tianju Investment Group is an investor in GallopAir, which will be only the second Brunei-based airline operator after national carrier Royal Brunei Airlines. GallopAir has said it intends to provide flight services in the Brunei Darussalam–Indonesia–Malaysia–Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) and act as a feeder for Royal Brunei.

    "article_content": "Watch the summit LIVE now: As the world emerges from the global pandemic and faces new geo-political challenges, it is increasingly clear that trust is the most important currency for governments, institutions and businesses. Trust is essential for social cohesion and well-being as it affects a government’s ability to govern. Consequently, it is an efficient means of lowering transaction costs in any social, economic and political relationship. As nations search for a path back to normalcy and economic recovery, the challenge many will face is not only knowing which policies to choose, but also how to implement those policies. Ultimately, the capacity to implement depends crucially on trust. Without trust in governments, markets and institutions, public support for necessary policies is difficult to muster, particularly where short-term sacrifices are involved and long-term gains might be less tangible. Join the conversation at the CNA Leadership Summit as we bring together leaders from the public and private sector, as well as civil society and newsmakers, to discuss the challenges and opportunities of building trust in the 21st century.

    "article_content": "Asia Asia South Korea is looking to be among the world’s top few defence exporters, while Japan is hoping to bolster its security partnerships and its domestic defence industry. The Republic of Korea Air Force's aerobatics team, known as the Black Eagles, are performing in the aerial display at the Singapore Airshow 2024. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: South Korea and Japan have been moving to beef up their military export trade, with their intentions on display at the ongoing Singapore Airshow . South Korea is looking to be among the world’s top few defence exporters, while Japan is hoping to bolster its security partnerships and domestic defence industry, which has endured an exodus of players in recent years. Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) is among the defence equipment makers putting its products and systems on display at the Singapore Airshow. The six-day event is held at the Changi Exhibition Centre until Sunday (Feb 25). The key aerospace and defence company in South Korea is known for developing the jets used by the Republic of Korea Air Force's aerobatics team, known as the Black Eagles. The Black Eagles, which has won international awards for their demonstrations, are performing in the aerial display at the Singapore Airshow. Mr Sangshin Park, regional manager and chief of international business development for Asia at KAI, said: “It is the biggest event (in Asia) and we believe that all the neighbouring countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia are very big potential customers. “So it's very meaningful to set up our booth here and promote our products.” South Korea is rising in prominence among the world's biggest arm dealers. It signed its biggest arms deal ever with Poland in 2022, laying the groundwork for the nation's defence firms to provide Europe with weapons on the back of the Ukraine war. However, the purchase has been stalled due to a partisan deadlock over legislation that could help expedite the US$22 billion weapons purchase. The sale is a key part of South Korea's plan to become the fourth-largest defence exporter by 2027, a spot now held by China. However, the competition in defence equipment exports is getting stiffer. “In terms of the geopolitical situation, in terms of the influence of China and Japan, we (do not want to) overstep the boundaries. But (we can promote our products to) some of the countries outside of their influence,” said Mr Park. “Still, we believe that there is a lot of market potential around the world.” Meanwhile, Japan is also courting the foreign market following a shift in the country's security policy, which opened its local defence industry to the global market. It is eyeing Asia, where defence spending is on the rise due to economic growth and China’s military expansion. Japan’s defence ministry has set up a booth at the Singapore Airshow for the first time, showcasing its capabilities from aircraft manufacturing to communications. It has also brought along 13 Japanese companies with the aim of supporting sales to other countries. Both Japan and South Korea are the United States’ most important allies in Asia. “For the case of Japan and Korea especially, they are very integrated into the Western supply chain. They're interoperable with western systems,” said Aviation Week Network’s Asia Pacific senior correspondent Chen Chuanren. “And I think more importantly is that given what's happening around the world, many countries are looking to get military equipment fast and urgently, and (Korea, in particular,) has the capacity and the capability to generate and produce military equipment very easily for these countries.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "World World Airbus Asia-Pacific’s president Anand Stanley spoke to CNA at the ongoing Singapore Airshow 2024, where Chinese state-owned firm Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China’s C919 airliner is making its international debut. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Competition in the aviation manufacturing sector benefits all players and should be welcomed, said Airbus Asia-Pacific’s president Anand Stanley on Friday (Feb 23). Speaking to CNA at the ongoing Singapore Airshow 2024 at the Changi Exhibition Centre, Mr Anand acknowledged the presence of Chinese state-owned firm Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) at the event. “I'm delighted that they are here, and I welcome that because we welcome competition. Competition makes all of us better,” he said. COMAC’s narrow-body C919 airliner is making its international debut at the Singapore Airshow. It had conducted its inaugural commercial trip in May last year, a domestic flight operated by China Eastern Airlines between Shanghai and Beijing. China’s first domestically developed passenger jet, the C919, is positioned as an alternative to Airbus and Boeing passenger jets, with both aviation giants struggling to meet demand for new planes, and the latter grappling with a string of safety issues. Global air travel is expected to finally exceed pre-COVID levels this year, with a full recovery anticipated for the Asia Pacific , according to observers. Mr Stanley noted that the Asia-Pacific region is the fastest growing market, and also the largest market, in aviation. “We are talking about 19,000 to 20,000 aircraft over the next 20 years, so it is (an) unstoppable demand to be honest,” he said. The demand for aircraft has been going up post-pandemic, said Mr Stanley. “We are looking at 19,000 new aircraft that are required, which shows that air travel is back,” he said. “Last year, we had a record year in terms of our backlog and orders. We have 8,300 aircraft in the backlog right now.” Aircraft manufacturers such as Airbus were plagued with problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply chain issues and manpower shortages. To deliver the aircraft to clients, Airbus is increasing its production capabilities, said Mr Stanley. The first produced 735 aircraft last year, and is planning on “significantly going beyond that” this year. “As we are in a ramp-up to meet demand, the supply chain also needs to ramp up to meet the demand,” noted Mr Stanley, adding that the firm is working directly and closely with suppliers to meet the orders. Airbus aims to produce the world’s first hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by 2035. “We are fully committed to bringing a hydrogen-fueled aircraft by 2035. It's coming along very well. We are doing a lot of work on it year over year,” said Mr Stanley. “We are looking at multiple different prototypes and vectors for that aircraft, whether it is combustion, which means we burn the hydrogen, or it's fuel cell based.” On Tuesday, the firm also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) to set up a Sustainable Aviation Hub in the country. The facility will bring together aerospace professionals and researchers to focus on technology, research and innovation, in areas such as decarbonisation, maintenance services and air traffic management. One area of research would be on sustainable aviation fuel and increasing its availability, while another would be on aviation regulation and how to achieve the optimum levels of regulation, said Mr Stanley. He added that new generation wide-body aircraft being produced by Airbus are more sustainable, and among the most fuel-efficient aircraft around. “They save about 25 per cent to 40 per cent of fuel compared to the previous generations,” he explained.

    "article_content": "World World Some fear that costlier electric vehicles could reduce demand and undermine the European Union’s plan to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2035. This audio is generated by an AI tool. BRUSSELS: Cheap and heavily subsidised Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) are flooding the market – this was the warning from senior European Union officials that sparked a probe into unfair trade practices late last year. Now, the bloc has taken action. The European Commission announced last Wednesday (Jun 12) that it will impose higher tariffs of up to 38.1 per cent on Chinese EVs, causing Beijing to issue threats of retaliation. Since then, concerns have arisen that trade disputes with China could put the brakes on the EU’s climate targets. The EU plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It has also committed to making all new cars and vans zero-emission from 2035. The additional tariffs were the result of an EU probe into alleged unfair state subsidies given to China’s car manufacturing industry that posed an economic threat to European rivals. It was also a bid by the bloc to tackle Chinese industrial overcapacity flooding the EU. The level of tariffs set for specific EV makers depended on the level of state subsidies received by the firms. They come on top of an existing 10 per cent levy on cars imported into the EU. The tariffs are set to kick in on Jul 4, but could be adjusted as Chinese companies have until then to provide evidence that could challenge the EU’s findings. The European Commission’s anti-subsidy investigation will continue until November. China has rejected the allegations of unfair trade practices, calling the EU's move “protectionist behaviour”. According to analysts, Chinese brands are set to make up an 11 per cent market share in Europe this year. This is set to rise to 20 per cent come 2027. These brands can be nearly 30 per cent cheaper than their European competitors. While European officials hope the additional tariffs could raise more than US$6 billion annually and help level the playing field, there are worries that they will complicate the EU’s ambitious climate plans. Some fear that costlier vehicles could reduce demand and undermine the bloc’s goal to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2035. Electrified vehicles accounted for nearly half of all new car registrations in the EU last year. China-EU business consultant Bart Horsten said that consumer confidence is based on the security of a product’s future, and that a potential buyer could be put off by the uncertainty of how much an electric vehicle costs. “Also, the regulations are changing often,” he added. Several European countries, including Germany, have also warned that trade disputes can lead to a surge in prices. Meanwhile, some industry players said competition is key to driving innovation. Recent data suggested the EU needs a jolt when it comes to the rollout of its EV charging infrastructure. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, the EU needs to build eight times more EV charging stations per year by 2030 to hit its emissions targets. Observers said it is possible for the bloc to reach its EV goals, but only with the right ambition and political stability. ABB E-mobility, with its new range of fast charging stations, is one of the firms trying to get the expansion of the EU’s charging infrastructure back on track. “We can learn from a market which is ahead, so we know from looking at that market what will be coming towards us,” said Mr Floris van de Klashorst, the firm's senior vice president of products and hardware platforms. “(This will put) us in a place where we can make sure that our products are also future-proof, and that is super important,” he added.

    "article_content": "East Asia East Asia Over a dozen people were missing in China on Tuesday, Jun 18, 2024, after heavy rains and flooding struck swathes of the south. (Photo: AFP/STR) BEIJING: The task of controlling floods in China is becoming increasingly arduous, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday (Jun 18), calling for all-out efforts to safeguard lives and property as powerful storms pounded provinces from the interior to the eastern coast. About a dozen people have been reported killed in floods or rain-induced mudslides in recent days with the annual flooding season in southern Chinese provinces in full swing. In the city of Meizhou in Guangdong province, low-rise buildings tilted perilously on subsiding ground next to raging rivers, or lay half-submerged as flood-waters burst the banks, video on social media showed. In Guangdong province, at least five people have been killed and 13 trapped due to flash floods and mudslides, according to state media, with over 1,400 houses having collapsed and 8,000 hectares of crops damaged. Xi called for all-out efforts to fight floods in the south, urging every possible attempt to rescue those lost and trapped, the official Xinhua news agency said. He also instructed rescuers to \"guarantee the security of people's lives and property, and overall social stability\", Xinhua added. Deaths during China's annual summer floods have fallen sharply from the thousands each year in the 1990s, as authorities beefed up flood control measures, such as dam construction. Yet extreme weather in recent years, including record-breaking rainfall, has made China vulnerable to intense flooding and disasters such as sudden mudslides, often in its mountainous but populated areas. In Shanghang, a county in southeastern Fujian province, four people were killed after rainfall in 15 townships broke records over a 24-hour period, Xinhua reported. Communication and power infrastructure in disaster-stricken areas in Shanghang have not fully recovered, with the region facing the risk of more landslides. In the far western region of Xinjiang, flash floods engulfed a car on Tuesday, and four people remained missing, state media said. In the mountainous area of Changji in Xinjiang's northwest, emergency officials said heavy rainfall had brought flash floods and mudslides that blocked roads in one town. Also on Tuesday, officials in the southwestern region of Guangxi upgraded a flood warning advisory, adding that about 23,600 people were affected in 10 counties. Flash flood warnings were also issued in the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangxi, where heavy rain fell for two days, state media said. Weather forecasters expect more heavy rain in Guangxi region, and the provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui, which could lead to more landslides and flooding. The waters in many rivers have exceeded warning levels, official media said. Meanwhile, China's north is wilting under some of the year's hottest weather. The mercury was expected to soar to up to 39 degrees Celsius in Beijing and the surrounding areas of Tianjin and Hebei on Tuesday, the National Meteorological Centre said. Authorities have also moved to offer drought prevention and disaster relief in seven provinces across China's north, east and centre. China is enduring a summer of extreme weather, which scientists say is made more common by climate change. Greenhouse gases, of which China is the world's biggest emitter, are a key contributor to climate change.

(Photo: REUTERS/Jennifer Lorenzini) Italian agricultural production shrank last year as wine, fruit and olive oil output all took a hit from extreme weather events linked to climate change, national statistics bureau ISTAT said on Tuesday (Jun 18). Europe suffered its hottest summer in 2,000 years in 2023 - a finding based in part on an analysis of tree rings - and this month temperatures in parts of the continent have already surpassed 40 degrees Celsius. Italian farms recorded a 3.9 per cent yearly drop in production volume in 2023, with woody crops such as vines, fruits and olives down 11.1 per cent, ISTAT said in a statement. \"The year's trends were affected by adverse weather conditions at different times of the year, with a succession of extreme events affecting many crops of primary importance,\" it said. Wine production fell more than 17 per cent to 2017 levels due to hot summer temperatures extending well into autumn, while olive oil makers in central regions saw output hurt by unseasonably cool and humid conditions during the spring blooming season. Fruit production was hampered by hail storms and spring frosts, ISTAT added. As summer approaches, drought in Italy's southern mainland and the islands of Sicily and Sardinia is already killing crops and livestock, farming lobby Coldiretti said in a statement last week. Italian farmers joined protests across the European Union in February to oppose low prices for produce, rising costs, cheap imports and EU measures aimed at more sustainable agriculture. Italy was among six countries that voted on Monday against a flagship EU policy requiring member states to introduce measures restoring nature on a fifth of their land and sea by 2030.

Hosts Jack Board and Liling Tan bring years of expertise covering climate change and sustainability to this weekly podcast. A one-stop shop for news, views and interviews. In a country where urbanisation has uprooted native species that used to call our skies, lands and waterways home, some creatures have beaten the odds of extinction … at least for now. Liling Tan speaks to Yeo Suay Hwee and Tan Gim Cheong from the Nature Society about the species that are coming back, and the ones that are lost forever. Jump to these key moments: Here's an excerpt of the conversation: Liling Tan: A lot of these natural habitats are being replaced by buildings, factories, offices, schools, transport networks, the MRT system. That is very important. But how do we strike the balance? Tan Gim Cheong: There are areas that are reclaimed which are left there to settle before development. So during that period of time, which is usually actually more than 10 years, there's sufficient time for scrubland to develop and sometimes maybe even woodland. Sometimes, there is ponding and this attracts water birds like ducks. What we can do to ameliorate the development and the clearing of habitats is to allow these areas to continue to be wild as long as they are not needed, so that wildlife has some space to go to. Liling: So we're relocating them? Gim Cheong: It's like we've developed a few places and other places we leave fallow. So those that we leave fallow, we try to leave them as it is so that wildlife can move in, have a place to stay, at least temporarily. That's why we sometimes convince the developer or the government when they are setting out a town to incorporate this nature area into their town park, in that sense to preserve it. Liling: Are developers open to this? I mean, do you get push back more now or less now than before? Yeo Suay Hwee: No, this got to be in the planning stage … you have to convince them that it is good to be incorporated into the development. Find more episodes of The Climate Conversations here .

(Photo: AFP/Yasser Al-Zayyat) UNITED NATIONS: Four in every five people want their country to strengthen its commitments to addressing climate change, according to a global poll of 75,000 participants published on Thursday (Jun 20). The survey by the UN Development Program, Oxford University and GeoPoll posed 15 questions by randomised telephone calls to people in 77 countries representing 87 per cent of the world's population. The key finding was that 80 per cent of respondents want their governments to increase efforts to fight against global warming. Poorer countries beat this drum the loudest, with 89 per cent in favour, though appetite is also high in the wealthy G20 nations (76 per cent), according to the survey. China (73 per cent) and the United States (66 per cent) - the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters - also saw a majority of respondents in favour of climate action. \"As world leaders decide on the next round of pledges under the Paris Agreement by 2025, these results are undeniable evidence that people everywhere support bold climate action,\" said Cassie Flynn, UNDP global climate director. A majority of respondents in 62 of the 77 countries surveyed said they supported a quick transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy. These included China (80 per cent) and the United States (54 per cent), but in Russia just 16 per cent of poll participants were in favour. Worries about global warming have also increased, the survey found, with 56 per cent saying they think about climate change at least once a week. Over half (53 per cent) of those surveyed said they were more worried about climate change than last year, compared with 15 per cent who said they were less worried. Leading the rise in climate anxiety is Fiji, where 80 per cent are more concerned compared to a year ago, followed by Afghanistan (78 per cent) and Türkiye (77 per cent). Saudi Arabia saw the lowest increase in climate fears, with 25 per cent more worried, followed by Russia (34 per cent), Czech Republic (36 per cent) and China (39 per cent). More than two-thirds of survey respondents (69 per cent) said that global warming had impacted their life decisions, such as where to live or work and what to buy. But Achim Steiner, head of the UNDP, said these concerns do not necessarily translate into electoral and consumer decisions. \"I would do more. But the others won't. So I will not do anything,\" Steiner said of what he called people's \"perception gap\" on climate action.

An activist sitting in front of a plane after spraying orange paint on private jets at Stansted Airport, northeast of London, on Jun 20, 2024. (Photo: Handout/Just Stop Oil/AFP) LONDON: Climate activists on Thursday (Jun 20) gained access to a UK airport and sprayed private jets with orange paint a day after Stonehenge was vandalised . Environmental protest group Just Stop Oil claimed US pop star Taylor Swift's private jet had landed at Stansted Airport \"mere hours earlier\". Taylor Swift has attracted criticism over her use of private jets. But Essex Police said her aircraft was not at the airport, northeast of London, at the time of the incident. Swift is currently on tour in the UK. Police said they had arrested two women aged 22 and 28 on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with national infrastructure. The pair, named by Just Stop Oil as Jennifer Kowalski, 28, and Cole Macdonald, 22, used fire extinguishers filled with orange paint to spray two private jets, according to a statement. It said they were demanding that Britain's next government after the Jul 4 general election legally commits to phasing out fossil fuels by 2030. In a post on X, Just Stop Oil added: \"Jennifer and Cole cut the fence into the private airfield at Stansted where @taylorswift13's jet is parked, demanding an emergency treaty to end fossil fuels by 2030.\" The accompanying video showed one of the activists cutting a hole in the fence before spraying the paint over the jets. Taylor Swift has been condemned by environmentalists for using fuel-guzzling private jets. In 2022, she headlined a list published by British sustainability marketing firm Yard of the \"worst private jet CO2 emission offenders\" among celebrities. Her jet flew 170 times in 2022, with total flight emissions for the year reaching 8,293.54 tonnes, or 1,184.8 times more than the average person, Yard said. The protest at Stansted came a day after activists sprayed an orange substance on Stonehenge, the prehistoric UNESCO World Heritage Site in southwest England. Just Stop Oil said two activists had \"decorated Stonehenge in orange powder paint\" in a stunt that was roundly condemned by political leaders and heritage bodies. Wiltshire Police arrested two people on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument. They were released on bail pending further enquiries, the force said on Thursday.

    "article_content": "Sustainability Sustainability Asia’s Great Climate Frontiers: In parts of the Coral Triangle, a harmony between fishing and marine protection has been achieved. But the future is far from certain. The Coral Triangle is one of the most diverse ecosystems of its kind in the world. (Photo: CNA/Jack Board) APO ISLAND, Philippines: Around the small volcanic island, the sea is heavy and the sky is dark. This is the Amihan season in the Philippines, where days are defined by the onset of the northeast monsoon, cooler temperatures and trade winds. Below the surface of the water nearby, there is turbulence too. Soft corals undulate in the strong current and small colourful fish seek refuge as waves break on the reef. Other underwater visitors to Apo Island off the coast of Negros do not seem to mind the conditions though. Green sea turtles have found a safe haven just metres from the shoreline of this fishing community. Unafraid of snorkelling tourists, the turtles graze in the murky shallows on a rich supply of seagrass. Locals estimate there could be up to 250 turtles that frequent the island’s waters, a rare phenomenon that has boosted the fledgling economy here and injected further momentum to protect marine life. Tourists flock now to Apo to see the majestic creatures, as well as the colourful coral reefs that have been allowed to blossom. A hard-fought harmony has been found here. But the situation on Apo was not always so. And how the long-term future looks hangs in the balance still. On the other side of the island, a less hopeful scene lies - symbolic of the challenges that exist around coral-dependent islands and economies in the Philippines. Not a soul can be spotted in Apo Island’s marine protected area (MPA), a 74-ha strip of coral that has special protections from human activity. Coral boulders lay strewn along the shoreline. The reef here has fallen silent. For more than a decade, the MPA has been closed to all after it was decimated by Typhoon Sendong in 2011 and a year later by Typhoon Pablo. The impacts on corals not accustomed to violent storms were catastrophic. “It's as if somebody bulldozed the whole area. And then the second typhoon, it's as if somebody went down and then smashed whatever was left,” said Rene Abesamis, an associate professor at UP Marine Science Institute and a leading expert on marine protected areas. “So, it was total obliteration of corals inside the sanctuary. Just imagine 30 years of protection gone in a few hours, because of two typhoons that happened one year apart.” Apo Island lies within the Coral Triangle, a vast ecosystem that stretches across the marine territories of the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Timor Leste, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The Coral Triangle is home to more than 500 varieties of coral and is the most biodiverse place in the world for fish species. It is complex, delicate and ancient. It also helps to support, feed and protect about 120 million people who live within its boundaries and is home to critical mangrove forests. The whole zone - just like coral reef systems all across the globe - is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Global sea temperature warming, ocean acidification and rising sea levels are compounding the stress factors. Typhoons in the Philippines are becoming more intense and unpredictable. While damaging weather patterns are highly complex and multi-faceted, research has shown that climate-related factors are contributing to the more frequent emergence of monster storm systems. About a quarter of the world’s typhoons already hit the Philippines, and while that number is not expected to rise in the years to come, because of climate change, they are expected to hit harder and move along paths that are difficult to predict and prepare for. Other human-caused impacts like overfishing, destructive fishing, unregulated tourism and marine pollution are factors contributing to the risks faced by the region. Reef loss and damage would have major environmental and economic impacts. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has forecasted that a 2 degrees Celsius rise in ocean temperatures would eliminate most reef systems. Already, sea temperatures surrounding the coastal areas of the Coral Triangle are rising approximately 0.1 degrees Celsius every year and could be 1.4 degrees Celsius warmer by the end of the century. An El Niño weather pattern is forecast for later this year, which is expected to bring warmer water conditions that can result in marine heatwaves and worsen bleaching events. It has authorities from national governments to local barangays - administrative wards - bracing for worse to come and looking to strengthen their climate defences. The designation of a conservation area around Apo Island was a landmark moment for marine protection when it was formalised in 1986. It was the second of its kind in the entire country. At that time, the concept was novel and unpopular with communities that leaned heavily on the surrounding sea and reefs for food and income. But this reliance was taking a toll. Catches were dwindling as fish resources became overexploited and dynamite and cyanide deployed by fisherfolk took a toll on the health of the reef. “In the old days, nobody cared about what happened after you fish, until people got aware that what they were doing was destructive to the fish,” said Mario Pascobello, the Barangay captain of Apo Island. “People like us, we thought that what we were doing was just normal. And we just realised a bit later that what we were doing was wrong. I was involved specifically in dynamite fishing,” he said. Led by marine biologist Angel Alcala, the MPA was established with the community’s ownership and involvement at its core. Rules were created by locals themselves to ensure fisherfolk avoided the designated area, allowing the reef to grow stronger and fish spawning to expand. That work has been largely successful, and the Apo Island MPA has become a blueprint for communities around the Philippines and has been replicated some 1,600 times across the country and even internationally in Indonesia. Pascobello transitioned from being one of the local culprits to a champion of the protection initiative. “Slowly, slowly, it spread across the country. I'm happy to share what we did here. And it's normally working well and I can prove, and Apo Island itself is proof, that community-based programmes are very effective,” he said. “I don't say that I'm proud. Because I think it is a responsibility. As a fisherman, you have to protect your farm. And our farm is the sea.” Recovery of this reef after compounding disasters will be on the “decadal scale”, according to Abesamis of the marine science institute. The community, and others like it, need to remain patient as a result and wait for benefits to return. Their 40 years of work hangs in the balance by a crisis they did not cause. “Now, the question is, will the recovery be fast enough so that it can survive? Or will it be lucky enough not to get a major disturbance event caused by climate change, like coral bleaching or typhoons,” he said. Despite the current shortcomings of the MPA, the spirit of those efforts has had unintended benefits: the arrival of turtles and with them, tourism. “Tourism actually is not part of the main objective of the project,” Pascobello the barangay captain explained. “The objective of this marine sanctuary project is to regenerate the fisheries to give more fish catches to the fishermen. That's it. “But tourism just comes as a secondary thing here. And it now has become the primary livelihoods of the people,” he said. Today, nearly all of the island’s residents benefit from tourism. Fishermen take turns acting as snorkel guides for visitors. The women benefit from operating restaurants and homestays, while young people aspire to become tourism operators. Days of catching and killing turtles, or blowing up reefs, are over. “The turtles are no longer seen as food but as friends,” said Rimel Tabañera, a young eco-guide on Apo. “The relationship between the locals and the turtles is there. The turtles are no longer afraid because they are no longer eaten, they are no longer being captured. Instead, visitors who harm the turtles get reprimanded by the locals because they take the protection of the turtles seriously now. And that is lovely.” Dante Jabelo Jr. never even dreamt of learning how to scuba dive. He and his community understand the sea intimately, but not from down in the depths. Seaweed farmers and fishermen like him on small, remote islands typically do not get the chance, given the costs and skills required. “We never thought that fishermen like myself can achieve this kind of training, which we assumed is only for those who have money. We would rather spend money on food,” he said. With the support of the Sulubaai Environmental Foundation, Jabelo now has the ability to suit up and explore underwater. But when he dives, it is not for leisure. “When scuba diving, we get to see the beautiful undersea creatures. We can check the condition of the corals and see why there are fewer fish. We can find out the reasons for the current state of the sea,” he said. “They helped and taught us so that when the time comes, we can watch over and protect the sanctuary.” Jabelo is a rising voice in his small community - Depla in Palawan - pushing for an MPA to be established around his barangay’s waters. Just like many surrounding communities in Palawan, the coral reefs and fishing grounds are struggling from a combination of human activities and climate change. The archipelagic province historically was sheltered from the country’s powerful typhoons but now often finds itself on the destruction path. “A lot of things have changed. Before, we were able to catch fish even on the outskirts of the ocean. We only bring back and sell high-quality fish. Now, we have no choice but to bring home all of our catch even if it's not good just so we can have something to eat. “The corals in this area have already been destroyed. They said it would take years before we could bring back the old state of the sea. The corals all look dead. We can't help but think that destructive activities like illegal fishing are the cause of the thinning population of fish in this area. “We think that having a sanctuary will help bring back the time when we would have an abundant catch. There are many marine species, beautiful ones, that are long gone,” he said. Amid rising climate impacts, the Sulubaai foundation is trying to bridge the gap between traditional knowledge and scientific research and equip locals in vulnerable island communities with the tools they need to adapt to a fast-changing planet. The foundation has already helped establish four MPAs in the local region of Shark Fin Bay. Its co-founder and president, Frédéric Tardieu, has ambitions to create 10 MPAs by 2025. The interventions are small but necessary and scalable, Tardieu says. At night, he watches the horizon crowded with lights “like a city” from international fishing trawlers decimating Palawan’s fish stocks. Locals are facing a bleak future, without help. “At the beginning when we realised the situation, we were really angry. The human is a machine. The human has the power to destroy one hectare in one second. But humans also have the power to help nature and the result is incredible,” he said. “I think Palawan is one of the last wild parts of the world. My dream is to contribute to the preservation of this part of the Philippines.” Sulubaai’s base, a private, rehabilitated island - Pangatalan - has become an incubator for new science and innovative ocean researchers. Education is a central mission too. Multiple projects run simultaneously - artificial reefs have been installed and are monitored to speed up coral reef recovery times, state-of-art photogrammetry creates three-dimensional maps of the reef landscape and bio-acoustic technology lets researchers better understand the complexity of reef sounds. “Pangatalan is a part of science and we give this information to the rest of the world,” Tardieu said. “We’ve taken the sea temperature every day for eight years. The waves are getting stronger. The beach washes out every year. The temperature is rising. And I'm afraid about this situation. But I can only use the power in my hands. \"We are a sentinel for the rest of the continent. If all the islands in the world give some information, we are preventing bigger impacts.” Experts agree that the outlook for corals around the world is bleak. The Coral Triangle region within decades may not resemble even how it looks today, let alone the past. Marine protected areas may need to scale up massively, all while juggling the livelihoods of island communities. In places like Apo and Pangatalan, the blueprint for adapting to an uncertain future is already being forged. Additional reporting by Aiah Fernandez. Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

    "article_content": "Sustainability Sustainability Asia's Great Climate Frontiers: In the rainforests of southern Thailand, locals are spearheading efforts in environmental protection. In the last part of a monthly series, CNA looks at the catalysts to changing attitudes and hope for the future. Khao Sok National Park is a protected forest area in southern Thailand. (Photo: CNA/Jack Board) SURAT THANI, Thailand: The rangers move in formation, alert as they weave through dense foliage and wade across waist deep rivers. The rainforest is loud with the siren calls of birds hidden in the canopy. From afar, the group might be mistaken for a military unit. The men - some experienced and others as young as 19 - wear camouflage fatigues, grip rifles and mean business. But their success in recent years means they are more likely to be looking for elephants to monitor than poachers to catch. The rangers form the forest protection unit of Khao Sok National Park in Surat Thani province in Thailand’s south. Their patrol missions can last as long as 14 days as they venture deep into the wilderness. Most of Khao Sok comprises virgin rainforest. It’s dense and humid, part of an ancient rainforest system that’s older than the Amazon. The area has a dark past; the site of a deadly plague, a guerilla conflict zone and an immense flood. Today though, it is a beacon of eco-tourism and a good example of successful environmental protection. Rainforests are a defining feature of many parts of Southeast Asia, from the great green expanses of Borneo to Cambodia’s misty Cardamom Mountains. They are critical as a tool to fight climate change. Over the past few decades, much has been lost through illegal deforestation, logging and land use changes. Yet in recent years, many parts of Southeast Asia have seen those trends starting to reverse. In Thailand, a country where forest clearing and wildlife poaching was once rife, local communities are discovering the benefits that can be unlocked when nature is preserved rather than destroyed. The Khao Sok rangers stop now and then to document what they find on patrol. Their discoveries are mostly mundane, like plastic bottles. But everything is recorded and mapped. Even these small things indicate human activity that will need to be monitored. The rangers are also looking for animal food sources, like fruit trees to better understand the wildlife in the area. The group pauses to examine claw marks on a tall tree. Signs of a bear looking for honey, they conclude. They seem happy about the discovery - a sign that nature is mostly undisturbed in this area. The coordinates are logged and the group presses on, under the guidance of its captain, Ponchai Yenchai. He has been doing this for 20 years, but his family has a much longer history in this rainforest. “Originally, every family here had fathers who were working like poachers. They weren’t actual poachers but rather would search for food,” Ponchai said. “We didn’t have any laws or a national park at the time. So, it’s normal that they would go and find wildlife. They didn’t sell them but they did it for survival. “I followed my father from when I was a child. We looked for things here and there. So, I learned which spots had a lot of animals, and which spots had resources, such as fruit trees or seasonal plants that we can eat. It was knowledge passed from generation to generation,” he recounted. Poachers are now the protectors throughout Khao Sok. Local villagers are now tour guides, leading international tourists to all corners of the park. “When former poachers saw that there were a lot of tourists coming, they switched from wildlife hunting to become tour guides and boat operators. They also opened restaurants or shops. This means they can earn a direct income and it isn’t illegal,” said Terdthai Kwanthong, the chief of Khao Sok National Park. “This makes people help with the conservation of nature. Life here is a lot different than in the past. They’ve joined us and cooperate in taking care of the forest and wildlife. “This is why incidents of encroachment, destruction of resources and poaching of wildlife are now zero.” Khao Sok has changed; not just the people who used to live in and rely on the forest but on a massive landscape scale. In the 1980s, the construction of a hydroelectric dam project flooded 162 sq km of forest. Just two years earlier, the area had been decreed a national park, meaning no logging or mining was permitted. With the country in need of electricity, the dam project was made a priority. The flooding that resulted caused massive upheaval. Many animals drowned and everyone living in villages in the area was forced out. Karun Pengchan, now 78 years old and residing on the outskirts of the national park, remembers that time with a lingering sorrow. “My children and my wife didn’t do anything complicated – we just had enough to eat,” the retired teacher said. “One day, the sub-district chiefs said that there would be a survey and a dam would be built. We needed to be prepared. We might not be able to live here in our old place. “We lived there until the rumours turned into real life. Once they started drilling the tunnel, the villagers were certain that this was serious. “I say that we lost everything. Whoever has to leave the place they used to live in, the bed they used to sleep in, the house they used to stay in, what would they feel? We cannot find the words that describe it all. “My wife and I memorised where our house was by heart. We can point where it is. If we take a boat with our children and grandchildren now, we can tell them that our house was here and our land was here,” he said. Despite the sad memories of life before the dam for some, today Khao Sok draws hordes of international visitors to forest trekking and exploring the aquamarine waters and dramatic limestone peaks. The place has been labelled the “Guilin of Thailand”, for its similarities to China’s famous karst landscape. And the influx of money to the area has been a catalyst for local behaviours to change. Eco-tourism can be a strong potential strategy to reward, compensate and incentivise local communities for better environmental protection in Thailand, according to Regan Pairojmahakij, a senior program officer at RECOFTC, an international not-for-profit assisting local communities to actively manage forests in Asia and the Pacific. “People are confronted with difficult choices and trade-offs. And when you want to send grandma to the hospital, and your kids to school, this takes money,” she said. “A lot of indigenous people and local communities that live in and around forests have long relied on subsistence type of economies that are not cash-based. So this puts them in a difficult position to try and acquire hard currency. And the forest has become the go-to place for that. “If we can offer them alternative benefits, including direct payments or direct financing, I think it's essential in allowing them the same basic rights that anybody else would expect to be able to take care of their families and improve their own livelihoods.” She suggested this could be through ecotourism, by supporting local supply chains for forest products and new and emerging markets for carbon or biodiversity. “I personally see great promise and something really transformative as we start to see markets offering incentives and recognising these really marginalised historically impoverished groups for the absolutely vital role that they play in protecting the remaining shreds of ecosystems that we rely on as a global community for our survival,” Pairojmahakij added. Thailand is on a more hopeful path when it comes to looking after its forests. Just like several of its ASEAN counterparts, deforestation rates have dropped in recent years. Tree cover loss in the country in 2021 was down 38 per cent compared to 2017, according to data from Global Forest Watch. The country recently joined an international coalition pledging support for a global goal to protect or conserve at least 30 per cent of the planet’s land and ocean by the end of the decade. Tropical forests like those in southern Thailand are vital as carbon sinks that help absorb harmful emissions that cause global warming, making them a critical part of climate change mitigation efforts. “They're one of the highest carbon sequestering forest types that exist. They're relatively more resilient in the face of climate change, as opposed to say the dry deciduous forests in northern parts of these countries which are much more subject to drought as well as wildfires,” RECOFTC’s Pairojmahakij said. When forests are cut down or burnt, the carbon stored within their trees and soil is released, and no more carbon dioxide can be absorbed in the future. All around Surat Thani province, examples of land use changes that have resulted in primary rainforest being transformed into economic concessions are everywhere. Especially as extraction from the rainforest became illegal, local communities have sought alternative ways to earn an income. Palm oil, rubber, coffee and pineapple plantations dominate the landscape. While most of this is a permanent shift, in small pockets close to Khao Sok, efforts to revive the forest are underway. Anurak Community Lodge is on the edge of the national park. It is surrounded by jungle but most of its grounds are quite different; they are full of palm oil trees. This land used to be a plantation. The man who used to own this land is 48-year-old Natthawut Chuphet. He sold it to the current owners but now works at the lodge as a hiking guide. He is also in charge of one of Anurak’s sustainability programmes to reforest this area. Slowly the palm trees are being replaced by indigenous ones. “We took care of this land for around 70 or 80 years after migrating here since the generation of our ancestors. They grew rambutans and coffee but it wasn’t fruitful. So, they planted oil palm instead,” Natthawut said. “Reforestation has started. In the next 10 years, it will definitely look like the forest in the old days. A lot of trees have been planted. “In the future, I think that nature will be so abundant like in the past, and everybody will understand about conserving nature for the next generations. And if we can conserve more nature, there will be a lot of guests too,” he said. The impacts of mass tourism stand as a threat to the balance that is being worked out around Khao Sok. With locals who treasure the landscape shaping the future, there is hope that this precious rainforest ecosystem can continue to prosper though. Park ranger Ponchai is one of them - proud of the role he plays in keeping the place of his ancestors safe. “This is my home. If we take care of it, people will come and see our work and develop our area further,” he said. “If we don’t take care of our home, then we can’t hope for people to take care of it, right?” Additional reporting by Ryn Jirenuwat.

    "article_content": "Sustainability Sustainability Asia’s Great Climate Frontiers: Southern Vietnam is the country’s food bowl. But water shortages are driving farmers to despair, with many of them opting to move to other provinces to find work. The Mekong Delta is the food bowl of Vietnam. (Photo: Jack Board/CNA) BAC LIEU, Vietnam: At the end of the line for the Mekong River, Southeast Asia’s longest and probably most important waterway, there are signs of man’s attempts to both brave and harness nature. After some 5,000km from its headwater in the Tibetan plateau, the Mekong flows through six countries and eventually ends up emptying out into a complex series of vein-like canals that run into the sea. At that precise point, a series of wind turbines sit offshore, harnessing the coastal breezes to provide clean power to the region. Nearby, a sea wall structure that overall stretches for 23km in Bac Lieu province, tells another story - of a battle with the tides. Widespread erosion along the coastline and saline intrusion, the influx of salty water into freshwater aquifers, are undermining the Mekong Delta - Vietnam’s food bowl. At the same time, the flow of the once indomitable river has been further jeopardised by the construction of large hydropower dams, which impact the seasonal flood pulse. Climate change - especially impacts on rainfall and rising sea levels - and unsustainable human development have formed a perilous cocktail deep in the delta. And millions of people face an increasingly uncertain future as a result. “Due to climate change and a very wrong way of using resources from the Mekong, people here have lost a lot of their livelihoods, they are losing their shelter, they are losing their water and millions of people have had to move to other provinces to work,” said Hoang Phuong Thao, the country director of anti-poverty organisation ActionAid Vietnam. The Bac Lieu shoreline is muddy and littered with debris. Along here, communities used to exist in small hamlets, but have since been moved on to areas further away from the encroaching sea. A project to reinstall mangroves here - a natural method to slow down erosion is in the planning stages. As salt has slowly invaded, more farmers have turned to shrimp growing ventures, instead of fruit, vegetables or rice, which have a low tolerance to saline-affected water. The saltwater intrusion phenomenon is a symptom of multiple, simultaneous environmental problems. Southern Vietnam is low lying and extremely vulnerable to sea level rise driven by climate change. Combined with coastal erosion and more regular periods of drought, the lack of fresh water, especially in provinces close to the sea, is becoming problematic. As a result, underground water resources have been contaminated, the Mekong is facing serious saltwater intrusion and farmers are seeing their crops fail more often. Upriver dams in China, Laos, Thailand and Cambodia - some of which are Vietnamese-funded - are taking water out of the river system during the wet season when it is needed and putting it back in during the dry season. “We've learned that the impacts of these dams are the greatest when the climate impacts are the greatest - when the rains aren't coming as much as they should be,” said Brian Eyler, director of the Stimson Centre Southeast Asia programme and the co-lead on the Mekong Dam Monitor, a public data platform that assesses the impact of hydropower projects and climate impacts on the river basin. “When you mess with that rhythm, then you're increasing food security concerns and water security concerns within that shared space of Vietnam and Cambodia,” he said. It is a stark outcome in a region that has long held the country’s bounty and half of its entire rice production. For rice growers, the delta has always provided. Its lush soils enriched by ample river water and sediments have made the region an economic powerhouse and its generations of farmers secure. Now, many of those farmers, armed with an ingrained knowledge of the land, are assessing their options. For some, it means looking at adapting agricultural technologies. Others are joining together in cooperatives, and the most desperate are dead-ending their livelihoods and turning to the lights - and assured wages - of the city. In the peak of the flood season, the rice fields of Tinh Bien district in An Giang province are verdant. This year has been a productive one for local farmer Nguyen Van Chon. But every season is different now and the Mekong does not flow like it always used to, the 40-year-old lamented. Drought has become a feature of a normally lush landscape - a state of emergency was declared in 2020 amid a threat of rising salinity and widespread water shortages. “The water comes unpredictably. Water is not as usual compared to the times of our grandparents. When it is not as usual, it's a bit more difficult for me to cultivate,” Nguyen said. Farmers like him rely on canals connected to the Mekong to keep their fields irrigated. Rice is a thirsty crop and water is a commodity with costs and limits when nature cannot provide. “My grandparents said the river is the source of life. If you live with water, it will bring profit to the farmer. Water is to serve for irrigation of fields or cultivation, or for drinking water for ourselves. If I don't have water, how can I live? “If I can’t grow rice in the future, I'll go find something else to do, something with a monthly salary. If you can't do rice, what can you do here? I only know how to grow rice,” he said. The uncertainty of water supplies adds strength to the argument of relying on less water-intensive crops and shifting to alternatives. But in the pursuit of economic returns, and with the extensive man-made irrigation canal network, many farmers have simply turned to try to produce even more rice. In dry times, it is a race to the bottom of the river. An Giang University is doing extensive research on water use and climate change to boost the resilience of rice farmers. A growing technique called Alternative Wetting and Drying (AWD) aims to reduce water usage by about one-third and methane output by nearly half, while maintaining yields. “For sustainable development, we have to think about traditional rice and we have to think about how to apply modern techniques,” said university project lead, Dr Pham Huynh Thanh Van. The AWD technique, which monitors water depth in rice fields, is not necessarily new and has been trialled throughout Southeast Asia, including in Vietnam. But the university project aims to roll out the methods on a community level instead of in individual fields, so farmers can cooperate instead of competing in an increasingly turbulent growing environment. “Because the water and the weather are unpredictable, farmers and also the people living in this area don't know when water is available or not. So, we have to be in an active situation to be ready with techniques and action if water becomes less and less.” “We think if more farmers work together, that means more water can be saved during the rice growing times. In some areas, the rice doesn't need more water. So at this time, we try to convince farmers to take just enough water for their fields,” she said. Getting organised into cooperatives is an approach being used in Dong Thap province. There are 108 members in the My Dong 2 cooperative, which connects farmers directly to buying companies and provides access to a smart monitoring application. “The cooperative helps farmers by informing their irrigation schedule and warning about insects. When farmers are informed, they can actively take care of their field,” said the cooperative's director, Le Van Nguyen. “They have more advanced protections compared to those who are not informed. They only need an app to see notifications. They don't have to examine the field on their own like before. “Now we only suffer unpredictable sun and rain but the water amount is ensured, regardless,” he said. Nguyen Phuoc Hung is a keen user of the application, which he said makes his rice growing more profitable and more sustainable. But the long-term viability of agriculture in southern Vietnam is an issue that hangs over him and his family. “I think growing rice is hard and dirty work, not as clean as office jobs,” he said. “In the future, I don't want my children to grow rice like their father.” It is part of the reason why a mass exodus of people from the delta is taking place, year after year. The plight of the floating market around the city of Can Tho tells the story of the rapid urbanisation that defines much of the modern-day delta. Over many years, it has transformed into a popular tourism destination, drawing crowds of visitors keen to witness traditional life on the river. Yet the ways of on-water buying and selling are dying out in the delta. A combination of economic and environmental factors means those boats still occupying the market often rely more heavily on tourists than actual trade. Fishermen now purchase farmed fish to sell in the market, locals say. Others have turned to factories or taxi-driving jobs. Children do not swim in the river any longer, as it causes the skin to itch due to pollution from the burgeoning industrial operations in the area. “I have many childhood friends who lived on boats. Since the business went down, they went up to land and started their new life in other cities like Saigon, Binh Duong or Long An. They went everywhere and anywhere to make a living. It's impossible to survive on the river now,” said Minh, a boat driver in Can Tho. Erosion has caused houses along the banks to collapse and only an elaborate dyke and gate system keeps the swollen Mekong from absorbing the city during the wet season. Salinity is an issue here too and authorities need to actively manage drinking water supplies. Infrastructure planning and management is a crucial thread in protecting the resources of the Mekong and keeping its people with livelihoods. Further south in Bac Lieu, authorities want to adapt to the changes that they are already experiencing - the powerful storms and uneven and unpredictable rain. “I think when we invest in a good infrastructure system, especially the traffic, the seawalls as well as the sewers, we can protect the living conditions of people,” said To Minh Duong, Chairman of Dong Hai District People's Committee. “And secondly, when the awareness of people is better, I think we can confidently co-exist with climate change. And in reality, if we can cope with climate change well with good infrastructure and higher civil awareness, I think we can omit threats from climate change and create opportunities for development,” he said. He argued that people from the area emigrating overseas or to other provinces can be a positive development, as it can result in more money being sent back to families locally. “Labour migration is normal. People have the right to choose,” he said. Nguyen Nu Nguyet Anh from the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Ho Chi Minh City has extensively studied the movement of people away from the delta. She said that climate change is a clear push factor disrupting people’s ability to make ends meet. Ties to a traditional way of life or to ancestral homes would not be strong enough to keep people in place if the economics no longer make sense for them, she said. “They’re happy to change their livelihood because they can make more money. They don't really care if their work saves the food security of the country. They're more concerned about the benefits for their family,” she said. Nguyen Thi Truc Mai left her hometown of Tra Vinh about 16 years ago. Life was already difficult back then, before climate change and human impacts on the Mekong really took a toll. She works in a garment factory in Ho Chi Minh City and said conditions now in the delta means there is little prospect of returning, especially for families like hers that do not own land. “There used to be plenty of jobs before. It was easy to get hired for any work in the field like harvesting the rice or cleaning the grass and earning some money every day,” she said. “No one wants to hire me now for work and I can only earn half of my current salary if I work in a factory in my hometown. If I return now, I would die of hunger.” Vietnam should be an active voice to mitigate some of the impacts on the Mekong, Eyler of the Stimson Center said. A first step would be to cut its investments in damaging mainstream dams on the river. “Vietnam has made some missteps in the region, and it's not too late to walk them back or think about alternative solutions. I think Vietnam is uniquely placed to drive that smarter regional collaboration,” he said. “There are a lot of livelihoods that rely on the natural resources of the Mekong. So, as these impacts take hold, it's becoming harder and harder to live there.” Additional reporting by Giang Pham. Copyright© Mediacorp 2024. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

    "article_content": "Sustainability Sustainability People protect themselves from the sun during a heat wave hitting the country, in Guadalajara, Jalisco state, Mexico, in May 2024 (Photo: AFP/File/ULISES RUIZ) WASHINGTON: Deadly heat that blanketed the United States , Mexico and Central America recently was made 35 times more likely due to global warming, an international network of climate scientists said on Thursday (Jun 20). The World Weather Attribution (WWA) group of scientists also said that extreme highs witnessed over that region in May and June were four times as likely to occur today as a quarter of a century ago. The record-breaking heat killed at least 125 people in Mexico and caused thousands more to suffer heat strokes, a potentially fatal condition that occurs when the body's internal cooling mechanisms start to fail. \"We likely do not know the full picture of heat-related deaths, since they are usually only confirmed and reported months after the event, if at all,\" said WWA, which uses peer-reviewed methods to assess links between specific extreme events and global warming. They said that as the world continues to burn fossil fuels and emit climate-heating greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, millions more people are expected to be exposed to dangerous levels of heat in the future. This year has been the hottest on record and already large swathes of the world have endured blistering temperatures before the onset of the northern hemisphere summer. Greece has notched its earliest-ever heatwave, India has suffered a month-long stretch of searing highs, while the United States is dealing with wildfires and scorching conditions. And in Saudi Arabia, at least 900 people died during the annual Haj pilgrimage , mostly from unforgiving heat with temperatures in Mecca hitting 51.8 degrees Celsius on Monday. For its study, WWA analysed the hottest five consecutive days and nights during a \"heat dome\" that lingered over the southwest United States, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras in late May and early June. The scientists have pioneered ways to use climate models to understand how these types of extreme events have changed in a world that is 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than in pre-industrial times. They concluded \"that human-induced warming from burning fossil fuels made the five-day maximum temperature event about 1.4 degrees Celsius hotter and about 35 times more likely\". WWA warned that if humans continue burning fossil fuels in the near term, these extremes could become more frequent still. \"The additional 1.4C of heat caused by climate change would have been the difference between life and death for many people during May and June,\" said Karina Izquierdo, urban advisor for the Latin American and Caribbean region at Red Cross Climate Centre. \"As well as reducing emissions, governments and cities need to take steps to become more resilient to heat,\" she said in a statement. Heat is the deadliest of all extreme weather but often underestimated, experts say, with children, the elderly and outdoor workers particularly vulnerable. In Mexico and Central America, the impacts of heat are intensified by poor housing conditions, limited access to cooling services, and for those living in informal settlements. Extreme heat also threatens the stability of electricity supply, which is critical to the functioning of healthcare facilities. Scientists said that extreme heat warming systems and action plans could help bolster Central America's preparedness for such events, with safety measures needed to protect outdoor workers. Green spaces and improved infrastructure in informal settlements would also help protect the most vulnerable people, WWA added.

    "article_content": "World World The number of elephants in South Sudan has fallen sharply from 5,000 to less than 2,500 in the last 15 years, according to authorities. Rangers look at an elephant that was killed by poachers for its tusks at the Nimule National Park in South Sudan. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SOUTH SUDAN: The Nimule National Park is located near South Sudan’s border with Uganda. Manned by a few poorly paid security officers, the borders between the East African neighbours are porous and poachers can easily cross with illegal products. Nimule is one of six national parks and more than 10 game reserves covering over 13 per cent of South Sudan’s terrain. Many of the wildlife species living there are under threat, as poaching becomes increasingly common across the country. Its government said there are concerns that elephants – commonly killed for ivory – could become extinct in the nation due to illegal wildlife trade. The number of elephants has fallen sharply from 5,000 to less than 2,500 in the last 15 years, according to authorities. “Elephant numbers have reduced; ostriches and giraffes (as well). Some animal species have gotten extinct, like rhinos,” said lieutenant general Khamis Adiang Ding, director general of South Sudan’s Wildlife Ministry. “They are vulnerable because of their meat and products such as ivory and tusks, which are for commercial purposes.” Authorities said many facing socio-economic challenges have turned to poaching amid a shortage of jobs and income. “Poaching is caused by a lack of economic activity in the area, both here and in neighbouring Uganda – that is the most important thing we need to put into consideration,” said Mr Ambayo Justice, a wildlife awareness warden at Nimule. South Sudan’s civil war, which raged between 2013 and 2018, led to the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, some of which are now used to kill elephants for their tusks. The conflict also triggered an economic crisis, pushing wildlife protection further down the list of government priorities. At the national park, the number of posts for government troops that used to protect the animals has been greatly reduced due to a lack of funds to keep the game rangers in their jobs. With scarce manpower and equipment, stopping the poachers is also dangerous work. “Poaching activity is everywhere in the whole of South Sudan, it is uncontrolled. If you want to control very seriously, you may even die, (the poachers) will shoot you,” said Mr Egidio Oler Brown, the park’s director. Authorities from both South Sudan and Uganda said they have stepped up efforts to tackle wildlife crimes more effectively, including reinforcing border security. However, identifying suspicious activities is increasingly tricky as criminals become more sophisticated in smuggling and trafficking. “We have strengthened our security at the exit points,” said Ms Margaret Kasumba, manager of law enforcement and security at the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), a government agency that conserves, manages and regulates the nation’s wildlife. “We are able to screen but they have become so sophisticated in terms of how they conceal the contraband.” For example, Ivory is sometimes painted black and labelled as cow horns, or concealed as plastics for recycling. To beat transboundary transit laws in East Africa, criminals do not tag or brand smuggled ivory from South Sudan. Instead, they sneak it out as old tires meant for retreading, old car batteries or hide them among logs and timbers. Uganda is a key transit hub for wildlife trafficking. Experts said that despite the existence of legislation to protect wildlife and against organised crime in the country, implementation remains a challenge, mainly due to a lack of funding. They added that illegal wildlife trade is not a problem unique to the region. Instead, such activities are a transnational issue with consumer demand – largely from Asia – driving unprecedented wildlife population declines. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), a global non-governmental organisation, said that most – if not all – international criminal syndicates in transnational wildlife trade in Africa are either Vietnamese or Chinese. “Since 2018, Vietnam has become the largest importer of illicit ivory, surpassing China. This is partly due to the issue of domestic ivory ban in China (that year),” said Ms Linh Nguyen, an investigator at the organisation. The Uganda Wildlife Authority said it is aware of organised criminal networks involved in illegal wildlife trafficking from the nation to Vietnam, including one called the Viet Group. Founded in northern Vietnam in the late 2000s, it allegedly started its operations in Africa with a view to sourcing wildlife and increasing its control of the illicit wildlife supply chain. Once ivory from South Sudan is transported into Uganda, members of the group can gain access to it. Vietnamese authorities said these members work with local suppliers in Mozambique and Uganda to get their hands on the illicit goods. In 2019, Ugandan authorities arrested several Vietnamese nationals with ivory concealed in trucks that transport goods for export. The EIA, which investigates environmental crimes, said authorities need to do more than just seizing contraband to tackle wildlife poaching and trafficking. “There has got to be follow-up investigation in the country where the goods are supposed to be sold, and where the goods came from,” said Mr Justin Gosling, a law enforcement and criminal justice consultant. East Africa’s wildlife helps draw more than 5 million tourists every year to Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania, providing jobs and contributing significantly to their gross domestic product. Experts said South Sudan, with its pristine nature, stunning landscapes and rich biodiversity, has great potential for wildlife tourism too. This can help boost the nation’s economy and its population, of which the United Nations estimate 80 per cent live below the absolute poverty line. However, that would depend on the nation's efforts to protect its wildlife and stamp out poaching, as fears of extinction for many species – including its elephants – hang in the balance.

    "article_content": "World World Squeezed into smaller areas, some of these animals die after they end up roaming just outside of the highly populated city of Los Angeles. This audio is generated by an AI tool. WASHINGTON: Mountain lions in California are under threat from problems like wildfires and loss of habitat, and a massive effort is underway to try and keep them out of harm’s way. Even though they are a protected species, there are now less than 4, 500 mountain lions - also known as cougars or pumas - in the whole of California. Only a dozen are left in the Santa Monica Mountains. These animals inhabit diverse habitat types across California, including temperate redwood forest, foothills and mountains. But they are losing their habitat as humans encroach on these spaces. Squeezed into smaller areas, some end up roaming just outside of the highly populated city of Los Angeles. Some are killed by cars on highways as they try to move around. “So if you're trying to wander to find food or mates or shelter in an area where you have to cross some of the world's busiest freeways, it's not a good scenario,” said Beth Pratt, California regional executive director at the United States’ National Wildlife Federation. “And indeed, what the National Park Service research over two decades has shown is these guys are going to literally vanish from this landscape if we don't do something.” Wildfires are also becoming more frequent in North America due to heat and drought linked to climate change. US Forest Service data released in June showed that more than 115 million people, which is more than a third of the US population, now live in areas facing high wildfire risk across the country. Species like mountain lions have died in such fires because they cannot escape the raging heat. One solution, expected to be the largest wildlife crossing in the world, is on an accelerated timeline. A 65m bridge funded by both the public and private sectors is being built above the 101-Freeway in Agoura Hills. The top of the structure will be covered in about half a hectare of native vegetation, including coastal sage scrub and oak savannah. The bridge will allow a wide range of species from monarch butterflies to mountain lions to escape fires, and get from one habitat area to another that would otherwise be cut off. The bridge has given hope that a fractured biodiversity hotspot is being reconnected. “I am convinced connectivity is key to climate resiliency, to the biodiversity collapse. We need connected and healthy ecosystems,” said Pratt. “We used to write off our space. Our human space is appropriate for wildlife. The number one threat to wildlife worldwide is loss of habitat,” she added. The Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, named after a philanthropist who helped fund it, cannot come soon enough. The US Southwest has already had a heatwave in the first week of June, with temperatures topping 43 degrees Celsius, more than four degrees higher than usual. Things may get worse, with the US National Weather Service warning that summer that is expected to last till September is likely to be hotter than normal. The northeast of the country is also likely to be drier in many places, increasing the risk of wildfires.

South Africa currently produces around 60,000 tonnes of game meat a year. (Photo: AFP/Marco Longari) BELA BELA, South Africa: Carcasses of impala, kudu and wildebeest hang from a slaughterhouse rail, ready to be turned into steaks, sausages and burger patties of the kind South Africa wants to see more of on the dinner table. The abattoir in Bela Bela, north of Johannesburg, is among only a handful in the country dedicated to game meat. Authorities say the untapped sector could create jobs and help preserve wildlife - while pleasing the palates of climate- and health-conscious meat eaters. \"We want to add a dimension into your dinner plate by giving you an organic game meat from the wild,\" Khorommbi Matibe, the environment ministry's biodiversity economy chief, told AFP. A top wildlife tourism destination, South Africa produces around 60,000 tonnes of game meat a year - equivalent in weight to roughly 60,000 giraffes. But only a fraction ends up in butcheries and supermarkets. Ninety per cent is hunted and consumed informally, according to the government. Even less is exported. In 2019, just over 3,000 tonnes of ostrich, crocodile and zebra were shipped to the European Union, China and the UAE, it said. Authorities would like to serve up much more. In March, they said they want to grow the sector from 4.6 billion rand (US$250 million) in 2020 to 27.6 billion rand by 2036, adopting a strategy published late last year. With unemployment sitting at 32.9 per cent nationally, this could create jobs in rural, economically deprived areas. Matibe said there are good reasons for barbecuing more springboks. Game animals release less methane - a greenhouse gas - than cattle, whose burps are a top source of global warming emissions from agriculture. Foraging in the wild, their meat is, by definition, free-range and lean. A 2023 study by researchers at Stellenbosch University found that zebra meat, in particular, was highly nutritious and very low in fat. Eating more of it could also help conservation efforts, the government argues. South Africa has long adopted a market-oriented approach to conservation, based on the belief that farmers have a better incentive to look after wildlife if they can profit from it. Critics say the model exploits and commoditises animals. But it has proved largely successful. The country's wildlife population has grown from about 500,000 in the 1960s to more than 20 million today. About 80 per cent is in private game reserves that attract tourists and hunters. Some meat could come from the hundreds of herbivores that are culled every year to keep numbers within sustainable levels, the government says. And it wants to convert one million hectares of communal land to game meat production, which could boost black ownership in a sector where, 30 years after the end of apartheid, more than 94 per cent of operators are white males, said Matibe. Requiring little equipment, game has \"really low\" input costs - an advantage for newcomers, added Darren Horner, owner of producer Aloes Meat. Yet, in a country mad for barbecue, locally known as braai, little currently ends on the grill. This is partially due to the belief that game is less tender than beef and tastes unusual, according to the strategy, which envisages marketing campaigns to boost consumption. \"Our grandmothers used to stuff it with bacon and leave it in red wine for three days to get rid of that wild taste. To me it only needs a bit of olive oil and salt,\" said Charl de Villiers, head of Game SA, an industry group. There are other hurdles. Authorities plan to draw up quality standards so that all meat can be traced to the source and trusted by supermarkets and restaurants. But these can't be too stringent or risk scaring away informal producers, said Horner. Meanwhile, exports of cloven-hoofed animals to Europe have been banned for years as South Africa struggles to contain outbreaks of the foot and mouth disease that farmers blame on inadequate border controls. State laboratories to test meat are small and outdated, which further limits export potential, producers say. De Villiers currently has to ship his ostrich meat to Britain for testing, which increases costs. Stephen Nel, owner of the Camo Meat abattoir in Bela Bela, said he applied for an export licence in 2017 but has since given up on it. \"It was a very big disappointment for me. The government failed us,\" Nel said, wearing khaki shorts and a matching shirt inside his refrigerated facility. About 4,000 animals a year are skinned, weighed, deboned, processed and packaged there. Almost all are brought in by hunters keen on eating some of their prey. Expanding production to supply supermarkets would require investments, but these are hard to come by, amid scepticism around the sector's potential, he said. The government has been talking about growth for over a decade, but \"nothing gets laid down\", said Nel. Yet, Matibe is confident the strategy will soon start to bring results and will remain on track even after elections in May that forced the ruling African National Congress to form a coalition government. \"In the next three years, we should be able to see a ramp up of this product coming to the market,\" he said.

    "article_content": "World World Observers say state authorities are intentionally delaying the establishment of a koala sanctuary due to carbon credits. This audio is generated by an AI tool. BELLINGEN, New South Wales: A tug of war between conservationists, the timber industry and state authorities is threatening the survival of one of Australia’s most iconic and beloved creatures – the koala. The New South Wales government has pledged to open a national park on the mid-north coast, covering thousands of hectares, for the state’s dwindling koala population. But a report by public policy think tank The Australia Institute claimed authorities are deliberately stalling the opening of the sanctuary. It said the government wants to first secure another way to make money from the trees before putting an end to logging and land clearing, which involves exploiting the forest for carbon credits. Environmental groups have warned that koalas in New South Wales could be extinct in the wild by 2050 unless there is urgent intervention. Two years ago, they were classified by the Australian government as an endangered species in the state, as well as in Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. While estimates of how many koalas live in the wild vary because they sit high in the trees and are difficult to spot, scientists believe its population along the nation’s east coast has halved over the past 20 years. They are under threat from a loss of habitat and countless other problems, including climate change, logging, road traffic, disease and bushfires. The Black Summer bushfires of 2019 and 2020 – one of Australia’s most catastrophic fire seasons on record – killed an estimated 5,000 koalas and affected almost a quarter of their habitats in New South Wales. The Great Koala National Park – comprising existing national park and public forest land – was proposed to provide a safe haven and protect the tree-dwelling marsupial. However, progress has been slow, with observers accusing state authorities of intentionally delaying the park’s establishment. “A big reason for the delay and the gazetting of the park is that the government wants to monetise the trees for carbon credits,” said Mr Stephen Long, a senior fellow at The Australia Institute. “It doesn’t want to gazette the park until it’s got a carbon credit method in place and approved.” At a budget estimates meeting in the New South Wales parliament in October last year, state premier Chris Minns hinted he would not halt the felling of trees until he was certain of a scheme for carbon offsets. He said then: “There are many governments and countries around the world who are desperate for carbon offsets and we’ll be looking at jurisdictions like New South Wales in relation to that.” The state government owns the Forestry Corporation, which in turn runs the timber industry. While logging has been temporarily suspended, conservationists fear it could resume at any moment. Some local activists have set up barricades to deter loggers. “We’re here to stop equipment from getting into the forest,” Ms Gill Everett, a member of the Bellingen Activist Network, told CNA on the side of a road leading into a forest, where advocates have set up tents, foldable chairs and anti-logging signs. “My day started at about 5am. I left home this morning to be here at 6am because we thought there was forestry equipment coming in.” Fellow activist Anne Coyle, who has lived in the area for the past four decades, said she is determined to stop logging lorries from driving into the parks because she believes there is so much at stake. “The koala is at the absolute brink. This is our last chance. If we don’t make the most of this chance, it’s all over for the koala,” she said. Advocates said that delays affecting the opening of the sanctuary will lead to serious consequences for the long-term survival of koalas. Susie Russell, vice president of conservation group North Coast Environment Council, said she believes the problems facing the species are symbolic of a much greater existential threat. “If the koala goes extinct, we can expect a whole range of other species to become extinct,” she added. “Ultimately that will lead to the collapse of society as we know it. So, if we can’t save the koalas, we’re not going to be able to save ourselves.” The Australia Institute’s report concluded that trees should not be monetised. Instead, they – and the animals that call Australia’s forests home – need to be protected. “The koala is an endangered species that is dear to the hearts of Australians and people all over the world,” said Mr Long. “It would be a tragedy of immense proportions if koalas were allowed to die out in the wild.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Improving the recycling situation may hinge on the younger generation, experts said. File photo of a recycling bin in Singapore (Photo: CNA/Javier Lim) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Contamination by food waste is one of the biggest challenges in recycling in Singapore, said an industry player. One contaminated recycling bin has the potential to ruin several batches of items because they all go into the same truck, said Mr Derek Chong, senior manager of operations at Chye Thiam Maintenance, which provides recycling services. “If we are collecting recyclables from 10 different locations … once that one single contaminant goes in, it contaminates the entire 10 batches,” he said. “For example, the gravy from your leftover food, the chilli sauce, these are food waste contaminants … Once that is mixed with recyclables, the recyclables cannot be used.” The overall recycling rate in Singapore declined from 62 per cent to 52 per cent over the last decade, according to the National Environment Agency’s (NEA) latest statistics on waste and recycling. Domestic recycling rate remained at 12 per cent. Under Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan, the country aims to increase its overall recycling rate to 70 per cent by 2030. Associate Professor Johan Sulaeman, director of the National University of Singapore’s Sustainable and Green Finance Institute, urged people to take recycling more seriously. “Please pay close attention to what you are actually trying to recycle. Don't just throw trash into the recycling bin,” he said. He noted that recycling in Singapore is quite convenient. “People just need to know that it's that easy,” he added. Despite the declining recycling rate, there was some good news in NEA’s report. The domestic waste generated per capita – collected from households and trade premises such as schools and hawker centres – decreased by more than 15 per cent over the past decade. Assoc Prof Sulaeman said this means people are more efficient in their consumption of resources. “That means that we are wasting less of the resources. I don't think people are consuming less, but I think we are now consuming more efficiently and I think that's crucial as well,” he said. Consuming less is another way to help the environment, he added. “(By) reducing waste, we can recycle less because we don't have waste to recycle to begin with,” he said. On top of having a goal for recycling rates, there should be a goal on total waste consumption, he added. Both Mr Chong and Assoc Prof Sulaeman stressed that awareness and education hinge on the young. “In schools, we must learn to teach our younger generation what's the proper recycling method, what are things we should not be throwing into the recycling bin because one person can cause the whole recycling bin to be damaged, and not be used,” said Mr Chong. Assoc Prof Sulaeman noted that the younger generation will have a longer runway to benefit the society through recycling and the reduction of resource usage. They can also help to educate the older generation, he said. “It’s very difficult to change the way you live and your lifestyle. But I think there is still a way for the younger generation to affect the mindset of the older generation and change their behaviour,” he said. The non-domestic recycling rate decreased to 67 per cent from 72 per cent in 2022. One firm that has been trying to do its part in improving these rates is Marina Bay Sands. Among its food waste reduction initiatives is a food waste tracking technology, which uses artificial intelligence to analyse the type and volume of food waste. “It's also mobile, so our chef can move it around the meeting venues, and then they can (review) the type of food waste and adjust the portion in the future,” said Ms Meridith Beaujean, the integrated resort’s executive director of sustainability. Using technology, MBS is able to transform 8,500kg of daily food waste into non-potable water or a high calorific substrate that can potentially be used as soil fertiliser or insect feed, she said. The resort also works with a Singapore company to upcycle and recycle used chopsticks which are turned into, among other things, menu cubes. Assoc Prof Sulaeman said that recycling is a joint effort. “A person may not make a difference, but if nobody makes a difference, then no difference will happen. Everybody will have to put in their small but important … contribution to the society,” he said. “I hope that everybody will have that sense of community to respond to this call of increasing the rate of recycling because even a small difference makes a huge difference when you're aggregating across the island.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Sauna culture is booming in Japan, with devotees endorsing its physical and mental health benefits, says Gearoid Reidy for Bloomberg Opinion. While public bathhouses have been in decline for decades, saunas are surging in Japan. (Photo: iStock/Dimensions) This audio is generated by an AI tool. TOKYO: In Japan, saunas suddenly seem everywhere. On Instagram, influencers and actors appeared to visit them daily, and the app was bombarding me with ads for mountain retreats with cold-plunge pools. Several friends who are dedicated “saunners” (a Japanese-English word used to refer to sauna devotees) insisted I give it a try. Local media speak of a “sauna boom” as they once had of the “tapioca boom”, with facilities popping up in central Tokyo just as bubble tea stores had before the pandemic, during a brief and intense social-media-inspired infatuation with the Taiwanese drink . Public bathhouses have been in decline for decades, with the number of sento baths in Tokyo dropping by nearly half in the last 15 years. By comparison, saunas are surging, with more than 12,000 facilities listed on leading portal site Sauna Ikitai. For old bathhouses that can afford the capital investment, steam room facilities are helping some to stay afloat. Finnish equipment makers are eagerly eyeing Japan as a growth market. It’s been suggested that steam rooms have perhaps taken golf’s place for clearing the minds of executives before they conduct multibillion-dollar deals. This sauna boom is the country’s third, according to experts, after the country first discovered the joys of getting sweaty when the facilities were first built in the athletes’ village for Finnish competitors at the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. The practice enjoyed a revival in the 1990s, when large bathhouses known as “super sento” became popular, usually featuring a steam room or two. A key difference in this growth period is the proliferation of rituals that newcomers can follow, based on Finnish customs of cycling between intense heat, cold-bath immersion, a break in fresh air, then repeat. This is aimed at achieving the state of totonou - a buzzy word for contentment and clarity achieved, caused by the release of norepinephrine and endorphins. The Japanese tend to like this kind of practice, this “correct” way of doing things - think of the traditional ceremony of drinking matcha green tea, the right way to wear kimonos or indeed the frequently unspoken rules of public bathing etiquette. Online guides dictate how much time one needs to spend in a sauna of what temperature (between 80 and 100 degrees Celsius, or 176 to 212 Fahrenheit), how long to endure the heat before subjecting oneself to a cold plunge, as well as the correct number of times to repeat the cycle to achieve totonou. A bewildering array of terms transmogrified into Japanese from various European languages, from aufguss to loyly, create the impression of a sophisticated hobby, like wine collecting, that rewards dedication and study. In the English-speaking West, sauna culture seems the province of meatheaded podcast bros and overbearing tech entrepreneurs. Not so in Japan, where polls indicate it’s equally as popular with women as men. Friends recommended it not for its physical health benefits, but for the mental, with one acquaintance going so far as to liken totonou to getting high. In search of psychological clarity, if nothing else, I visited one of the trendy new facilities in Tokyo’s Shibuya district. I followed the rituals as written: Ten minutes or so in the sauna; a minute in the cold plunge pool; another quarter of an hour taking in fresh air and awaiting inspiration. Nothing happened. I felt as likely to catch a cold as find inner peace. Was the sauna not hot enough? Had I chickened out of the frigid bath too early? I needed to go further. I reached out to the man most directly responsible for the recent craze, manga artist Katsuki Tanaka. He began writing about saunas in 2009, having become hooked on the experience after joining his local gym, and copying what he saw others do. His columns eventually became a collection of essays entitled Sado, a play on the word for tea ceremony, but using a different character to mean “The Way of the Sauna”. That became a hit comic book and in 2019 was turned into a TV show, all of which helped inspire the current trend. In the process, he popularised the sauna rituals and coined the word totonou. Then came COVID-19, which turbocharged the need for facilities where people could get away from life’s cares. “Spending so much time at home, surrounded by information on computers and smartphones, unable to go abroad, makes people want an experience that will satisfy your five senses,” Tanaka says. “Our lifestyles have hugely changed in the last few years.\" That, he says, is the reason for a similar boom in camping. The need for relaxation might also be behind a recent surge in shisha bars serving waterpipe tobacco. I posited that one reason for the particular popularity in Japan might be the lack of other highs, legal or otherwise, that the nation’s drug laws ensure. The country’s ban on cannabis remains steadfast, though times are changing. Next year, the government plans to permit its medical use. Curiously, many CBD products are legal in Japan, hailed for their relaxing effects. (Products made from the high-inducing THC are illegal.) Inspired by Tanaka’s explanation - and on deadline for this column, which remained frustratingly incomplete - I sought mental clarity again. Back into the sauna, the cold pool, the fresh air, repeat. Nothing. My mind raced. Deprived of external stimulus, my hands yearned for my smartphone, for Twitter, Reddit, that fleeting dopamine hit. And then, after my third cycle - something! My fidgeting stopped. A strange sense of calm swept over me, a feeling that while I could move, I didn’t need to move. The muscles in my arms and legs twitched involuntarily. My mind went blank; I stopped worrying about my deadline, and with senses heightened, took in the ambient sounds of dripping water and instrumental music. Was this totonou? I’ve no idea. It faded quickly. So too might the sauna boom, just as the boba tea sensation did - streets in Shibuya and nearby Harajuku are now filled with boarded-up tea joints. Saunas are exposed to the risk of rising energy costs, and Japan’s falling real wages are bad news for pricey hobbies, with an average sauna visit costing around 2,000 yen (US$13) - that’s twice the minimum wage, around four times the government-controlled price for sento bathhouses. Some newer facilities can cost 3,000 yen and above. But hopefully they aren’t just a fad. We could all use a little inner peace.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary People who can disconnect from work are happier, healthier and less fatigued, says a Griffith University researcher. This audio is generated by an AI tool. BRISBANE: In the hit dystopian TV series Severance, employees at biotech corporation Lumon Industries find it easy to separate work and home life. A computer chip is inserted in their brains to act as a “mindwipe”. They leave all thoughts of home behind while at work, and completely forget about their work when at home. While the show explores the pitfalls of such a split in consciousness, there’s no denying it’s a tantalising prospect to be able to “flick the off switch” and forget about work whenever you’re not actually supposed to be working . This is known as “psychological detachment”. People who can do it are happier and healthier, and experience less fatigue. But many of us struggle to detach and disconnect mentally from work, particularly when our jobs are demanding and stressful. It may not be enough simply to be physically away from work, particularly in an era when so many of us work from home. We also have to stop thinking about work when we’re not there - whether it’s fretting over your to-do list while out at dinner, thinking about your unanswered emails while you’re at your daughter’s soccer game, or lying in bed pondering what you’ll say at tomorrow’s board meeting. Your choice of activity outside work can be crucial to this process of psychological detachment. To learn more about what strategies are most effective, my research surveyed nurses who were working shifts in hospital emergency departments in 2020, a highly stressful work environment. My colleagues and I collected data from 166 nurses, using a survey called the Recovery Experience Questionnaire. This included collecting information about the underlying psychological experiences associated with home-time activities, such as feeling relaxed while reading a book or going for a walk. Importantly, our survey results also showed nurses who were better able to forget about work had less fatigue and better physical and mental health. Our results identified three key strategies that helped our survey participants to reduce fatigue and mentally recover from work: Exercise, spending time with family and friends, and leisure pursuits. The physical benefits of exercise are well known. But exercising - whether it’s doing yoga, going for a run or playing netball - also brings mental benefits by encouraging you to focus deeply on what you’re doing rather than dwelling on outside thoughts. Friendship and social connection are also good for our well-being. Research suggests people who have plenty of friends and confidants are less likely to die from chronic disease. And one study found people who undertake a difficult task with the help of a friend have fewer abrupt changes in heart rate than those who tackle the task alone. Deliberately making time to spend with family, friends or pets can help us forget about work at home, and to centre our attention instead on what is important to us besides work. Many of the nurses in our study reduced the effects of fatigue during home time by pursuing hobbies and interests such as sewing or gardening. But you shouldn’t worry too much about what specific activity you pursue - the main thing is to pick something you find pleasurable and engaging, and which fits comfortably around your existing commitments. Finally, switching off from work also means not letting your work come home with you. Where possible, complete all your daily tasks so these aren’t on your mind at home. Unplug from work-related technology by not checking work emails or texts. Of course, technology and working from home have now made separating work and home even harder. But setting healthy routines can help put mental as well as physical boundaries around your work time - even when your workplace is in the next room.

The key nutrients in Herbal Pharm's Beta Glucan supplement promote bone health, vision, cognitive development and immunity. Photos: Herbal Pharm, Shutterstock This audio is generated by an AI tool. Struggling to ensure your child gets all the nutrients they need? You’re not alone. Many parents face the challenge of balancing their little one’s picky eating habits with the need for a well-rounded diet that fuels their growth and development. According to HealthHub, it’s recommended that a child’s daily diet includes an array of vitamins such as A, B, C, D, E and K . These nutrients can readily be found in a variety of fruits and vegetables, with many being particularly rich in Vitamins A, C, K and folic acid. Eggs and dairy products are excellent sources of Vitamin B12, while fish is high in Vitamin D. However, between hectic schedules, fussy eaters and the lure of convenient but nutritionally deficient snacks, ensuring your child gets all the goodness they need can feel like a Herculean task. Food allergies and the pressures of modern life can create additional challenges, potentially resulting in inadequate nutritional intake for children. FACTORS THAT AFFECT NUTRITIONAL INTAKE Understanding the myriad factors influencing a child’s nutritional intake is key to addressing dietary gaps and promoting healthy growth. Parents often attribute their children’s aversion to vegetables to their taste buds, but the reason may be more complex. Food neophobia , an apprehension towards new or unfamiliar foods, is common among children aged two to six. This fear often leads them to reject unknown foods, including vegetables. Instead, they tend to gravitate towards sweet flavours and a limited selection of fruits or vegetables they find palatable. Such dietary limitations can significantly restrict their consumption of a broad spectrum of fruits and vegetables, each offering unique nutritional benefits essential during the critical growing years from ages two to 12 . Our contemporary fast-paced lifestyle brings additional challenges, notably an increasing prevalence of anxiety among children. In Singapore, for example, about 12.5 per cent of children aged 6 to 12 exhibit signs of emotional issues and/or behavioural issues. Research from Harvard University states that persistent stress can strain the body’s metabolic demands , depleting nutrient reserves and potentially impeding growth and development. Without a balanced diet, children face the risk of nutrient deficiencies. This connection between emotional well-being and dietary habits underscores the crucial need to address any underlying anxieties. Navigating the dietary needs of children with common food allergies like wheat, soy, peanuts, eggs, shellfish and milk adds another layer of complexity. These allergies pose substantial obstacles in ensuring a balanced intake of essential nutrients. If your children have food allergies, consider consulting a registered dietitian or healthcare professional to help create tailored meal plans that cater to these dietary restrictions. ENHANCING YOUR CHILD’S WELL-BEING THROUGH SUPPLEMENTS While a balanced diet typically provides adequate nutrients for children, there are instances where dietary supplements are beneficial. Herbal Pharm’s Beta Glucan supplement serves to complement the daily meals of children aged three and above, said Ms Logeswari Shivaprakash, chief operating officer of Herbal Pharm . “The supplement enriches their diet with key nutrients like Vitamins D3, A and C, along with Omega-3. These are vital for bone health, vision, immunity and overall well-being. Coupled with our patented Smart Chew technology that improves nutrient absorption, parents can have peace of mind knowing that their children are getting the optimal nutrition to flourish,” she shared. Its key ingredient, beta glucan, is a bioactive polysaccharide found in yeast and mushrooms that supports immune function . Ms Shivaprakash added: “Beta glucan helps keep your gut healthy by balancing the good bacteria in your stomach and strengthening the walls of your intestines.” In addition to its primary ingredient, the supplement contains vitamins and minerals that support growth and development. For instance, Vitamin D3 is included to facilitate calcium absorption, enhance bone health and support immunity. The addition of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an Omega-3 fatty acid, plays a crucial role in cognitive development and visual function . DHA aids in transmitting signals between brain cells, promoting optimal neurological function and potentially reducing the risk of vision-related issues. Another Omega-3 fatty acid beneficial for brain development, cognitive function and memory is eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Its anti-inflammatory properties may alleviate symptoms of asthma, eczema and allergies, and promote better respiratory and skin health in children . Additionally, Vitamin A is vital for vision and eye health , while Vitamin C bolsters the immune system and may contribute to lower blood pressure . While dietary supplements like beta glucan can enhance a child’s nutrition, it is important to note that they should not be a substitute for a balanced diet and regular exercise. When selecting a supplement, parents should carefully weigh their child’s specific nutritional needs, potential allergies and personal preferences. “Other factors to consider include product efficacy, ingredients (whether they are natural, sugar-free or vegan-friendly) and brand trust. If you believe your child may benefit from supplements, do seek advice from a healthcare professional,” said Ms Shivaprakash. For busy parents seeking to enhance their child’s nutrition, Herbal Pharm’s Beta Glucan supplement offers a convenient solution. The article should not be taken as medical advice or used as a recommendation for any specific treatment or medication. Parents should consult a healthcare professional before introducing new supplements to their child’s diet.

PUTRAJAYA: Malaysian celebrity chef Datuk Redzuawan Ismail, also known as Chef Wan, was ordered to pay RM150,000 (US$31,800) in damages to his former Irish son-in-law over defamatory social media posts. The Malaysian Court of Appeal on Thursday (Jun 20) overturned a High Court's ruling earlier in 2023 that alleged statements made by the chef were not defamatory of former son-in-law Gavin Edward O’Luanaigh. Chef Wan was ordered to pay RM150,000 in general, aggravated and exemplary damages to O’Luanaigh, and RM40,000 in costs for proceedings in the High Court and Court of Appeal. O’Luanaigh, whose Muslim name is Salahudin Ghaffar, was married to Chef Wan’s actress daughter, Serina Redzuawan, in 2010 before their divorce in August 2017. He filed a suit in February 2021 claiming that eight social media posts by Chef Wan were defamatory against him and his present wife. In his statement of defence then, Chef Wan said the statements published in the postings were based on facts and were made without malicious intent. On May 11, 2023, the Shah Alam High Court partly allowed O’Luanaigh’s claim for an injunction to restrain Chef Wan from publishing any libellous and false allegations against him. The celebrity chef was also ordered to remove all eight posts on social media which were allegedly defamatory. However, the judge then ruled that the statements were not defamatory of O’Luanaigh and were not published with malicious intent. Chef Wan on Thursday was also granted a perpetual injunction prohibiting the chef from publishing defamatory statements about O’Luanaigh. He will also have to pay an interest of five per cent per annum from the date of the filing of the writ of summons until the final settlement of the judgment sum.

    "article_content": "Health Matters Health Matters Still the leading cause of cancer deaths among women in Singapore, doctors are helping victims overcome odds even in the face of aggressive triple negative breast cancer. Breast cancer is linked to hormone receptors and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein, or Her2. Breast cancer is the leading cause of death among Singaporean women, accounting for roughly 30 per cent of all cancers diagnosed in women. The occurrence of breast cancer is linked to hormone receptors and a protein known as Her2 – the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. About 70 to 80 per cent of breast cancer cells express hormone receptors, commonly known as estrogen and progesterone receptors, while about 20-25 per cent of breast cancer cells express Her2 receptors. “Her2 receptors are proteins that promote cancer cell growth”, explains Dr Wong Chiung Ing, a Medical Oncologist at Parkway Cancer Centre. While conventional treatments such as chemotherapy are still sought to combat breast cancer, it is now also possible to destroy the cells with greater precision. “We now have targeted therapy that targets this protein (Her2), interferes with the pathway, stops the tumour progression and therefore promotes cancer cell death” says Dr Wong. She goes on to add that “targeted therapy can be combined with chemotherapy to have even more effective control on cancer cell growth.” Signs of Breast Cancer, Apparent and Hidden The most common tell-tale sign of breast cancer is a breast lump that is painful, hard and will not go away. The breast may be swollen as well because of this. Other symptoms may include nipple inversion or nipple discharge which could be bloody or coloured. Breast cancer can also cause skin changes, including dimpling or puckering of the skin. However, the bigger problem for doctors and patients alike lies beneath the skin, in the 15 per cent of breast cancer cells that do not exhibit either hormone or Her2 receptors. This is known as a triple negative breast cancer. Immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy has shown promising results in treating triple-negative breast cancer. “Triple negative breast cancer tends to be more aggressive and have a higher chance of recurrence, as there is no target to treat in triple negative breast cancer” says Dr Wong. Treating Triple Negative Breast Cancer Conventional treatment that involves surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been the main course of action in treating this strain of cancer so far. However, as Dr Wong points out, “recent studies using immunotherapy in treating triple negative breast cancers show very promising results.” Immunotherapy activates the body's own immune system to recognise and destroy cancer cells. “This gives hope to this group of patients where treatment options are often limited.” It is therefore imperative for patients to have the breast cancer cells tested for appropriate targets. “Through testing, we can provide the most comprehensive treatment”, says Dr Wong.

    "article_content": "Health Matters Health Matters To face fears and live life as normal, involves a mental and physical battle that both family and cancer survivor journey together. Nancy Tsang was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer just before her 60th birthday. “I ran away to a gym and did a yoga class… I was crying. I mean, it seems like the world is still moving on, but my own is going to tumble down” recalls Nancy Tsang of the day her life changed. It was March 2014, about a month shy of her 60th birthday. Although she had recovered fully from a bout of diarrhoea a few months ago, Nancy felt something was still amiss. On her doctor’s advice, Nancy went for a colonoscopy. It revealed the devastating truth. “There’s a tumour in my colon. And judging from the size, my doctor suspected that the cancer may have spread…” recounts Nancy, who was immediately sent by the specialist to undergo a CT scan. The results, the cancer in the colon had spread to the liver. “Once your cancer has moved to other organs, it’s regarded as stage four. And that means it’s quite dangerous. So, I was really, very shocked… I feared my life is going to end soon”. Life Goes on Having led an active and healthy lifestyle which included regular gym sessions at least three times a week, Nancy’s immediate reaction was to shut out those who cared and were worried about her. “I need a moment on my own” she told her son, passing on the call from her concerned sister in Hong Kong as she ran off to the gym. Embracing the exercise rhythm helped Nancy clear her mind and face reality. “The world goes on, life goes on, so why shouldn’t I?” she reasoned. With that outlook, Nancy took on the battle to overcome her cancer. This involved surgery to remove the tumour in her colon, followed by chemotherapy, which led to minor surgery to place a chemo port. The implant under the skin of Nancy’s upper left chest reduces the many needle pricks to veins that continuous chemotherapy requires, helping to ease the discomfort of patients. A Series of Battles After cancer removal surgery on her colon, and more than two years of chemotherapy which she chose to discontinue due to the side-effects, oncologists treating Nancy had to pursue other means to remedy the cancer that had spread to her lungs. That meant another round of surgery in 2017, although there are other options for treating cancer, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy and radiation therapy. “It’s only when you have cancer, you realise, you don’t really win it like one battle. It is a series of battles because the cancer (does) move to other parts”. “I find I’ve become the bionic woman,” she says laughing heartily. “Because I’ve had operations on my colon, on my liver and on my lungs… I don’t know whether I still have parts to be cut.” Nancy has clearly had the works, and more than once. But she remains unfazed. Happiness is … Nancy has now found a routine to live as normally as she can, playing golf twice-weekly, travelling abroad and meeting friends for lunch, that may sometimes include a good steak, which she enjoys. “It’s only when you go through the difficulty… you realise that happiness is just having a lunch with your kids, with your friends…” Nancy’s cancer has also served as an eye-opener and a source of inspiration for her only son, Hadrian. “Seeing my mother kind of, fight for her life and try to figure out how to live on, made me realise… In the worst-case scenario, people still try to make the best that they can. And if a cancer patient can do that, then why can't all of us, right?” he says emphatically. The 33-year-old was primed for a career-advancing overseas posting when Nancy was first diagnosed with cancer. He turned down the posting and made a career change as well. “When my mother was pretty ill, when she couldn’t sleep, we ended up watching a lot more television” he recalls. “When she felt better, we used to go for walks, sometimes we’d play a bit of sports.” But it’s not just about spending more time together, as Hadrian explains. “For your physical health to recover, you also need to be in a good place mentally. When my mother was in a good mood… Then she could also fight harder…” Knowing that she was not alone, did help Nancy in her effort to live with cancer. “There are times when you are in pain and you are fighting through the medicine’s side effects, you really hate the whole process” says Nancy as she fights back tears with a brave smile. “But with people coming to you, calling you, showing their love… You find strength.” Embracing a fearless attitude, Nancy Tsang finds strength to battle stage four cancer. A Holistic Recovery Path Nancy has had a quarter of her lungs removed but still, every morning finds her at the Singapore Botanic Gardens, working out to boost her energy and lung functions. “I walk, I do some exercise and I really feel good about it.” In August 2020, Nancy had another operation to remove cancer spots in the liver and bile duct. Since then, her cancer has been in remission. It’s been tumultuous for the 68-year-old who lost her much-loved husband, survived a traumatising traffic accident and battled cancer, all within the same span of time. “Cancer is like a warning...” she muses. “I mean, there’s no need to worry so much, because things will just come when it is time, and no matter what you do… they cannot be changed” she chuckles. “So, all the more I should be happy and really… live my life”. Nancy admits that it’s “very horrible to have stage four cancer”. And her never-give-up attitude that she hopes will serve as an inspiration to others, comes from the most important lesson she’s learnt. It is, “not to be afraid”.

    "article_content": "Health Matters Health Matters CAR T-cell therapy unlocks the potential of the body’s immune system to beat advanced blood cancers. Dr Dawn Mya Hae Tha (right) says CAR T-cell therapy can be used to treat patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Stimulating the body’s immune system to fight cancer, is increasingly the treatment choice of oncologists in treating patients. One breakthrough treatment for hard-to-beat blood cancers is CAR T-cell therapy. This treatment received approval for use in Singapore in 2021 and the country remains the only place in Southeast Asia to have approved CAR T-cell centres. New Hope for Better Outcomes CAR T-cell therapy is defined by Dr Dawn Mya Hae Tha as “a form of immunotherapy as well as targeted cell therapy”. “It is an individualised and personalised treatment for patients with a type of lymphoma called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma” says the Haematologist at Parkway Cancer Centre (PCC). “Also, children and young adults up to 25 years of age with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia” she adds, are candidates for the complex course of this new treatment. Dr Mya explains that the option to use CAR T-cell therapy is considered only when the patient’s cancer is still not in remission following at least two lines of therapy, including stem cell transplantation. According to Dr Colin Phipps Diong who leads the Haematology team at PCC, before the introduction of CAR T-cell therapy, there was no other viable treatment option, and patients would succumb to their blood cancer. For eligible patients, says the senior consultant, “CAR T-cell therapy offers hope”. How CAR T-cell therapy Works The key to the treatment is the cancer patients’ own T-cells, which is a type of white blood cell that works to kill diseases. However, unlike common infections, cancer cells often behave differently. “Cancers, including blood cancers are usually able to hide from the immune system … the body's T-cells may have difficulty recognising and attacking blood cancer cells” explains Dr Diong. The treatment therefore genetically engineers the person’s T-cells to attack cancer cells. At PCC in Singapore, the treatment is first carried out as an inpatient procedure that lasts for some 3-4 hours, where cancer patients have their T-cells collected through apheresis using a specialised machine. Saving lives by treating previously incurable blood cancers with CAR T-cell therapy. The cryopreserved T-cells will be sent to the United States, where a receptor gene known as the Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) is added to the cells. This receptor enables the T-cells to attach to cancer cells with the corresponding antigen, allowing the new CAR T-cells to recognise and destroy cancer cells. In short, as Dr Diong summarises, “engineering the patient’s own immune cells to kill a specific, intended target”. After some 3-6 weeks, the modified cells that arrive in Singapore will be ready for the cancer patients who have to first undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy. “This is not to kill cancer cells, but immune cells … that might interfere with the functions of CAR T-cells when infused” points out Dr Mya. Only after that, cancer patients will be able to receive the genetically engineered T-cells through CAR T-cell infusion. Suitable Cancer Patients for CAR T-Cell Therapy CAR T-cell therapy is not an option for any cancer patient. Doctors also need to assess the patient to determine if the person is both physically and psychologically prepared to undergo the treatment. The primary doctor has to present each case in detail to a team of haematologists during regular transplant meetings. This is important, says Dr Diong, as the entire team will “weigh the risks and benefits”. Apart from the team of haematologists, CAR T-cell therapy treatments will involve a specialised team, from apheresis nurses to transplant coordinators and more. All must work together and even pass audits that a CAR T-cell centre must maintain to remain operational. Dr Mya recognises the role of the multidisciplinary team in managing potential side effects of CAR T-cell therapy, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The reintroduced CAR T-cells multiplying in the body can release large amounts of chemicals called cytokines into the blood, explains the haematologist. These inflammatory molecules can cause symptoms like fever, aches and pains and in severe cases, lead to low blood pressure and breathing difficulties. As Dr Diong also points out, “CRS can be a fatal condition”. Therefore, a multidisciplinary team approach that combines expertise, is key in managing patients undergoing treatment. Patient Outcomes of CAR T-cell Therapy As the therapy is new, patient follow-ups have not reached the common five years milestone. However, based on clinical trials, Dr Mya notes that outcomes with CAR T-cell therapy have “tremendously improved”. “In children with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia… with CAR T-cell therapy, the overall survival is now more than 60 per cent after two years of follow up. \"So, now we can expect a much higher chance of cure for these patients” she says.

    "article_content": "Health Matters Health Matters Singapore welcomes proton radiation therapy for more precise tumour targeting. Proton beam therapy is commonly administered five times a week. In 1984, the supernatural comedy film franchise ‘Ghostbusters’ introduced to masses the idea of using proton energy to battle unwanted, ghastly appearances. Cancer, some may say, can be described in the same way. So, here is how fact and fiction which can sometimes be like two sides of the same coin, collide. The particle accelerator of moviedom did exist. It was built in 1929 in a California radiation laboratory. Two decades later, experts proposed the idea of using proton energy for medical treatments, leading to the first use of proton beams in 1954 to control metastatic breast cancer. What’s It All About? Radiotherapy is the use of ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells. “In the curative-intent setting, radiotherapy can be used to downstage cancer prior to surgery, as adjuvant treatment after surgery, or as definitive treatment with or without chemotherapy”, says Dr Wong Siew Wei. The medical oncologist at Parkway Cancer Centre adds that radiotherapy plays a part in palliative care too, particularly in the “treatment of symptomatic sites of cancer spread such as bone or brain metastasis”. To target tumours, a radiation oncologist would first have to assess the suitability of a patient, as well as both the type and technique of radiotherapy. Conventional radiotherapy involves the use of X-rays. “Conventional X-rays hit a tumour but don’t stop. They pass through the tumour and exit the body on the opposite side, causing damage on the way out as well,” explains Dr Lee Kuo Ann, radiation oncologist at Parkway Cancer Centre. On the other hand, in proton beam therapy, the protons will travel through tissues to land at the localised site of the tumour. Controlling Collateral Damage Proton therapy, which is painless and commonly an outpatient treatment that lasts between 15 to 30 minutes per session, targets tumours using positively charged subatomic particles. It is usually administered a few times over a single week or even a few months, depending on the patient’s condition and treatment needs. When deployed, it targets cancer cells and tumours with greater precision. “We pre-calculate the speed of the protons so that they land in the tumour where they deposit all their energy, a phenomenon known as the Bragg peak, with nothing coming out on the other side”, says Dr Lee. According to Dr Wong, the main advantage of proton therapy over conventional radiotherapy is the wider safety margin. There are also more opportunities to treat cancers located near critical structures. This includes sensitive areas such as the eyes, brain, heart and spinal cord. “One potential application is the treatment of large liver cancer that has spread into a major vein” he says. “Current locally directed treatment options… that involve the injection of therapeutics directly into the liver blood supply may not be suitable for every patient” points out Dr Wong who lists anatomical constraints or underlying comorbidities as some of the reasons. However, he adds “there is a growing body of evidence primarily from Japan supporting the use of proton therapy in this group of patients.” Proton beam therapy is revolutionising radiotherapy with increased precision and reduced collateral damage. Proton’s Precision for Better Tumour Control Radiation oncologists such as Dr Lee, often work closely with medical oncologists like Dr Wong, surgeons and different specialists, to decide the ideal treatment for each patient. Proton therapy could benefit those who require treatment near sensitive areas such as the eyes, brain, heart and spinal cord. Using the treatment of head and neck cancers to further illustrate the point, Dr Lee highlights that conventional X-ray radiation exposes the mouth, throat and salivary glands to scattered doses. This could lead to dry mouth and swallowing problems down the road, he adds. But he’s confident that with proton therapy being more focused, “we will be able to improve patients’ quality of life”.

    "article_content": "Health Matters Health Matters A curable cancer can be the catalyst for better physical and mental health. Cancer survivor Yu Poh Leng teaches aqua aerobics to other breast cancer survivors. Amid splashes of pool water and laughter, Yu Poh Leng’s voice pierces through the blaring up-tempo music, “3, 2, 1… Catch your breath, very good!” Filled with energy, she barely breaks a sweat at a poolside 10 storeys high, where she leads eight women in an aqua aerobics class. The exercise playlist loops into the song “Titanium” sung by Sia. The lyrics about never falling in the face of adversity is somewhat fitting. That’s because every single one of the women at the pool, including Poh Leng, is a breast cancer survivor. “Teaching aqua aerobics… can be physically quite tiring but it’s very rewarding,” she says. “By giving my time to the survivors, I gain a lot more… and what they’ve gone through, that impacts me and that inspires me”. Drenched in sunlight, Poh Leng’s now tanned skin hides more than blemishes, it hides a different past. Stressing on Cancer Before cancer struck, Poh Leng didn’t make time for exercise, or even swimming, which she’s been passionate about since childhood. The self-proclaimed workaholic was intent on building her career in public relations. “It’s not healthy… and I didn’t take care of my body,” she admits while reflecting on her past. “I was working… 25 hours a day, if there’s such a thing”. According to Dr See Hui Ti, a medical oncologist at Parkway Cancer Centre, about 40 per cent of cancer is induced by diet and lifestyle. Drawing on 18 years of experience, the senior consultant points out, “some patients with very aggressive breast cancer … they are often perfectionists, often type A (personalities), and often very worried about the littlest things”. “With that happening, their stress hormone, cortisol, is often very high and that leads to low immunity which then doesn’t really help in helping them fight the cancer.” However, proving a cause-and-effect relationship between stress and cancer says Dr See, is not as clear-cut as with lung cancer and the number of cigarettes smoked a day, she cites as an example. Screening and Self-examination In October 2019, Poh Leng was diagnosed with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer. “I am a strong believer in mammograms” says Poh Leng who also reveals, “I go for a mammogram screening every year”. Along with regular mammogram screenings, the Singapore Cancer Society recommends a monthly breast self-examination. Following that advice helped Poh Leng detect her cancer, sooner rather than later. “It was between the mammogram sessions when I did my self-examination and I realised I actually had a lump”. Following up with a consultation at a polyclinic and further medical tests, led to her diagnosis. A Holistic Treatment Poh Leng’s cancer treatment lasted for about 12 months. Determined to get better, she began adding regular exercise to her routine, walking almost every other day. “Even during the entire process, during chemo treatment… I continued to exercise because exercise is very important, not just mentally but physically as well”. Poh Leng was not spared the fatigue that comes with chemotherapy nor its other side effects. Loss of appetite, insomnia and even severe heart palpitations afflicted her. Throughout the process, she’d learnt to listen better to her body. “I had good days and bad days. So on good days, I’ll continue to do a lot of walks… exercising at home. So on my bad days, I just rested”. Dr See says that patients both receiving and not receiving chemotherapy, often ask about how much they should exercise. “I tell them actually, the studies have shown that an average office worker would perhaps do about 5,000 to 7,000 steps if they were to take the public transport. But recent studies have shown that perhaps even 10,000 steps a day is not enough”. She adds that “15,000 steps or one hour and half a day of active activity is better for reducing cancer risks”. For Poh Leng, exercise walking progressed to jogging and in time, more activities like swimming were added. “I increased my intensity as I was getting better,” she adds. Eating right was also on Poh Leng’s mind to overcome cancer. However, she found that while advice was plenty, they were often unwarranted. “If I were to follow all the dietary advice that people gave, I would not be eating anything at all, or just be drinking water and living on love”. She therefore focused on her doctor’s dietary advice. Dr See says that while she recommends dietary change to patients who may need it, she states that getting everyone to follow a one-size-fits-all diet is not plausible. “Focusing on nutrition rather than calorie count,” she stresses, plays a part in greatly reducing the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Rehabilitation through Aqua Aerobics With a referral letter from her doctor, Poh Leng signed up for a cancer rehabilitation programme with the Singapore Cancer Society (SCS). There, she met a lymphedema therapist who advised that water sports are very good for breast cancer survivors because of the pressure that helps with the lymph circulation. Lymph nodes in the area surrounding the breast and armpit are sometimes removed during breast cancer surgery. That means that while water therapy could be helpful for such patients in general, it may not be suitable for some, including those with open wounds, active lymphedema flares and skin irritation due to chlorine exposure. For Poh Leng, the therapist’s words triggered a eureka moment. Inspired by her mental and physical improvements after making lifestyle changes while battling cancer, Yu Poh Leng motivates cancer-survivors to adopt a healthier journey through life. Soon she was teaching aqua aerobics to 12 other breast cancer survivors. Dr See says that patients who can maintain the healthy lifestyle habits they adopt when battling cancer even after their recovery can potentially improve their quality and quantity of life. “Having a curable breast cancer has saved their lives. Henceforth, they’re going to be even more interested in their health… such that not only will they reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence, they will go on to be healthier, from their cardiovascular and to emotional health aspects”. Poh Leng has now expanded to teaching aqua aerobics to people from various walks of life, including seniors and persons with disabilities. It’s a lifestyle change that’s made her healthier. “I’m a lot stronger physically after cancer… you should have seen my old photos, I looked so bad,” she insists. “I exercise a lot more, and I’ve lost quite a fair bit of weight as well”. The 57-year-old has also chosen to slow down on her previous career, limiting herself to just five to 10 hours a month in a consultancy role. Instead, she conducts more aqua aerobics classes that give her a different sense of accomplishment. “I’m thankful for the new lease of life that I have and make sure that I actually contribute a lot more back”. With the change she’s leading, Poh Leng wants to create a bigger impact. “My dream is to introduce this sport to more people, to teach them the merits of it, to teach them self-care… so that they can actually go to the pools and actually exercise for their own health”.

    "article_content": "Health Matters Health Matters Pulsed field ablation prevents thermally mediated complications in atrial fibrillation treatment. Dr Chan Wan Xian (left) and Dr Jeremy Chow (right) stress the need for regular health screenings to detect atrial fibrillation because a proportion of their patients report having experienced no symptoms. This audio is generated by an AI tool. What gets your heart rate up? An adrenaline rush when talking to your crush or engaging in strenuous physical activity can get your heart pumping faster. But what if you are at rest and your heart’s beating out of your chest? A SILENT KILLER A normal resting heart rate clocks between 60 and 100 beats per minute. A resting heart rate of 150 to 160 beats in a minute could be a sign of atrial fibrillation (AFib), which is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia. Palpitations, fluttering and other irregular heartbeats are warning signs. Easily being short of breath when climbing stairs or fatigue, experienced due to a fast heart rate, are identified as other common symptoms by Dr Jeremy Chow at the Asian Heart & Vascular Centre (AHVC). The cardiologist says sports watches that track heart rates and pulse oximeters, which became prevalent during COVID-19, are useful tools to monitor heart rhythms. Any noticeable irregularities should be discussed with a general practitioner or a specialist. Dr Chow’s colleague at the AHVC, Dr Chan Wan Xian, says: “The diagnosis is quite simple. It’s quite painless as well — we just need to do an ECG, or electrocardiogram.” In an ECG, electrodes in the form of patches are stuck to the skin at chosen spots on the upper body to record the electrical activity of the heart. In some instances, an ambulatory ECG Holter monitor is used as a portable ECG recorder to make a diagnosis. AFib has a reputation as a silent killer as it can also be asymptomatic. Without treatment, Dr Chan says, “it increases the risk of stroke by up to five times and heart-related death by up to two times”. The echocardiologist adds: “If not treated properly, promptly, and if it persists, it can actually weaken the heart muscles and cause a condition called heart failure, where the heart can’t pump efficiently.” GETTING TO THE HEART OF AFib “When we manage a patient with irregular rhythm like atrial fibrillation, we want to treat two things; we want to first get the rhythm back to normal using ablation,” says Dr Chow. Atrial Fibrillation can significantly increase the risk of stroke and cause heart failure according to experts. Technological advancements have led to less invasive procedures in treatment. Since October 2022, a safer and more effective ablation technique for managing the rhythm has been available in Singapore. Compared to thermal ablations, which use hot or cold energy to destroy tissue and pose a risk of internal injury, the latest non-thermal method of pulsed field ablation uses an electrical field to cause cardiac tissue death instead. Dr Chow, who’s also an electrophysiologist, explains that ablation in general “creates isolation points so that electrical signals from the veins do not come into contact with the heart and cause erratic rhythm”. Reducing the risk of a stroke is equally important and usually achieved through a left atrial appendage closure. Because the heart does not beat on a regular basis in the atrium, blood clots tend to form “within a small pouch in the heart called the appendage, which is like the appendix of the intestine”, says Dr Chow. Closing off the appendage with a small plug prevents clots from entering the bloodstream and causing strokes. MANAGING THE RISKS Dr Chan observes that the chance of getting atrial fibrillation increases with age, typically afflicting those over 65 years old. “Patients with long-term medical conditions, like high blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnoea and pre-existing heart conditions, also have an increased risk.” While not all the risk factors can be controlled, Dr Chow recommends maintaining an active lifestyle, reducing salt intake and going for health screenings that can detect diseases like atrial fibrillation if you’re above 40 years old, “so that it does not progress to the full-blown condition, which sometimes may be harder to treat or cure”.

Dr Cliff Wong (left) and Dr Edgar Tay (right) say minimally invasive procedures can help patients with heart valve diseases such as aortic stenosis. This audio is generated by an AI tool. A conductor takes centre stage in a symphony orchestra. In our bodies, the heart takes centre stage, orchestrating life’s rhythm. But in the shadows lurks a condition that, when left untreated, can disrupt this symphony — aortic stenosis. LURKING SHADOW Aortic stenosis occurs when the valve of the heart does not open, and blood cannot flow normally. “Aortic stenosis left untreated (means) your survival will decrease (to) less than 50 per cent over the coming two years,” says Dr Cliff Wong, an echocardiologist at the Asian Heart & Vascular Centre (AHVC). UNCOVERING OPTIONS Dr Wong’s colleague at AHVC, Dr Edgar Tay, an interventional cardiologist, shares that oftentimes when patients are diagnosed with aortic stenosis, their first worry is about whether they require surgery. Historically, patients diagnosed with aortic stenosis, or heart valve disease, are treated with open-heart surgery. Nowadays, there are less invasive treatment options. Before deciding which type of surgery is best suited for the patient, cardiac imaging tests such as echocardiograms or CT scans will have to be done. “The collaboration between the surgeon and imaging cardiologist can help reduce the risk of the complications related to procedures and actually choose the best methods for a better outcome and decrease the risk of the complications,” says Dr Wong. A GAME CHANGER Over the last 20 years of medical advancement, minimally invasive procedures, such as the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), have allowed patients to be treated without opening the chest. TAVI is a minimally invasive procedure during which a new valve is inserted through a small incision in the thigh area while the patient is under sedation or local anaesthesia. Patients are usually hospitalised for three to four days and are able to go back to their usual activities quite quickly. “The idea is to give patients efficient treatment whereby their symptoms are removed and allow them to do what they love,” says Dr Tay. Patients with Aortic Stenosis may avoid open-heart surgery due to advancements in treatment technologies. While the collaboration between surgeons and imaging cardiologists can help reduce the risk of complications. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY Dr Tay shares that chest pains, feeling out of energy when exercising, and breathlessness are symptoms of aortic stenosis. As the disease progresses, patients can feel breathless even when at rest. “Don't dismiss symptoms that are persistent or affecting your quality of life. Get the diagnosis early, and then go for treatment” says Dr Tay. Produced in partnership with Asian Heart & Vascular Centre.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Should certificates of entitlement (COE) for cars be longer than 10 years? Why can’t we have additional buyers’ stamp duty for cars or create car categories based on needs? We take suggestions from the public on refining the COE system to the experts. COE premium prices over the years. (Animated graphics: CNA/Clara Ho) Record-high Certificates of Entitlement (COE) premiums have hit the headlines in recent times, and while efforts have been made to increase the supply and bring down prices, the question remains: What more can be done to the existing system to make the prices of premiums less volatile? The first bidding exercise in October 2023 saw premiums for the Open Category - which can be used for any vehicle type but end up being used mainly for large cars - crossing S$150,000 (US$112,000) for the first time . Category B premiums breached this mark two weeks later. For perspective, a typical family car such as the base model 1.6-litre Toyota Corolla Altis was marketed at about S$173,000 during that time, taking into account COE registration. Its cost price is closer to S$20,000. It bears noting that COEs are integral to the Vehicle Quota System, which is a landmark scheme implemented on May 1, 1990, to regulate the growth of the vehicle population in Singapore. Central to the VQS’ outcome is capping the growth rate to 3 per cent per annum, compared with an average of 6.8 per cent per annum in the three years prior. Since February 2018, a zero-growth rate policy for cars and motorcycles has been in place and will continue until Jan 31, 2025. In land-scarce Singapore, owning a car naturally comes at a cost. Calls to overhaul the system need to bear in mind the wider policy considerations at play. To address skyrocketing prices, authorities are increasing the supply of certificates. In May, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said it would release more Category A and B certificates by bringing forward guaranteed deregistrations of five-year non-extendable COEs. It later announced a 35 per cent increase in the COE quota for the November 2023 to January 2024 quarter. What resulted was COE premiums falling across the board in the first bidding round of November, with Category B prices dropping 26.7 per cent to S$110,001. Prices for larger cars rebounded in the next bidding round, but smaller cars saw a further drop to S$85,001. These were part of the government’s “cut-and-fill” move to tackle the current supply troughs , said Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat in parliament, in response to questions on the system by various Members of Parliament. But will increasing demand reduce price volatility for long? The Transport Ministry has said COE prices are expected to trend upwards in the long run, because of the government’s zero-growth policy for the car population and rising household income. “As household incomes continue to rise in the coming years, coupled with our policy of zero-growth in the car population, we must expect the long-term trajectory for COE prices to be upwards,” said Transport Minister S Iswaran in May 2023. Does the COE system need an update? CNA posed five common suggestions from the public to transport analysts to see if they are viable. The private car population, including off-peak cars, shrunk from 580,406 in 2012 to 542,145 in 2022. Private-hire cars, meanwhile, have grown from 14,862 to 72,632 over the same period, giving the appearance it is a key driver of demand, and thus price, in recent times. It’s little wonder then people are calling for a separate category for private-hire vehicles (PHVs) and taxis. But experts say the issue with this suggestion is that publicly available data do not show how PHVs are used. We do not know whether these cars are being used for private hire, car sharing, or private purposes, transport economist Walter Theseira told CNA. This lack of information makes it difficult to determine whether COE demand can be linked to private-hire companies and their fleets, added the associate professor at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS). Data from the Transport Ministry shows the total private-hire car population stands around 78,000, with two-thirds being chauffeured PHCs such as those from ride-hailing companies. The remaining self-drive PHCS include car-sharing vehicles. Both are available for rentals, but only chauffeured PHCs may be used to provide ride-hail services. Yet, the data does not capture how the vehicles are used in order for demand to be assessed. Additionally, Singapore Institute of Technology’s (SIT) Zhou Yi said private-hire companies are not always the owners of the PHVs, making it difficult to prevent abuse should a new COE category be created. “Remember, the ‘Uber’ model is a large point-to-point transport without owning any car,” Assoc Professor Zhou said. He added: “Everyone can go for the PHV category unless the government sets similar KPIs [as it does] for taxi owners.” Addressing this suggestion in parliament, Mr Chee said there are “trade-offs” to having a separate COE category for car-leasing companies including a risk of further spikes in the prices due to fewer certificates in the market. He added the government would study the possibility of “further options beyond COE bidding” to address these concerns with car-leasing companies. Another suggestion made is to lengthen the 10-year duration of a COE, possibly to 15 or 20 years, based on the reasoning that cars today are made to be more efficient and last longer. However, Assoc Prof Zhou said this won’t solve the problem in the long term. Instead, it could increase COE prices given the lack of supply due to fewer deregistrations, he suggested. For Assoc Prof Theseira, the issue of having more efficient and longer-lasting vehicles is not a question that the existing COE system is meant to answer. The Vehicle Quota System, of which COEs are an integral part, is “perfectly successful in managing the vehicle population”. As shown in the table below, the population of Category A and B vehicles have been kept below 350,000 in each category for the past decade. However, the issue of “success” is not in the number of vehicles, he said. “It's the outcomes of the system which are not desirable, such as extreme volatility in COE prices when the underlying economic use of vehicles probably hasn't changed, and extreme volatility in fleet turnover. Both are caused by the COE supply cycle,” he explained. The economist added it also doesn’t address the question of what the vehicle population target and mix should be. He had previously raised similar concerns and said that, in order to solve these, policymakers need to make judgments about how many vehicles should exist and why. To cool the property market when it gets red-hot, authorities tinker with the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) where people who own multiple houses pay more in duties. The idea of imposing a similar levy for car ownership sounds interesting but it is not easy to implement, said Assoc Prof Zhou. For one, he said it is easy to get around as car buyers can register their vehicles under different names. The number of people owning multiple cars may also not be worth introducing such a scheme, he added. The Transport Ministry had previously said that as of Oct 31, 2022, about 471,000 households own cars; of these, about 12 per cent own two cars and less than 3 per cent own three or more cars. “Unless there is a significant trend toward percentage of multiple car ownership, it may not be worth introducing ABSD as the nature of owning cars is different from houses,” the SIT professor said. Experts say this suggestion might lead to other unwanted outcomes. Assoc Prof Zhou said if the price limit is lower than what consumers are willing to pay, and if the supply of COEs continues to be limited due to the government’s zero-growth policy, then it could lead to authorities having to conduct lucky draws to allocate the available certificates. “It may even drive more [car] dealers to join in the draws and buyers may have to wait longer,” he said. This was reiterated by Mr Chee in parliament, saying that such demand-measures “would have little effect on COE prices”. For Assoc Prof Theseira, there are two considerations for this: Is there broad societal consensus on whether special considerations should be given to such needs, to whom and to what extent? And is it practical to implement these changes? “As cars are not necessities the way that housing, healthcare or education are - areas where the government does in fact provide extensive support based on social needs - it is unclear the public would support such measures,” he said. The benefits would likely go to a certain segment of the middle class, with lower-income Singaporeans unlikely to find cars cost-effective even after the policy change, while high-income Singaporeans won’t benefit by design, the SUSS professor said. As for whether it’s practical to implement, he thinks it’s only possible with “extensive changes to regulations and enforcement” to disallow any form of “policy leakage” from, say, fake buyers obtaining vehicles cheaply or using the vehicle outside its stated purposes. SUSS’ Theseira told CNA that the broader change needed is to revise the COE vehicle mix, look at the supply and growth rates and shift vehicle control more towards paying for usage rather than ownership - including distance-based charges. “However, those changes would require much more study to be achieved,” he added. The LTA in October announced a timeline to install the next generation of electronic road pricing units - ERP 2.0 - which could facilitate distance-based charging, but it says it has “no immediate plans” to introduce distance-based road use charges. Assoc Prof Zhou said any modification or change to the existing COE system will need to consider actual practices by car dealers, taxi operators as well as individuals. This should also be done within the context of the wider zero-growth in car population policy to drive Singapore’s car-lite society ambitions. Additionally, Assoc Prof Theseira said it will be “challenging” to take away COEs from high-supply years and move these to low-supply years without causing unhappiness. “But I think from the economic perspective, it is clear that it is not sensible for the COE supply and prices to vary by such a large factor across years when there is little that changes about vehicle demand and use in those different years,” he said.

(File photo: REUTERS/Louisa Gouliamaki) ATHENS: Europe has a duty to host children hurt and traumatised by war in Gaza for as long as the conflict continues, Greek Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis told Reuters on Wednesday (Jun 19). Gerapetritis is seeking partners in what he hopes would be a project to temporarily bring the children to the European Union and said he discussed the idea with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa this week. \"We need to face this tragedy very clearly,\" Gerapetritis said. \"Europe should be open to injured people from (Gaza) but also to children who are now facing famine or other sorts of dangers.\" Greece was elected as a member of the United Nations Security Council for 2025 to 2026 earlier this month, and Gerapetritis believes the country's historical ties with the Arab world give it credibility to act as a peace broker. The 56-year-old, who has held the post for a year, did not say how many people could be hosted by Greece or the EU but said the issue was under discussion with Palestinian authorities. Gerapetritis stressed that the initiative was not linked to regular migration, which has become politically sensitive in Europe and strongly opposed by a resurgent right. \"This is an obvious call of humanitarian assistance. We're not talking here about economic migrants or other types of irregular migration,\" he said, days after far-right parties surged in European parliamentary elections . Greece condemned the Oct 7 attack by Hamas militants against Israel but has called for a halt to Israel's ground and air assault on Gaza that Palestinian authorities say has killed more than 35,000 people and flattened whole cities. The World Health Organization says many in Gaza face famine-like conditions and more than 8,000 children under five years old are suffering from acute malnutrition. In addition, the psychological impact of the war on children is \"tremendous\", said Gerapetritis. Gerapetritis said he talked to Palestinian and Israeli prime ministers this week about ways to seal peace and reconstruct Gaza. \"We shouldn't wait ... for the war to stop in order to start discussing it,\" he said. \"It is going to be a giant project and we have to develop it as early as possible,\" he said. A Gaza ceasefire would also help reduce attacks on ships by Iran-backed Houthi militants in the Red Sea which has affected Greece's shipping sector . \"I am relatively optimistic that alongside the ceasefire that we're hoping to achieve in the very near future, the situation also in the Red Sea will become much better,\" Gerapetritis said.

(File Photo: REUTERS/Yasser Qudih) \"The requirement to select means and methods of warfare that avoid or at the very least minimise to every extent civilian harm appears to have been consistently violated in Israel's bombing campaign,\" UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. The report concludes that the series of Israeli strikes, exemplified by the six attacks carried out between Oct 9 and Dec 2, suggested that Israel's military had \"repeatedly violated fundamental principles of the laws of war\", the statement said. Gaza's deadliest war was sparked by Hamas's unprecedented attack inside Israel on Oct 7, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. The militants also seized 251 hostages. Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,372 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry. Among the attacks listed in Wednesday's report were the strikes on Ash Shujaiyeh neighbourhood, in Gaza City on Dec 2 last year. It caused destruction across an approximate diagonal span of 130 metres, destroying 15 buildings and damaging at least 14 others, it said. Ajith Sunghay, head of OHCHR's office in the Palestinian territories, said that the report focused heavily on Israeli actions since the weapons used by Israel's military were far more destructive. The missiles fired by Hamas, while \"absolutely unacceptable\", he said, \"have not caused significant killing during the war\" by comparison. The incidents detailed in the report did not include a key and controversial blast early in the war on Gaza's Al-Ahli hospital compound, where Hamas initially talked about hundreds killed in what they said was an Israeli strike. Israel denied responsibility and blamed a misfired rocket launched by Islamic Jihad militants - a claim backed by the US - while Western intelligence sources suggested a far lower death toll.

    "article_content": "World World Palestinians flee during Israeli bombardment in the area in Rafah (Photo: AFP/Bashar TALEB) GAZA STRIP: Israeli air strikes and clashes between troops and Palestinian militants rocked Gaza on Wednesday (Jun 19), after Israel's army warned it had readied an \"offensive\" against the Lebanese Hezbollah movement on the country's northern front. Witnesses and the civil defence agency in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip reported Israeli bombardment in western Rafah, where medics said drone strikes and shelling killed at least seven people. The Israeli military has announced a daily humanitarian \"pause\" in fighting on a key road in eastern Rafah , but a United Nations spokesman said days later that \"this has yet to translate into more aid reaching people in need\". More than eight months of war, sparked by Hamas's unprecedented Oct 7 attack on Israel, have led to dire humanitarian conditions in the Palestinian territory and repeated UN warnings of famine. The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt has been shut since Israeli troops seized its Palestinian side in early May, while nearby Kerem Shalom on the Israeli border \"is operating with limited functionality, including because of fighting in the area\", said UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq. He told reporters that in recent weeks, there had been \"an improvement\" in aid reaching northern Gaza \"but a drastic deterioration in the south\". \"Basic commodities are available in markets in southern and central Gaza. But ... it's unaffordable for many people.\" The war has sent tensions soaring across the region, with violence involving Iran-backed Hamas allies. The Israeli military, which has traded near-daily cross-border fire with Lebanon's Hezbollah since October, said late Tuesday that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\". On Wednesday the military said its warplanes had struck Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon overnight while reporting a drone had infiltrated near the border town of Metula in an attack claimed by Hezbollah targeting troops. The Iran-backed group also announced the death of four of its fighters. Lebanon's official National News agency reported Israeli strikes on several areas in south Lebanon on Wednesday morning, including on the border village of Khiam, where an AFP photographer saw a large cloud of smoke. Hezbollah later said it had fired \"dozens of Katyusha rockets and artillery rounds\" towards a barracks in Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in retaliation for the attacks. Israel said the Hezbollah attack did not cause any casualties and that its own \"artillery struck the sources of fire\". The Israeli army's announcement that its plans for an offensive in Lebanon had been approved , along with a warning from Foreign Minister Israel Katz of Hezbollah's destruction in a \"total war\", came as US envoy Amos Hochstein visited the region to push for de-escalation. Former Israeli security officials were split on the significance of the approval, with one telling AFP there would be an operation in Lebanon \"within a few weeks\" while another said the government was \"more interested in a ceasefire\". Syrian state media said an Israeli strike on military sites in the country's south killed an army officer on Wednesday. Israel has not commented on the report. In Gaza, Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian armed group that has fought alongside Hamas, said its militants were battling troops amid Israeli shelling of western Rafah. Witnesses reported seeing Israeli military vehicles enter the city's neighbourhood of Saudi, followed by nighttime gun battles. Parts of central Gaza also experienced fighting overnight, while witnesses reported artillery shelling and heavy gunfire in northern Gaza City's Zeitun neighbourhood. The Oct 7 attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. The militants also seized 251 hostages . Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,396 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry. At least 24 people died over the past day, the ministry said. In a message on the occasion of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, US President Joe Biden called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month. Hochstein said the plan would ultimately lead to \"the end of the conflict in Gaza\", which would in turn quell fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. But US, Qatari and Egyptian mediation efforts have stalled for months since a one-week truce in November. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced mounting criticism at home over his handling of the Gaza war and hostage crisis, with regular mass demonstrations led by captives' relatives and anti-government activists. Thousands gathered in front of parliament in Jerusalem on Tuesday night, calling for early elections and the resumption of truce talks. Hochstein on Tuesday evening returned to Israel for more talks with Netanyahu after a series of meetings in Lebanon, according to an Israeli official. Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, have pending arrest warrants requested against them at the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity. A UN report issued Wednesday detailed six \"indiscriminate and disproportionate\" Israeli strikes that killed at least 218 people in the first two months of the war. It said the strikes involved \"the suspected use\" of heavy bombs - a shipment of which the United States had paused in May over concerns Israel might use them in its Rafah assault. The strikes targeted \"densely populated\" areas including refugee camps, a school and a market, the UN rights office said, making the use of heavy bombs \"highly likely to amount to a prohibited indiscriminate attack\". UN human rights chief Volker Turk said: \"The requirement to select means and methods of warfare that avoid, or at the very least minimise to every extent, civilian harm appears to have been consistently violated in Israel's bombing campaign.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "World World A satellite image shows a closer view of US military-run humanitarian aid pier in Gaza before its removal, on Jun 12, 2024. (File photo: Reuters/Maxar Technologies/Handout) WASHINGTON: The US military's on-again, off-again floating pier in Gaza is expected to resume operations on Thursday to unload sorely needed humanitarian aid for Palestinians, two US officials told Reuters on Wednesday (Jun 19). The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the pier had been re-attached to the shore on Wednesday after being temporarily removed last Friday due to poor sea conditions . Aid began arriving via the US-built pier on May 17, and the UN said it transported 137 trucks of aid to warehouses, some 900 metric tonnes. But then rough seas damaged the pier, forcing repairs, and poor weather and security considerations have limited the number of days it has been operational. US President Joe Biden announced in March the plan to put the pier in place for aid deliveries as famine loomed in Gaza, a Hamas-run enclave of 2.3 million people, during the war between Israel and the Palestinian militants. The US military estimates the pier will cost more than US$200 million for the first 90 days and involve about 1,000 service members. It is unclear how much longer it will be operational. Speaking at the Pentagon on Tuesday, spokesperson Air Force Major-General Patrick Ryder declined to say when the military might halt its pier operations altogether. He said the pier has so far allowed for a total of over 3,500 metric tonnes of aid to reach Gaza's shores. \"With the caveat that this has always been intended to be a temporary pier, I'm not aware at this point of any established date of: 'This is when we're going to stop,'\" he told reporters. \"And again, taking a step back here, the big picture: Whether it be by land, sea or air, (the United States is) employing all avenues to get assistance into Gaza.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "World World Smoke plumes billow over Gaza's Rafah, more than eight months into the Israel-Hamas war. (File Photo: AFP/Bashar Taleb) CAIRO/GAZA: Israeli forces pounded areas in the central Gaza Strip overnight, killing three people and wounding dozens of others, according to medics, while tanks deepened their invasion into Rafah in the south, residents said. Israeli planes struck a house in Al-Nuseirat camp, killing two people and wounding 12 others, while tanks shelled areas in Al-Maghazi and Al-Bureij camps, wounding many other people, health officials said. Nuseirat, Maghazi, and Bureij are three of Gaza's eight historic refugee camps. The Israeli military said on Wednesday (Jun 19) that forces were continuing their operations across the enclave targeting militants and military infrastructure in what it described as \"precise, intelligence-based\" activities. More than eight months into the war in Gaza, Israel's advance is now focused on the two last areas its forces had yet to storm: Rafah on Gaza's southern edge and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre. The operations have forced more than a million people to flee since May, the vast majority already displaced from other parts of the enclave. In Rafah, near the border with Egypt, Israeli tanks stationed deep in the western and central areas of the city stepped up bombardment, forcing more families living in the far coastal areas to flee northward. Some residents said the pace of the raid has been accelerated in the past two days. \"The tanks took control of most of the areas in Rafah. People living by the beach have also started to leave toward Khan Younis and central areas in fear because of the continued bombardment,\" said Abu Wasim, a resident from Rafah's Al-Shaboura neighbourhood, who quit his home over a week ago before tanks rolled in reaching the heart of the city. Rafah housed over half of Gaza's 2.3 million people until May 7 when Israeli forces began the ground offensive into the city. Fewer than 100,000 are now believed to be left behind. There has been no sign of let-up in the fighting as efforts by international mediators, backed by the United States, have failed to persuade Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire. The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said fighters battled Israeli forces with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs, and have in some areas detonated pre-planted explosive devices against army units. On Thursday, Israeli authorities freed 33 Palestinians who had been detained during the past months by Israeli forces in different areas of the enclave. The freed detainees were admitted into Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip after they complained of torture and mistreatment by Israeli jailers. Israel denies mistreatment of Palestinian detainees. Palestinian and international human rights groups have criticised what they say is Israel's ill-treatment of Gaza detainees and repeatedly demanded it disclose their whereabouts and information about their well-being. Israel's ground and air campaign was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. The offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population homeless and destitute. Since a week-long truce in November, repeated attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with Hamas insisting on an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will agree only to temporary pauses and will not end the war until Hamas is eradicated and the hostages are freed.

(File photo: Pool via REUTERS/Shaul Golan) WASHINGTON: The White House expressed deep disappointment over criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the United States on Thursday (Jun 20) amid tensions between the two allies over Israel's war in Gaza . The White House response came as national security adviser Jake Sullivan held meetings with Netanyahu's top two aides to discuss the Gaza conflict and other issues. Similar talks were expected between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the Israelis. Netanyahu on Tuesday issued an English-language video in which he said Blinken had assured him that the Biden administration was working to lift restrictions on arms deliveries to Israel, an exchange the top US diplomat declined to confirm. In a rare account of normally private diplomatic conversations, Netanyahu also said he told Blinken that it was \"inconceivable\" that in the past few months Washington was withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby addressed the comments in a briefing with reporters, saying the US had directly expressed displeasure to Israel. \"I think we've made it abundantly clear to our Israeli counterparts through various vehicles our deep disappointment in the statements expressed in that video and our concerns over the accuracy in the statements made,\" Kirby said. \"The idea that we had somehow stopped helping Israel with their self-defence needs is absolutely not accurate,\" he said. Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi and Ron Dermer, Israel's minister for strategic affairs, spoke with Sullivan as a larger, more formal \"strategic dialogue\" meeting was being rescheduled, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Blinken said weapons shipments - with the exception of one with large bombs - were moving as usual given Israel faced security threats beyond Gaza, including from Hezbollah and Iran. He declined to comment on his private exchange with Netanyahu during a news conference on Tuesday. \"There is one shipment of high payload munitions that we have put under review and that remains under review. That's not a bottleneck. That's a policy review,\" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller. The United States in May paused a shipment of 2,000-pound and 500-pound bombs due to concern over the impact they could have in densely populated areas but Israel was still due to get billions of dollars worth of US weaponry. Scrutiny on Israel's conduct in its military operation in Gaza has increased as the Palestinian death toll from the war has soared to above 37,000, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave and reduced Gaza to a wasteland. The war started when Palestinian Hamas militants stormed across the border and attacked Israel on Oct 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage, according to Israeli tallies. Biden in April warned Israel that the US would stop supplying it weapons if Israeli forces make a major invasion of Rafah, a city in southern Gaza that is the last refuge for many displaced by the war.

(Photo: REUTERS/Mahmoud Issa) GENEVA: A group of United Nations experts on Thursday (Jun 20) warned arms and ammunition manufacturers against taking part in the transfer of weapons to Israel, saying it could make them complicit in human rights abuses and violations of international law. The group of 30 experts, including several UN Special Rapporteurs, said arms manufacturers supplying Israel should halt their transfers of war materiel, \"even if they are executed under existing export licenses\". \"These companies, by sending weapons, parts, components, and ammunition to Israeli forces, risk being complicit in serious violations of international human rights and international humanitarian laws,\" the experts said in a statement. There was no immediate comment from Israel which has repeatedly denied carrying out abuses during its Gaza operations, saying it is acting to defend itself and is fighting Hamas militants, not the Palestinian population. The UN experts said on Thursday the risk to arms firms had increased since the International Court of Justice ordered Israel last month to halt its military offensive in Rafah in the southern tip of the Gaza Strip, in a landmark emergency ruling in South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide. \"In this context, continuing arms transfers to Israel may be seen as knowingly providing assistance for operations that contravene international human rights and international humanitarian laws and may result in profit from such assistance,\" the experts said. Israel has rejected the genocide accusations as false and grossly distorted. The UN human rights office said on Wednesday that Israeli forces may have repeatedly violated the laws of war and failed to distinguish between civilians and fighters in the Gaza conflict. Israel dismissed the findings as flawed. Israel's air and ground offensive has killed more than 37,400 people in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory, according to health authorities there. Israel launched its assault after Hamas fighters stormed across the border into southern Israel on Oct 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

    "article_content": "World World A Palestinian man cools off dogs amid the soaring heat wave, in Gaza City, Jul 17, 2023. (File photo: Reuters/Fadi Shana) GENEVA: The World Health Organization warned on Friday (Jun 21) that scorching heat in the Gaza Strip could exacerbate health problems for Palestinians displaced by Israeli bombardment and heavy fighting between its forces and Hamas militants. The World Food Programme has warned that a massive public health crisis is looming in Gaza due to the lack of clean water, food and medical supplies. \"We've seen massive displacement over the last weeks and months, and we know that combination and the heat can cause a rise in diseases,\" said Richard Peeperkorn, WHO's representative for Gaza and the West Bank. \"We have water contamination because of hot water, and we will have much more food spoilage because of the high temperature. We will get insects: Mosquitoes and flies, dehydration, heat stroke.\" Extreme heat has killed hundreds worldwide as the northern hemisphere summer begins. Peeperkorn said in Gaza, due to poor water and sanitation conditions, the number of cases of diarrhoea were 25 times higher than usual. Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery and hepatitis A, according to the WHO. The WHO has been unable to carry out medical evacuations from Gaza since the closure of the Rafah crossing in early May. Peeperkorn said an estimated 10,000 patients still required medical evacuation from Gaza, half of whom are suffering from ailments related to the war. Israel's air and ground offensive has killed more than 37,400 people in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory, according to health authorities there.

    "article_content": "World World GAZA STRIP: Israel bombed the Gaza Strip where one hospital reported at least 30 dead Friday (Jun 21) and as exchanges of fire and threats over the Lebanon border raised fears of an even wider war. After further cross-border fire between Israel and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the clashes must not turn Lebanon into \"another Gaza\" . Increased \"bellicose rhetoric\" from both sides risked triggering a catastrophe \"beyond imagination\", he said. In Gaza the director of Gaza City's Al-Ahli hospital was quoted by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry as reporting 30 dead on Friday in intensified Israeli bombardment. \"It has been a difficult and brutal day in Gaza City. So far, around 30 martyrs have arrived at the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital,\" Dr Fadel Naeem was quoted as saying. Civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Basal said five municipal workers died when a garage in the city was bombed. The violence on the Lebanon border began after the Oct 7 attack by Hamas militants from Gaza into southern Israel. That attack resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. The militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,431 people, also mostly civilians, according to Gaza's health ministry. Months of negotiations towards a truce and a hostage release have failed to make headway, but mediator Qatar insisted Friday it was still working to \"bridge the gap\" between Israel and Hamas. The war has destroyed much of Gaza's infrastructure and left residents short of food, fuel and other essentials. On Jun 16 the army said it would implement a daily \"tactical pause of military activity\" in a southern Gaza corridor to facilitate aid delivery. But on Friday Richard Peeperkorn of the World Health Organization said \"we did not see an impact on the humanitarian supplies coming in\". Hisham Salem in Jabalia camp told AFP: \"The markets... used to be full, but now there is nothing left. I go around the entire market and I can't find a kilo of onions, and if I do ... it costs 140 shekels (US$37).\" But Netanyahu told relatives of captives killed in Gaza: \"We will not leave the Gaza Strip until all of the hostages return.\" On Thursday he said he was \"prepared to suffer personal attacks provided that Israel receives the ammunition from the US that it needs in the war for its existence\". His statement came as an apparent doubling down after he made a video statement accusing Washington of \"withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel\" .

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary The clash between US President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump will be less on policies than on each candidate’s manner and appearance, says Edward Luce for Financial Times. WASHINGTON: How do you run a debate between two men whose combined age is two-thirds that of the US republic? The answer is to have no audience, mute the one not talking and schedule bathroom breaks (calling them commercials). It would be an overstatement to say that next week’s clash between Joe Biden and Donald Trump will be definitive. But in a close election in which each candidate’s mental capacity is under scrutiny, it will matter a lot. Only three times in US history has a presidential debate arguably changed the outcome. In each case, however, they took place within weeks or days of the election. Biden pushed for a historically early date because so many Americans mail in their votes nowadays. In reality, his team wanted the earliest chance to break a polling deadlock that they assumed would have evaporated by now. The sooner Biden can quell doubts about his age and remind people of Trump’s character the better. That is the theory. The past offers mixed messages. The first televised debates were between John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1960. These would augur well for Trump. People who tuned in on their radios thought that Nixon had won. Those who watched it on TV went for Kennedy. The contrast between Nixon’s so-called five o’clock shadow and JFK’s radiant youthfulness mattered. Today’s equivalent would be to watch with the sound off. On that measure, Trump comes across as more vigorous. Kennedy won 34.2 million votes. Nixon won 34.1 million. The other two election-deciding debates both involved Jimmy Carter. In 1976, a month before the election, Carter lured the sitting president, Gerald Ford, into a trap. He got Ford to deny there was Soviet domination of eastern Europe. This alienated swing state voters of Polish and Czech origin in a tight election where the electoral college margin boiled down to a few thousand votes in Ohio and Wisconsin. George Gallup called it “the most decisive moment in the campaign”. The actor Chevy Chase picked up on the gaffe in his Saturday Night Live impersonation of Ford. “Last year I visited the capital of Poland, and let me say from the outset that Milwaukee is a beautiful city,” said Chase’s Ford. In 1980 Ronald Reagan’s genial presence quelled doubts that he was a fanatic on trigger alert with the USSR. Until that moment - a week before the election - Carter and Reagan’s numbers were neck and neck. All Reagan needed to do was to come across as sane. He won by a landslide. Examples two and three augur badly for Trump. He has no equal in his capacity to demean large groups of people. Past targets include women, people who serve in uniform, and those with close family suffering from addiction or disability. Though Trump can be funny, his character is decidedly un-reassuring. On past performance, Biden ought to beat Trump. He was judged the winner in both their 2020 encounters. This was partly because Trump came across as obnoxious, notably about the waywardness of Biden’s son, Hunter . People liked it when Biden said, “Will you shut up, man?” Trump was heading for defeat anyway. He also lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016 on both the content and his predatory body language. He defeated Clinton in spite of that. The former FBI director James Comey can help explain why. Yet Democrats would be lying if they said they will not have their hearts in their mouths when Biden takes the podium next Thursday (Jun 27). The mute test is probably outdated. A better one would be TikTok, or Instagram Reels, on which many Americans will get their exposure. In March, Biden gave an energetic State of the Union speech. Millions only saw the 15-second clip where he mangled the name of a murder victim. The perception gap between Americans who watched the speech and those who saw tiny snippets was vast. Biden is certain to produce a few clippable Bidenisms next week. Are these the impressions on which the future of US democracy hinges? The dispiriting answer is maybe. The good news for Biden is that the rules mostly favour him. Trump feeds off live audiences and will have to adapt to silence. He will be inaudible when Biden is speaking. Biden would be negligent if he did not remind viewers that his opponent is a convicted felon . It would be nice to think policy clashes will decide the debate. Even more than usual, however, what the candidates say will matter less than how each seems. Biden’s goal will be to ensure his age will be less of a talking point than Trump’s character. On paper his task is simple. In practice it is anything but.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary The shutdown of Singapore brewery Archipelago reflects economic struggles in the industry and difficulties appealing to the choosy craft beer customer, says Christian Barker. Composite photo of Archipelago Brewery in Tuas and a bottle of its Singapore Blond Ale (Photos: Facebook/Archipelago Brewery) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Local craft beer brewery Archipelago has fallen victim to what some commentators are calling the “beerpocalypse”. The brand, owned by Asia Pacific Breweries (APB) Singapore, will cease operations at the end of June . For craft beer brewers around the world, these are trying times. In 2023, a staggering 418 breweries in the United States were shuttered, while in Britain , 52 declared insolvency. Established in 1933, Archipelago is Singapore’s second-oldest brewery, originally situated near Alexandra Brickworks. After the brand lay dormant for many years, in 2006 Archipelago was given a new lease of life as APB’s craft brewing arm. APB produces beers such as Tiger, Anchor and the local licensed version of Heineken. However, APB’s owner Heineken has decided to pull the plug on the artisanal brewery after 18 years, citing a desire to streamline their portfolio amid “declining craft beer market realities and high operational costs”. These pressures include the toll taken by conflict in Eastern Europe - Ukraine has historically been a major source of wheat and barley, key components in beer - and inflation, driving up the price of everything from ingredients and packaging to shipping. Rising interest rates are also impacting brewers who have borrowed to fund their business or acquire property, while cost-of-living pressures are decreasing demand. With diminished discretionary spending, people are simply going to the bar less, and may find mainstream beer at S$15 (US$11.10) per six-pack more appealing than niche ales costing S$15 per pint or more. One of the main reasons drinkers gravitate to craft beer and are willing to pay higher prices is the sense that they’re consuming an independent, artisanal product - not an industrial beverage churned out by major breweries. Despite being made with great care by a small team of passionate brewers, Archipelago likely suffered from its association with APB, maker of mass-market beers. “There is a bit of a backlash against craft beer brands that are owned by big companies,” Daniel Goh, one of the founders of Chinatown craft beer purveyor Smith Street Taps, told me. “People think, why should I drink that (corporate-owned) craft beer, when they are plenty of perfectly viable, independent craft beer alternatives the market has to offer?” In Mr Goh’s view, consumers will gravitate to supporting independent, Singaporean-owned breweries such as Brewlander, Alive and Brewerkz. He has observed a similar anti-corporate sentiment affecting Australian craft breweries Stone & Wood and Little Creatures. Both were acquired by Lion, the beer giant that produces mass-market Australian beers including XXXX and Tooheys. When a craft brewery falls under the control of a large corporation, often the “bean counters” will take over, Mr Goh said, and suddenly, “you’re not chasing a vision - you’re chasing numbers. That’s a very different approach.” In this country, we drink less than our regional neighbours. By APB’s estimates, annual per capita consumption of beer in Singapore is around 24L, compared to an average of 50L in Cambodia or Thailand, and 60L in Vietnam. Roughly 3 per cent of the beer consumed locally is craft beer. Consequently, exports are an important element in a Singaporean craft beer’s success. Archipelago, however, failed to gain traction internationally. The brand started out producing varieties like Straits Pale and Traders Brown Ale that acknowledged their Singaporean provenance. However, in recent years, more of Archipelago’s brews seem designed to look European (such as Bohemian Lager, Belgian Witbier, Irish Ale) or Australian (Summer IPA). Even the Singapore Blonde Ale, with its label depicting a pin-up girl , appears American. This is ironic given the success Tiger has had in the international market by leaning into its Singaporean origins. Learning from its big brother in this regard could have been an area where Archipelago benefitted, rather than suffered, from its corporate associations. Without a strong branding proposition that is recognisable as “uniquely Singaporean”, Archipelago may have lost its attractiveness to an international audience seeking a taste of this country. To craft beer enthusiasts, Archipelago Brewery’s products may have carried the high pricing of craft beer, but not the self-made and distinct identity they associate with artisanal beverages. A craft beer lives or dies on pride in its unique origins, a sense of independence and authentic craftsmanship. While Archipelago had that last factor on lock, its failings in the other two areas proved fatal.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary The ease of obtaining medical certificates from telemedicine providers raises risks beyond the workplace, given how the courts rely heavily on MCs in dispensing justice, says Fortress Law Corporation’s Mark Yeo. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Medical certificates (MCs), and the ease with which patients have been able to obtain them through telemedicine providers , were recently thrust into the spotlight. Following reports regarding the “excessive issuance” of MCs without proper clinical assessments and follow-ups, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is considering tightening regulations . Proposed measures include requiring every MC to include the name and medical registration number of the issuing medical practitioner. In a joint circular with the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) sent to doctors, the authorities also reminded medical practitioners of their professional obligations, noting that MCs are “medico-legal documents which carry professional and legal implications”. At least one clinic, Medstar Medical Clinic & Surgery , is under investigation for issuing MCs without any audio or video consultation on its telemedicine service PocketCare. The joint circular has reignited the long-running debate on the relevance of medical certificates in today’s employment landscape, especially in a post-COVID world. Some firms are rethinking their MC policies , allowing employees to take paid sick leave without needing a doctor’s note . The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has also advised employers against requiring MCs from employees who test positive for COVID-19 using self-administered test kits. At its core, an MC is a certification by a medical professional that the patient is ill or medically unfit for certain types of activities. The SMC’s Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines thus requires that MCs be issued “on proper medical grounds arrived at through good clinical assessment”. While MCs are often used as documentation for absence from work or school, they also play a critical role in other areas. In the area of criminal justice, when individuals are charged with hurt-based offences, the duration of an MC - which represents how long a person is ill or medically unfit for certain activities - can affect both the types of charges brought against them and the severity of their sentences. For other types of offences, MCs may even be used by the accused as a defence. Understanding why MCs are relevant in this area first requires an elaboration on the difference between “hurt” and “grievous hurt” under the law. Under the Penal Code, “hurt” is defined as “bodily pain, disease or infirmity”, and broadly includes injuries such as bruises and abrasions. On the other hand, “grievous hurt” extends to more serious injuries such as fractures or permanent disabilities like the loss of sight or hearing. Importantly, the definition of “grievous hurt” also includes injuries that cause “the sufferer to be, during the space of 20 days, in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits”. This is where MCs become relevant. Since “ordinary pursuits” would include going to work, if an MC issued to a victim cumulatively exceeds 20 days, this would mean that the accused caused grievous hurt. When grievous hurt is established, the severity of the charges against the accused escalates. For example, the offence of “voluntarily causing hurt” under the Penal Code carries a maximum punishment of three years’ jail, or a S$5,000 fine. In contrast, the offence of “voluntarily causing grievous hurt” carries a jail term of up to 10 years, with the possibility of additional fines or caning. Similar step-ups in penalties also apply most commonly to offences such as careless or dangerous driving under the Road Traffic Act Even within the definitions of “hurt” and “grievous hurt”, the courts frequently assess the degree of harm caused when deciding on sentencing. This rationale is straightforward: Generally, the greater the harm, the more severe the sentence. In this context, the courts often use the duration of medical and hospitalisation leave as a rough measure of the severity of the victim’s injuries, as it represents a medical professional’s assessment of the time needed for the victim to resume his normal activities. With the increasing use of sentencing frameworks that place primary importance on the offender’s culpability and the harm suffered by the victim, MCs play a significant role in influencing not only the type of offence an accused is charged with, but also the severity of the sentence handed down. MCs may also be used by some as an excuse for certain obligations under the law. For example, individuals under drug supervision programmes are often required to undergo routine urine tests at the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), often weekly or twice weekly. Failing to do so constitutes an offence, unless the supervisee provides a valid reason for his absence, such as illness, supported by an MC. This would also apply to individuals who are required to routinely report to a police station as part of their bail conditions, or attend court hearings, although the MC would need to specifically excuse the patient from court proceedings, which is anecdotally rarely given. The gravity with which the courts view fraudulently obtained MCs is shown through the consequences meted for such conduct. In 2017, a lawyer known as S K Kumar was disbarred for, amongst other things, advising his client to obtain a medical memo under false pretences to justify his client’s absence from a court hearing in 2014. Mr Kumar had done so because he forgot to inform his client that there was a hearing fixed on that day for his case. While the medical memo was not eventually tendered to court, the fact he had advised his client to obtain one fraudulently eventually became a basis for causing the lawyer to be struck off. Seen in this light, the ease at which patients may obtain MCs from telemedicine providers raises risks beyond the workplace, given how the courts rely heavily on MCs in dispensing justice. More than simply allowing an employee to be excused from work, MCs carry other legal implications that affect the life and liberty of others. Mark Yeo is a Director at Fortress Law Corporation.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Jensen Huang, the Taiwan-born founder of semiconductor giant Nvidia, brings a quiet determination to a Silicon Valley known for hype and bluster, says IMD Business School’s Howard Yu. This audio is generated by an AI tool. LAUSANNE, Switzerland: At 61, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is not your usual Silicon Valley tech rockstar. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg achieved stardom before age 30, as did Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. This week, Nvidia overtook Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company , at about US$3.34 trillion. It’s not like Nvidia builds products that consumers can easily relate to: Unlike iPhones or Facebook, most of us never directly buy or even see Nvidia’s graphics cards or artificial intelligence chips. Yet, fans mobbed Mr Huang at the Computex tech trade show in Taiwan earlier this month and flocked to the restaurants and night market stalls he patronised. “ Jensanity ” has swept the island and the tech world. So how did Mr Huang become the “Taylor Swift of tech”, as coined by Mr Zuckerberg? For one, Taiwan-born Mr Huang has arguably become the face of the AI semiconductor boom, at a time when chips have become the next front in the rivalry between China and the United States. One of the deepest fault lines lies in Taiwan which is at the heart of everything technological that powers Silicon Valley to Shenzhen. It holds the key to the world’s digital future. “Taiwan is the unsung hero, a steadfast pillar of the world,” Mr Huang said onstage at Computex, pointing to a chart that showed 100 Taiwanese companies, such as TSMC. The semiconductor foundry manufactures most of the world’s advanced chipsets, including Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips. Foxconn, Quanta, Pegatron and Wistron assemble Apple, Dell and HP products. Delta Electronics enables the power and thermal management of electric vehicles and data centres. ASUS is known for its high-performance personal computers and components. Washington wants to contain China. Beijing wants to achieve self-sufficiency. And Taiwanese companies, knowing both sides need them, play cute. Make friends with everyone. Take orders from Apple’s Tim Cook, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Tesla’s Elon Musk, Alibaba’s Jack Ma and Xiaomi’s Lei Jun. Why choose? Hedge your risks. Only the paranoid survive. Looking at its success today, it is easy to forget that it took Nvidia wandering in the wild for 30 years before striking gold. It’s no overnight unicorn. Its first chip was a massive flop. Its second was doomed to fail: Japan’s Sega had contracted Nvidia to develop a new game console using an unconventional 3D rendering approach. Microsoft subsequently announced a competing standard, which ultimately was adopted by the rest of the industry. Nvidia instead pivoted to build a compatible Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) that accelerated the performance under the emerging Windows standard. Then, in 2006, Nvidia discovered that its graphics cards could do more than make pictures and videos. They could accelerate other fast, repetitive tasks - ideal for areas like machine learning. To tap this potential, the company released CUDA. Programming GPUs directly is complex. CUDA made it much easier by providing a set of tools that anyone could use to write code and use GPUs. Nvidia then poured at least US$10 billion into CUDA, according to their numbers from back in 2017. CUDA was already a game changer and here’s the kicker: CUDA was free. In one fell swoop, anyone with programming skills could experiment. And everyone did - from Tesla to Sony and Amazon, from students at Berkeley to MIT. Machine learning, artificial intelligence and scientific computing were big winners from widespread experimentation. That’s how OpenAI and Meta became Nvidia’s biggest customers. It was a huge and risky leap at the time into what Mr Huang now calls a “zero billion dollar” AI market. He understood that Nvidia needed to be more significant in the age of AI to develop new applications around machine learning. But far more than one who has risen from rags to riches, Mr Huang is the embodiment of persistence and realism , rather than just raw talent. He was the awkward immigrant who endured a gauntlet of hardships during his childhood. He credits his first job at a fast food restaurant for helping him learn the value of efficiency and hard work. He had realistic expectations of himself and what Nvidia could achieve within a limited time. “People with very high expectations have very low resilience, and unfortunately, resilience matters in success,” he said in March at his alma mater Stanford. He even went as far as wishing “ample doses of pain and suffering” upon the students, believing these experiences to be essential for personal growth and success. Ultimately, the world is tired of loud-mouthed Silicon Valley leaders who overpromise and underdeliver. They pretend to save humanity, dream of space travel and throw money at trying to live forever . Jensen Huang isn’t interested - he’s busy building more advanced GPUs to enable others to dream big. His quiet but steady determination is refreshing in an industry known for its hype and bluster. This grounded approach has endear ed him to fans, Wall Street, and notably, to his own employees . When was the last time we saw such a craze for Mr Zuckerberg or Mr Cook?

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary The meeting between Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un has generated less concern in South Korea than internationally – and a surprising consensus about China, say Erik Mobrand from Seoul National University and Hyejin Kim from National University of Singapore. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SEOUL: Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to North Korea this week has grabbed headlines in international media, as a step toward consolidating an authoritarian bloc against a Western democratic grouping. But the view from South Korea is more nuanced than international coverage might have us think. After all, while Mr Putin was lavishly welcomed by Kim Jong Un on Wednesday (Jun 19), President Yoon Suk Yeol was announcing a national emergency - over low birth rates , not defence or foreign relations. The meeting was not exactly a huge cause for concern in South Korea. Both progressive and conservative voices in local media have concurred that there are factors tempering worry. For the conservative paper Donga Ilbo, this friendship between “gangster states” cannot last long. The warm relations are for present convenience, offering support to Moscow’s war campaign in exchange for much-needed international business for Pyongyang; the prospects for enduring friendship are dim. Another report noted general agreement among experts that there was \"almost no possibility that, for the sake of the war in Ukraine, Russia selects North Korea and cuts diplomatic ties with South Korea\". The trade volume between South Korea and Russia in 2023 stood at 500 times that between North Korea and Russia. In other words, economic interdependence gives Seoul the trump card in dealing with Moscow. That said, Seoul will not and should not take its eye off the Putin-Kim relationship. A first concern is about security obligations between North Korea and Russia. The two countries signed a mutual support agreement on Wednesday, that might oblige them to come to each other’s defence in the event of war. It is this point that gives concern in South Korea, especially to progressives, as it would entwine Korean peninsula matters in wider conflicts. A second concern is that Russia could share weapons technology with North Korea. For example, the transfer of missile technologies could allow North Korean long-range missiles fitted with nuclear warheads to reach the continental United States. This point, made by conservative voices, is a call for American support. What should Seoul do in response? Here, there is a surprisingly high degree of agreement across South Korean perspectives. While stressing the US alliance as the core of any response, there is something of a consensus on the next priority as well. Progressives and conservatives agree that South Korea’s diplomacy toward China is crucial. The current conservative government has distanced the country from China, at least in speeches. The tone this week from voices that normally support the Yoon administration is different, calling for more strategic communications with China to remind it that tight partnership between Russia and North Korea could be destabilising in the region. There is a historic precedent here. When tension on the peninsula boiled over in 1950, and with Soviet support for Pyongyang’s invasion of the South, China eventually found itself pressured to intervene in a major military confrontation. South Korea knows that leaders in Beijing will not be relishing the idea of Moscow causing instability in its backyard. The emphasis on China - across the political spectrum - reflects the pragmatism in South Korea’s external engagement today. The story told increasingly from Washington of an “us” and “them” world sits awkwardly in Seoul, even if the president and foreign ministry mimic that language from time to time. For decades now, South Korea has enmeshed itself in economic and diplomatic ties around the world. Under the liberal world order, that was the game and Seoul played it well. The treaty alliance with the United States is a foundation of South Korean security, but it has not been taken as a determinant of who the East Asian nation’s friends and partners would be. This view has been seen in South Korea’s response to Russian military aggression in Ukraine. Unlike in Europe and in North America, in South Korea Russia’s war in Ukraine is not treated by all as a threat to global democracy. An interest in maintaining trade relations with Russia has been one basis for this view. Another argument is that this war is not Korea’s: Getting involved can feel like being pushed around by Americans and ceding yet more control over foreign relations. Seoul has sent non-lethal equipment and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine but has so far not broken its policy against supplying weapons to an active military confrontation. On Thursday, South Korea said it would reconsider providing weapons. In this view, Mr Putin’s visit reflects a missed opportunity, for South Korea, for North Korea, and for the wider region. If only Washington and Seoul had worked a bit harder to foster dialogue with Pyongyang, then perhaps the overture from Moscow would not have been the international opening for Mr Kim. In Seoul, there is disappointment at the Russian visit to Pyongyang even if the diagnoses differ. Some lay blame at the feet of the North Korean leadership and its partners. Others see the causes as more complex, with American and South Korean leaders also called out for taking antagonising postures that foster a charged, ideological and Cold War-like tension. But indignation is not the overwhelming reaction in South Korea. The views are subtler and call for caution in deciding Seoul’s next moves. For better or worse, South Koreans are not on a crusade.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Thai tearjerker How To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies is a reminder for us to spend more meaningful time with our ageing parents and grandparents, because, let’s face it, they won’t be around forever, says Tracy Lee. M’s fumbling attempts to win over his cantankerous grandmother are initially met with resistance, but mutual trust, affection and understanding grow between them over time. (Screengrab/IMDb) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: If you haven’t watched How To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies yet, please do so. Better yet, bring the whole family. Book a seven-seater MPV (or two if you are lucky enough to have a large multigenerational family) to fit in your kids, parents, grandparents and their wheelchairs as well. “Inspired by true stories found in every family”, the Thai drama follows self-absorbed, feckless university dropout M (Putthipong Assaratanakul), who volunteers to move in with his grandmother (Usha Seamkhum) after she is diagnosed with late-stage cancer. Ostensibly, it’s to take care of her, but M’s real motive is to get Amah to bequeath her house to him. M’s fumbling attempts to win over his cantankerous grandmother are initially met with resistance, but over time and as her health takes a turn for the worse, his greedy self-interest and her suspiciousness of him give way to mutual trust, affection and understanding even as complicated relational dynamics play out between them and among other family members. Hilarious in parts, profoundly moving in others, and painfully real, the movie had cinemagoers dabbing away tears, sniffling into tissues, and even bursting into uncontrollable sobs. Being Teochew-Chinese like M, I recall how sulky and resentful I had felt as a teenager at being dragged along to mosquito-infested cemeteries during the annual Qing Ming tomb-sweeping festival, or having to participate in what I felt were archaic, superstitious rituals at my paternal grandmother’s funeral. Now that I’m older, I wish I’d realised then that those occasions were for the family to come together and honour our ancestors and cultural heritage. I wish I’d adopted an attitude of respectful curiosity and taken the opportunity to ask about our long-departed relatives, their lives and the meanings behind those customary practices. I am also not proud of myself as I recount this: When I was 19, my maternal grandmother, who had always been nothing but sweet and loving towards everyone, misplaced an expensive watch and some jewellery, and accused me of stealing them. I got so upset that I rudely said: “Why should I bother stealing from you, when all I need to do is wait for you to die to inherit your stuff?” and halted my weekly visits. She called a month later to say that she had found the missing items (they’d fallen into the gap between her dresser and bedroom wall), asked why I hadn't visited for so long, then invited me over for dinner because she was making ayam buah keluak “with plenty for you to tapow back to hostel”. Just like that, it was water under the bridge, and we resumed our chats about her favourite topics - Channel 8 period dramas, Fann Wong, and fashion. She relished talking about the clothes and hairstyles she used to wear, and how the nail polish or lipstick I was sporting was the same shade she had 40 years ago. How To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies touches on universal interfamilial issues almost anyone can relate to, such as sibling rivalry, favouritism, and judgments about who’s more filial or successful. M’s oldest uncle lives far away with his wife and young daughter, and has to pay for his posh house and his daughter’s international school fees; M’s mum is a single parent with a humble supermarket job; M’s youngest uncle is unemployed and up to his neck in debt. The tension between filial piety and personal commitments is laid bare , especially when elderly relatives become increasingly frail and need help with daily activities such as showering, or frequent hospital visits. As M’s coolly cynical cousin Mui points out, what old people need most, is what their children can’t give them - time. It’s something that Singapore’s sandwich generation, typically aged between 35 and 59, relate to as they juggle caring for their children and ageing parents, while holding down jobs, keeping their homes in order, carving out time for self-care and maintaining some semblance of a social life. The movie also highlights the challenges adult children face, and the potential for disagreement among siblings, when deciding how best to approach the care of ailing parents. Should the elderly be kept informed, or shielded from certain hard truths such as how many weeks or months they’ve got left to live? Are they better off ageing in place, moving into a relative’s home (if so, which one?), or being admitted into a nursing home? The movie is the perfect springboard to discuss these important issues as a family. More importantly, it’s a reminder that old folks value time with their adult children and their grandchildren. And since time is what grandchildren have more of compared to their sandwiched parents, maybe Gen Z can step away from their computers and mobile phones and step up. As M showed, seemingly vast intergenerational gaps can be bridged by spending time patiently getting to know a grandparent. Ask what help they need, then offer it - whether it’s heavy lifting, a grocery run or IT support. Learn a few words or phrases of the language or dialect they are most comfortable speaking. Ask them about their past, and you might uncover some precious gems about them, your family history or what you were like as a baby. Show affection through your tone of voice or the touch of your hand. Reminisce together about the ordinary or special childhood moments you shared when they were younger and more active. Did they take you to kindergarten, a favourite mee pok stall that no longer exists, or even on overseas holidays? Tell them about your dreams and plans, and yes, maybe even treat them to LOL moments by using selfie-editing apps like Meitu and BeautyCam on them. Sit and watch the tele or Netflix together , whether it’s a nature documentary, cooking show, TV series or even some silly reality show, and chat throughout. In the movie, M’s cousin Mui mentions how she spent so much time taking care of her grandfather and changing his adult diapers that she no longer noticed the odours. This struck a guilty chord with me and reminded me of my maternal grandfather, who had a colostomy due to colon cancer. As an immature, self-absorbed teen, I was put off by the strange gurgles and smells from grandpa’s stoma. Combined with his increasingly foul temper (which I didn’t realise then was due to the pain and difficulty of dealing with cancer) and a reignited passion for Teochew opera played at loud volumes, I found it easier to keep my distance. I regret that now. Just as you might your think your grandparents smell weird, they might find your tattoos, extreme nail art, floppy mop top hairstyle, bleached hair or oversized Crocs strange too. Let’s face it, our ageing parents and grandparents won’t be around forever. They understand that their children and grandchildren are busy juggling work, school, relationships and life, and they wish for us to succeed and be happy. But surely, we can all spare a little more time for the ones who breathed life and love into us, so that even after they're gone, we're filled with fond memories instead of bitter regret.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has put forth a proposition for countries seeking a “neutral and non-aligned location” amid the escalating US-China technology war: Choose Malaysia for semiconductor production, say these experts. KUALA LUMPUR: US-China competition resulting in economic and technological decoupling is motivating small and middle powers to create middle-ground alternatives. In that context, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has put forth a compelling proposition for countries seeking a “neutral and non-aligned location” amid the escalating US-China technology war: Choose Malaysia for semiconductor production. Anwar’s move underscores Malaysia’s aspiration not only to navigate through turbulent global economic waters but also to thrive in it. Central to the Malaysian proposal is the recently introduced National Semiconductor Strategy, under which the Malaysian government will invest RM25 billion (US$5.33 billion) to transform the nation into a global semiconductor hub. Plans are underway to develop an integrated circuit design park in Selangor and a “Silicon Island” off the coast of Penang. These projects reflect Malaysia’s efforts to not only position itself at the forefront of the global semiconductor industry but also create new alternatives away from China and the United States. Malaysia’s bid to attract investments beyond the US-China rivalry is not unique, but the country is well-positioned to succeed. Despite lacking a large domestic market, Malaysia offers excellent infrastructure and connectivity, a reliable and skilled workforce, an extensive network of free trade agreements, and pro-business policies. Domestic political challenges appear to be dissipating , further enhancing Malaysia’s appeal as a stable and attractive investment destination. That said, Malaysia’s neutrality claim would attain more credibility if Anwar embraces the Indo-Pacific construct with the same zeal. The US-China competition, particularly over Taiwan and the South China Sea, continues to pose significant risks. Still reeling from the global economic disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic, US-China decoupling strategies are contributing to an increasingly fragmented global trading system. Malaysia, with its highly open economy and strategic location in the Indo-Pacific region, stands to lose considerably if tensions escalate. Naturally, as with other small and middle powers, Malaysia wants to ensure its economy remains insulated, or at worse, resilient to these challenges. By providing an avenue for alternative supply chains to develop, it reduces the risk of disruption which was one of the major factors affecting the Malaysian economy in recent years. Anwar has also been a vocal advocate for the establishment of an Asian Monetary Fund as a regionally focused finance institution, along with the pursuit of de-dollarisation to ensure that the international financial architecture is not dominated unfairly by Western powers. Motivations for de-dollarisation are multi-faceted. They range from reducing a country’s exposure to the negative impact of “error-fraught monetary policy” to the continued weaponisation of the US dollar, for example, with sanctions. Rising economies such as India are already taking steps to trade in their currencies, as was illustrated by the recently signed Malaysia-India agreement to trade in Indian rupees. Saudi Arabia’s decision to stop oil trading in the US dollar and open itself up for trade in other currencies is the most recent indication of this trend. In Malaysia’s case, the goal would include insulating itself from the adverse effects of erratic US monetary policies, but also as a means of strengthening the ringgit which has never regained its pre-1997 levels. While de-dollarisation and an Asian Monetary Fund may not immediately challenge the dominance of the US dollar or existing international institutions, they offer small and middle powers such as Malaysia greater flexibility and autonomy. These initiatives are designed to mitigate potential fallout from geopolitical rivalry and to shield Malaysia from uncertainties should the competition intensify. Recognising the divisive nature of the US-China competition, Anwar has also called for a more cohesive and assertive ASEAN. As chair of ASEAN in 2025, Malaysia is afforded a prime opportunity to push for deeper integration and perhaps even more de-dollarisation. Considering ASEAN’s history of institutional inertia may pose challenges, Malaysia is moving ahead with plans to join BRICS+ , an inter-regional organisation where such ideas may find more traction. Malaysia’s participation will certainly add value to an organisation that already represents 37.3 per cent of global GDP, and in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) is reported to have surpassed the G7 grouping. With other ASEAN members such as Thailand also showing interest, Indonesia may be encouraged to re-consider membership. Malaysia’s ambition with BRICS+ may be viewed by some as a sign the country is tilting towards China. But such an assessment would be victim to a false dichotomy. Taken as a whole, Malaysia’s policies in pursuit of the National Semiconductor Strategy, the Asian Monetary Fund, and de-dollarisation initiatives all reflect a desire to enhance Malaysia’s economic resilience, independence, and to protect itself from the geopolitical machinations of great power politics. These efforts can additionally contribute towards Malaysia’s broader vision of a more balanced, equitable and democratised international order. Greater partnership with like-minded countries in ASEAN, BRICS+, and the wider Indo-Pacific region, including India, and Saudi Arabia, may greatly assist Malaysia in its endeavours.

(Photo: AFP/R Satish Babu) KALLAKURICHI,India: The death toll from a batch of toxic illegal alcohol in India had risen to 56, police said on Monday (Jun 24), with 117 people in hospital recovering from the deadly drink. Last week, hundreds of people in the Kallakurichi district in the southern state of Tamil Nadu consumed a batch of locally made \"arrack\", which was laced with methanol. Hundreds of people die every year in India from cheap alcohol made in backstreet distilleries, but this poisoning is one of the worst in recent years. To increase its potency, the liquor is often spiked with methanol, which can cause blindness, liver damage and death. Top district police official Rajat Chaturvedi told AFP that \"56 people have died so far and around 117 people are currently under medical treatment\". Political rivals in the state have blamed each other for the deaths, and the site of the tragedy witnessed a protest by local opposition politicians Monday. Tamil Nadu is not a dry state, but liquor traded on the black market comes at a lower price than alcohol sold legally. Selling and consuming liquor is prohibited in several other parts of India, further driving the thriving black market for potent and sometimes lethal moonshine. Last year, poisonous alcohol killed at least 27 people in one sitting in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, while in 2022, at least 42 people died in Gujarat. Indian media reported that poor labourers in Kallakurichi district regularly bought liquor in plastic bags costing 60 rupees (US$0.70), which they would drink before work. This batch, however, was devastating. Some people went blind, while others collapsed in the street and died before they could make it to the hospital.

(Photo: REUTERS/Beawiharta) JAKARTA: Indonesia's budget deficit is forecast to increase this year and may widen further as President-elect Prabowo Subianto implements his policy agenda, but revenue-side reforms could keep the gap under the legislated ceiling, the World Bank said on Monday (Jun 24). The deficit is forecast to widen to 2.5 per cent of GDP this year from 1.7 per cent in 2023 as cost-of-living measures and falling commodity prices hit the budget bottom line, the multinational lender said in its Indonesia Economic Prospects report.\"The fiscal stance expanded slightly amid rising social spending and subsiding commodity windfalls,\" it said. The deficit is then expected to hold at 2.5 per cent of GDP in 2025 as Prabowo begins implementing his campaign promises, before narrowing slightly to 2.4 per cent in 2026.Southeast Asia's largest economy has laws mandating that the annual budget deficit cannot exceed 3 per cent of GDP, and setting a maximum debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 per cent of GDP. Concerns about the impact of Prabowo's policies on the deficit and debt ratios have added to the pressure on the rupiah and bond yields in recent weeks. Prabowo's aides have repeatedly said he would abide by the fiscal rules. His flagship program of giving students free, nutritious meals will cost 450 trillion rupiah (US$27.35 billion), equal to about 2 per cent of the value of GDP, when fully implemented, according to the president-elect's team.\"Because these (social programs) are important and can further boost human capital in Indonesia, there is a need to ensure their sustainability going forward,\" Wael Mansour, a senior economist at the World Bank, said in a media briefing. \"Hence, it is important to implement them gradually and within a fiscally sound way.\" The forecasts assumed Prabowo, who starts his five-year term in October, would implement the meals policy gradually and complement it with reforms that could boost tax receipts by 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent of the value of GDP annually. Revenue reforms could include lowering tax thresholds, removing exemptions and improving audits, the report said. The World Bank cautioned that global economic uncertainties remained a risk to the country's external balance and fiscal positions. \"External shocks such as a potential intensification of armed conflicts or geopolitical uncertainty could result in a sharper-than-expected decline in the terms of trade, resulting in lower revenues and a tighter fiscal and external position,\" it said. The World Bank forecast economic growth would be 5.0 per cent in 2024, compared with 5.05 per cent in 2023, and then rise to 5.1 per cent for both 2025 and 2026. Prabowo, who is currently Indonesia's defence minister, has pledged to boost growth to 8 per cent within his term. The World Bank estimated Indonesia's current account deficit relative to GDP would progressively widen to 0.9 per cent in 2024, 1.4 per cent in 2025 and 1.6 per cent in 2026, from 0.1 per cent last year. Indonesia's trade surplus has already narrowed this year, with lower commodity prices reducing export receipts.

    "article_content": "Business Business FILE PHOTO: The Japanese national flag waves at the Bank of Japan building in Tokyo, Japan March 18, 2024. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo TOKYO: The Bank of Japan debated in June the chance of a near-term interest rate hike with one policymaker calling for an increase without delay to address risks of inflation overshooting expectations, a meeting summary showed on Monday (Jun 24). The discussion highlights the board's growing awareness over heightening inflationary pressure in the world's third-largest economy, which could prod the BOJ to debate raising interest rates as early as its next policy meeting on Jul 30-31. The yen's recent declines have heightened the possibility of an upward revision to the BOJ's inflation forecasts, which means the appropriate level of its policy rate could move higher, one member was quoted as saying at the Jun 13-14 policy meeting. \"The BOJ must continue to closely monitor data leading up to the next policy meeting\" in July, as upside risks to prices have become \"more noticeable,\" said another opinion. \"If deemed appropriate, the BOJ should raise its policy rate without too much delay.\" The central bank must consider whether further rate hikes are needed as inflation could exceed its forecasts if companies renew efforts to pass on recent rising costs, a third opinion said. Some in the nine-member board, however, were more cautious about an imminent rate hike, citing the need to scrutinise whether rising wages will lift consumption out of the doldrums, the summary showed. At the June meeting, the BOJ kept short-term rates intact at a range of 0-0.1 per cent but decided to announce a detailed plan next month on reducing its US$5 trillion balance sheet in a sign it was moving steadily towards normalising monetary policy. With inflation exceeding its 2 per cent target for two years, the BOJ has also dropped hints it will raise short-term rates to levels that neither cool nor overheat the economy - seen by analysts as somewhere between 1-2 per cent. Many market participants expect the BOJ to raise rates again some time this year, though they are divided on whether the timing could come as early as July or later in the year. Japan's core inflation hit 2.5 per cent in May, accelerating from the previous month's 2.2 per cent due largely to higher energy levies. The weak yen complicates the BOJ's policy path. While it helps keep inflation above its 2 per cent target, the boost it gives to imported goods prices has hurt consumption by pushing up households' living costs. The dollar briefly hit ¥159.62 on Friday, not far from the 34-year trough of 160.245 hit on Apr 29 that prompted Japan to intervene in the market. It stood at 159.87 yen in Asia on Monday. \"Monetary policy is conducted based on the BOJ's assessment of trend inflation and wage developments, not on short-term developments in the foreign exchange market,\" one opinion showed, brushing aside a view held by some market players the bank could hike rates soon to slow the yen's declines.

(Photo: REUTERS/Issei Kato) TOKYO: Japan is always ready to take action against excessive market moves, Tokyo's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda said on Monday (Jun 24), as the yen fell close to 160 to the dollar, raising market caution for fresh intervention. \"We won't comment on day-to-day currency moves as such comments could give the market unforeseen effects, but we are always to ready to take appropriate action when there are excessive moves,\" Kanda told reporters. The yen has been under pressure after the Bank of Japan's decision this month to hold off on reducing bond-buying stimulus until its July meeting. The dollar traded at ¥159.87 early Monday. Kanda said that he was aware that the yen's decline towards 160 to the dollar prompts market caution about intervention, but noted that the authorities have set no specific levels in mind on when to intervene. The market widely sees ¥160 to the dollar as the authorities' line in the sand. Japan spent some ¥9.8 trillion (US$61.64 billion) to pull the currency out of a 34-year trough of 160.245 per dollar hit on Apr 29. The steps, however, have failed to reverse the yen's weakness due partly to wide Japan-US interest rate differentials. Kanda also said the addition of Japan to the US Treasury's foreign exchange monitoring list had \"absolutely no impact\" on Tokyo's policy options. A US Treasury report issued on Thursday added Japan to its foreign exchange monitoring list alongside six countries that were on the previous list. \"Japan has policy leeway to ensure that foreign exchange rates move in a stable manner reflecting fundamentals,\" Kanda said. Issues emerge with currency intervention when a country tries to weaken its currency to boost exports, but \"what we are doing is exactly the opposite to that,\" he added. \"We will firmly respond to moves that are too rapid or driven by speculators,\" he said. \"If no action is taken to such moves, people, companies and households would suffer.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

(Photo: CNA/Syamil Sapari) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A man who has never been recognised as an Islamic or Quranic teacher went on trial on Monday (Jun 24) for teaching an incorrect doctrine that allowed gambling and \"spiritual marriage\" for Muslims. Mohd Razif Radi, a 66-year-old Singaporean, is contesting one count under the Administration of Muslim Law Act for teaching a doctrine that is contrary to Muslim law. He is accused of doing so from 2004 to 2020 by delivering three false teachings: That gambling can be made permissible, that a male and a female can be validly married by way of a spiritual marriage, and that he was able to summon the spirit of \"Mbah\". \"Mbah\" is purportedly the \"last prophet\" or from the prophet's lineage. According to a statement of agreed facts shared between the prosecution and the defence, Razif set up an eatery known as Lina's Cafe at 7 Jalan Pisang in around 2017 with a woman named Marlinah Ahmad. According to previous reports, Razif allegedly ran an unregistered religious school at the cafe. Before the trial started on Monday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Hidayat Amir made two applications: First, for three prosecution witnesses to give evidence in camera and not in public view, and second, for all prosecution witnesses to be protected by gag order. Mr Hidayat said the prosecution witnesses had expressed \"feelings of distress\" over testifying in public due to the \"sensitive nature\" of their testimonies, which will \"go beyond issues of religion and culture which are already sensitive to begin with\". This includes the topic of spiritual marriages and the effect of this on their family members. \"They are innocents,\" said Mr Hidayat. \"Their evidence, if heard in public, will cause re-traumatisation (and) embarrassment.\" Razif's lawyer, Mr Simon Tan from Attorneys Inc, asked for a similar gag order to be extended to the defence witnesses. He said these are \"very, very sensitive matters\" which will \"invariably impact on their standing in the Muslim community\". Mr Tan added that most of the witnesses are women, who might feel a \"sense of trepidation and fear\" if their evidence is \"openly bandied in court\" including in front of their former spouses. Mr Tan said the defence witnesses \"have been very much ostracised in the Muslim community\". The prosecution objected to having a gag order for the defence witnesses. The judge first allowed the prosecution's twin applications for gag orders for its witnesses and for some of the evidence to be heard in camera. He told the defence that he would not be granting the gag order for defence witnesses now, but said the defence could make the appropriate applications at the relevant juncture. The police said in an earlier statement that they began investigating the case after the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) lodged a report against Razif on Aug 24, 2021. The trial continues before District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan. If convicted of teaching a doctrine that is contrary to Muslim law, Razif could be jailed for up to 12 months, fined up to S$2,000, or both.

SINGAPORE: The temporary hike to the taxi surcharge on rides from Changi Airport and attractions at Mandai Wildlife Reserve will be made permanent from Jul 1. ComfortDelGro and Strides Premier announced the impending permanent surcharge hikes on their Facebook pages on Monday (Jun 24). ComfortDelGro added that \"location surcharges are imposed by the respective locations\". In response to CNA's queries, Trans-Cab also said that it would implement the permanent fare hikes from Changi Airport and Mandai Wildlife from Jul 1. CNA understands that Prime Taxi will follow suit in the next few days. The S$8 (US$6) daily surcharge for taxi trips from Changi Airport from 5pm to 11.59pm, and S$6 at all other times was first introduced in May 2022, before being extended . Changi Airport said in 2022 that this was to \"ensure a better supply of taxis\" to the airport for passengers. The airport told CNA on Monday it has seen a \"significant increase\" in taxi supply following the surcharge adjustment in 2022. Industry stakeholders, including taxi companies and taxi drivers, were consulted before the hike was first applied, it added. The temporary location surcharge from the Singapore Zoo, River Wonders, Night Safari and Bird Paradise for trips between 1pm and 11.59pm daily will also be made permanent from Jul 1, with the surcharge increasing from S$3 to S$5. The temporary location surcharges were introduced over two years ago to cushion the impact of the recent increase in fuel prices and also ensure a better supply of taxis for passengers. Both ComfortDelgro and Strides Premier said the revised permanent surcharge changes would only be reflected on their respective websites from Jul 1.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore A view of the skyline in Singapore. (File photo: REUTERS/Caroline Chia) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Singapore’s core inflation stayed at 3.1 per cent in May, unchanged from April and March . This is slightly higher than the 3.0 per cent forecast by a Reuters poll of economists. An increase in services inflation was offset by lower electricity and gas, and retail and other goods inflation, according to data from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Jun 24). On a month-on-month basis, core inflation - which excludes accommodation and private transport - rose by 0.1 per cent in April. Meanwhile, consumer price index, or headline inflation, went up to 3.1 per cent year-on-year in May, from 2.7 per cent in April, driven by higher private transport inflation. On a month-on-month basis, headline inflation increased by 0.7 per cent. Electricity and gas inflation fell from 7.6 per cent to 6.9 per cent due to a smaller increase in electricity prices. Retail and other goods inflation dipped from 1.6 per cent to 1.5 per cent. MAS and MTI attributed this to a slower pace of increase in prices of personal effects, as well as alcoholic beverages and tobacco. Services inflation increased slightly - from 3.5 per cent to 3.6 per cent in - on the back of a \"larger increase in holiday expenses and a smaller decline in airfares\". Food inflation remained at 2.8 per cent, reflecting stable food services inflation, even though non-cooked food inflation registered a \"modest increase\". Accommodation inflation eased slightly from 3.5 per cent to 3.4 per cent due to smaller increases in housing rents. Global prices of energy and most food commodities have remained relatively stable in recent months, said MAS and MTI. The costs of Singapore’s imported intermediate and final manufactured goods have also continued on a broad decline. Inflation for services associated with overseas travel has remained firm but should moderate further over the course of the year as the air transport and hospitality sectors around the world gradually restore supply. \"MAS core inflation is expected to stay on a gradual moderating trend over the rest of the year and step down more discernibly in Q4 2024, as import cost pressures continue to decline and tightness in the domestic labour market eases,\" said MAS and MTI. The authorities also expect private transport inflation to moderate from last year amid the larger projected COE supply in 2024. Accommodation inflation should also continue to ease as the supply of housing units available for rental increases over the course of the year. MAS and MTI projected both headline and core inflation to average 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent in 2024. \"Excluding the transitory effects of the 1 per cent-point increase in the GST rate to 9 per cent, headline and core inflation are expected to come in at 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent.\" They warned that risks to the inflation outlook remain as fresh geopolitical shocks, adverse weather events, and further transportation disruptions around the world could put upward pressure on global energy and food commodity prices, as well as shipping costs. \"Domestically, a stronger-than-expected labour market could also lead to a re-acceleration in wage growth,\" said MAS and MTI. \"Conversely, an unexpected weakening in the global economy could induce a greater easing of cost and price pressures.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

(Photo: AFP/Yonhap) SEOUL: Around 20 bodies have been found at a South Korean lithium battery factory after a massive blaze on Monday (Jun 24), the Yonhap news agency said, with firefighters saying they were still searching the building. More than 100 people were working in the factory when workers heard a series of explosions from the second floor, where lithium-ion batteries are inspected and packaged, firefighter Kim Jin-young told media. About 78 people were confirmed safe but many more were still missing, with Yonhap saying that \"about 20 bodies (were) found\" at the site, after rescue workers finally managed to get inside. Kim told media that they had managed to put out the largest fire at the factory and were pulling bodies out of the charred building. \"A rescue team has gone inside and is carrying out search and rescue operations,\" he said. Images shared by Yonhap after the fire broke out showed huge plumes of billowing grey smoke rising into the sky above the factory, with orange flames inside the building. Dozens of fire engines were seen outside. The vast factory had an estimated 35,000 battery cells in storage on the second floor, with more batteries stored in other areas. Lithium batteries burn hot and fast, and are difficult to control with conventional fire extinguishing methods. \"Due to fears of additional explosions, it was difficult to enter,\" Kim said. \"As it is a lithium battery manufacturer, we determined that spraying water will not extinguish the fire, so we are currently using dry sand,\" he added. The lithium battery plant is owned by Aricell, a South Korean primary battery manufacturer. It is located in Hwaseong city, just south of the capital Seoul. Lithium batteries are used in everything from laptops to electric vehicles but can be highly explosive, with airlines, for example, imposing strict regulations on checking devices containing them. South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol issued emergency instructions to authorities, telling them to \"mobilise all available personnel and equipment to focus on searching for and rescuing people\", his office said. The president also warned authorities that they should \"ensure the safety of firefighters considering the rapid spread of fire\". Firefighting and rescue efforts were ongoing, and the cause of the fire was unknown. Authorities in Hwaseong sent out a series of alerts to residents warning them to stay inside. \"There is a lot of smoke due to factory fires. Please pay attention to safety, such as refraining from going out,\" one alert sent by text message said. \"Factory fire. Please detour to surrounding roads and nearby citizens please close windows,\" another one read. South Korea is a major producer of batteries, including those used in electric vehicles. Its battery makers supply EV makers around the world, including Tesla. South Korea is also one of the world's largest producers of high-end semiconductors, and the government has invested heavily in key technologies including displays and batteries.

    "article_content": "Asia exclusive exclusive Asia Amid intense behind-the-scenes lobbying, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s government is set to allow Bestinet Sdn Bhd to continue operating the IT platform that manages the intake of migrant labour into the country. But the planned new three-year concession faces government-imposed conditions, possibly setting the stage for more political wrangling. This audio is generated by an AI tool. KUALA LUMPUR: Bestinet Sdn Bhd, a private entity with political clout that has long had a stranglehold over Malaysia’s migrant labour recruitment system, is set to get a fresh three-year contract to manage the country’s foreign workforce intake, government sources say. The new contract heads off the Home Ministry’s plan – reported last month by CNA – to replace Bestinet’s proprietary IT system that manages the intake of migrant workers by Malaysia , and spotlights hurdles in the economic reform agenda of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s administration. The proposed new arrangement will come with strict conditions for the company, sources say, setting the stage for more behind-the-scenes political manoeuvring between the government and the powerful Bestinet lobby. According to sources, the company would be required to surrender control of its payment systems under the firm’s proprietary IT system, the Foreign Workers Centralised Management System (FWCMS). Bestinet was informed last week of the new conditions by the Home Ministry, which supervises the migrant labour recruitment system together with the Human Resources Ministry. The last FWCMS contract with the government expired at the end of May. Only after the company accepts the new terms will a fresh three-year arrangement be finalised, the government officials said. One key element in the proposed contract extension is that Bestinet must hand over to the government its so-called Swift code, alphanumeric ciphers used by banks globally for the international transfer of funds, and other protocols in the payment system that the company employs in the processing of migrant workers into Malaysia, the administration sources said. Kuala Lumpur would then make payment to Bestinet for its services. A Bestinet company executive declined to discuss queries from CNA. The spokesperson noted that the government of Malaysia “would make any necessary announcement, if any”. Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail, who is personally overseeing the Bestinet issue, did not respond to queries from CNA about the planned three-year extension to the company under the new conditions. But local and foreign labour activists noted that Bestinet has already signalled news about its continued role to recruitment agents in countries such as Nepal, Myanmar and India, asking them to update their licences before mid-June with their respective governments to qualify as employment representatives under Malaysia’s FWCMS platform. CNA has reviewed these email notifications. “That Bestinet has received an extension is not (a) secret in the (migrant labour) market and it is disappointing because the country is being held to ransom by continuing with the company’s platform,” noted Mr Charles Santiago, a former elected Member of Parliament who is part of a government-private sector working committee involved in bringing change to the country’s migrant labour recruitment system. Bestinet’s FWCMS concession, which is the sole platform used by the country’s Immigration Department for visa applications from 15 countries exporting labour to Malaysia since 2013, has long attracted domestic and international scorn over allegations of rampant corruption and the exploitation of impoverished overseas recruits. As reported earlier by CNA, the Malaysian government had planned to replace the 11-year concession with a new IT portal that has been under development for the past year that government proponents noted would make the process of foreign labour recruitment cheaper, more transparent and minimise third-party involvement. But that plan faced serious pushback. Bestinet’s top management, including its founder Mohamed Amin Abdul Nor, and labour agents aligned with the company put pressure on the Anwar government by tapping their connections with Malaysia’s political elite and segments of the country’s royal households to secure a fresh multi-year extension for its FWCMS concession. Political operatives in Mr Anwar’s inner circle acknowledged that the premier and the Home Ministry had come under intense lobbying. The big test facing the government now is whether Bestinet will accept the new terms under the proposed three-year extension or once again turn to its politically powerful patrons to pile pressure on Mr Anwar’s administration and further undermine the government’s economic reforms, noted labour activists. Government officials declined to discuss the new conditions over the payment protocols and the demand for Bestinet to surrender the Swift code. Labour activists speculated that the move could be aimed at dealing with the widespread problems associated with the recruitment of workers from Bangladesh, which is one of Malaysia’s main sources of foreign labour. T he official fee for a single Bangladeshi recruit is roughly RM4,500 (US$955) but, in reality, each migrant worker pays nearly four times that amount to a cast of players in a convoluted recruitment process that also involves forcing employers to pay hidden fees for each worker . Before assuming the premiership after an inconclusive general election in November 2022, Mr Anwar and his coalition partners in the Pakatan Harapan (PH) alliance had been hugely critical of Bestinet’s stranglehold on migrant labour intake, which was granted by the previous government led by now-jailed former premier Najib Razak. But pushing through reforms has been an uphill struggle for Mr Anwar because of Malaysia’s messy politics. Mr Anwar was forced to forge an alliance with the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and other unlikely political bedfellows to form a unity government and become premier. While the ruling alliance, headed by PH together with other regional parties in the east Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, enjoys a solid majority in the 222-member p arliament, relations between the component parties remain testy and tenuous, forcing the premier to often make compromises that trump the reform platform. “The country is being held hostage by the players in the foreign labour recruitment system and unless the government gets tough, (Mr Anwar’s) reforms will go nowhere,” said Mr Santiago. Mr Santiago noted that Malaysia's reliance on foreign labour, together with groups of undocumented migrants who sneak into the country through its porous borders with the help of human trafficking syndicates, has created other distortions to the economy. For one, the large presence of a cheap foreign labour force has allowed the private sector to keep a lid on wages, which in turn has hurt many ordinary Malaysians in the lower income brackets. “Putting food on the table is a fundamental issue for many ordinary Malaysians and a political problem for the government. The only way is to deal with the migrant labour problem decisively,” said Mr Santiago. According to official statistics, documented migrant workers make up about 15 per cent of Malaysia’s workforce and many work in so-called 3D – dirty, dangerous and demeaning – jobs that are usually shunned by locals. Combined with undocumented workers, their numbers could be around 5.5 million based on unofficial estimates. The migrant labour ecosystem has also blighted Malaysia’s international standing due to collusion among politicians, the country’s entrenched and powerful civil service, enforcement agencies, recruitment companies, labour brokers and exploitative employers. This has resulted in Malaysia being listed with the likes of China and North Korea for its poor progress in eliminating human trafficking by the United States State Department, which is set to release its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report today (Jun 24). The TIP Report is a closely tracked assessment that evaluates global trafficking trends and focuses on government efforts in prosecution, protection and prevention. Malaysia is currently ranked on Tier 2 in the US TIP Report, but Mr Andy Hall, a Nepal-based labour activist who has done extensive work on the migrant labour situation in Malaysia, noted that its situation is precarious. “Malaysia's systemic inability to meaningfully combat labour trafficking, ensure remediation of victims and accountability of perpetrators warrants its immediate downgrade to Tier 3 in the upcoming 2024 US Department of State TIP Report,” he said in a statement to CNA. Malaysia was downgraded to Tier 3 in 2021 and 2022, a period that saw five companies being slapped with export bans to the US.

    "article_content": "Asia Asia The Medan Metropolitan Police Department shared the list showing the alleged suspects in their full police uniforms that was subsequently posted on social media. MEDAN: Police in Indonesia’s North Sumatra province are on the hunt for 13 former cops who were allegedly involved in a suspected motorcycle theft syndicate even as social media was set ablaze by the authorities’ revelation of the crimes with the issuance of a “wanted list” involving them. Last week, the Medan Metropolitan Police Department shared a wanted list featuring 15 people who themselves were members of the department that was subsequently posted on social media. All have since been dismissed from their posts. Of the 15, two have already been dealt with by the law. They were shown on the wanted list wearing their police uniforms in the photos , and the images are now displayed on the announcement board at the Medan Metropolitan Police Department headquarters. According to a report from Indonesian news outlet Kompas, the 15 former officers were allegedly involved in a motorcycle theft syndicate that had operated under the guise of a cash on delivery (COD) transaction system since October 2022. COD is a type of transaction where the recipient pays for a good at the time of delivery rather than using credit. Medan, the city in which the syndicate allegedly operated in , ranks as the second most crime-ridden city in Indonesia after Jakarta, according to 2020 data from the Central Bureau of Statistics. The city - which is the country’s fifth most populous - has even earned the moniker \"Gotham City\" akin to the shadowy fictional city in DC Comics where Bruce Wayne/Batman resides. Medan's current mayor is Mr Bobby Nasution, who is President Joko Widodo’s son-in-law. Two of the former officers on the list who had already been charged - and identified as Chief Brigadier Ari Galih Gumilang and First Brigadier Haris Kurnia Putra - had allegedly worked with two civilians and another cop to rob a man by posing as prospective buyers interested in purchasing a motorcycle that had been advertised for sale on Facebook. After an initial contact through WhatsApp, the prospective seller - identified as Mr Benny Setiawan Sembiring - agreed to meet up. Mr Sembiring brought along his wife and daughter. The two civilians colluding with the officers then came on a motorcycle to the meeting point posing as prospective buyers. \"At first, those two people came to inspect (my) motorcycle and learn how to use the remote control. I began to suspect something was off,\" Mr Sembiring reportedly told local media. Sometime later, Ari, Haris and the third cop - who was not included on the authorities’ wanted list - arrived and introduced themselves as officers from the North Sumatra Police Department. They confiscated Mr Sembiring’s motorcycle registration certificate and keys, claiming the vehicle was linked to a criminal case and insisting on taking it to Sunggal Police Station, one of Medan's district police stations. Mr Sembiring refused to surrender to their demands and began recording the incident. They then tried to take the motorcycle and the registration certificate forcefully but were thwarted when Mr Sembiring disabled the vehicle’s ignition. The group continued to threaten Mr Sembiring and tried to force him into their car. Mr Sembiring then threatened to call his associate at the North Sumatra Police Department: Chief Commissioner Tatan Dirsan Atmaja, who is the Director of Criminal Investigation. Upon hearing Mr Tatan’s name , the five hastily retreated to their vehicle to flee. Mr Sembiring’s wife was injured while attempting to prevent their escape and was dragged by the fleeing car. After the incident, Mr Sembiring reported the robbery attempt to the police. The three officers were subsequently apprehended. Investigations revealed that the trio had committed over 10 similar motorcycle thefts using the COD method. They had colluded with police officers from Sunggal Police Station and Helvetia Police Station in Medan. In addition, they were also found to be involved in drug offenses. The internal affairs division of North Sumatra Police dismissed them from service on Nov 11, 2022. Ari and the third cop were sentenced to 1.5 years jail each while Haris was imprisoned for a year. The two other men involved in Mr Sembiring’s attempted robbery remain at large. The remaining 13 officers on the wanted list have also been dishonorably dismissed, local media reported. Adjunct chief commissioner Sonny W Siregar, head of public information at the North Sumatra Police Department, said that some of the 15 former officers have been captured, but did not provide specifics on who had been arrested. The full list of wanted former officers include first Sub-Inspector Sutarso, Chief Brigadier Ari Galih Gumilang, Sutrisno, and Riswandi. The other wanted former officers - all with the rank of brigadier - are: Eliot TM Silitonga, Mulyadi, Refandi, Rudianto Ginting, Afriyanto Maha, Safril, M Ade Nugraha, and Jefri Suzaldi. The last three names on the list are First Brigadier Haris Kurnia Putra, Second Brigadier Erdi Kurniawan, and Second Brigadier Hasanudin Sitohang.

    "article_content": "Sport Sport FRANKFURT, Germany : Manuel Neuer praised the impact of Germany’s substitutes as they rescued a 1-1 draw with Switzerland on Sunday to top Group A at the European Championship, a result the goalkeeper feels is like a win for the tournament hosts. Germany fell behind to a Dan Ndoye goal in the first half and were frustrated by missed chances until substitute Niclas Fuellkrug rose to head them level in the 92nd minute to maintain their seven-match unbeaten run dating back to November. Another substitute, David Raum, provided the cross for the equalising goal, while 21-year-old Maxi Beier also impressed off the bench as Germany dominated the last 20 minutes. \"You should never write off a team, especially ours, especially with the substitutions we were able to make,\" Neuer told reporters. \"The players who came on were a breath of fresh air and the result feels a bit like a victory.\" Germany had found it hard to break down a resolute Swiss side before Fuellkrug’s goal, something they will have to improve on in the knockout rounds where they face the runner-up in Group C, currently Denmark, in Dortmund on Saturday. \"The Swiss did well, they were always tight and pressed us,\" Neuer said. Right back Joshua Kimmich acknowledged Germany had failed to reach the heights of their first two games in the pool against Scotland (5-1) and Hungary (2-0) and said they must find that level again if they are to claim a first continental title since 1996. \"We weren't quite as good over the 90 minutes (as the first two games) and I think a draw was a fair result. We can be satisfied with the point.\" Beier, who made his Euros debut in only his second cap, said the halftime message from coach Julian Nagelsmann was to move the ball quicker. \"Let the ball run faster to make the gaps bigger, that worked better in the second half,\" he added. \"The Swiss are a good opponent, they didn't make it easy for us.\" Hungary finished on three points in Group A after a 1-0 win over Scotland and must wait to find out if they will be one of the four best third-place finishers who advance to the round of 16. Scotland have been eliminated.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat also addressed questions on why containment booms were not pre-emptively deployed at beaches. Minister for Transport Chee Hong Tat speaks at a press conference on Jun 24, 2024, addressing the oil spill clean-up operations. (Photo: CNA/Marcus Mark Ramos) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Standard operating procedures (SOPs) were effective in cleaning up the 400 tonnes of oil that spilled in Singapore waters after a recent maritime accident, Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat said. Government agencies, its industry partners and volunteers have also done well in managing the incident, said the minister, who oversees the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), at a press conference on Monday (Jun 24). Minister for National Development Desmond Lee and Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu were present at the press conference. Mr Chee addressed questions on why containment booms were not pre-emptively deployed around beaches such as Sentosa and East Coast Park to prevent oil from reaching these areas. The oil spill occurred on the afternoon of Jun 14 after a Netherlands-flagged dredger hit a stationary bunker vessel, causing oil from the latter's damaged cargo tank to spill into the water. Detailing the timeline of events that day, Mr Chee said the response to the incident was well within industry standards. The first MPA patrol craft arrived 11 minutes after the incident at 2.33pm to spray dispersants at the water, and at 2.55pm, MPA contacted boom contractor T&T Salvage Asia to lay containment booms around the damaged bunker vessel. The team from T&T Salvage needed a few hours to load the heavy equipment and another few hours to sail to the site, said Mr Chee. Its boat arrived at the site at 9.41pm. Despite the challenges of working at night and under bad weather conditions, T&T “did well to deploy 200m of oil booms around the damaged vessel by working through the night”, and the deployment of the booms was completed at 5.15am the next day, Mr Chee said. “The steps taken by MPA and T&T and their response times are in line with international industry practices for responses to oil spills.” Furthermore, Mr Chee said Singapore has an established SOP for oil spills, and that an oil spill response exercise is conducted every two years which involves government agencies and industry partners. The last exercise was conducted in 2022 and the next exercise is planned for October this year. Mr Chee said that there is “some misperception” that the booms could have prevented the oil from floating away and going onto Singapore's shores. An oil spill is not the same as spilling coffee onto the floor, the minister said. “If you spill coffee on the floor, the coffee will remain there, you can go get a mop and clean,” he said. “Oil that spills into the ocean, especially if it’s a sudden discharge, a large amount, like what happened on Jun 14, the oil will not remain stationary. As deploying the containment boom around the oil spill would take several hours, \"we must expect a significant amount of oil that is spilled in the sea to be carried by tidal currents and waves to other locations\". Thus the main purpose of the containment around the damaged vessel is not to “fence in” the oil that has been spilled but a preventive measure in case of further leaks from the damaged vessel. “The containment boom can also help catch some of the oil spill which remain in the vicinity of the incident location and did not float elsewhere. But this is also not 100 per cent foolproof, because the tidal currents and waves can carry the oil to go below and above the booms,” he said. As to why the booms were not pre-emptively deployed to prevent oil from reaching beaches, he said it is simply not feasible to deploy booms along the entire coastline of Singapore. “If you are going to deploy booms along the entire southern coastline from Pasir Panjang to East Coast, that would require more than 46km of booms,” he said. The booms would also require maintenance and replacement as they are subject to the elements and some can snap. So, MPA would first assess the movement of the oil before deploying the booms. “MPA had therefore deployed vessels and crew to monitor surrounding waters signs of oil while it alerted other agencies to step up monitoring of the coastline,” he said. It also used predictive modelling of where the oil would move based on tidal predictions and real-time weather data, as well as predictions using satellite images. “This targeted approach is consistent with international practice, and ensures that the booms available are placed where they can be most effective,” he said. Since Jun 14, about 3.4km of booms have been laid to stop oil from flowing back to the sea, and to prevent oil from being washed ashore and into inland canals. Responding to a question by CNA on whether MPA is looking to improve on how quickly booms are deployed in an oil spill, Mr Chee said that the speed of deployment depends on many factors. “So if in a situation where it is a daytime operation and the weather is fine, definitely, I think the operator will be able to deploy more quickly compared to the situation that we had that day when it was night time and the weather conditions were not very good.” CNA also asked why MPA did not mention in its first media statement on the incident on Jun 14 about the possible spread of the oil spill. Mr Chee said that the immediate response was to deal with the issues at the incident site itself. “First is to make sure that there's no more spillage from the damaged vessel, because if you have oil that continues to come out in large amounts from the vessel, I think that will make the situation even worse,” he said. “They had to make sure first of all that the vessel is safe, it will not be at risk of sinking, the crew are okay (and) the damaged tank would not have continued spillage of oil,” he said. He added that the authorities also did not know where the oil would go. “You don't quite know at that point in time where you will float to, so therefore, which of the shores and the beaches will be affected.” On the day of the incident, MPA had alerted agencies, including the National Environment Agency, National Parks Board and Sentosa Development Corporation to be on the lookout for oil traces.

FILE PHOTO: A general view of the city skyline of Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, August 5, 2021. (File photo: REUTERS/Ajeng Dinar Ulfiana) This audio is generated by an AI tool. JAKARTA: The Jakarta administration is preparing a roadmap to preserve the metropolis’ role as Indonesia’s economic epicentre, even after it loses its capital status . Jakarta, which marked its 497th birthday on Saturday (Jun 22) and its last one as the national capital, contributes nearly 17 per cent to the Indonesian economy. The local government hopes the congested and sinking city can maintain or even improve its contribution, but the vision may be hampered by various obstacles, said observers. Jakarta will officially lose its standing as the capital when the president issues a decree officially naming Nusantara , a US$32 billion megaproject in East Kalimantan, as the new seat of the government. Outgoing Indonesian President Joko Widodo said: “I could later sign it, or later the president-elect (Prabowo Subianto) of the new government could also sign it.” Mr Widodo announced the decision to relocate the Indonesian capital from Jakarta in 2019. On Mar 28, Indonesia's parliament designated special status for Jakarta so it can still compete with other “world-class cities”. It will remain as the country's economic hub, and a global centre for trade, services, finance and business. Currently, a roadmap detailing the city’s long-term development plans for the next 20 years is being designed. The documents are expected to be completed this year. “We have that vision for Jakarta to be a global city that is progressive, competitive and sustainable,” said Dr Sri Haryati, economics and finance assistant for the regional secretariat of the Jakarta provincial government. “(Sustainability) is important because we are talking about issues related to the environment, climate change and so on. So, sustainability is something that Jakarta really cares about,” she added. “We are concerned about how the human resources in Jakarta are of good quality, productive and prosperous. Jakarta's economy should not only thrive but also be inclusive, globally competitive and sustainable.” For years, Jakarta has been plagued with various issues such as floods, inaccessibility to clean water , inadequate housing, poor waste management, traffic congestion, and pollution. “We have a slogan - Restore Jakarta. One of the ways to restore Jakarta is to develop regulations that support ecological interests,” said WALHI Jakarta environmental policy advocacy officer Syahroni Fadhil. “For example, conduct inspections on companies that contribute to waste in the rivers. Have such environmental audits been carried out?” Jakarta will be part of an \"agglomeration\" council to harmonise development plans with satellite cities such as Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Cianjur. Urban planning expert Nirwono Joga told CNA that the council, which is mandated by the Jakarta special region law, may face challenges in trying to resolve the city's many problems. “The regional heads in Jabodetabekpunjur (Jakarta and its satellite cities) have different political party backgrounds and different interests. Don't forget they have their own development agenda,” he said. “For example, if we talk about floods and providing clean water for Jakarta, is that the same problem for them? If they are forced to take part in dealing with floods, providing clean water, what is the benefit for them, for their city, (and) for their constituents?” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

(File photo: AP/Ng Han Guan) TAIPEI: Taiwan's defence ministry said on Saturday (Jun 22) it had detected 41 Chinese military aircraft around the island in a 24-hour window, a day after Beijing said \"diehard\" advocates of Taiwan's independence could face the death penalty. China claims self-ruled democratic Taiwan as part of its territory and has said it would never renounce the use of force to bring it under Beijing's control. It has stepped up pressure on Taipei in recent years and held war games around the island following last month's inauguration of new Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te. On Saturday, Taipei's defence ministry said it had detected 41 Chinese military aircraft and seven naval vessels operating around Taiwan during the 24-hour period leading up to 6am. \"Thirty-two of the aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait,\" the ministry said in a statement, referring to a line bisecting the 180km waterway that separates Taiwan from China. The ministry added that it had \"monitored the situation and responded accordingly\". The latest incursion came after China published judicial guidelines on Friday that included the death penalty for \"particularly serious\" cases of \"diehard\" supporters of Taiwanese independence, state media reported. On May 25, Taiwan detected 62 Chinese military aircraft around the island in a 24-hour window, the highest single-day total this year, as China staged military drills following the inauguration of Lai, who Beijing regards as a \"dangerous separatist\".

    "article_content": "Asia Asia Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr delivers a keynote address at the Shangri-La Dialogue, in Singapore, May 31, 2024. (Photo: Reuters/Edgar Su) MANILA: Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said on Sunday (Jun 23) his country is not in the business of instigating wars and will always aim to settle disputes peacefully, amid escalating maritime confrontations with China. \"In defending the nation, we stay true to our Filipino nature that we would like to settle all these issues peacefully,\" Marcos said in a speech to troops of the Western Command unit in charge of overseeing the South China Sea. Philippine navy personnel and the Chinese coast guard had their latest clash last week in the disputed waterway, where the Philippine military said a Filipino sailor was severely injured and its vessels damaged. Chinese coast guard personnel carrying knives and spears looted firearms and \"deliberately punctured\" Philippine boats involved in the mission, the Philippine military said. China disputed the Philippine account, with a foreign ministry spokesperson saying on Thursday the necessary measures taken were lawful, professional and beyond reproach. Marcos, who did not name China in his speech, commended the troops for exercising restraint \"amidst intense provocation\", and said his country would always exercise its freedoms and rights in line with international law. \"In the performance of our duties, we will not resort to the use of force or intimidation, or deliberately inflict injury or harm to anyone,\" Marcos said. \"We stand firm. Our calm and peaceful disposition should not be mistaken for acquiescence.\" Recent maritime run-ins between China and the Philippines, a US treaty ally in Southeast Asia, have made the highly strategic South China Sea a potential flashpoint between Washington and Beijing. The United States has condemned China's actions and reaffirmed its ironclad defence commitments against any attack on Philippine aircraft or vessels in the South China Sea under their mutual defence treaty. But the Philippines said on Friday there was no reason to invoke the treaty because China's actions, which security officials have described as escalatory, could not be classified as an \"armed attack\". China claims almost the entire South China Sea, a conduit for more than US$3 trillion of annual shipborne commerce, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague said China's claims had no legal basis, a decision Beijing has rejected. \"We are not in the business to instigate wars - our great ambition is to provide a peaceful and prosperous life for every Filipino,\" Marcos said. \"We refuse to play by the rules that force us to choose sides in a great power competition.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

The launching ceremony of the first Hangor-class submarine China developed for Pakistan was held in Wuhan in April. The two countries signed the contract for the submarines in 2015 when Chinese President Xi Jinping was on a visit to Pakistan. Under the deal, four of the submarines will be built in China and the other four in Pakistan. Equipped with air-independent propulsion (AIP) technology, the submarines give Pakistan a strategic edge over its arch-rival India, which has no such stealth submarines. The AIP system allows non-nuclear submarines to operate without the need for atmospheric oxygen. Submarines equipped with the AIP system are almost noiseless, making them stealthier than nuclear attack submarines. Beijing’s goal in supplying stealth submarines to its long-time ally Pakistan may be to distract India in the race for dominance over the Indian Ocean. India has been projected by the US and its Western allies as a counterweight to the rising power of China. China's ambition of becoming a global maritime power depends on its increased military presence in the Indian Ocean, which contains important shipping lanes for oil and goods. In 2017, China opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti on the northwestern fringe of the Indian Ocean. China considers a stronger Pakistan navy key in addressing its security challenges in the Indian Ocean region. In 2022, the Pakistan Navy instated Tughril , its most advanced warship, into service. Built at the Shanghai Shipyard and armed with surface-to-air missiles and supersonic surface-to-surface missiles, Tughril is a versatile vessel capable of undertaking multiple missions. In the same year, Pakistan acquired Taimur, the second of four powerful guided-missile warships, from China. Built in Shanghai, Taimur expands the geographical reach of Pakistan’s naval forces. China’s partnership with Pakistan gives it a foothold in the Indian Ocean, which has raised security concerns in New Delhi. Like China, India is heavily dependent on the Indian Ocean for the transportation of crude oil and goods. More broadly, India perceives China’s investments into naval bases and ports across Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Maldives as an encirclement of the Indian Ocean maritime domain. In 2022, India protested the docking of a Chinese research vessel at Hambantota in Sri Lanka, fearing that the ship could surveil India's defence capabilities. By arming the Pakistan Navy with stealth submarines, China may trigger further naval competition between Pakistan and India. Because the latter is part of the Quad, namely Australia, Japan and the US, geopolitical rivalry may intensify in the Indian Ocean. By growing its strategic footprint in the Indian Ocean, China also expands maritime routes for its energy supplies. Eighty per cent of China's oil has to pass through the Strait of Malacca - a narrow waterway between Indonesia and Malaysia that lies east of the Indian Ocean. Chinese-run Gwadar Port on Pakistan’s southwest coast could be China's trump card in securing its interests in the Indian Ocean. Strategically located near the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipping lane, Gwadar Port allows China to bypass any potential blockade in the Strait of Malacca through the Arabian Sea. China is simultaneously strengthening Pakistan's naval muscle and developing the country's Gwadar Port. Critics see these steps as China's long-term investments that would pay strategic dividends in future. The US Pentagon has identified Gwadar as a possible location for a future Chinese military base. With a naval presence in Gwadar, China could conduct regular patrols in the Arabian Sea. China's longstanding strategic relationship with Pakistan poses new challenges to competitors in the race for dominance over the Indian Ocean.

(File Photo: REUTERS/Ann Wang) TAIPEI: Democracy is not a crime and autocracy is the real \"evil\", Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Monday (Jun 24) after China threatened to impose the death penalty in extreme cases for \"diehard\" Taiwan independence separatists. China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, has made no secret of its dislike of Lai, who took office last month, saying he is a \"separatist\", and staged war games shortly after his inauguration. On Friday, China ramped up its pressure on Taiwan by issuing new legal guidelines to punish those it says support the island's formal independence, though Chinese courts have no jurisdiction on the democratically governed island. Asked about China's move at a news conference at the presidential office in Taipei, Lai first reiterated his sympathy for recent flooding in southern China before responding. \"I want to stress: Democracy is not a crime; it's autocracy that is the real evil. China has absolutely no right to sanction Taiwan's people just because of the positions they hold. What's more, China has no right to go after Taiwan people's rights across borders,\" he said. According to China, anyone who does not uphold \"reunification\" is therefore a Taiwan independence supporter, Lai added. \"I also want to call on China to face up to the existence of the Republic of China and have exchanges and dialogue with Taiwan's democratically elected, legitimate government,\" he said, using Taiwan's formal name. \"If this is not done, relations between Taiwan and China will only become more and more estranged.\" Lai rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims and says only Taiwan's people can decide their future. He has repeatedly offered talks with China but has been rebuffed. China says any move by Taiwan to declare formal independence would be grounds to attack the island. The government in Taipei says Taiwan is already an independent country, the Republic of China, and that it does not plan to change that. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's Communists.

    "article_content": "Business Business People cross a bridge at Pudong financial district in Shanghai, on Aug 11, 2014. (Photo: REUTERS/Carlos Barria) BEIJING: China's fiscal revenue fell 2.8 per cent in the first five months of 2024 from a year earlier, accelerating from a 2.7 per cent decline in the January-April period, official data showed on Monday (Jun 24), as weak demand drags on the economic recovery. Fiscal expenditure rose 3.4 per cent in the first five months,versus a 3.5 per cent gain in the first four months, according to finance ministry data. For May alone, fiscal revenue was down 3.2 per cent year-on-year, compared with a 3.7 per cent slide in April, while fiscal spending grew 2.6 per cent against a 6.1 per cent rise in April, according to Reuters' calculations based on the ministry's data. China has pledged greater fiscal stimulus to prop up its fragile economy, as an ambitious growth target of around 5 per cent for this year puts pressure on policymakers to fire up domestic activity in the face of mounting trade tensions with the West. Beijing has kicked off sales of 1 trillion yuan (US$137.82 billion) in long-dated special treasury bonds and launched government-subsidised incentives to spur trade-ins of autos and other consumer goods. But worsening declines in property investment, sales and some key money gauges hitting record lows have stoked concerns over persistent weakness in domestic demand.

    "article_content": "East Asia East Asia Tourists from Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand make up the lion’s share of travel to China under its visa-free umbrella. Alongside the economic benefits, analysts say the expanding visa waivers also signal Beijing’s “persistent commitment” to opening up amid tensions with the West. Malaysian couple Tan Ziteng and Leow Weiliang chose Lijiang, Yunnan, as their photoshoot destination due to its picturesque scenery and attractive pricing packages. (Photo: Tan Ziteng) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Visiting snow-capped mountains, scenic lakes and deep gorges is all in a day’s work for He Quan. The 35-year-old private driver based in the city of Lijiang in Yunnan plies his trade eight hours a day, ferrying passengers around the Chinese province’s key attractions. He did not want to disclose his earnings but CNA understands each trip ranges from 150 yuan to 1,000 yuan (US$21 to US$140). Known as “Ah Quan Shifu” to them, his sole clients were domestic travellers just six months back. But a different clientele has emerged - now, four to five times a month, his services are engaged by Chinese-speaking tourists from Southeast Asia, specifically Singapore and Malaysia. Although the new clientele still makes up less than 10 per cent of his overall business, Mr He welcomes the additional income. “As tourism sector workers, we don’t just focus on domestic tourists; we also need to interact with foreign guests,” he said. “This helps expand our customer base.” Mr He added that his Singapore and Malaysia passengers often share their experiences on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu, boosting publicity and attracting more business. China has recorded a surge in foreign arrivals since dismantling nearly three years of strict COVID-19 controls early last year. The resumption and expansion of visa-free policies have been key as they have streamlined the travel process, according to analysts. Travellers from the region - namely Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand - are driving demand under the visa-free umbrella, which experts say ties in with their relatively closer geographic and cultural links to China. While the economic benefits of greater inbound tourism are clear for the world’s second-largest economy amid sluggish post-pandemic recovery, analysts point out that there is also a geopolitical dimension amid rising tensions with the West. “Inbound tourism can be regarded as China’s new soft-power diplomacy … (it) serves a role here from a geopolitical perspective,” Professor Sam Huang, a scholar internationally noted for his research on China tourism, told CNA. “The pandemic has alienated China to a certain degree. Now China needs to let more foreign citizens experience its development in person.” China has had mixed fortunes in tourism since reopening its borders in January 2023. Outbound tourism has recovered well, with Chinese tourists reclaiming their crown as the world’s biggest tourism spenders. Chinese spending on travel abroad hit US$196.5 billion in 2023, beating the United States (US$150 billion) and Germany (US$112 billion), according to the World Tourism Organisation. Meanwhile, inbound tourism has struggled to recover. China welcomed 35.5 million foreign visitors last year, less than 40 per cent of the 97.7 million arrivals it logged in 2019 before the pandemic. To boost this, China has since unilaterally established visa-free arrangements with about a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, to streamline the travel process. Mutual visa waiver agreements have also been established with three Southeast Asian nations: Malaysia , Singapore and Thailand . The strategy has seen results. Nearly two million foreigners entered China visa-free in the first quarter of the year, up by more than two and a half times compared to the same period on-year, according to data from the National Immigration Administration. Tourism accounted for over 30 per cent of these visits. The three Southeast Asian states were the largest source countries for visitors to mainland China in the first five months of the year, according to international online travel agency Trip.com. Germany and France rounded off the top five list. “In the same period, the number of travel bookings from Thailand skyrocketed by more than 14 times compared to the same period last year. Visitors from Malaysia and Singapore also grew rapidly, by almost 10 times and some 5.7 times respectively,” Mr Edmund Ong, general manager of Trip.com Singapore, told CNA. Professor Huang, the China tourism specialist, attributes this to the geographic and cultural proximity between Southeast Asian countries and China. “Visa-free policies can have a stronger effect on people in these countries than those in distant European countries”, said the research professor in tourism and services marketing at Australia’s Edith Cowan University. He added that people may also have tightened their travel budgets after the pandemic. “Short-haul international travel means lower costs and can be more affordable.” With its picturesque scenery and relatively closer proximity as opposed to the rest of China, Yunnan has emerged as a top travel pick for Southeast Asian tourists. Tan Ziteng, a 27-year-old accountant from Malaysia, is one such visitor. She travelled to Yunnan last month with her husband for their wedding photoshoot. They spent a day in Lijiang as part of a RM6,000 (US$1,270) package that included four photoshoots, each in a different costume. Subsequently, they explored Dali and Shangri-La at their leisure, savouring the region's scenic beauty and cultural richness. “I've watched plenty of promotional videos showing how beautiful it is. We can also explore nearby cities while we're there,” said Ms Tan. Hotels in Yunnan said they have experienced an increase in foreign tourists since December last year. Jinghua Shuiyuan Inn in Dali has logged a 20 per cent increase in occupancy since December last year, with a notable influx of guests from Southeast Asia as well as Macao, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Chan Brothers Travel, a Singapore travel agency, told CNA that Yunnan is a popular destination within China for Singaporean travellers, along with other places like Zhangjiajie and Jiuzhai Valley. The company observed an over two-times increase in trips to China for the first six months of the year, compared to the same period in 2019. There has also been a shift towards longer 9- to 14-day itineraries compared to shorter tours before the pandemic, noted Mr Jeremiah Wong, a senior marketing communications manager at Chan Brothers Travel. He added that the agency has introduced extended travel packages to accommodate this. Another Singapore travel agency, EU Holidays, says China has surpassed Europe to become the top tourism destination. Its director Wong Yew Hoong attributed this to China being among the last countries to reopen borders, leading travellers who have already visited other destinations to consider the country next. He also highlighted the value for money and China's enhanced infrastructure as other key factors driving this shift. China resumed its 15-day visa-free policy for Singapore citizens in July 2023. This allowance was extended to 30 days from February this year and made mutual. Overall for foreign tourists, Trip.com statistics show that major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, known colloquially as “Bei Shang Guang Shen”, remain the most popular destinations in China. Qingdao in eastern Shandong province came in fifth. Analysts point out that there are clear economic aims to China’s post-pandemic visa-free policy as a protracted property downturn, mounting local government debt and a shrinking workforce weigh on the world’s second-largest economy. “Foreign tourists’ spending represents net input in the economic system, and the multiplier effect is relatively large for tourism to drive other related sectors,” said Prof Huang. Increased inbound tourism, facilitated by China’s visa-free manoeuvres, can boost consumption and stimulate the economy, said Associate Professor Yong Chen, who teaches at EHL Hospitality Business School in Switzerland. \"As China’s economy advances, the proportion of services in the economy increases, and the competitiveness of service industries in the international market hinges on their ability to attract and serve foreign tourists,\" he told CNA. But Assoc Prof Chen also pointed out that China’s unilateral visa-free pledges have a deadline. For instance, the commitments with European nations such as France, Germany and Italy are slated to cease at the end of 2025. “This policy is meant to be a catalyst, not a long-term institutional arrangement, for resurrecting business, trade, and tourism disrupted by the pandemic and geopolitics. “Tourism is a feasible and easy solution to this problem. A long-term visa arrangement is far more complicated and hence not feasible,” he added. Assoc Prof Chen noted too that the countries granted unilateral visa-free access are not “major source markets” for China due to their small populations and geographical distance. At the same time, observers say there is a geopolitical dimension to China’s moves amid a troubled external environment - from heightened tensions with the West, the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza and a recent violent confrontation in the South China Sea. China’s visa-free policy could reassure the international community of Beijing’s “persistent commitment” to opening up for business, trade, and tourism, noted Assoc Prof Chen. “International tourists play a pivotal role in relaying such commitment to the outside world through their own experience in China. The bottom-up policy through tourism is imperative because top-down diplomacy between governments may not resume anytime soon,” he said. Prof Huang from Edith Cowan University suggested that China is taking a “smart diplomacy” approach through its visa waiver selection. The latest inclusions to the list are set to be Australia and New Zealand, which both have close links to the US. “Visa-free policies would encourage people-to-people exchanges and intercultural understandings between countries … I believe (they) serve the overall purpose of China’s grand diplomatic strategies,” he told CNA. Searches by New Zealand tourists for China-related keywords surged by 65 per cent the day after the visa waiver announcement, according to Trip.com as reported by Chinese state broadcaster CGTN. Concurrently, New Zealand has become a popular spot for Chinese tourists during the summer, the report added. \"As of June 14, air ticket bookings from China to New Zealand have more than doubled year-on-year,” an employee of Chinese online travel platform Qunar told CGTN. \"Cities such as Auckland, Queenstown, Christchurch, and Wellington are highly popular among Chinese tourists, with bookings for related tourism products tripling year-on-year,” the person added. As China rolls out the visa-free welcome mat to more foreigners, the country has been taking steps to ensure smooth travel within its borders. Since November last year, train ticket services for international travellers have been enhanced. They can now verify personal information online via China Railway’s official ticketing platform, called 12306, using details like names, nationalities, and passport IDs. Previously, foreign passengers purchasing tickets online had to present their original passports at the railway station counter to verify their personal particulars. Alipay and WeChat Pay also support payments from users of 13 international online wallets for transactions within China. Still, some international visitors have faced issues while navigating the country of 1.4 billion people. Ms Rosette Peh encountered difficulties with transportation during her visit to Yunnan province in March. In one case, she and her friend experienced a last-minute change to their high-speed train seats. \"My friend and I were not informed because we had no local phone number. We were a bit lost inside the train cabin and had to guess our seats by asking other local tourists who were in the same situation,\" said the 30-year-old social worker. Other travellers have encountered issues with accommodation. Last month, Chinese authorities ordered hotels nationwide not to refuse foreign guests following multiple complaints. “The government should allow hotels to make their own decisions regarding which consumer markets to serve and how to serve them, provided that there is no discrimination against consumers and no violation of market principles and consumer rights,” said Assoc Prof Chen from EHL Hospitality Business School. “The decision of which hotel to patronise should be left to consumers, regardless of whether they are foreigners or Chinese.” While Mr He, the private driver in Yunnan, can’t speak for hotels, what worries him is whether he can host foreigners to his standards. He told CNA he previously received several enquiries in English but ended up disregarding them due to concerns over the language barrier. \"So far, I have only had Malaysian and Singaporean guests,\" he noted, adding that they feel comfortable. \"We speak the same language and share similar cultures, so there are hardly any barriers.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

(Photo: REUTERS/Aly Song) HONG KONG: A Hong Kong court gave Chinese property developer Kaisa Group a seven-week respite on Monday (Jun 24) to finalise a debt restructuring plan, adjourning a hearing on a liquidation petition for what it said could be the last time. The High Court adjourned the hearing to Aug 12 after the petitioner representing a key group of bondholders agreed to Kaisa's request for more time. The Shenzhen-based developer has been working to restructure its offshore debt since defaulting on US$12 billion in offshore debt payments in late 2021. At a hearing in April, Kaisa told the court it would finalise terms by the end of May. Justice Peter Ng told the court on Monday he was \"not sure if the (next) judge will grant any further adjournment\" and that Kaisa \"really has no excuse if (there is) no progress\". Citicorp International, bond trustee of an ad hoc group of bondholders (AHG), has acted as petitioner since March after a former petitioner withdrew. \"There are seven members in the AHG and it takes time to pin down final small details,\" Kaisa group senior advisor LL Tam said after the hearing. The developer hopes to sign an agreement within a fortnight, he said. The deal will involve issuing new shares to creditors, though Chairman Kwok Ying Shing will remain top shareholder, Tam said. The price of Kaisa shares had fallen 5.8 per cent by noon versus a 1 per cent fall in the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index. Kaisa is the second-largest offshore debt issuer among Chinese developers after China Evergrande Group but in 2015 became the first among peers to default on dollar bonds. It is not alone in fighting liquidation, with creditors filing petitions against Country Garden and others. China Evergrande was ordered to liquidate earlier this year. Chairman Kwok returned to mainland China from Hong Kong for the first time in almost a decade to seek regulatory approval for offshore debt restructuring, Reuters reported last week. He has been in Shenzhen for about two months for talks with a government committee and onshore regulators, sources said. Tam told Reuters on Monday that Kwok will return to Hong Kong after visiting projects in Shenzhen and ensuring their completion and delivery.

As a shipping, logistics and regional financial centre, Dalian is seen as a gateway for the country’s northeast to the world. This audio is generated by an AI tool. DALIAN, Liaoning: Chinese officials will be on a charm offensive to woo foreign investors, as the coastal city of Dalian gets ready to host the World Economic Forum’s second largest annual gathering. Known as the Summer Davos, the three-day event beginning Tuesday (Jun 25) is expected to attract about 1,600 local and international participants from business, government, civil society and academia. Among them are Poland President Andrezj Duda and Vietnam Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. Chinese Premier Li Qiang will give a special address at the gathering and meet with WEF executive chairman Klaus Schwab and foreign guests, China’s Foreign Ministry said. The number two ranked Chinese leader will also have a conversation with representatives of the foreign business community. As a shipping, logistics and regional financial centre, Dalian is seen as a gateway for the country’s northeast to the world and is home to one of China’s busiest international ports along the Pacific Ocean. Into its 15th edition, the event returns to Dalian after a five-year hiatus partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has traditionally alternated between being held in Dalian and another port city in China’s north, Tianjin. Summer Davos has been a feature of the Chinese calendar since 2007, just before the global financial crisis, at a time when the world’s economy was booming. China was seeing rapid economic growth and making its mark on the global stage. However, in a vast difference compared to when the first edition was held, the theme this year is “Next Frontiers for Growth”, with WEF’s Chief Economists Outlook in May pointing to “cautious optimism” for the global economy, with bright spots emerging, including “consistently buoyant activity in the economies of Asia.” The role of the meeting has evolved over the years, observers said. When it started, Summer Davos marked China joining the mainstream world, said Mr Einar Tangen, senior fellow at Beijing-based think tank Taihe Institute. “Many years later, it's kind of become more of a talk shop and networking. We're at a point now which is the exact opposite of 2007. Things are very pessimistic, you have geopolitical contests and because of that, things are gridlocked.” Despite watered down expectations of tangible outcomes at the event, Mr Tangen said talking is better than not at all, with organisers expecting discussions to focus on the global economy and the potential of technology. The forum is part of a broader calendar of international forums in China, including those in Beijing, Hainan and Shanghai. Aside from business, such events are also a way for China to deepen political and commercial ties with partners and showcase Chinese culture, said Mr Tangen. Chinese authorities will be keen to reach out to the international business community at the conference following a slump in foreign investment inflows, and as unemployment creeps up . China’s foreign direct investment fell to a 23-year low last year. Director of international cooperation at China’s National Development and Reform Commission Pan Jiang said that the country continues to build a “market-oriented, legalised, and internationalised first-class business environment”. “It also has a super-large market and this market is in a stage of unleashing potential. This will provide broad space and very valuable opportunities for the development of foreign-funded enterprises in China,” he said. As China works towards achieving its goal of around 5 per cent growth this year, similar pledges are expected to be amplified in Dalian in the coming days to drum up investor confidence amid headwinds in the country’s property sector and weak domestic demand.

(Photo: Reuters/Maria Martinez) BEIJING: Proposed European Union tariffs on Chinese goods are not a \"punishment\", Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck told Chinese officials in Beijing on Saturday (Jun 22). Habeck's visit to China is the first by a senior European official since Brussels proposed hefty duties on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) to combat what the EU considers excessive subsidies. China warned on Friday ahead of his arrival that escalating frictions with the EU over EVs could trigger a trade war. \"It is important to understand that these are not punitive tariffs,\" Habeck said in the first plenary session of a climate and transformation dialogue. Countries such as the US, Brazil and Turkey had used punitive tariffs, but not the EU, the economy minister said. \"Europe does things differently.\" Habeck said that for nine months, the European Commission had examined in great detail whether Chinese companies had benefited unfairly from subsidies. Any countervailing duty measure that results from the EU review \"is not a punishment\", he said, adding that such measures were meant to compensate for the advantages granted to Chinese companies by Beijing. \"Common, equal standards for market access should be achieved,\" Habeck said. Meeting Zheng Shanjie, chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission, Habeck said the proposed EU tariffs were intended to level the playing field with China. Zheng responded: \"We will do everything to protect Chinese companies.\" Proposed EU import duties on Chinese-made EVs would hurt both sides, Zheng added. He told Habeck he hoped Germany would demonstrate leadership within the EU and \"do the correct thing\". He also denied the accusations of unfair subsidies, saying the development of China's new energy industry was the result of comprehensive advantages in technology, market and industry chains, fostered in fierce competition. The industry growth \"is the result of competition, rather than subsidies, let alone unfair competition\", Zheng said during the meeting. The EU provisional duties are set to apply by Jul 4, with the investigation set to continue until Nov 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could be imposed. Habeck told Chinese officials the conclusions of the EU report should be discussed. \"It's important now to take the opportunity that the report provides seriously and to talk or negotiate,\" Habeck said. After his meeting with Zheng, Habeck spoke with Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, who said he would discuss the tariffs with EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis on Saturday evening via videoconference. CNA's Yasmin Jonkers takes a look at the possible implications of the European Union imposing tariffs on electric vehicles from China. ESSEC Business School Professor Cedomir Nestorovic sees the EU struggling to hit its climate targets without Chinese EVs, which are already in the market and a cheaper option for drivers. Although the trade tensions were a key topic to be discussed, the goal of the meeting was to deepen cooperation between both industrialised nations for the green transition. This was the first plenary session of the climate and transformation dialogue after Germany and China signed a Memorandum of Understanding in June of last year for cooperation on climate change and the green transition. The countries acknowledged they had a special responsibility to prevent global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, a level regarded by scientists as crucial to preventing the most severe consequences. China installed almost 350 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable capacity in 2023, more than half the global total, and if the world's second-biggest economy maintains this pace it will likely exceed its 2030 target this year, a report published in June by the International Energy Agency (IEA) showed. While Habeck praised the expansion of renewable energy in China, he noted that it is important not to look only at the expansion of renewables, but also the overall CO2 emissions. Coal still accounted for nearly 60 per cent of China's electricity supply in 2023. \"China has a coal-based energy mix,\" Zheng said. China, India and Indonesia are responsible for almost 75 per cent of the global total coal burned, as governments tend to prioritise energy security, availability and cost over the amount of carbon emissions. Zheng said China was building coal-fired power plants as a security measure. \"I still believe that the enormous expansion of coal power can be done differently if one considers the implication of renewables in the system,\" Habeck replied.

Song Kyung-Seok/Pool via REUTERS SEOUL: A US aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea on Saturday (Jun 22) for a joint military drills aimed to better counter North Korean threats, Seoul's navy said. The announcement came a day after South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador to Seoul to protest a defence deal signed by President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang this week, which included a pledge to come to each other's aid if attacked. \"The US Navy's aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt ... arrived at the Busan Naval Base on the morning of Jun 22,\" the South Korean Navy said in a statement. Its arrival \"demonstrates the strong combined defence posture of the South Korea-US alliance and their firm resolve to respond to the escalating threats from North Korea\", it added. The carrier's visit comes around seven months after another US aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, came to the South in a show of strength against Pyongyang. The USS Theodore Roosevelt is expected to participate in joint exercises with South Korea and Japan this month. Pyongyang has always decried similar combined drills as rehearsals for an invasion. The United States, South Korea and Japan have expanded their joint training exercises and heightened the visibility of strategic US military assets in the region to deter the North, which has declared itself an \"irreversible\" nuclear weapons power. The carrier arrived a day after Seoul said it had fired warning shots when North Korean soldiers briefly crossed the heavily fortified border in the third such incursion this month. North Korean soldiers have recently been engaged in activities such as laying more landmines, reinforcing tactical roads and adding what seemed to be anti-tank barriers near the border, according to the South Korean military. The two Koreas have also been locked in a tit-for-tat \"balloon war\", with an activist in the South confirming Friday that he had floated more balloons carrying propaganda north. Pyongyang has already sent more than a thousand balloons carrying trash southward, and Kim's powerful sister Kim Yo Jong warned on Friday the North is likely to retaliate.

(File photo: AP/Jacquelyn Martin) HANOI: US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink on Saturday (Jan 22) said the situation in the South China Sea is deeply concerning, adding that China's recent actions in the disputed waterway were \"deeply destabilising\". Kritenbrink made the comments during a visit to Hanoi, amid rising tension between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, where Vietnam is also a claimant. \"We think that China's actions, particularly its recent actions, around the Second Thomas Shoal, vis-à-vis the Philippines have been irresponsible, aggressive, dangerous, deeply destabilising,\" Kritenbrink said at a briefing for selected media in Hanoi, a recording of which was reviewed by Reuters. \"We're going to continue to stand with our Filipino allies,\" Kritenbrink said, adding that Washington had made it clear, both publicly and privately, to Beijing that the mutual defence treaty obligations it has with the Philippines were \"ironclad\". On Friday, Philippine officials said they did not consider invoking the mutual defence treaty with the US after accusing China of aggressively disrupting a resupply mission in the disputed South China Sea earlier this month. China's foreign ministry disputed the Philippines' account, with a spokesperson saying on Thursday that the necessary measures taken were lawful, professional and beyond reproach. \"We think every country in the region, including China, needs to respect international law and needs to behave responsibly in the maritime domain,\" Kritenbrink said. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, a conduit for more than US$3 trillion of annual shipborne commerce, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague said China's claims had no legal basis, a decision Beijing has rejected. Kritenbrink arrived in Hanoi on Friday on the heels of a visit to Vietnam by Russian President Vladimir Putin that was sharply criticised by Washington. \"Only Vietnam can decide how best to safeguard its sovereignty and advance its interests,\" Kritenbrink said when asked about his view on Vietnam's foreign policy and its hosting of Putin. Vietnam and the US officially upgraded their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership, Vietnam's highest tier of its diplomatic ranking, during a visit to Hanoi by President Joe Biden in September last year. Kritenbrink said the upgrade was \"historic and momentous\", and said he wanted to maintain momentum to make sure that all of the agreements reached are implemented. \"We continue to believe that the US-Vietnam partnership has never been stronger,\" he said.

(Photo: REUTERS/Annegret Hilse) SHANGHAI: China and the European Union have agreed to start talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) being imported into the European market, senior officials of both sides said on Saturday (Jun 22). Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he had been informed by EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis that there would be concrete negotiations on tariffs with China. The confirmation came after China's commerce ministry said its head Wang Wentao, and Dombrovskis, executive vice president of the European Commission, had agreed to start consultations over the EU's anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs. \"This is new and surprising in that it has not been possible to enter into a concrete negotiation timetable in the last few weeks,\" Habeck said in Shanghai. He said it was a first step and many more will be necessary. \"We are far from the end, but at least, it is a first step that was not possible before.\" The minister had said earlier on Saturday that the European Union's door was open for discussions regarding EU tariffs on Chinese exports. \"What I suggested to my Chinese partners today is that the doors are open for discussions and I hope that this message was heard,\" he said in his first statement in Shanghai, after meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing. Habeck's visit is the first by a senior European official since Brussels proposed hefty duties on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles to combat what the EU considers excessive subsidies. Habeck said there is time for a dialogue between the EU and China on tariff issues before the duties come into full effect in November and that he believes in open markets but that markets require a level playing field. Proven subsidies that are intended to increase the export advantages of companies can't be accepted, the minister said. Another point of tension between Beijing and Berlin is China's support for Russia in its war in Ukraine. Habeck noted Chinese trade with Russia increased more than 40% last year. Habeck said he had told Chinese officials that this was taking a toll on their economic relationship. \"Circumventions of the sanctions imposed on Russia are not acceptable,\" he said, adding that technical goods produced in Europe should not end up on the battlefield via other countries. The EU's provisional duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese EVs are set to apply by July 4, with the investigation set to continue until Nov 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could be imposed. \"This opens a phase where negotiations are possible, discussions are important and dialogue is needed,\" Habeck said. Proposed EU tariffs on Chinese goods are not a \"punishment\", Habeck told Chinese officials earlier in Beijing. \"It is important to understand that these are not punitive tariffs,\" he said in the first plenary session of a climate and transformation dialogue. Countries such as the US, Brazil and Turkey had used punitive tariffs, but not the EU, he said. \"Europe does things differently.\" Habeck said the European Commission had for nine months examined in detail whether Chinese companies had benefited unfairly from subsidies. Any countervailing duty measure that results from the EU review \"is not a punishment\", he said, adding that such measures were meant to compensate for the advantages granted to Chinese companies by Beijing. Zheng Shanjie, chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission, responded: \"We will do everything to protect Chinese companies.\" Proposed EU duties on Chinese-made EVs would hurt both sides, Zheng added. He told Habeck he hoped Germany would demonstrate leadership within the EU and \"do the correct thing\". He also denied accusations of unfair subsidies, saying the development of China's new energy industry was the result of comprehensive advantages in technology, market and industry supply chains, fostered in fierce competition. The industry's growth \"is the result of competition, rather than subsidies, let alone unfair competition,\" Zheng said during the meeting. After his meeting with Zheng, Habeck spoke with Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, who said he would discuss the tariffs with EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis on Saturday evening in a video conference. \"There's room for manoeuvre, there's room for discussion and I hope that this room for manoeuvre will be taken,\" Habeck said. In case the negotiations didn't reach a deal, Chinese carmaker SAIC Group 600104.SS has designed an array of creative products in response to the threat of tariffs. Shao Jingfeng, chief design officer of the SAIC Motor R&D Innovation Headquarters, released pictures on his Weibo social media account showing products such as skateboards, hoodies, sneakers, cups, umbrellas and table tennis paddles, mainly yellow and black in colour and emblazoned with the EU emblem and the figure \"38.1\", a reference to the level of the EU's tariffs. \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,\" Shao wrote on Weibo. \"Let us remember 38.1.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

(Photo: REUTERS/Vitalii Hnidyi) KHARKIV: Russia bombed a residential building in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Saturday (Jun 22), killing three people and wounding more than 50 as it stepped up renewed hostilities. Officials said four guided bombs hit Ukraine's second largest city , located near the Russian border, and President Volodymyr Zelensky posted footage of the torn-off facade of an apartment block and a crater outside. \"Russian terrorists have again hit Kharkiv with guided bombs,\" he wrote on Telegram, announcing three dead as rescuers searched the rubble. Fifty two people were wounded in the strikes, including three teenagers, the regional prosecutor's office said. Regional governor Oleg Synegubov had said earlier that \"Doctors are fighting for the lives of four patients, two women and two men, who are in serious condition\". He posted photos of blown-out windows and cars and a minibus damaged by the blast, which tore through the walls of flats, leaving tangled wreckage and rubble. Rescuers worked with dogs, cutting through doors and dousing a fire in the flats near the city's central bus station. Bodies in bags were laid on the ground outside, an AFP journalist saw. One dead woman lay at a bus stop, wearing bright sandals, her bag by her side. An elderly woman with blood running down her face and legs was helped onto a stretcher as she protested she did not want to go to hospital. Synegubov said \"only civilian infrastructure was damaged\". \"Since the beginning of this June alone, Russians have used more than 2,400 guided aerial bombs against Ukraine already, about 700 of which were targeted at the Kharkiv region,\" Zelensky said in a later statement. \"This is calculated terror.\" Russia launched a new offensive in the region in May, taking significant territory, and has increasingly targeted Kharkiv. In May, a guided bomb attack on a hardware store killed 16 and wounded dozens. Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said last month that Russia has dropped almost 10,000 guided bombs on Ukraine this year. Prosecutors said Russia used its new UMPB D-30 SN guided bombs for the latest attack on Kharkiv, launched from the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine. Russia's Rossiiskaya Gazeta newspaper wrote this month that the weapons are now being used in the Ukraine war. They can be fired from the ground at long range as well as from planes, it wrote, which means \"it is almost impossible to anticipate\" an attack. \"This Russian terror with guided bombs must be stopped and can be stopped. We need strong decisions from our partners so that we can destroy Russian terrorists and Russian combat aircraft where they are,\" Zelensky said. Russia also launched 16 cruise missiles and 13 attack drones at energy infrastructure in several regions overnight, Ukraine's military said. This was Russia's \"eighth massive, combined attack on energy infrastructure facilities\" in three months, the energy ministry said. More than two years into the Russian invasion, missile and drone attacks have crippled Ukraine's electricity generating capacity and forced Kyiv to impose blackouts and import supplies from the European Union. Russia said its troops \"carried out a group strike with long-range high-precision weaponry from air and sea and also drones on Ukrainian energy facilities that power arms production\". The defence ministry said strikes targeted stores for munitions and \"air-launched weapons provided to the Ukrainian military by western countries\". \"All the set targets were hit,\" the ministry said, justifying the strikes as retaliation for Ukrainian attacks on Russia's energy network. Ukraine's energy ministry said energy facilities in the southern Zaporizhzhia and western Lviv regions were damaged. Russian attacks have destroyed half of Ukraine's energy capacity, according to Zelensky. In Zaporizhzhia, Russian artillery shelling also killed one civilian, according to the regional military administration, while a policeman manning a checkpoint was killed by a drone in the southern Kherson region, police said. Five civilians were killed by shelling in frontline areas of the Donetsk region, regional head Vadym Filashkin said. Frontline clashes were reported near the towns of Pokrovsk and Toretsk, where Moscow \"continues to increase the pace of offensive actions, deploying significant forces,\" Kyiv's military said. Russia's defence ministry said troops had improved positions in the Donetsk, Lugansk and Kharkiv regions. The head of Russian authorities in the Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, said the region had come under attack from Ukraine. Three men working for a construction firm were killed by cluster munitions, he said. In Russia's southern Belgorod region, a man was killed in the shelling of a farm near the border, said governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.

(Photo: REUTERS/Ayman Al Hassi) CAIRO: At least 42 people were killed in Israeli attacks on districts of Gaza City in the north of the Palestinian enclave on Saturday (Jun 22), the director of the Hamas-run government media office said. One Israeli strike on houses in Al-Shati, one of the Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps, killed 24 people, Ismail Al-Thawabta told Reuters. Another 18 Palestinians were killed in a strike on houses in the Al-Tuffah neighborhood. The Israeli military released a brief statement saying: \"A short while ago, IDF fighter jets struck two Hamas military infrastructure sites in the area of Gaza City.\" It said more details would be released soon. Hamas did not comment on the Israeli claim to have hit its military infrastructure. It said in a statement the attacks targeted the civilian population and vowed in a statement \"the occupation and its Nazi leaders will pay the price for their violations against our people.\" Footage obtained by Reuters showed dozens of Palestinians rushing out to search for victims amid the destroyed houses. The footage showed wrecked homes, blasted walls, and debris and dust filling the street in Shati refugee camp. Israel's ground and air campaign in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7 , killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. The offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, of whom 101 were killed in the past 24 hours, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population homeless and destitute. More than eight months into the war, Israel's advance is now focused on the two last areas its forces had yet to seize: Rafah on Gaza's southern edge and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre. Residents said Israeli tanks deepened their incursion into western and northern Rafah areas in recent days. On Saturday Israeli forces bombed several areas from air and the ground, forcing many families living in areas described as humanitarian-designated zones to leave northwards. The Israeli military said forces continued \"precise, intelligence-based\" targeted operations in Rafah, killing many Palestinian gunmen and dismantling military infrastructure. On Friday, the Gaza health ministry said at least 25 Palestinians were killed in Mawasi in western Rafah and 50 wounded. Palestinians said a tank shell hit a tent housing displaced families. The Israeli military said that the incident was under review. \"An initial inquiry conducted suggests that there is no indication that a strike was carried out by the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi,\" it said.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary US President Joe Biden’s plan to downgrade marijuana, whether politically motivated or empathic, is a regressive step in the global fight against drugs, say Tan Chong Huat and Narayanan Ganapathy from Singapore’s National Council Against Drug Abuse. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The United States has formally moved to loosen restrictions on marijuana , with plans to reclassify it as a less harmful drug. Under the move, marijuana - which has been classified since 1970 as a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, LSD and ecstasy - will be downgraded to a Schedule III drug, putting it in the same category as drugs like testosterone or painkillers containing codeine. Schedule III drugs are deemed to have a “moderate to low potential” of dependence. “No one should be in jail merely for using or possessing marijuana,” US President Joe Biden said in a video on May 17. “Far too many lives have been upended because of failed approach to marijuana and I’m committed to righting those wrongs.” Earlier this week, Maryland pardoned more than 175,000 marijuana convictions, becoming the latest state to do so after similar mass pardons by Massachusetts and Oregon, among others. A post shared by President Joe Biden (@potus) The intent could be politically motivated, or even empathic. Regardless, it is a regressive step in the global fight against drugs, and undermines decades of progress in drug control efforts and contradicts extensive scientific evidence on the adverse effects of cannabis. Research reported in The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse highlights that prolonged cannabis abuse can disrupt brain function, particularly during critical developmental stages. Similarly, the Singapore Medical Journal featured local research that attests to these findings, showing that early initiation of cannabis use leads to greater long-term negative impacts. The reclassification of marijuana at the federal level could legitimise the cannabis industry and accelerate the normalisation of recreational cannabis use at the state level, despite concerns about the risks. In Singapore, recent data highlights growing concerns about drug use among youths. The 2022 Health and Lifestyle survey by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) revealed that the mean age of drug initiation in Singapore is 15.9 years . Drug-related arrests are also on the rise, increasing by 10 per cent to 3,122 cases last year. Notably, there was a 17 per cent increase in cannabis abusers arrested. Amongst new cannabis abusers arrested, close to two in three were below the age of 30. These statistics reflect a troubling trend that underscore the need for more robust and concerted drug prevention measures. Despite Singapore’s comprehensive demand and supply reduction efforts, endorsed by strong public opinion, misconceptions about cannabis are prevalent among youths. In the 2023 National Drug Perception Survey by the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), 90.4 per cent of youths agreed that “drug-taking should remain illegal in Singapore”, but only 79.3 per cent supported the continued criminalisation of cannabis. Qualitative interviews revealed that some youths believe cannabis use can be personally regulated, while young adults in their early 30s often view cannabis as a “soft” drug suitable for recreational use without addiction risks. But research invalidates the perception that cannabis is less harmful than other drugs. In a study published in the Singapore Medical Journal last year, researchers found that almost half of the 450 participants surveyed progressed to using other illicit drugs after trying cannabis, with 42 per cent progressing to heroin. The distorted knowledge among youths is unfortunately compounded by social media and pop culture. The task of combating misinformation about drugs is made more difficult by the vast digital landscape, where young people encounter a wide array of information, some of which can potentially fuel drug-abusing behaviours. The repercussions of drug abuse extend far beyond individual abusers, deeply affecting their families and the community. A 2020 study by Singapore’s Ministry of Social and Family Development stated that children of parents who committed drug offenses are 5.18 times more likely than other children to have contact with the criminal justice system in the future. Additionally, youth offenders from households with a history of substance abuse are 2.2 times more likely to join gangs. Research shows that children of drug-abusing parents experience a range of social-psychological deficits including weakened social bonds to conventional institutions and role models. The Biden administration’s decision to relax its stance towards marijuana has been lauded by advocates for addressing what they say is an uneven drug enforcement policy that has fuelled mass incarceration and disproportionately affected certain communities. However, this commendation appears contradictory, as it fails to recognise the potential adverse effects such a move could have on socio-economically deprived and disadvantaged communities already afflicted by the drug scourge. Empirical evidence from countries that have adopted harm reduction approaches, such as Portugal, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia, reveals mixed outcomes. For instance, the Netherlands, known for its regulated sale of cannabis through so-called “coffeeshops”, continues to face issues of drug tourism and associated social ills where children as young as 14 years old are recruited as “cocaine collectors”. In January 2024, the Mayor of Amsterdam warned in an opinion piece published in the Guardian that the Netherlands risks becoming a “narco-state”. In Sweden, the number of fatal shootings has more than doubled since 2013, reaching 391 in 2022, primarily due to gang-related drug and arms conflicts. A lawyer representing teenage shooting victims told the BBC in December that “children are using their own bags not to carry books, but to carry the drug markets of Sweden on their shoulders. Similarly, Canada and Australia, despite their comprehensive harm reduction strategies, persistently encounter drug-related crime and health issues. In 2023, British Columbia decriminalised drugs to reduce overdose rates, but only to see it surge by 5 per cent, the BBC reported. BC authorities are now considering re-criminalising the use of hard drugs in public places. Closer to home, Thailand is planning to relist cannabis as a narcotic , just two years after it became the first in Southeast Asia to decriminalise its recreational use. These cases illustrate the complexities and potential negative consequences of relaxed drug policies, particularly for vulnerable populations. It is precisely for this reason that Singapore maintains its unwavering commitment to shield vulnerable communities from the devastating effects of drug abuse and prevent the intergenerational cycle of crime, arrest, incarceration, and re-incarceration. Singapore’s approach, guided by science and sensible considerations, prioritises harm prevention over harm reduction and serves as a robust framework for tackling this pervasive issue.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Efforts to ban smartphones in classrooms are well-intentioned and seek to support youth, but research supporting these practices is still unsettled, say these child development and psychology researchers. MONTREAL: This week, the United States Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy called for health warnings on social media for younger users . This recent call follows an earlier advisory on Social Media and Youth Mental Health, also published by the Surgeon General. Health warnings on social media would be analogous to the ones seen on cigarette packages, serving as reminders to parents and youth of the mental health risks of social media. The Surgeon General also called for schools to become phone-free environments. Although in his op-ed, Murthy acknowledged that research on these topics is not yet conclusive, he also noted that we \"don’t have the luxury to wait for perfect information\". Concerns over smartphone use and social media’s impact on child and adolescent mental health are far from new. But they have been reignited because new warnings are being suggested and put into place to limit their use. Smartphone bans or restrictions have been enacted in countries around the world although how these restrictions work in practice varies. Several Canadian provinces are also implementing such restrictions. Although these efforts are well-intentioned, and seek to support youth, research supporting these practices is still unsettled. As researchers in child development and psychology, we feel it is essential to review related research and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of smartphone bans and social media health warnings. Our research shows that greater screen time is associated with negative physical, behavioural and cognitive outcomes. One reason why screen time may be problematic is it interferes with other activities that are associated with well-being, such as physical activity, interactions with family and friends, and academic pursuits. Some, but not all studies show that social media use is associated with more anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents. The pressure for social validation and gaining likes and followers can increase stress and anxiety in youth. Moreover, social media can result in cyberbullying and negative social interactions, which are in turn associated with poor mental health. Social media use in adolescents has also been associated with body image issues, particularly in girls. Social media can present filtered and unrealistic beauty standards that lead to dissatisfaction with one’s own body. It is important to note that these studies are correlational, and do not imply causal evidence. In terms of the impact of smartphones on attention, usage can be distracting to youth. For example, research shows that students can take up to 20 minutes to refocus after being distracted by their smartphones. Banning smartphones from classrooms will likely lead to fewer student distractions, particularly for youth who are experiencing more difficulties in school. Without the need to police smartphone usage, teachers can also focus the classroom more on academic learning. Smartphone bans may also help protect youth against cyberbullying that can happen during class hours. However, smartphone bans in schools will not eliminate cyberbullying, which can occur during off school hours, so it remains critical to educate students, parents and teachers about recognising, preventing, and addressing cyberbullying. In contrast, banning smartphones in school could have detrimental impacts for some youth. For example, LGBTQ+ youth use social media to form a community where they can get support, share information, and develop their identity. Limiting access to a space where they can feel safe and feel like they belong could exacerbate their mental health difficulties. The efficacy of warning labels depends on the form they take. Research suggests that warning labels that promote safe use are more effective. In the case of social media, this means improving social media literacy. For example, warning labels could remind users that what they see on social media is not always representative of real life , and this reminder may help reduce the negative effects of online social comparisons. Social media warning labels also hold the media platforms more accountable. Platforms create and design features to maximise usage, profiting from user engagement. Warning labels can help users be more aware of how these platforms profit from their usage, highlighting the potential risks of excessive use. Although social media labels might not directly dissuade young users from high consumption, they may do so indirectly, via greater parental oversight. Indeed, parents might be more likely to set limits knowing that there is evidence that the product their child or adolescent is using is associated with some risks. In contrast, warning labels focused on moderating or stopping social media use could be less efficient. They may foster a negative self concept in users, such as thinking “I know I shouldn’t be using social media, but I can’t stop because I lack self-control.” This does not represent a good starting point to motivate change. Given the lack of causal evidence on the effects of social media on mental health difficulties, it is important to remember that banning smartphones in classrooms is not a panacea. Importantly, it doesn’t address many root problems of mental health difficulties in youth, such as cyberbullying. Social media is one factor, among many, for why youth are currently experiencing high rates of mental health difficulties. Other factors include structural discrimination, economic hardship, and social isolation made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic. Focusing exclusively on social media will not fix the mental health challenges currently faced by youth. Therefore, comprehensive initiatives such as increasing school funding for mental and digital health literacy alongside bolstering availability of extracurricular activities may serve as effective ways of supporting youth. It is encouraging that policymakers are paying more attention to youth mental health and its causes, but it is important to act at multiple levels to support youth mental health and learning.

(Photo: Ludovic Marin/Pool via REUTERS) Pro-independence protesters burned police vehicles and blocked roads in New Caledonia on Monday (Jun 24), authorities in the French Pacific territory said, as anger erupted over the extradition to France of jailed protest leader Christian Tein. France's High Commission in Noumea said in a statement that protesters had also set fire to the town hall in the Koumac commune, as well as destroyed areas in Paita. The Dumbea municipal council said a firefighting vehicle was attacked, possibly by gunshots, and some schools were forced to close due to the protests, which began in May after France voted to approve reforms to allow thousands more French residents who have lived in the territory for 10 years to vote. Indigenous Kanaks fear this reform will dilute their vote and make it harder for any future referendum on independence to pass, while Paris says the measure is needed to improve democracy. Daniel Goa, president of Caledonian Union, the biggest pro-independence political party, said in a statement he was \"astonished\" at the deportation of Tein and six other party officials on Saturday night. \"All they have done has been to organise more peaceful demonstrations,\" he said. He denied the prosecutor's allegations that Tein and the others were sponsors of violence. Police had arrested Tein, who leads an offshoot of Caledonian Union called Field Action Coordination Cell (CCAT) last week. CCAT have set up barricades that have disrupted traffic for weeks, and Tein had met French President Emmanuel Macron during a visit to Noumea last month aimed at resolving the political impasse. On Monday French loyalist politicians including Sonia Backes and Nicolas Metzdorf said in a statement a third of local business had been destroyed and they had sent a letter to Macron requesting the New Caledonia government be placed under state administration, as it was \"no longer fit to lead\".

(Photo: REUTERS/Claudia Greco) BRUSSELS: China and the European Commission have agreed to s tart talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) being imported into the European Union, opening the door to potential de-escalation. The European Commission is planning to impose provisional duties on EVs produced in China ranging from 17.4 per cent to 38.1 per cent, on top of its standard 10 per cent tariff for car imports. The duties are due to apply by Jul 4. Provisional duties can be imposed within nine months of the start of an EU anti-subsidy investigation if the Commission concludes it needs to prevent injury to EU industry. They can be applied for a maximum of four months, by which point the Commission will decide whether to apply final duties, known as definitive duties. In the EV case, the deadline for this is Nov 3. Provisional duties are only collected if definitive duties are imposed at the end of the investigation. If definitive duties are lower or not applied, then provisional duties are adjusted down accordingly. Until then, customs authorities normally just require a bank guarantee from importers. The duties can also be applied retroactively for as much as 90 days, so in the EV case from early April, with a decision on this taken at the end of the investigation. On Jun 22, Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he had been informed by EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis that there would be concrete negotiations on the tariffs with China. \"What I suggested to my Chinese partners today is that the doors are open for discussions and I hope that this message was heard,\" Habeck said in Shanghai after meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing . By Jul 4, the Commission is due to publish in the EU official journal a lengthy document detailing the ongoing investigation and its findings. The provisional duties will then apply the following day. Interested parties such as China and EV producers have until Jul 18 to comment on the findings. They can also request a hearing. The Commission has already visited more than 100 sites of automakers in China and Europe and done the bulk of its investigation. Its final report generally reads as a confirmation of its provisional findings, with possible adjustments following comments received. Definitive duties are often a little lower than the provisional rates, reflecting an acceptance of some of these arguments. One new element will be Tesla's request that the Commission calculate a separate duty rate for it. The largest EV exporter from China to Europe will want to have a lower rate than the 21 per cent for companies that have cooperated with the investigation, a group it is currently in. As an alternative to duties, exporters can commit to sell their products at or above a minimum price. Chinese exporters agreed such an undertaking in the case of solar panels a decade ago. However, cars are not commodities, so it is hard to see how a minimum price could be applied. At the provisional stage, the Commission has full power to impose duties, although it does consult EU members and is supposed to take their positions into account. They are to submit their positions by Jul 15. At the end of the investigation, the Commission can then propose definitive duties, normally applying for five years. It can be blocked if a qualified majority of the European Union's 27 members oppose measures. A qualified majority means 15 EU members representing 65 per cent of the EU population. In most cases, there is no blocking majority. Any company not in the sample group of BYD, Geely and SAIC that wishes to have its own individual duty can ask for an \"accelerated review\" just after the imposition of definitive measures. Such a review should last a maximum of nine months. The Commission can also carry out an \"interim review\" after a year has elapsed if the measures are no longer necessary or if they are not sufficient to counteract subsidies. The Commission itself often looks into whether producers are evading duties via exports of parts for assembly elsewhere. For the EU, such circumvention exists if 60 per cent or more of the value of parts are imported from the country subject to duties and if the value added in the assembly is no more than 25 per cent. Companies can challenge the measures at the European Court of Justice. China can take the European Union to the World Trade Organization. Both legal paths can take well over a year.

Red Box Energy Services transport vessel AUDAX. (Image: Red Box Group website) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The visa application of a shipping company's chief executive officer was rejected as supporting documents were not provided by the deadline, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) clarified on Monday (Jun 24). The Financial Times had earlier this month reported that Singapore had \"refused\" to renew the work visa of Red Box Energy Services CEO Philip Adkins after the company was found by the United States to be breaching sanctions on Russia. As Red Box is headquartered in Singapore, the refusal to renew his visa is \"in effect forcing him to step down\", Mr Adkins told the Financial Times. \"I accept the consequences of the sanctions, even though I don’t agree with them,\" he added. The Manpower Ministry said in response to CNA queries that Red Box submitted an employment pass (EP) renewal application to the ministry for Mr Adkins in December last year. However, the application was rejected in February this year as the \"necessary supporting documents were not provided by the due date specified in the application process\", said MOM. \"Red Box Energy Services submitted a second EP renewal application for Philip Adkins with the requested documents on Mar 6, 2024. This application is currently being assessed.\" Red Box was placed under sanctions by the US in May for reportedly delivering materials used in the construction of a Russian liquefied natural gas project in the Arctic Circle, reported the Financial Times. The United Kingdom earlier this month added Red Box to its sanctions list, it said. According to the article, Mr Adkins, who is himself not under any sanctions, argued at that time that the construction material were “simple steel frames” and therefore the company did not breach sanctions.

REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo BEIJING: Beijing wants the European Union to scrap its preliminary tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles by Jul 4, China's state-controlled Global Times reported, after an agreement by both sides to hold new trade talks . Provisional EU duties of up to 38.1 per cent on imported Chinese-made EVs are set to kick in by Jul 4 while the bloc investigates what the EU claims are excessive and unfair subsidies to Chinese EV makers. China has repeatedly called on the EU to cancel its tariffs, expressing a willingness to negotiate. Beijing does not want to be embroiled in another tariff war, still stung by US tariffs on its goods imposed by the Trump administration, but says it would take all steps to protect Chinese firms should one happen. Both sides agreed to restart tariff talks after a call between EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis and Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Saturday during a visit to China by Germany's economy minister , who said the doors for discussion are \"open\". The best outcome of the talks is that the EU scraps its tariff decision before Jul 4, Global Times reported late on Sunday, citing observers. The EU's increasingly protectionist moves will trigger countermeasures from China, and an escalation in trade frictions would only lead to \"lose-lose\" results for both sides, the newspaper said. The tariffs are set to be finalised on Nov 2 at the end of the EU anti-subsidy investigation. The Chinese commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. EU trade policy has turned increasingly protective over concerns that China's production-focused development model could see it flooded with cheap goods as Chinese firms look to step up exports amid weak domestic demand. China has rejected accusations of unfair subsidies or that it has an overcapacity problem, saying the development of China's EV industry has been the result of advantages in technology, market and industry supply chains. \"When European Commission President Von der Leyen announced she would investigate China's new energy vehicles ... I had an intuitive feeling it was not only an economic issue but also a geopolitical issue,\" said Zhang Yansheng, chief research fellow at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges. \"Personally, I think it is unfair to start a tariff war by only taking into consideration the capacity utilisation rate and insufficient demand,\" he added. Trade relations between the 27-strong bloc and the world's No 2 economy took an abrupt turn for the worse when the European Parliament voted in May 2021 to freeze ratification of what would have been a landmark investment treaty because of tit-for-tat sanctions over allegations of human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region. Beijing and Brussels came to blows again that year when China downgraded diplomatic ties with Lithuania and told multinationals to sever relations with the Baltic state after Vilnius invited democratically governed Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory, to open a representative office in the capital. Although Beijing is calling for talks, it has also indicated that it has retaliatory measures ready if the commission does not back down, and that it considers Brussels wholly responsible for the escalating tensions. The Global Times, which first reported that China was considering opening a tit-for-tat anti-dumping investigation into European pork imports - which the commerce ministry announced last week it would undertake - has also teed up an anti-subsidy investigation into European dairy goods and tariffs on large-engined petrol cars. Chinese authorities have dropped hints about possible retaliatory measures through state media commentaries and interviews with industry figures. \"It seems probable that Beijing will raise tariffs up to 25 per cent for Europe-made cars with 2.5 or above litre engines,\" said Jacob Gunter, lead analyst at MERICS, a Berlin-based China studies institute. \"Pork and dairy are already on the table for Beijing, and likely more agricultural products will be threatened,\" he added. \"On the EU side, there are a variety of ongoing investigations using the new toolkit that Brussels has assembled, so we should expect some sort of measures targeting distortions on (Chinese) products ranging from medical devices to airport security scanners to steel pipes.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

(Photo: REUTERS/Craig Hudson) More than 100 million people across the US were under heat warnings on Sunday (23 Jun), with cities on the East Coast bracing for record breaking temperatures as the heat dome causing the dangerous conditions expands to the West Coast. Baltimore and Philadelphia are forecast to touch records near 38C on Sunday, while temperatures rise into the 90s Farenheight (32C) in states like Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, as much as 15 degrees above normal for this time of year. The extreme heat will then shift to Nebraska and Kansas on Monday, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. Officials are warning of dangerous conditions in the Philadelphia region where high humidity could drive heat indices above 41C, making it feel even hotter than the actual temperature. \"It likely means we'll be seeing periodic periods of excessive heat across a decent part of the country into July,\" NWS meteorologist Marc Chenard said. \"Not continuous at any one spot, but the overall pattern will continue to favor these above normal temperatures.\" Temperatures have cooled in the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes and New England regions, but excessive heat over 32C continues to stretch from Virginia to New York. Climate change is driving dangerous heat waves across the Northern Hemisphere this week and will continue to deliver dangerous weather for decades to come, research shows. Extreme heat is suspected of causing hundreds of deaths across Asia and Europe as it has taken over cities on four continents. More than 1,000 have died during Haj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, amid sweltering temperatures this year, according to a Reuters tally. In New Mexico, officials are responding to multiple weather events, including a dust storm, flooding and two wildfires. The Biden administration last week declared an emergency over the wildfires, which have been blamed for two deaths and more than 1,400 destroyed structures. The FBI has offered a US$10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest of anyone responsible for the fires. The blazes have scorched 10,117 hectares around the village of Ruidoso, according to the government wildfire tracking website Inciweb. While excessive heat is causing problems in many states, other states are also contending with flooding. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds on Saturday issued a disaster proclamation covering 21 counties due to flooding from heavy rains in the northwest part of the state. Rock Valley officials on Saturday ordered some residents to evacuate with the help of the National Guard, local news outlets report. A flood advisory is also in place in southern Minnesota and southeastern South Dakota.

(Photo: Reuters/Phil Noble) LONDON: Britain's Manchester Airport was resuming operations and expected flights to restart on Sunday (Jun 23) afternoon and evening, airport authorities said, after a power outage caused widespread disruption at Terminals 1 and 2 earlier in the day. It was not clear what led to the power outage but Manchester Airport said in a statement that it was working with airlines to reschedule cancelled flights in the coming days, adding that flights scheduled for Monday would be unaffected. The airport said in an earlier post on social media platform X that passengers due to fly from Terminal 3 should go to the airport as normal, unless advised otherwise by their airline, but they could be affected by delays. The disruption was first reported by Sky News, which said an issue with the power supply had affected the airport and a number of other buildings. Power has been restored but services will be affected throughout the day, the report added. Earlier the airport operator had said a \"significant\" number of flights at the UK's third-busiest airport were being delayed or cancelled Sunday after a major power cut. The Manchester Airports Group, which also operates London Stansted and the East Midlands airports, said Manchester Airport had been \"affected by a major power cut in the area earlier this morning.\" \"This has caused widespread disruption,\" the group said on social media. Power has now been restored at the international airport in the north of England, but passengers due to travel from Terminals One and Two were told to \"not come to the airport until further notice\" as flights were being cancelled. Some flyers took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to describe the \"chaos\", with one passenger saying there was \"baggage thrown on any carousel\" and another saying they were \"stuck on the plane\". Airline easyJet, which operates flights from Terminal One, warned of \"very long queues\" for security, and disruption to check in luggage, meaning passengers can only board flights with cabin bags. The UK's travel industry has been hit by a series of disruptions in the last few years, including technical problems and industrial action affecting rail and air passengers. Last month, a nationwide outage of immigration e-gates caused long delays for thousands of passengers. In August last year, the country faced its worst air traffic control disruption in almost ten years due to a technical fault.

(Image: AP/Golos Dagestana) MOSCOW: Gunmen attacked churches and synagogues in Russia's North Caucasus region of Dagestan on Sunday (Jun 23), killing at least eight police and national guard officers and a priest, officials said. The unidentified gunmen launched simultaneous attacks in Dagestan's largest city of Makhachkala and in the coastal city of Derbent. Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened criminal probes over \"acts of terror\" in Dagestan, a largely Muslim region of Russia neighbouring Chechnya. The leader of Dagestan, Sergei Melikov, wrote on Telegram: \"This evening in Derbent and Makhachkala unknown (attackers) made attempts to destabilise the situation in society.\" \"We know who is behind these terrorist attacks and what objective they are pursuing,\" he added later, without specifying but referring to the war in Ukraine. \"We must understand that war comes to our homes too. We felt it, but today we face it,\" he said. Melikov said the \"active phase\" of operations in Derbent and Makhachkala had ended and that \"six bandits have been liquidated\". The authorities will try to find \"all the members of these sleeper cells who prepared (the attacks) and who were prepared, including abroad\", he added. Russian officials said police had killed four gunmen in Makhachkala and two in Derbent. Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church and a fervent supporter of the Kremlin, said the \"enemy\" was seeking to destroy \"inter-religious peace\" in Russia, without naming who was responsible. The attacks targeted \"two Orthodox churches, a synagogue and a police checkpoint\", the National Antiterrorism Committee said in a statement to RIA Novosti news agency. \"As a result of the terrorist attacks, according to preliminary information, a priest from the Russian Orthodox Church and police officers were killed.\" The Russian Orthodox Church said archpriest Nikolai Kotelnikov was \"brutally killed\" in Derbent. In all, six officers were killed and 12 wounded in the attacks, the spokeswoman for Dagestan's interior ministry, Gayana Gariyeva, told RIA Novosti. The ministry later added that a local police chief had died from his wounds. Russia's National Guard meanwhile said one of its officers had been killed in Derbent and several others wounded. The Dagestan interior ministry said a total of 16 people, including 13 police officers, were wounded in the attacks. In a separate incident, the ministry said gunmen had also shot at a police car in the village of Sergokal, 65km from Makhachkala, wounding one officer. Sunday is a religious holiday, Pentecost Sunday, in the Russian Orthodox Church. Dagestan's interior ministry said 19 people took shelter inside a church in Makhachkala and were later led out to safety. Gunmen also attacked synagogues in both cities. \"The synagogue in Derbent is on fire,\" the chairman of the public council of Russia's Federation of Jewish Communities, Boruch Gorin, wrote on Telegram. \"The synagogue in Makhachkala has also been set on fire and burnt down,\" he said. The rabbi of Makhachkala, Rami Davidov, later told RIA Novosti that no one was killed or injured there. The Russian Jewish Congress said on its website the Derbent synagogue was attacked about 40 minutes before evening prayers. Gunmen fired at police and security guards and threw in Molotov cocktails, it said, adding that the attack in Makhachkala was similar. Dagestan lies east of Chechnya, where Russian authorities battled separatists in two brutal wars, first from 1994 to 1996 and then from 1999 to 2000. Since the defeat of Chechen insurgents, Russian authorities have been locked in a simmering conflict with militants from across the North Caucasus that has killed scores of civilians and police. State news agency TASS cited a law enforcement source as saying the \"gunmen who carried out attacks in Makhachkala and Derbent are supporters of an international terrorist organisation\", without naming it. Russia's FSB security service in April said it had arrested four people in Dagestan on suspicion of plotting the deadly attack on Moscow's Crocus City Hall concert venue in March, which was claimed by the Islamic State group. Militants from Dagestan are known to have travelled to join the Islamic State in Syria and in 2015, the group declared it had established a \"franchise\" in the North Caucasus.

A man affected by the scorching heat is helped by another Muslim pilgrim and police officer the site of the symbolic 'stoning of the devil' ritual during the annual Haj pilgrimage in Mina on Jun 16, 2024. (File photo: AFP/Fadel Senna) RIYADH/CAIRO: The number of deaths during this year's Haj pilgrimage totalled 1,301 people, Saudi Arabia's health minister Fahad Al-Jalajel said on Sunday (Jun 23). The minister, quoted by state television, said that deaths were caused by pilgrims \"walking long distances under direct sunlight without adequate shelter or comfort\". Fatalities also included a number of elderly people and those suffering from chronic diseases. Some 83 per cent of the fatalities were among people who were not authorised to make the pilgrimage, he said. On Friday, a senior Saudi official defended the Gulf kingdom's management of the Haj pilgrimage. \"The state did not fail, but there was a misjudgement on the part of people who did not appreciate the risks,\" the official told AFP in the government's first comments on the deaths. An AFP tally on Friday, compiling official statements and reports from diplomats involved in the response, put the toll at 1,126, more than half of them from Egypt. The senior Saudi official said the Saudi government had confirmed 577 deaths for the two busiest days of Haj: Saturday, when pilgrims gathered for hours of prayers in the blazing sun on Mount Arafat, and Sunday, when they participated in the \"stoning of the devil\" ritual in Mina. \"This happened amid difficult weather conditions and a very harsh temperature,\" the official said while acknowledging that the 577 figure was partial and did not cover all of Haj, which formally ended on Wednesday. \"Regrettably, the number of mortalities reached 1,301, with 83 per cent being unauthorised to perform hajj and having walked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort,\" the official Saudi Press Agency reported. The Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once before they die. Saudi officials had earlier said 1.8 million pilgrims took part this year, a similar total to last year, and that 1.6 million came from abroad. For the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer. The timing of the Haj moves forward about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions. A 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for hajj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\". Haj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and distributed to individuals via a lottery. Even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs spur many pilgrims to attempt the Haj without a permit , though they risk arrest and deportation if caught by Saudi security forces. The irregular route, which can save pilgrims thousands of dollars, has become increasingly popular since 2019 when Saudi Arabia introduced a general tourism visa, making it easier to enter the Gulf kingdom. Before this year's Haj, Saudi officials said they had cleared more than 300,000 would-be pilgrims from Mecca who did not have Haj permits. But later, the senior Saudi official said on Friday, \"an order came from above that we allow people who arrived at the gates of the holy places\" to participate. \"We can estimate the number of the unregistered pilgrims at around 400,000,\" the official said. \"Almost all of them from one nationality,\" the official added, an apparent reference to Egypt. On Saturday, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly ordered 16 tourism companies stripped of their licences and referred their managers to the public prosecutor over illegal pilgrimages to Mecca, Egypt's cabinet said. It said the rise in the number of deaths of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims stemmed from some companies which \"organised the Haj programmes using a personal visit visa, which prevents its holders from entering Mecca\" via official channels. Arab diplomats told AFP earlier this week that Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths, 630 of them unregistered pilgrims. A US State Department spokesman said on Friday that \"multiple\" US citizens died in the Haj. \"We can confirm the deaths of multiple US citizens in Saudi Arabia\", the spokesman said, without providing further details. When asked if any Singaporean pilgrims had been affected, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) told CNA on Monday that those in Saudi Arabia are \"generally in good state of health\". \"They have been strongly advised to prioritise hydration and take necessary precautions to mitigate the effects of the challenging weather conditions,\" the council added. \"Activities are also encouraged to be timed either early in the morning or at night to avoid heatstroke.\" The Haj, whose timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, fell again this year during the scorching Saudi summer. Temperatures reached 51.8 degrees Celsius at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday, according to the National Meteorological Centre. Unregistered pilgrims did not have access to amenities meant to make the pilgrimage more bearable, including air-conditioned tents. Unregistered Egyptian pilgrims told AFP this week that in some cases they struggled to access hospitals or hail ambulances for loved ones, some of whom ended up dying . The pilgrims also said they could not access official Haj buses - the only transportation around the holy sites - without paying exorbitant, off-the-books fees. Forced to walk for many kilometres under the blazing sun, some reported seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and pilgrims collapsing because of apparent exhaustion. The senior Saudi official told AFP on Friday that there was no blanket ban on unregistered pilgrims using the buses. \"There is no ban on them using the buses but these buses are prepared for the registered pilgrims that we know are coming,\" the official said. The unregistered pilgrims \"walk along bus routes that are not set up with food or medical services like ambulances. It's a highway for the buses\".

    "article_content": "World World Days after Israel announced a daily pause in fighting on a key route to allow more aid into Gaza, chaos in the besieged Palestinian territory has left vital supplies piled up and undistributed in the searing summer heat. More than eight months of war, sparked by Hamas's unprecedented Oct 7 attack on Israel, have led to dire humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip and repeated UN warnings of famine . Desperation among Gaza's 2.4 million population has increased as fighting rages, sparking warnings from agencies that they are unable to deliver aid. Israel says it has let supplies in and called on agencies to step up deliveries. \"The breakdown of public order and safety is increasingly endangering humanitarian workers and operations in Gaza,\" the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, said in a briefing late Friday. \"Alongside the fighting, criminal activities and the risk of theft and robbery has effectively prevented humanitarian access to critical locations.\" But Israel says it has allowed hundreds of trucks of aid into southern Gaza, trading blame with the United Nations over why the aid is stacking up. It shared aerial footage of containers lined up on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom crossing and more trucks arriving to add to the stockpile. The October Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 37,551 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. With civil order breaking down in Gaza, the UN says it has been unable to pick up any supplies from Kerem Shalom since Tuesday, leaving crucial aid in limbo. A deputy UN spokesman this week said the crossing \"is operating with limited functionality, including because of fighting in the area\". William Schomburg, International Committee of the Red Cross chief in Rafah, said arranging lorries from the Egyptian side in particular was complicated. \"It's not just a question of civil order, but also the fact that you often have to cross battlefields,\" he said in an online briefing, adding that the area near Kerem Shalom had been hostile. \"There were even rockets fired nearby. So this whole area is particularly complicated to navigate for reasons linked to the hostilities and for reasons linked to general security.\" Israel's coordinator for civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, known as COGAT, said Thursday \"the content of 1,200 aid trucks awaits collection by UN aid agencies\", saying a lack of distribution was responsible. Earlier in the week, COGAT spokesman Shimon Freedman told reporters at the crossing the daily pause on a southern road into Gaza was designed to allow the UN \"to collect and distribute more aid\" alongside an Israeli military presence. He said most of the aid had not moved because \"organisations have not taken sufficient steps to improve their distribution capacity\". Aid agencies have instead pointed to Israel's offensive on the southern city of Rafah, which pushed out more than a million people and closed a border crossing with Egypt, as a deepening humanitarian crisis hampered relief efforts. Schomburg described Rafah City as a \"ghost town\". \"It is a ghost town in the sense that you see very few people, high levels of destruction, and really just another symbol of the unfolding tragedy that has become Gaza over the last nine months,\" he said. The UN food agency has said its aid convoys have been looted inside Gaza by \"desperate people\". As both sides stall, it is the civilians in Gaza who are paying the price. \"We don't see any aid. Everything we get to eat comes from our own money and it's all very expensive,\" said Umm Mohammad Zamlat, 66, from northern Gaza but now living in Khan Younis in the south. \"Even agencies specialised in aid deliveries are not able to provide anything to us,\" she added. NGO Doctors Without Borders said on Friday that six trucks with 37 tons of supplies, mostly essentially medical items, have been held up at the Egyptian part of Kerem Shalom since Jun 14. \"This is incomprehensible and unacceptable,\" a statement said. \"It's like asking a fireman to watch a house filled with people burn down, and preventing him putting out the fire.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

(Photo: REUTERS/Violeta Santos Moura) JERUSALEM: Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant headed to Washington on Sunday (Jun 23) to discuss the next phase of the Gaza war and escalating hostilities on the border with Lebanon, where exchanges of fire with Hezbollah have stoked fears of wider conflict. Iran-backed Hezbollah began attacking Israel shortly after Hamas' Oct 7 assault sparked the war in Gaza, and the sides have been trading blows in the months since then. Hezbollah has said it will not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. \"We are prepared for any action that may be required in Gaza, Lebanon, and in more areas,\" Gallant said in a statement before setting off to Washington, where he said he would meet his counterpart Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Earlier in June, Hezbollah targeted Israeli towns and military sites with the largest volleys of rockets and drones in the hostilities so far, after an Israeli strike killed the most senior Hezbollah commander yet. US envoy Amos Hochstein visited Israel and Lebanon last week in an attempt to cool tensions, amid an uptick in cross-border fire and an escalation in rhetoric on both sides. On Sunday, an Israeli soldier was severely wounded by a drone strike, the military said. Some Israeli officials have linked the ongoing Israeli push into Rafah, the southern area of Gaza where it says it is targeting the last battalions of militant Islamist group Hamas, to a potential focus on Lebanon. Gallant appeared to make the same link in his statement. \"The transition to Phase C in Gaza is of great importance. I will discuss this transition with US officials, how it may enable additional things and I know that we will achieve close cooperation with the US on this issue as well,\" Gallant said. Scaling back Gaza operations would free up forces to take on Hezbollah, if Israel were to launch a ground offensive or step up its aerial bombardments. Officials have described the third and last phase of Israel's Gaza offensive as winding down fighting to smaller scale operations while stepping up efforts to stabilize a post-Hamas rule in the enclave, much of which has been laid to waste. Gallant, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, has sparred with the premier in the past few months, calling for a clearer post-war plan for Gaza that will not leave Israel in charge, a demand echoed by the White House. Netanyahu has been walking a tightrope as he seeks to keep his government together by balancing the demands of the defence establishment, including ex-generals like Gallant, and far-right coalition partners who have resisted any post-Gaza strategy that could open the way to a future Palestinian state. The head of Israel's parliamentary Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, Yuli Edelstein, told Army Radio on Sunday that fighting Hezbollah would be complex either way, now or later. \"We are not in the right position to conduct fighting on both the southern front and the northern front. We will have to deploy differently in the south in order to fight in the north,\" said Edelstein, also a Likud member. Edelstein criticized a video by Netanyahu released last week in which the prime minister said the Biden administration was \"withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel.\" The video led to a spat with the White House. President Joe Biden's administration paused a shipment of 2,000 pound and 500 pound bombs in May over concerns about their impact if used in densely-populated areas of Gaza. Israel was still due to get billions of dollars worth of US weaponry. \"I hope that in the discussions behind closed doors much more will be achieved than by attempts to create pressure with videos,\" Edelstein said, referring to Gallant's trip. Netanyahu said in a statement later on Sunday that the video was a last resort, after appeals made behind closed doors did not help. Israel's ground and air campaign in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. The offensive has killed more than 37,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population of the enclave homeless and destitute.

    "article_content": "World World Palestinians carry a casualty outside the headquarters of UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) following an Israeli strike in Gaza City, Jun 23, 2024. (Photo: REUTERS/Mahmoud Issa) CAIRO: Eight Palestinians were killed on Sunday (Jun 23) in an Israeli air strike on a training college near Gaza City being used to distribute aid, Palestinian witnesses said, as Israeli tanks pushed further into the southern city of Rafah . The strike hit part of a vocational college run by the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA that is now providing aid to displaced families, the witnesses said. \"Some people were coming to receive coupons and others had been displaced from their houses and they were sheltering here. Some were filling up water, others were receiving coupons, and suddenly we heard something falling. We ran away, those who were carrying water let it spill,\" said Mohammed Tafesh, one of the witnesses. A Reuters photographer saw a low-rise building completely demolished and bodies wrapped in blankets laid out beside the road, waiting to be taken away. \"We pulled out martyrs (from beneath the rubble), one who used to sell cold drinks and another who used to sell pastries and others who distributed or received coupons,\" Tafesh said. \"There are about four or five martyrs and 10 injured. Thank God, the condition of the injured is good.\" The Israeli military said the site, which it said had served in the past as a UNRWA headquarters, has been used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants. It added that precautionary measures were taken before the strike to reduce the risk of harming civilians. \"This morning (Sunday), IAF fighter jets directed by IDF and ISA intelligence struck terrorist infrastructure in which Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were operating,\" the military said in a statement. \"This is another example of Hamas' systematic exploitation of civilian infrastructure and the civilian population as a human shield for its terrorist activities,\" it added. Hamas denies Israeli accusations it uses civilians as human shields or uses civilian facilities for military purposes. Juliette Touma, UNRWA's Director of Communications, said the agency was looking into the details of the reported attack before providing more information. \"Since the beginning of the war, we have recorded that nearly 190 of our buildings have been hit. This is the vast majority of our buildings in Gaza,\" she said. A total of 193 UNRWA team members have been killed in the conflict, she added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the phase of intense fighting against Hamas in the Gaza Strip would end \"very soon\" but that the war would not end until the Islamist group no longer controls the Palestinian enclave. \"After the intense phase is finished, we will have the possibility to move part of the forces north. And we will do this,\" Netanyahu said in an interview with Israel's Channel 14. Israel's fighting against Iran-backed Hezbollah has escalated on the northern border with Lebanon, where many Israeli towns have been evacuated. Netanyahu said a northern deployment would allow residents to come home. More than eight months into Israel's war in the Hamas-administered Palestinian enclave, its advance is focused on the two areas its forces have yet to seize, Rafah on Gaza's southern tip and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre. Israel's ground and air campaign in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. The offensive has killed almost 37,600 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left Gaza in ruins . Residents said Israeli tanks had advanced to the edge of the Mawasi displaced persons' camp in the northwest of Rafah in fierce fighting with Hamas-led fighters, part of a push into western and northern Rafah in which they had blown up dozens of houses in recent days. \"The fighting with the resistance has been intense. The occupation forces are overlooking the Mawasi area now, which forced families there to head for Khan Younis,\" said one resident, who asked not to be named, on a chat app. The Israeli military said it was continuing \"intelligence-based, targeted operations\" in the Rafah area and had located weapons stores and tunnel shafts, and killed Palestinian gunmen. The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad movement said their fighters had attacked Israeli forces in Rafah with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs and pre-planted explosive devices. Another strike killed two people in Nuseirat in central Gaza. In Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip, health officials at Kamal Adwan Hospital said two babies had died of malnutrition, taking the number of children who have died of malnutrition or dehydration since Oct 7 to at least 31, a number that health officials say reflects under-recording.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore In an Apr 20 article, the Financial Times reported that Singapore had given international banks an \"unusual series of top-level briefings on geopolitics\". SINGAPORE: Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Indranee Rajah on Tuesday (May 7) refuted a Financial Times (FT) report that had characterised government meetings with top international banks as \"unusual\". The Apr 20 article, titled \"Singapore gives top-level briefings to reassure foreign banks on stability\", said the government had given international banks an \"unusual series of top-level briefings on geopolitics\". The purpose of this, the article said, was to reassure the banks that Singapore \"can remain stable and neutral at a time of rising tension between China and the West\". In a written parliamentary reply to Member of Parliament Louis Chua (WP-Sengkang), who had asked Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong about the objectives and key messages of such briefings, Ms Indranee took issue with the way these meetings were framed by FT. \"It is surprising that such a poorly sourced story, vainly searching for a point, could appear in a major paper like FT, especially after we had repeatedly clarified matters with the reporter, including telling her the briefings were not unusual,\" said Ms Indranee on behalf of the Prime Minister. The article was written by FT's Singapore and Southeast Asia correspondent Mercedes Ruehl. According to her LinkedIn profile, she has been in Singapore since 2020. Ms Indranee added: \"As for the suggestion the Government was somehow conducting these briefings under the radar, the FT did not report what we told its reporter: That almost all the briefings her article mentioned had already been publicised by the ministers on their own social media accounts.\" According to the FT article, citing sources with knowledge of the talks, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean led several such meetings. Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong and Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam were also involved in these meetings, according to FT. Citigroup and Standard Chartered were named in the article as some of the US and European financial institutions that took part in the briefings. Local banks were also involved, said FT. In her written reply, Ms Indranee said ministers and officials have been conducting such briefings for \"decades\". Parties involved in such meetings include not only financial institutions – international and local – but also groups such as businesses, non-governmental organisations, unionists and students. \"In brief, we engage as widely as possible,\" said Ms Indranee. In response to CNA's queries, an FT spokesperson said on Wednesday: \"We stand by our reporting.\" Mr Chua also filed a question for the Prime Minister asking about plans to tighten anti-money laundering rules in the wake of a multi-billion-dollar case , Singapore's largest. Ten people have been charged and five of them sentenced – with jail terms ranging from 13 to 15 months. Ms Indranee said an inter-ministerial committee intends to provide an update on its findings in \"the coming months\". The formation of this committee was announced in October 2023. It is chaired by Ms Indranee, who is also the Second Minister for Finance. The committee is made up of political office holders from the Monetary Authority of Singapore and four ministries: Home Affairs, Law, Manpower, and Trade and Industry.

The Workers' Party Secretary-General Pritam Singh at a press conference in Singapore on Jul 19, 2023. (Photo: Reuters/Edgar Su) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Workers’ Party chief Pritam Singh said on Tuesday (Mar 19) that he will continue with all parliamentary duties and town council responsibilities until the legal process related to his charges comes to a “complete close”. He was charged on Tuesday with making false statements before a parliamentary committee, in relation to a lie that his party’s f ormer lawmaker Raeesah Khan told in the House in 2021. The 47-year-old, who is also the Leader of the Opposition, pleaded not guilty to two charges under the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. “Until the legal process comes to a complete close, I will continue with all my parliamentary duties and town council responsibilities – including, but not limited to, meet-the-people sessions, estate walks, house visits, Hammer outreaches, amongst others,” he said in a Facebook post. The charges come two years after the committee said he had lied under oath during the hearings. Ms Khan’s case came about in November 2021 when she admitted to lying in parliament over a rape incident that she had alleged was mishandled by the police. She resigned later that month. In his Facebook post, Singh reiterated his not guilty plea to both charges. “When I first entered politics some years ago now, I was under no illusion as to the challenges that lay ahead in building a more balanced and democratic political system in Singapore. Even as the work continues, it has been my privilege and honour to be part of a Workers’ Party team that advances this cause. “I will continue to play my part in this endeavour and I thank all Singaporeans for your continued support for the efforts of the Workers’ Party. Let’s press on,” he said. If found guilty, Singh may be jailed for up to three years, fined up to S$7,000, or both, for each charge. A spokesperson for the Attorney-General's Chambers later said in response to media queries that the prosecution will ask the court to impose a fine for each charge if Singh is found guilty. The spokesperson added that the prosecution's position is \"based on the evidence presently available and considering the totality of the circumstances\". \"It will be for the court to decide whether Mr Pritam Singh is guilty of the charges. If he is found guilty, it is for the court to decide what the appropriate punishment should be,\" the spokesperson said.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary The current king has steered Malaysia through political instability. The next king, Sultan Ibrahim of Johor, can be a beacon of stability the country needs, says James Chin, Asian Studies professor at the University of Tasmania. Johor ruler Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar will be installed as Malaysia’s king from Jan 31, 2024. (Photo: Facebook/Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar) This audio is generated by an AI tool. HOBART: On Friday (Oct 27) morning, it was announced that Johor ruler, Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar , will be installed as Malaysia’s king from Jan 31, 2024 . The Agong, as the king is called in Malaysia, is chosen based on the country’s unique rotational system, with a fixed order of the nine hereditary sultans taking turns to become head of state for five years. The question everyone is asking in Kuala Lumpur now is: What sort of Agong will Sultan Ibrahim be? The short answer is that he will not be very different from how he has been as Sultan of Johor, though he will now have to keep in mind that he represents his brother rulers as well. He is no longer speaking for the state of Johor but the whole nation . What we do know is that Sultan Ibrahim strongly believes in multiculturalism. He has made it clear many times in Johor, that he treats all his subjects as Bangsa Johor - an inclusive Johorean identity - and that he does not like the racial polarisation of Malaysian politics. In one famous incident in 2017, he reprimanded a Johor laundry operator for a signboard limiting its services to only Muslims, warning business owners with blatant discriminatory practices that their licences may be revoked. “Don’t mess around with your narrow-minded religious prejudices,” he said at the time. The new Queen, Raja Zarith Sofiah Sultan Idris Shah, is someone who shares her husband’s belief in Bangsa Johor and multicultural Malaysia. Many may not know that she graduated from Oxford University with a major in Chinese Studies. Although Malaysia is a constitutional monarchy, the sultans are powerful in their own right. As Johor ruler, Sultan Ibrahim is already part of the constitutional body called the Conference of Rulers which is the final arbiter of anything to do with Islam and Malay adat (customs and traditions), including federal laws. A new role he will take on is to provide the prime minister with advice and counsel. As a tradition inherited from the British, the prime minister regularly meets with the Agong when Cabinet is in session to brief him on all government policies. The Agong will provide his views on government policy - widely seen to be a non-partisan and non-political view - which will be taken into account by the prime minister. Retired British prime ministers have said that the advice given by the late Queen Elizabeth II was very important in how they made their decisions. There is no reason to think it will be different in Malaysia’s case. In recent years, the monarchy has played an important role when the politicians are unable to get their act together . When the first Pakatan Harapan government fell apart in 2020, it was the current Agong, Sultan Abdullah of Pahang, who selected Muhyiddin Yassin to be prime minister. A year later, when Muhyiddin lost his majority , it was the Agong again who selected Ismail Sabri Yaakob as his successor. After the inconclusive general election results in November 2022, again it was left to the Agong to assess which of the coalition leaders, Muhyiddin Yassin or Anwar Ibrahim, could command the majority in parliament. It’s unsurprising if Malaysians see the monarchy as the salve when the political class is cracked. The Agong is the one who will fix their mess, unwavering. With hopes that the political tumult will end with current Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim at the helm, who similarly holds a vision of multicultural Malaysia, Sultan Ibrahim can be the beacon of stability the country needs.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Vang Shuiming surrendered about 90 per cent of the assets seized from him, including apartments in Clarke Quay and Beach Road. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The suspect with the highest number of charges in Singapore's multibillion-dollar money laundering crackdown was sentenced to 13 months and six weeks' jail on Tuesday (May 14). Vang Shuiming, 43, faced a total of 22 charges. He pleaded guilty to three of them, and the remainder were considered for sentencing. His offences involved the possession of about S$2.4 million (US$1.8 million) in suspected criminal proceeds, and the use of documents he had reason to believe were forged. He also voluntarily forfeited about S$180 million in assets to the state. This is the largest amount that any accused person in the money laundering case has forfeited so far. It came out of more than S$198 million in assets seized from him, including assets that he paid for but were held in the name of his wife, Wang Ruiyan. These included 10 apartments in Clarke Quay and one at Tomlinson Road that are under construction, and four apartments in the Beach Road area. Other items included a S$240,000 Kawai grand piano, a green Rolls-Royce Phantom worth S$1.8 million and a white Bentley Flying Spur worth S$1.3 million. More than S$137,000 in donations were also surrendered and held in police custody. Deputy Public Prosecutor David Koh sought a jail term of 14 to 16 months, while Vang's defence lawyers from Drew & Napier argued for 13 months. Vang is the sixth of 10 suspects to be dealt with in this case. Five individuals pleaded guilty before him and were sentenced to between 13 and 15 months in jail. The accused persons all hold various foreign nationalities. Deportations have already begun for those who have finished serving their sentences. Vang is listed as a Turkish national in court documents and has passports from China, Vanuatu and Türkiye. He is linked to three other suspects who are on the run, including his brother. When Vang was nabbed in a Good Class Bungalow along Bishopsgate in Tanglin on Aug 15, 2023, he had funds totalling about S$2.42 million across four Singapore bank accounts. The funds were suspected of being benefits of criminal conduct, and Vang was unable to satisfactorily account for how he came by the money. This became the subject of four of his charges. When dealing with banks, Vang said the funds were his shareholder profits from two purported e-commerce companies – Xiamen Likanghang Trading and Xiamen Yetian Trading. After his arrest, he admitted they were not the source, but claimed the funds came from his loan business in China, Xiamen Mingxin Guarantee. Vang \"maintained this story\" through 18 statements to police from Aug 15 to Sep 4, 2023, said the prosecution. But on Sep 26, 2023, he admitted this was untrue. He then claimed that the money came from \"his gambling winnings and profits from real estate investments in the Philippines\". Vang has not substantiated this claim, the prosecution noted. The bulk of Vang's charges – 18 of them – were for submitting documents that he had reason to believe were forged to multiple banks in Singapore. Vang used these documents when questioned by the banks about the sources of funds in his accounts. For the proceeded charge, Mr Koh described how Vang arranged for more than HK$229 million (US$29 million) to be sent to his Citibank account from an Indonesian remittance agent in April and May 2021. Citibank asked Vang about the source of the funds and his relationship with the remittance agent, since he was not a resident of Indonesia. Through one Wang Qiming, who was then his relationship manager, Vang provided a certificate purportedly from the remittance agent, stating that it received the funds as \"first party inflow\" from the accused. The remittance agency also said that through an authorised agent in China named \"Chen Ze Long\", it received funds equivalent to HK$8 million from Vang in August 2021. When Citibank's compliance department asked for more documents to verify these claims, Vang provided a purported bank statement from a China Merchant Bank account in his name, showing transfers from \"Chen Ze Long\". But in the course of investigations after his arrest, Vang admitted that he did not have any China Merchant Bank account and the statement was a forgery. The other forged documents purported to be financial statements of Xiamen Likanghang, Xiamen Yetian and Xiamen Mingxin. Vang submitted these to UOB Kay Hian in June 2022 and Bank Julius Baer & Co in July 2022. \"The accused represented to the banks, either directly or through his external asset managers, that his wealth came from three companies in China of which he was a shareholder,\" Mr Koh said. \"These financial statements were forged, and the accused had reason to believe they were forged.\" The prosecution stressed the need for a \"suitably lengthy\" jail term to discourage Vang and like-minded individuals from using Singapore as a money laundering haven. Mr Koh pointed out the transnational element of Vang's offences and the substantial amount of money involved, which he argued were aggravating factors. In mitigation, defence lawyer Wendell Wong said that Vang's early plea of guilt and voluntary forfeiture indicated his remorse, and also saved the state time and resources. \"Mr Vang had moved his family (including his wife, his young children and his elderly parents) to Singapore in or around 2019 as he wanted to start a new chapter of their lives here,\" he said in submissions. \"They will suffer the consequences of his conviction now,\" the lawyer told the court. He also said that \"Mr Vang did not want to cause any trouble in Singapore or for Singapore\", but District Judge Sharmila Sripathy-Shanaz took issue with what she called a \"curious and ultimately strained characterisation\" of the man. Instead, she agreed with the prosecution that Vang's conduct reflected \"a broader abuse of Singapore's financial infrastructure\". Parties also discussed the significance of the absolute amount and the proportion of the assets that Vang forfeited. Defence lawyer Mr Wong pointed out that Vang's S$180 million forfeiture was the highest among all the related convictions so far. He contrasted this with Wang Baosen, who forfeited about S$8 million, and whom he used as a reference in sentencing arguments. But Judge Sripathy-Shanaz noted that Vang was forfeiting about 90 per cent of his seized assets, while Wang forfeited 100 per cent of his assets. When this was pointed out to the defence, Mr Wong asked the judge to consider \"the pain factor\" involved in the different amount of money at stake for Vang. The judge gave Vang's forfeiture \"significant weight\" in her decision on the sentence. But she also said it was \"crucial to consider not merely the absolute value of the property forfeited, but rather the proportion forfeited relative to the total assets seized\". She also observed a \"distinct sentencing trend\" for the offences of having criminal proceeds in the money laundering case so far, and saw the need to ensure consistency in sentencing.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Su Jianfeng, one of the 10 suspects involved in Singapore's billion-dollar money laundering probe, was on Thursday (May 16) slapped with six new charges. The fresh charges are related to his alleged fraudulent submission of forged documents to banks. This brings the total number of charges that the 36-year-old faces to 12. In the latest charges, Su had allegedly forged and submitted as genuine multiple property sale contracts to two banks – OCBC and Maybank Singapore. He had fraudulently used a property sale contract for the sale of \"Emaar Square Building 2 Property Number 408\" to one Zhou Weihong, and submitted it as genuine to OCBC. This was allegedly done to deceive the bank into believing that a deposit of S$2,999,980 (US$2.23 million) from Wecord Rich Trading Company on May 28, 2021, was from the sale of the said property. In another charge, Su allegedly used the same method for the sale of \"Residences_E2 Property Number 2302\" to a Lin Zhenghu, and submitted the contract to Maybank Singapore. It involved a deposit of S$1,029,970 and S$969,970 from a company called Tuo Xin You in December 2020, disguised as proceeds from the sale of the property. According to court documents, he had done so to deceive the banks that he had legitimate sources of wealth, and into believing that the deposits were from the sale of the properties. Su also submitted two loan agreements to two companies as genuine documents to OCBC, allegedly intending to deceive the bank that the deposits were from the loans. The first loan agreement was between him and a company, Sheng Yu, for a loan of about S$2.5 million, which was then submitted to OCBC. He allegedly intended to deceive the bank into believing deposits of S$1,029,990, S$499,990 and S$969,990 from Sheng Yu were delivered from the loan. A second involved an agreement between Su and another company, Sheng Big, for a loan of about S$2 million. Deposits of S$1,109,990 and S$889,990 on Nov 10, 2020 were delivered to OCBC Bank. Su, who is listed as a Vanuatu national in charge sheets, initially faced four charges in August 2023 for possessing proceeds from illegal remote gambling. This comprised S$17 million stored in three safe deposit boxes and S$550,903 in cash. He was arrested on Aug 15 that year in a Good Class Bungalow along Third Avenue near Bukit Timah. On Feb 8, 2024, he was handed two other charges for forging annual reports of a Chinese company, Xiamen Zhou Hang Mao Yi You Xian Gong Si, and submitted them as genuine documents to Standard Chartered Bank and Bank of Singapore. Since the arrest of the 10 suspects across multiple locations in August last year, the total value of assets seized or frozen has risen to over S$3 billion. On Tuesday, Vang Shuiming, one of the suspects in the case, was sentenced to 13 months and six weeks' jail , making him the sixth suspect to be dealt with by the court. Five others pleaded guilty before him and were sentenced to between 13 and 15 months' jail. Su’s matter has been fixed for a pre-trial conference on May 28.

Lin Baoying, charged over the billion-dollar money laundering case in Singapore. (Illustration: Rafa Estrada) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Lin Baoying, the only woman among 10 suspects in Singapore's multibillion-dollar money-laundering investigation, was on Tuesday (May 21) handed seven new charges. The new charges are related to the possession of suspected criminal proceeds and forgeries that were submitted to banks. After the charges were tendered, Lin's lawyer Mr Chew Kei-jin informed the court that she wished to plead guilty. Lin then spoke up and asked the judge for an early date for her plea. The 44-year-old Chinese national appeared via video-link and followed proceedings through a Mandarin interpreter. The fresh charges mean that Lin now stands accused of a total of 10 offences. She was previously charged with forging documents to sell a property in Macau and for lying that she had not prepared the sales document. The two original charges of forgery were amended on Monday. Lin is now accused of submitting a forged agreement of a property sale in Macau to justify deposits of nearly HK$122.5 million (US$15.7 million) in a CIMB Bank account and HK$75 million in a Standard Chartered Bank account. In the fresh charges, she is similarly accused of submitting forged property sale documents to UOB Kay Hian and the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), to justify deposits of HK$12.5 million across both accounts. She is charged with having almost HK$210 million suspected of being at least partly criminal proceeds, held across her four bank accounts. She also allegedly conspired with one Liu Kai and one Li Hongmin to forge a tax payment certificate with the intention of using it to cheat Bank Julius Baer & Co. Lin will return to court for a pre-trial conference on Thursday. Her partner, Zhang Ruijin, 45, was sentenced to 15 months' jail after pleading guilty to three charges in April for his role in the money-laundering operation. The couple was arrested in a bungalow along Pearl Island at Sentosa Cove last August. The prosecution previously said that Lin had a teenage daughter who lived in Beach Road with a domestic helper, while she lived separately in Sentosa. The combined assets between Lin and Zhang came to about S$325 million (US$240 million), with Lin having the larger share of the pie, a court previously heard. More than S$3 billion in assets have been seized or frozen in relation to the case, making it Singapore's largest money-laundering probe and likely one of the largest money-laundering operations in the world. Six of the 10 suspects have been convicted and sentenced to between 13 months and 15 months in jail. They have forfeited more than S$540 million in assets to the state so far.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Dupes, short for duplicates, are not quite copies of branded items. But that is not stopping what seems to be a growing consumption trend. The programme Talking Point delves into dupe culture and puts some products to the test. Talking Point host Munah Bagharib tests activewear and other products to find out what dupes are value for money. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: As a university student, resources are “very limited” for Daniel Chan, who wears basics such as T-shirts “all the time”. But if he can get a better deal when shopping, then it means he can “buy more things”. That is why he buys dupes, short for duplicates. These are cheaper alternatives to popular items. “We (Gen Zers) love it when we score a good deal,” said the 24-year-old, wearing a S$10 T-shirt that was a dupe of a S$19.90 T-shirt from another brand. Although the term “dupe” is used, it is not a replica of the original item. People who are into dupes know they are not buying the real deal but want it anyway. WATCH: Part 1 — Why Gen Z loves dupes: Can cheaper also be better? (22:18) “Young people are more conscious (of) what we (spend) our money on, so dupes have started to become a very big thing,” said Chan, who is also a TikTok influencer who recommends dupe products to his 81,000 followers. With so many categories of dupes coming on the scene, the programme Talking Point reached out to viewers through an online survey and an Instagram poll to find out what they normally buy. Among the 200-plus people who responded, clothes ranked top of the list. Accessories including bags ranked second, followed by make-up and perfume, electronics and other items such as household products. Clothing dupes are so popular they are changing the way clothes are produced today, accelerating the production time and begetting what is called ultra-fast fashion. “With social media, luxury trends are a lot more visible and accessible online to the mass consumer,” said fashion researcher Angelene Wong. “All this data then goes into the manufacturing process of ultra-fast fashion. “Because of social media, (dupes) have been deemed to be of good quality but with a lower price point, and so these items have been de-stigmatised. … And because they’ve become so accessible, that lends (itself) to an increased consumption rate.” Some dupes of beauty products are almost three times cheaper. Some activewear dupes are 90 per cent cheaper than the originals. One of the Talking Point viewers who usually buys dupe watches reckoned he has saved S$8,000 to S$9,000. Besides the lower price tag making for better value, a good dupe for Chan is one that serves the same function as the original and is still good quality. “It gives you perhaps the same vibe,” he said. But does the I-want-it-now consumer mentality mean dupes are generally of poorer quality? How good a bargain are dupes, really? To get some answers, Talking Point puts some products to the test. It also delves into dupe culture in a two-part special and goes to China — where many dupes originate — for an inside look at the industry. In China, if an item is popular, there will almost definitely be a cheaper alternative, from sports shoes to Bluetooth headsets. But by far the most popular dupe category is clothing, Talking Point found. Take, for example, activewear, which Qingdao M&Y Trading produces. Its best-selling items are its range of leggings, which are dupes of “big brands”, said owner Li Xue Mei. There are, of course, differences between its dupes and the originals. “We made the pockets larger. And for some big brands, the waistband is shorter, but … we (Chinese) prefer it higher to give you a more defined waist,” she said. “We also have over 30 colours for each of our styles. The colours are all very bright. We also made improvements to the fit based on the weight and size of Asians.” While the original leggings retail at nearly S$160 in Singapore, her company sells its dupes at 10 per cent of that price. “It’s all about production volume,” she said. Of the two million pieces of activewear the company sells a year, leggings account for about 1.3 million pieces. It is on e-commerce platforms such as Taobao and Alibaba. Besides selling domestically, it has sales in countries such as Australia, Russia, Singapore and Vietnam. “We don’t have any publicity costs,” Li added. Instead, the company promotes its products on social media, for example, by making use of live-streaming. Live streams are profitable not only for companies like hers but also live streamers like Lai Qing, who sells dupe clothing on his channel. He frequents a 250,000-square-feet wholesale complex in Hangzhou to check out trending dupes in shops there. Then he sources items directly from the factories producing them. “For live streams, we’ll multiply the cost price … by 1.8 to get the retail price,” he said. “You can also hit a selling price of three times the cost price.” “Each live stream, we hope to sell 1,000 to 3,000 pieces of clothing. Fans who want to buy dupes in China are in the millions, I think. But because of the increasing number of live streamers, the market’s getting saturated.” It has become big business. The wholesale complex in Hangzhou has 2,000 to 3,000 live-stream rooms, he estimated. Talking Point gained access to a couple of factories producing an array of dupes. At one household goods factory, the general manager shared how it operates in the dupe ecosystem. “The client gives me a picture. We can create a sample in two to three days,” said Shu Kai of Yifan Daily Necessities. “After the client confirms the product, our production cycle can create 200 units in seven days.” Established suppliers of raw material and teams that run like clockwork mean cost savings all round. The company supplies a hair-drying towel, for example, that costs four times less than the branded original. At one jewellery factory, the designs are “slightly similar to big-name designers”, said Dongyang Handu Accessories owner Li Mi Mi. Her dupes “sell very well”, she added, because people are familiar with the styles. But she stressed that her company does not make direct copies of products and will reject such orders. Dupes do occupy a grey area, especially when the products are almost replicas of the originals. Uniqlo, for example, is suing Shein for copying its popular shoulder bag that looks deceptively small despite its large capacity. The case is pending. As dupes are widely available, it is hard to quantify losses suffered by the original brands. But companies are adjusting their business strategy. Hair-care brand Olaplex created its own dupe, called Oladupe. It was a marketing campaign to say the original is irreplaceable. Activewear brand Lululemon, meanwhile, held an event last year for customers in the United States to swop their dupe tights for the original. Then there are businesses riding the wave of dupes. Josh Frost, for instance, started a business in 2022 that recreates well-known perfumes but makes them stronger than the originals. “Some mainstream brands … use more filler, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing,” said Frost, who owns Best Perfume Store. “If you’d like that fresher, lighter smell — at about four per cent concentration — then mainstream brands are suited for you. “If you’d like your perfume to last, maybe for eight hours out in the … sun, then ours would be better suited for you.” So that he does not get tangled up in legal issues, he is mindful of brands’ names, bottle designs, shapes and colours. “Stay away from that, don’t deceive the consumer, and then you’re okay,” he said. On whether the business of dupes is gaining acceptance, he said people are “definitely more focused on quality and affordability in our tough times”. Having sold about 52,000 bottles in total, his business is “looking to expand into three retail stores” by year end. Another who is “quite optimistic” about the prospects of the dupe market is Wang Yang. She heads a business strategy tour in China that links aspiring entrepreneurs looking for “good-quality products” with the factories manufacturing dupes and other products. There is a growing consumption trend towards “the concept of dupes”, she said. “If you look at my house today, you’ll also find … that I’ve started to use dupes.” But she does not think dupe companies will thrive “alongside” brand-name companies. The latter necessarily have “a lot of marketing elements” to create their brands, she said, whereas a dupe company “won’t really have its own brand identity or voice”. There also remains a consumer focus on quality, she added. “If the price has come down, and the quality has come down, then that means I just bought a defective product.” Can consumers tell the difference, however, between dupes and the originals? Talking Point host Munah Bagharib conducted a little experiment with make-up to find out. On one side of her face, she wore her regular products, which cost almost S$520, and on the other side the best-matching dupes, costing about S$200. WATCH: Dupes vs originals — We test make-up, hairdryers, headphones and activewear so you don’t have to (6:26) Five viewers were roped in to form a panel of judges, and three of them guessed wrongly. After leaving the make-up on for eight hours, Munah herself was “surprised” to see no difference between the two powder foundations. “I’d consider switching to the dupe. I’d also consider switching the brow pencils and the lipsticks because I can achieve the same look with the same quality at a much lower price,” she said. “But I’ll stick to the original … blusher and eye shadow, as I can see and feel the difference in quality. My original blusher lasted longer without fading. And the original eye shadow, which has finer glitter flakes, blended better.” When it comes to another category of dupes — electronics — viewers whom Talking Point spoke to were pickier about what they bought. Those who loved their dupes did choose items with some form of brand recognition and product warranty. Their recommended dupe options include headphones and a hairdryer, with cost savings that can work out to more than S$800. But would these dupes perform like the originals? One person who monitors and reviews products including dupe electronics is Delfina Utomo, an editor at lifestyle magazine 8 Days. And she helped Munah test a pair of dupe headphones she recognised as a popular purchase on Amazon and Shopee. Compared to the original, she could hear a bit of music when Munah was wearing the headphones and the volume was increased. “If I’m sitting next to you on the train, I’d know your whole listening playlist,” she quipped. To see if the dupe blocked external sound, Utomo played some background noise — which Munah could hear when there was a dip in the music she was listening to, unlike the original headphones. “The other thing I look at is Bluetooth connectivity — whether it stays connected when I walk around the house. Singapore’s houses are small, … but for some (dupes), it gets crackly,” said Utomo. In this case, both headphones were consistent, which led her to conclude that the dupe was a “decent” set. Consumers can get it for around S$60, compared with S$360 for the original. As for the hairdryer, Munah had it tested by hairstylist Zig Shee. He dried and styled her hair with the dupe first, then the original, both on the same settings: High heat to dry and style, cool air to set. The results showed a “stark difference”, and the original “won by a fair bit” even though the dupe dried her hair faster by about five minutes. “The dupe gave a lot more frizz, whereas (with) the original, the hair was shinier and significantly smoother. … When I was using the dupe, I found it harder to manage in the sense that the heat was inconsistent,” said Shee. “This did not match up to a fair bit of hairdryers that I’ve tried, as compared to the original and other bigger brands.” Munah did her own value-for-money stress test on another set of dupes: an activewear outfit (a top and tights) brought back from China, which cost S$25. Evaluating them on comfort, function and durability, she felt the tights were “just sticking to (her) skin” as she was working out and “sweating more and more”. WATCH: Part 2 — When are dupes worth your money? (23:03) On the fourth day of the week-long test, which included daily washes, she noticed that a bit of thread had come loose. By comparison, she has a S$266 branded outfit that looks as good as new after two years. On the seventh day, she concluded: “These leggings aren’t as breathable as the originals. Function-wise, they do tend to bunch up when I’m doing high-intensity workouts. Wearing them during low-intensity workouts were fine, though. “I don’t mind trying dupes to expand my wardrobe, just maybe not these.” Watch the first episode of this Talking Point special here and the second part here .

She’s a nurse, one with advanced training that requires a master’s degree in nursing. “In terms of theoretical knowledge, there’s no doubt about it — she’s on a par (with) or possibly better than some of the junior MOs (medical officers),” says her supervisor Lew Jin Wen, a senior consultant in respiratory and critical care medicine at TTSH. “She knows the protocols and procedures here. She’s been around here the longest.” Hwang is an advanced practice nurse (APN), which means she has the medical expertise to diagnose conditions and provide complex nursing care. Among other things, APNs can run clinics independently, order tests and manage patients with stable chronic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension and mental health problems. She is not only an APN, but also the first APN in a medical ICU at TTSH. But not everyone can easily appreciate the depth of her training. “Even my family didn’t really know what an APN does,” says the 36-year-old. A typical morning for Hwang begins with her checking in with her ICU patients before ward rounds. When the ward rounds are about to start, she briefs the doctors on clinical findings and presents plans for the patients’ care that day for discussion. WATCH: Life as an ICU advanced practice nurse — Advising doctors, examining patients like a boss (14:59) At the same time, she also attends to patients’ basic nursing care. Describing the role of APNs, Lew says: “They’re nurses … (who have) accreditation to perform as medical officers.” Staff nurses will report physiological findings — such as a patient’s abnormal blood pressure or pulse rate — to a doctor, but upon advancing to APNs, they can “take it a step further” and order therapies and further investigations based on their diagnosis, he adds. Yet, the public often overlook this expertise. “There are family members who still aren’t very familiar with the APN role, and sometimes they still (demand) to speak to a team doctor,” says Hwang. “We don’t refuse them, … but I do make a point of standing beside the doctor so that it’s acknowledged that the APN role is part of the ICU team.” To her, these moments are part and parcel of the job, which also requires her to be sensitive to patients and their families in a time of crisis and tough decisions. “I don’t tend to get too emotional about such comments because, honestly, I don’t blame the family members,” she says. “With time and with more interaction, the public would know more about this role and be more accepting of it.” To become an APN, she had to complete an 18-month National University of Singapore master’s programme. The decision to do so came after she spent nine years as a staff nurse, which gave her the skills and resolve to undertake the next step. “I enjoyed my interactions with patients. And I really wanted to do more for my patients in terms of being able to be the first responder when there’s any change in their condition in the ICU,” she says. Lew shares that even before Hwang became an APN, she had shown a lot of “intellectual curiosity” about the way the medical team “thinks about the patient”. “She’d (take) me aside and ask me about what (treatment) we were planning,” he recounts. As an APN, she is also a “bridge” between doctors and nurses, especially when it comes to broader efforts to improve the quality of care in hospital. “Faith’s been on both ends of the spectrum: nursing as well as medicine,” says Lew. “She knows how a medication order on our side will translate into what the nurse has to do on the other side.” Asked how they felt as parents when she first told them she wanted to be a nurse after completing her A levels, her father, Hwang Tseng Ho, replies: “It came as a surprise to us.” They tried to persuade her to consider other courses at university, such as business administration, which offered “a wider career choice upon graduation”, thought her father. “Nursing back then, to them, was only about cleaning up after patients,” she recalls. Her peers from school were also surprised at her decision. “There were friends who commented (on) why I wanted to join nursing after going through A levels,” she says. “There were misconceptions that to be a nurse, you didn’t have to have a lot of academic background. “But having gone through nursing school (and) further studies, I can assure you that educational background (and) all the training are very important foundations … to become a nurse.” Her career ambition was in part inspired by her experience with her late grandmother, who had suffered an acute stroke when Hwang was in junior college. “We went to Malaysia to visit her in hospital and (felt) very lost. But I just felt prompted to go up to her to clean her eyes,” says Hwang. “She couldn’t speak at that point in time, but I remember seeing her tear up. And I believe that at that moment, I brought her comfort. “I thought to myself, if such small actions can bring so much comfort to a loved one, how much more nursing can offer.” Over the years, Hwang has won her parents over and changed their perception of the profession, especially when she furthered her studies to develop her nursing skills. “After I graduated from university, I moved on to a specialist diploma in critical care nursing. And they’re like, ‘Oh, you mean there’s a specialisation for this?’” she recounts. “They were very happy and encouraged that there’s actually very good career progression in the nursing profession.” When she told her parents she was pursuing a master’s, they bought her a stethoscope in a show of support. “I was most proud of her when she completed her master’s in nursing and was the top student in the class of 2021,” says her father. “We bragged about her being the top student, as all parents do.” Her mother, Theresa Hwang, adds: “She was always very enthusiastic. Before she leaves the house to go to work, she’ll say, ‘I’m going to save the world!’ … That won us over.” Becoming an APN is but one of four advanced career tracks for nurses in Singapore: After gaining experience as a staff nurse, one can pursue nursing management, education, clinical nursing — as Hwang did — or nursing research. A nurse who embarks on the education track, for example, could manage and develop nurses’ careers or go into academia and become a lecturer who draws up nursing curricula. On the management track, a nurse could become a director of nursing, looking into manpower planning and policies affecting nurses. Hwang herself occasionally holds mini-lectures and group discussions for her nursing colleagues, on topics like X-ray interpretation. “Nurses are always very passionate to learn, but sometimes they don’t have the opportunity to do so,” she says. “I’d like to be the one to share my knowledge with them so that everybody on the ground can grow together.” Her colleague Lee Jun Zhang, a TTSH senior staff nurse, shares that she inspired him to pursue his advanced diploma in nursing. “Faith’s been guiding me since I was a junior nurse here in the medical ICU,” he says. “After the APN course, it deepened her medical knowledge even more, which also helps all the nurses around the ward.” “There’s very good progression in nursing,” stresses Hwang. “(It’s) not just about bedside nursing. There are a lot of specialty areas one can consider. If it’s something that you like to do, and you feel that this is a calling, I’d say go for it.” After 14 years on the job, there have been times when it has been challenging, she acknowledges. She once went the extra mile to ensure a patient’s smooth transfer out of the ICU, only to be greeted with ire by the patient’s family. “They weren’t comfortable with the environment he was in and demanded that we … push him back to the ICU,” she recalls. “Their tone was quite condescending and demanding. … Moments like this (get) you down a little.” Amid the “thankless” moments, she finds motivation by focusing on the patient’s well-being. “Do we really need patients or families to thank us? That’d be nice. But I think what really pushes us on in this journey as a nurse is seeing the actual improvement in the patient’s condition,” she says. And it is the positive moments that are more sharply etched in her memory. “Every patient encounter is very special because not only do I learn from the case (and) the conditions I see, I also think these interactions teach me a lot of life lessons,” she says. She remembers an elderly patient newly diagnosed with cancer that had very likely spread. “She didn’t want all these extraordinary measures, and she just wanted to be comfortable, to spend her last days with her husband,” recounts Hwang. “I remember (the husband) being very sweet, being very loving. … They got to spend her last days together (before) she passed on a few days later.” While the ICU is often associated with “very aggressive things, like intubations, like CPR with resuscitation”, Hwang says experience has taught her that it is “not only a place where we intensively care for the sick, it’s also a place where we want to intensively care for the dying”. “All these interactions have taught me about cherishing relationships, because things can happen at any time, and (cherishing) relationships is very important — to say the things we want to say and not hold them back,” she adds. The “people interaction” side of nursing — “because of our time by the bedside with the patients” — is something she appreciates. “There have been people (who’ve asked), why not choose medicine instead of nursing?” she shares. “Although I do look into the medical aspect, into the diagnosis and management of patients now, I still remember what I’ve learnt as a nurse and cherish the time I have with my patients to make them feel comforted.” Lew observes that her “innate ability to connect with people” is exceptional. “Taking care of any critically ill patient is actually a series of negotiations between us (the doctors), the nursing staff and the patient’s next of kin. And she does that very well,” he says. Despite her parents’ initial concerns about nursing as a career, they are now proud of her, especially when they can see how much she loves her profession. Her father adds: “I’d tell my younger me, in those days, that we should’ve been more open-minded towards such a career.” She feels it takes “great courage” to put one’s hand up for the nursing profession. “I always think compassion and this willingness to help somebody isn’t something that everyone’s born with,” she reflects. “It’s truly a calling. And if your child comes to you and says they want to be a nurse, … I’d encourage you to support them because you’re going to see how they flourish. And that’s very rewarding.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Sport Sport FRANKFURT, Germany : Germany left it late against Switzerland to secure a point which ensured they progress to the last 16 of Euro 2024 as group winners, though their well-drilled opponents demonstrated an effective means of nullifying the host nation's talented side. Switzerland sat deep from the outset to frustrate Germany's attacking players and, though Jamal Musiala showed glimpses of his ability to break the lines, the Swiss largely succeeded until substitute Niclas Fuellkrug's 92nd-minute equaliser. Kai Havertz, initially leading the attack, spurned a number of half chances and defender Antonio Rudiger should have done better with a first-half header but Germany, who had a goal disallowed at 0-0, had few clear opportunities until late on. Germany dominated possession, with 66 per cent of the ball according to Opta, completed more than double the number of passes Switzerland managed and had 18 shots on goal - though only three of those were on target. The Swiss, meanwhile, were clinical: Dan Ndoye's acrobatic volley put away either side's best chance in the first half, and he nearly doubled the lead immediately afterwards, outmuscling Rudiger but shooting just wide. Switzerland could have sealed top spot in Group A themselves late on as Ruben Vargas had the ball in the net in the 84th minute but had strayed offside before captain Granit Xhaka drew a full-length dive from Manuel Neuer to keep it at 1-0. Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann - who for the third time named the same starting 11 - is a big fan of Havertz, but the fact an old-school number 9 like Fuellkrug saved the day may prompt calls for the side to have a clear focal point up front. Ultimately, Germany have progressed to the knockout stages with an unbeaten record at the top of Group A. The irony, however, is that it means they may face a side better suited to replicating Switzerland's game plan. Second place would likely have pitted Germany against an uncharacteristically attacking Italy side under Luciano Spalletti or Croatia, who have sought to control possession in their two group matches so far. Going through as winners means they could instead face Denmark or Slovenia, both of whom will take heart from the way Switzerland were able to muzzle the likes of Musiala, Havertz and Florian Wirtz. \"Of course, we would have liked to win the game and to play great football,\" captain Ilkay Gundogan said. \"But I think you also need games like that during a tournament. \"And that can also be a real strength for the next games, hopefully.\" Nagelsmann will hope Gundogan's optimistic assessment of a challenging contest proves to be correct.

Fuellkrug struck with a trademark towering header in the second minute of stoppage time at the end of the game to make it 1-1 and spare the blushes of the hosts, who enjoyed plenty of possession but struggled to get shots on target against the Swiss defence. \"It's those moments where we really need him, and he makes the argument for both jobs, playing in the starting XI or coming off the bench, so it's both good luck and bad luck for him that he's so good in that role,\" Nagelsmann told reporters. With Kai Havertz picked to play as the lone striker, Fuellkrug came on to replace Jamal Musiala in the 76th minute, and Nagelsmann said the burly forward would now be considered for a starting spot in the last 16. \"It was a superb goal - it wasn't easy, that header, and now he has one more week to give it everything in training, and then we'll see who we play in the round of 16 and prepare for that match,\" Nagelsmann said. Germany topped the group on seven points, with the Swiss second on five and Hungary third on three points, with Scotland finishing bottom of the group with a single point. The Germans will find out their last 16 opponents on Tuesday when England meet Slovenia and Denmark play Serbia to complete Group C, with the second-placed team in that group set to meet the Germans in Dortmund June 29. \"We have two more days to prepare, maybe the opponent is not that happy about that, but one of those four only has to prepare for one team, we have to prepare for four, so it's kind of fair. May the best team win on Saturday,\" Nagelsmann said.

    "article_content": "Sport Sport STUTTGART, Germany : Scotland were denied a legitimate penalty in the second half of Sunday’s loss to Hungary that could have changed the outcome of their final Group A match at the Euros, manager Steve Clarke said. Scotland substitute attacker Stuart Armstrong was caught on the thigh by Hungary defender Willi Orban but his claims for a spotkick in the 79th minute was waved away by Argentine referee Facundo Tello. The contest, which both sides needed to win, was delicately poised at the time but Hungary went away to score with the final kick of the game in the 10th minute of stoppage time to finish third while sending Scotland home. “It was 100 per cent a penalty. Somebody, somewhere has to explain to me why that's not a penalty. It’s a one goal game, we get the penalty and it could have been a different night. “I've got other words, but I'm not going to use them,” said an obviously exasperated Clarke. \"I don't understand how VAR can look at that and say it's not a penalty. “In a European competition, it may have been better to have a European referee but we had European VAR and maybe a referee didn't see the challenge clearly on the pitch, so what's the purpose of VAR if they are not going to come in on something like that. It was a penalty.” Clarke, who has qualified Scotland for two successive Euros, called it an even contest, as both sides struggled to create any real chances and it only really opened up near the end. “We gave everything, there’s nothing you can fault there. It was a very tough game against a good opponent. A very close game that was always going to be decided by the first goal. You could tell that after half an hour. “Unfortunately for us when we opened up towards the end of the game to try and chase the winner, that we felt we needed to get to the next stage, we got caught on the counter.” Kevin Csoboth’s goal means Hungary will wait over the next days to see whether they advance as one of the four best third-placed finishers. But for Scotland, their run of failure at major tournaments continues. “I feel the same as everyone who is Scottish I would imagine – disappointed and sad. That’s it,” added the manager.

But generally we are happy. I am proud of the team, happy that we stayed unbeaten.\" Switzerland captain and player of the match Granit Xhaka referred to the hosts reaction: \"Cheers from the Germans after the 1-1 actually says it all\", he said. His team is hungry.\" This result meant Germany advanced to the last 16 as Group A winners, while Switzerland finished as runners-up. Julian Nagelsmann's men had already sealed their place in the last-16 after beating Scotland and Hungary.

The continental showpiece will be a chance to learn where players stand tactically and what the keys to beating a big team like Brazil are, the Argentine added. \"The hierarchy (of Brazil) is respected, but not feared. If you're afraid to play, you don't show up,\" the coach told a press conference on Sunday. \"The difference in hierarchy can be fought, first with order, with a lot of determination and a lot of conceptual clarity about what needs to be done, and basically by running. If there are two Brazilians, there must be three Costa Ricans,\" he added. Alfaro insisted they could win because \"football is the only sport where you don't know if you're going to win or lose before you start playing\", but they would have to play a \"perfect game\" to do so. \"It seems to me that Brazil's irregularity after the World Cup, with Tite's departure, came from the mistake of not defining a head coach. But now Brazil have defined an order of what they want, they have coach Dorival Jr, a clear head who projects and plans,\" he added. The former Boca Juniors and Ecuador coach added that, regardless of the result, they will be \"fighting on equal terms\" with all their rivals in Group D, which includes Colombia and Paraguay.

    "article_content": "Sport Sport ARLINGTON, United States: A third-minute goal from Christian Pulisic set the United States on their way to a 2-0 victory over Bolivia in their Group C opener at the Copa America on Sunday (Jun 23). Folarin Balogun added the second shortly before half-time and while the tournament hosts pushed for more goals in the second half they were unable to add to their tally. \"The message to the team is it's always important to win your first game,\" US coach Gregg Berhalter said. \"We talked about progressing our performance, improving our performance throughout the tournament, so I think it was a good starting point.\" The US were aggressive right from the start against Bolivia, who have just one win in their last 31 Copa America matches. A missed opportunity by Balogun in the first 20 seconds was soon forgotten when Pulisic scored a spectacular goal from the edge of the box, beating Bolivian keeper Guillermo Viscarra. It was Pulisic's 30th goal in 69 international matches. His first came against Bolivia in May 2016. The US doubled their lead in the 44th minute when Pulisic found Balogun and the striker ended his six-match goal drought in international matches with a low shot into the bottom corner. The hosts continued their onslaught with Ricardo Pepi, who came on as a substitute in the 65th minute, denied four times by Viscarra. \"We tried to recover but of course, after the goal in minute three, it all went down the hill,\" Bolivia coach Antonio Carlos Zago told reporters. \"We should have competed a bit more, but we need to be aware that we had the host team in front of us. They are a strong national team and I am really happy with the effort made by the players.\" The US next face CONCACAF rivals Panama on Thursday in Atlanta, while Uruguay will take on Bolivia in New Jersey.

Mandatory Credit: Maria Lysaker-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo Brazil coach Dorival Junior has identified balance and consistency as the keys to success ahead of Monday's Copa America opener against Costa Rica. Dorival, who took over in January and has only coached four games, admitted that the Brazilian squad still lacked on-field stability, which he said was natural given their short time together. \"I have to find a balance for a team that was put together only three months ago, and after a certain period of 15 or 20 days of work they have to find themselves again,\" he said at a press conference on Sunday. \"In football you don't skip preparation phases in training, but that's why we try to accelerate each one of them to have a consistent and confident squad that can then use the individuality of its players to create opportunities.\" The coach announced a starting line-up that included two new faces, Real Madrid centre back Eder Militao and Atletico Mineiro full back Guilherme Arana. \"The starting line-up will have Militao and Arana. In every game, if necessary, there will be one or two changes. All the players are ready. None of them are below our expectations. We are prepared for any situation,\" the coach added. New Real Madrid signing Endrick will not start against Costa Rica and is expected to come on in the second half, as Dorival called for \"a bit of patience\" with the 17-year-old striker. \"It's something that will happen naturally. It might not take long because he is extremely skilful. I'm in a hurry to get him on the pitch, but you have to have a certain balance. He has excellent skills and is one of the most promising players.\" Brazil will also face Colombia and Paraguay in Group D.

Pulisic struck first with a sublime curling shot into the top corner in the third minute and he set up Folarin Balogun for another score in the 44th minute.

(Photo: AFP/Lluis Gene) STUTTGART: Hungary winger Roland Sallai dedicated Sunday's (Jun 23) 1-0 win over Scotland at Euro 2024 to Barnabas Varga who was stretchered off and taken to hospital after a sickening collision which will rule him out of the rest of the tournament. Varga collapsed to the pitch in Stuttgart and was struggling to move after chasing a long cross into the area as Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn came to collect the ball late in the second half. After a long delay, medics took the 29-year-old player from the pitch while sheets were draped around the stretcher in scenes that were initially reminiscent of Christian Eriksen's collapse after suffering cardiac arrest during Denmark's Euro 2020 match against Finland. Hungary captain Dominik Szoboszlai appeared to be in tears as he consoled his stricken teammate. \"It was terrible. It was a terrible moment to see Barnabas like that,\" said Sallai. \"Fortunately he is in a much better condition. He is probably going to have to go for a minor operation. \"We cross our fingers that he can return quickly. Naturally it was a terrible incident. Of course we were fighting for him in the remaining 15-20 minutes. We wanted to win for him and we dedicate the win to him.\" Coach Marco Rossi said Varga suffered what appeared to a facial fracture. \"It was a confusing situation. What I heard from the players is that Barny at that moment looked like he was not conscious so everyone was really worried about his condition and also worried about the fact that the doctors arrived a bit late we can say,\" said Rossi. \"But of course they probably didn't realise it was a dangerous situation. Fortunately, we can say now that Barny is not under any kind of risk. \"Probably he will be operated in the coming hours because he suffered a fracture here (pointing to his cheek/eye socket). If we go through the competition of course he will not be part of the team any more.\" Varga was immediately taken to hospital after the incident. \"The condition of Barnabas Varga is stable,\" the Hungarian Football Federation (MLSZ) wrote on X. \"The Hungarian national team player is currently in one of the hospitals in Stuttgart. We will inform you immediately if there is any news on his status.\" German broadcaster Magenta TV reported that Varga was conscious and talking when he arrived at hospital in Stuttgart. Kevin Csoboth grabbed the winning goal in the 10th minute of stoppage time in the Group A game to keep alive the team's hopes of making the last 16.

    "article_content": "Sport Sport Katie Ledecky and a powerhouse American swim team will turn their attention to another Summer Games showdown with arch-rivals Australia after the U.S. Olympic trials concluded in Indianapolis on Sunday. After nine days of intense competition at Lucas Oil Stadium, normally the home of the NFL's Indianapolis Colts, the final tickets to Paris were handed out with Simone Manuel winning the 50m freestyle and Bobby Finke the men's 1,500m. Manuel, the first Black woman to win an individual Olympic swimming gold medal at the 2016 Rio Games, won the 'splash and dash' in 24.13 seconds, just .02 head of Gretchen Walsh, who also earned a spot in the event in Paris. \"I put in a lot of work to get to this point,\" said Manuel. \"I wasn't feeling too confident after last night (in the heats), I spent a lot of time watching races where I won and I really wanted to channel that Simone because I know I am a winner and that's what I did tonight.\" Finke, gold medallist in the 800m and 1,500m freestyle at the Tokyo Olympics, will defend both titles in Paris after touching first in the final event of the meeting in 14:40.28. David Johnston finished 12 seconds back of the winner but the result was good enough to earn him a spot on his first Olympic team. With the U.S. and Australian Olympic trials wrapped up the stage is now set for what is set to be an explosive competition in the Paris pool. Team USA will once again be targeting top spot in the pool after winning 11 gold medals and 30 overall. But Australian swimmers are heading to France on a mission to end the American reign after coming close in Japan with nine golds among their 21 total. \"This has been a legendary rivalry in our sport and it is shaping up again to be a really exciting one, both sides of the pool, men and women,\" U.S. swimming great Michael Phelps told NBC Sports. Competing in her fourth Olympics, Ledecky will be counted on to make a major contribution to the U.S. medal haul after winning four individual events (200, 400, 800 and 1,500 freestyle) at the trials. A seven-time Olympic champion and one of the all-time greats of the sport, Ledecky's battles with Australian Ariarne Titmus and Canada's teenage wunderkind Summer McIntosh are expected to be one of the highlights of the Paris Olympics. With Ledecky and another seven-time gold medallist Caeleb Dressel leading the way, the U.S. will not lack for experience in a squad packed with Olympic and world champions and world record holders. But the U.S. roster also includes some fresh faces, like 17-year-old Thomas Heilman, who will contest the 100m and 200m butterfly and becomes the youngest male to make the U.S. swim squad since Michael Phelps at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Dressel, winner of five golds in Tokyo, did not qualify to defend his 100m freestyle crown but will be kept busy in Paris in the 50m freestyle and 100m butterfly as well as potentially being involved in three relay teams. Regan Smith is also set for a heavy workload after winning the women's 200m butterfly and 100m and 200m backstroke. The 22-year-old added some spice to the U.S. and Australia rivalry when she regained the 100m backstroke world record from Kaylee McKeown. Walsh opened the trials by setting a world record in the women's 100m butterfly on the opening day and will travel to Paris with her older sister Alex, who earned her spot on the team after finishing second in the 200m individual medley. They will not be the only siblings on the U.S. squad - Alex Shackell qualified in the women's 200m butterfly and her brother Aaron won the 400m freestyle.

Uruguay's win saw them move level with the United States on three points. The U.S. beat Bolivia 2-0 in the day's other Group C match. Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay, who have won the Copa America a joint record 15 times, were rewarded for their blistering early pace when Araujo fired home a sublime curling effort from the edge of the area in the 16th minute. Panama grew into the match after the break and wasted several chances to get themselves back into the contest. Jose Fajardo blasted an effort wide in the 52nd minute after a defensive error by Mathias Olivera, while Jose Rodriguez tested Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet with a ferocious shot from range. Asked what he said to his team at halftime, Panama coach Thomas Christiansen told reporters: \"I told them they have to be fearless. \"That they have to increase their level of confidence. That they are capable to do what they did in the second half. And after the goal, like Uruguay, we generated opportunities.\" Uruguay were on the ropes for much of the second half but Nunez, who had already missed a string of chances, settled their nerves in the 85th minute with a coolly-taken volley into the bottom corner after a rebound dropped kindly for him. In a frenetic spell during stoppage time, Vina rose highest to head home Uruguay's third from a set-piece before Michael Amir Murillo netted a consolation goal for Panama after cutting back onto his left foot and curling his shot past Rochet. Uruguay's all-time leading scorer Luis Suarez, 37, was an unused sub. Uruguay next face Bolivia in New Jersey on Thursday, while Panama take on the United States in Atlanta.

    "article_content": "Sport Sport China has a history of swimmers caught for taking banned substances, but are their athletes being \"unfairly singled out\" as Beijing claims? A host of Chinese swimmers failed doping tests before the Tokyo Olympics, but were allowed to compete based on China's findings they had ingested it unknowingly. (File photo: AFP/Mark Ralston) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: With three months to the Paris Olympics, the sporting world has been hit with revelations that 23 Chinese swimmers consumed a banned drug ahead of the last Games in 2021 – and were allowed to compete anyway. Here’s a breakdown of what happened and why. It was reported that the athletes tested positive for a prescription heart drug, trimetazidine (TMZ) – which can enhance performance – at a domestic meet in late 2020 and in the early days of 2021. The Tokyo Olympics were held in July and August 2021. TMZ has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) list of banned substances since 2014, and is prohibited for use in and out of competitions. Quoting Dr Kelly Johnson-Arbor, a medical toxicology physician at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Reuters reported that TMZ could \"theoretically” help an athlete’s heart function better if they’re competing in a highly exertional sport, where a lot of energy is used and the heart is put under significant stress. According to Chinese investigators, trace amounts of TMZ were found in the kitchen of a hotel where the athletes were staying. WADA was notified in June 2021 that Chinese anti-doping authorities had accepted that the swimmers had tested positive for TMZ after “inadvertently being exposed to the substance through contamination”. In reviewing this, WADA consulted with independent scientific experts to test the contamination theory, as well as whether low doses of the drug could have benefited the athletes during competition. WADA ultimately concluded that it was \"not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination was the source of TMZ”. WADA and swimming's governing body World Aquatics decided not to take action due to \"a lack of any credible evidence\" to challenge China's version of events. Chinese anti-doping authorities, meanwhile, determined that the swimmers had ingested the substance unknowingly from tainted food and that no action against them was warranted. The affected athletes included nearly half of the swimming team that China sent to the Games in Japan, with several going on to win medals, including gold. Many are expected to be in contention again at the Paris Olympics in July and August this year. China's government has stepped in to decry the reports as \"false information\", with foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin emphasising Beijing's “zero-tolerance attitude toward doping\". Chinese state media Global Times also published an op-ed on the same day, questioning the “foreign media’s intention to discredit Chinese swimmers as the Olympics approaches”. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) meanwhile has demanded an investigation into WADA’s handling of the tests, claiming that the global body and its Chinese counterpart had swept the positive tests \"under the carpet\" in a \"potential cover-up\". \"The whole situation is a tragedy for clean athletes around the world,\" USADA chief Travis Tygart told Reuters. \"They should have announced the violation; they should have disqualified the athletes.\" In response, WADA has threatened legal action. It also pointed to a 2014 case on US soil as precedent and an example of group contamination related to food or environment. In 2020, three-time Olympic champion Sun Yang was found guilty of refusing to give a doping sample and banned for eight years by WADA. He had reportedly smashed vials of blood during a doping test in 2018, which he still disputes. Sun later succeeded in appealing to reduce the ban. Seven Chinese swimmers also tested positive for steroids at the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima. And in 1998, Yuan Yuan was banned after customs officers uncovered a large stash of human growth hormone in her bags at the World Championships in Perth. An article in The Guardian over the weekend drew a link between these cases and coaches from East Germany's state-sponsored doping regime, who went to China in the late 1980s to help set up high-performance training programmes. The Guardian reported that in the wake of the 90s doping cases, Chinese officials had complained of Sinophobia, racism and ignorance of Chinese swimming culture. On Sunday (Apr 28), Chinese state media Xinhua ran an article citing a commentary by two Australian scholars, concluding that its main point was that “Western observers tend to single out China in an unfair way”. The commentary, first published on The Conversation, argued that \"when it comes to China, many observers are quick to name and shame athletes, viewing every news story as some kind of proof the country must have a systemic, state-sanctioned doping programme\". And the latest case comes amid an intense power struggle between a rising China and US whose dominance is being challenged, wrote the two sport academics from the University of Canberra. But Dr Lim Tai Wei, an adjunct senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s East Asian Institute, said that beyond possible podium protests and further questions about testing procedures, this doping scandal was “unlikely to become a major strategic flashpoint” between China and the West. There are many other more significant issues demanding attention, he said, pointing to disputes in maritime and tech to name a few. Yet, such tensions often \"strongly\" correlate with athletic rivalries, said Assistant Professor Benjamin Ho from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. \"Sport and politics often mirror one another in ways ... there may be reputational costs for the Chinese.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Experts explain what to consider for home loans, and why interest rates for savings accounts fell ahead of the Fed cutting rates. People outside UOB and DBS branches at Toa Payoh Hub on Jan 11, 2023. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Interest rates in the United States could stay unchanged because inflation has not improved enough. US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said it would likely take longer than previously expected to gain the “greater confidence” needed to start cutting rates. Singapore’s interest rates are determined by global rates and foreign exchange market expectations. That means broadly following the direction of other central banks, especially the US Fed. Not necessarily, according to experts. UOB and Standard Chartered Bank have already lowered the interest rates on their flagship savings accounts. Banks make interest payments to those who deposit funds with them, and earn interest income from those who borrow money from them. Some banks have more money than their customers want to borrow, which means they are not earning much interest income. “They have challenges lending all this money out, because property transactions have slowed down,” said Mr Alfred Chia, chief executive officer of the SingCapital financial advisory. “At the same time they have to fork out high interest payments.\" So banks that lower interest rates may be trying to reduce costs. And as rates in the US stay high for longer, banks could continue to face the issue of having more funds than they can loan out, said Mr Chia. But specifically for UOB , the decision to cut rates may not be due to the Fed or market expectations, said Mr Glenn Thum, senior research analyst at Phillip Securities Research. It may instead be that the bank increased rates “too aggressively at the start”, he said. These have already fallen and are not likely to rise despite the Fed standing still. “We won’t see the promotional interest rates that we saw previously last year. That’s when everyone was rushing to a bank ,” said Mr Thum. “I don’t think we’ll see that because of the uncertainty.” Banks would rather not risk raising rates since they are unsure of when the Fed will move. When yields on Treasury bills – debt securities issued and backed by the Singapore government – rose in 2022, banks had to respond and increase their fixed deposit rates, said Mr Chia of SingCapital. But these have since declined and reached a mostly stable point. They are unlikely to be too affected by the latest news from the Fed, he added. Local banks are offering rates of between 2.7 per cent and 2.9 per cent for six-month fixed deposits, though OCBC requires a larger deposit amount than DBS and UOB, according to their websites. Mortgages pegged to the Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) will be more impacted by the Fed, said Mr Chia. In Singapore, a floating home loan rate is usually pegged to SORA. The interest rates vary throughout the life of the loan, depending on the economy and market conditions. “Home mortgage rates have actually started to stabilise, some have actually (seen) some form of drop,” said Mr Chia, adding that fixed-rate packages could be around 1 percentage point lower. According to the PropertyGuru portal, DBS offers a two-year fixed package at 2.9 per cent. The three-month compounded SORA on May 2 was 3.6491 per cent. Mr Song Seng Wun, economic advisor at CGS-CIMB Securities, said that on the whole, he expects interest rates in Singapore to continue hovering around current levels. But potential borrowers should also keep shopping around. “Rates have peaked,\" he said. \"But some places are willing to lend to you at a lower rate than others.” Opinions are divided. Mr Chia and Mr Thum see up to three rate cuts closer to the end of the year, depending on how stubborn inflation is and other economic indicators such as the labour market. But other observers believe the Fed is unlikely to cut rates this year, despite expectations. Mr Kurt Mayell, head of trading platform CMC Markets Singapore, pointed to strong productivity, wages and employment numbers – which impact the Fed’s decisions on rate adjustments. Robust economic data could in fact revive rate hike fears, though Mr Powell said on Thursday this was unlikely. Macroeconomic consultant Komal Sri-Kumar said the US presidential election in November could affect the Fed’s decisions. “(Powell’s) statement that he does not expect a rate increase is also in some sense politically motivated, because he could not say that rates could go up and then crash the markets during the months before the elections,” said Mr Komal. Mr Lee Kian Soon, CEO of fund management firm Astral Asset Management, said one consequence of little to no rate cuts this year would be a huge interest rate differential. \"In the short term, governments could take some measures or actions to try to calm the markets,” he said. “But, over the longer run, this is difficult unless they raise interest rates to narrow the gaps. \"It's very difficult for most Asian central banks as they depend on the actions triggered by the Fed to decide what is best for their economies and currencies.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

China has been pushing for a “multipolar world” and sees Europe being a separate and independent actor from the United States, which “would give the PRC (People’s Republic of China) a little bit more manoeuvring space”, said political scientist Chong Ja Ian. “They see a world where there are multiple major actors, as one where the sort of mutual competition and adjustment gives the PRC strategic space to move around.” Dr Chong, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore, told CNA’s East Asia Tonight on Monday that China “is also trying to seek more investment from around the world, (and) the Europeans are one of the sort of sources that the PRC is looking to.” “(French President Emmanuel) Macron has talked about how Europe needs to be sort of more independently-minded from the United States, and so (France) seems like a useful place for Xi to start,” said Dr Chong, who is also a non-resident scholar at Carnegie China. “If you look at the other places on his itinerary, Hungary and Serbia, these are also places in Europe that seem to be pushing for closer ties with places like Russia, (and) that may be a bit different from the United States in the positioning.” Dr Cedomir Nestorovic, professor of international marketing and geopolitics at ESSEC Business School (Asia Pacific), said the three countries chosen for the tour do not come as a surprise. Mr Xi's visit to France coincides with the 60th anniversary of Sino-French diplomatic relations and indicates the relative warmth between both sides. The choice of France as the only significant European power to visit shows Mr Macron’s stature as a powerbroker within the European Union, said analysts. It follows the French president’s trip to China in April last year, where he said the EU should not be dragged into a conflict between China and the US over Taiwan. Dr Nestorovic told CNA’s Asia First on Monday: “France is among the big countries in the West most open to hearing what China has to say.” The other countries selected, Serbia and Hungary, are seen as China-friendly and are used as a foothold for its expanding economic ambitions in Europe. These two small countries are quite receptive to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and have courted economic ties with the world's second-largest economy, inviting major investments in various areas from infrastructure to technology. These include developing vast battery and electric vehicle manufacturing plants in Hungary, and copper and gold operations in Serbia. On Monday, Mr Xi held talks with Mr Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The Russia-Ukraine war was among the key issues on the agenda. During the trilateral talks, Mr Macron and Dr von der Leyen pressed Mr Xi to use China's influence to end the Russian aggression against Ukraine. But with Mr Putin planning to visit China later this month, it is unlikely that there will be much changes on that front, said observers. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a “no limits” partnership agreement with Mr Xi in February 2022, less than three weeks before sending his troops into Ukraine. The meeting on Monday also covered trade disputes and global challenges, including the Israel-Hamas war. Both Mr Macron and Dr von der Leyen urged Mr Xi to accept fair global trade rules . The discussions come amid a slew of probes launched by the EU in recent months into alleged unfair trade practices by China, which had earlier slammed these moves as “protectionism”. France has shown “some possibilities of cooperation with China that we didn't have coming from the other countries”, which are taking a cautious approach towards it, said Dr Nestorovic. Dr Chong said the relationship between China and the EU is multifaceted. While some nations believe that unfair competition is driving European firms out of the market, others view China as a target for investment, he added. “So it's quite a mixed picture, and the two sides will have to navigate that relationship.” Meanwhile, Mr Xi’s upcoming visits to Serbia and Hungary are seen as efforts to establish inroads in Europe. A major project aims to refresh a railway line between the countries’ capitals of Belgrade and Budapest, mainly financed by China as part of its BRI plan. It will transport Chinese goods from the Chinese-controlled port of Piraeus in Greece onto Europe. Serbia and Hungary are among the most sympathetic to Russia on the continent. “The PRC support for Russia and Russia's war efforts has been a sticking point for its relationships with Europe,” said Dr Chong. “So I suppose going to Serbia, which is more friendly towards the PRC and outside the EU, and a sort of more Russia-receptive place like Hungary allows Xi to push the case that its relationship with Russia may not be such a bad thing, perhaps the rest of Europe shouldn't frown upon it so much. “But for states that are also near Ukraine, they are worried that the continued war, Russia's continued aggression could potentially spill over into their borders.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "East Asia East Asia China has dropped any reference of the contentious \"Made in China 2025\" slogan from official documents, but the policy to become a global tech powerhouse is still alive and kicking, said observers. This audio is generated by an AI tool. China rolled out the ambitious “Made in China 2025” master plan with considerable fanfare in 2015, positioning itself to become a more technology-intensive powerhouse. However, the result of that push has raised concerns in the West. The aim of the 10-year blueprint is to shift gears from churning out low-end products to becoming a global heavyweight in high-tech industries. The world's second-largest economy hopes to bridge the technology gap with the West, by promoting Chinese manufacturers in the global market and reducing its dependency on imported tech. The state-led policy targets 10 key high-tech sectors, such as electric cars, telecommunications, robotics, and artificial intelligence systems. Under this, government subsidies, including low interest loans and tax breaks, are directed at favoured high-tech companies such as electric vehicle manufacturers and chipmakers. China is investing heavily into its endeavours, said Professor Tomoo Marukawa of the University of Tokyo’s Institute of Social Science. “The government investments have been quite successful in fact. They're getting returns,” he added. China has even set some bold targets. By 2025, the country plans to achieve 70 per cent self-sufficiency in high-tech industries. By 2049, the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, it is gunning to be a global manufacturing powerhouse. “It is stipulated that by the year 2049, China will be the frontrunner in the global manufacturing industries,” Prof Marukawa, who monitors developments in the Chinese economy, told CNA’s East Asia Tonight on Thursday (May 9). “So does that mean that China is going to take over the US or will it be on a par with the US? That question has never been answered, but I think at least the Chinese authorities think that they will be on par with the US.” As China's economy starts to slow down, its focus on these sectors may propel growth. But critics are raising eyebrows because the master plan leans heavily on state support, and creates an uneven playing field for foreign businesses. Governments around the world have expressed their fears, as the policy undermines adherence to international trade practices and poses a security risk . The initiative has provoked intense anxieties from the United States, for instance. Washington sees China as a tech powerhouse nipping at its heels, sparking a trade war over what it sees as unfair economic policies with a new battleground found in the AI sector. As a result, China has faced more hurdles from Western countries in the tech sector, from tighter controls on imports to hefty tariffs and less investment. Facing heightened international scrutiny, China started to dial things back. In 2019, Beijing began dropping all mentions of the industrial strategy from its official documents. However, observers said the policy is still alive and kicking, adding that China will not abandon its pursuit of developing advanced technology. Despite downplaying the “Made in China 2025” slogan, it continues to pump in subsidies to keep the wheels turning for automakers, chip producers, and other high-tech players. Dr Wang Huiyao, founder and president of Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization, said this kind of “planning exercise” is “very useful” given that China contributes more than one-third of the global gross domestic product (GDP) growth. “China always has some kind of planning,” he added. Observers said while the hype may have quietened down a bit, the tech race between China and the West is far from over. It is unclear how much progress China has made because “the goal in this policy is quite vague”, said Prof Marukawa, noting that China has a weak semiconductor industry. “China is lagging behind the frontrunners in the semiconductor industry. But in other sectors such as, for example, electric vehicles (and) new energy, China has made great progress. “Also, what is quite often neglected is that the focus of this Made in China policy is on the basic components or basic materials, so the actual target is to strengthen the basic capability of the industries,” Prof Marukawa added.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore What are the KP.1 and KP.2 strains? Are they more infectious and are current vaccines effective against newer variants of COVID-19? File photo of a COVID-19 test kit. (Photo: iStock) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Another COVID-19 wave has hit Singapore, with the KP.1 and KP.2 variants accounting for more than two-thirds of cases here. The two strains belong to a new family of subvariants called “FLiRT”, which is also spreading elsewhere in the world. Here's what we know about the new variants. KP.1 and KP.2 belong to a group of COVID-19 variants scientists have nicknamed “FLiRT”, after the technical names of their mutations. The strains in FLiRT are all descendants of the JN.1 variant , an offshoot of the Omicron variant. The JN.1 variant spread rapidly around the world several months back and was responsible for Singapore's COVID-19 wave last December. The KP.2 strain, in particular, appears to be spreading faster than KP.1. In May, KP.2 was classified by the World Health Organization as a Variant Under Monitoring. This signals to public health authorities that a COVID-19 variant may require prioritised attention and monitoring. KP.2 was first detected in India in early January. It has since become the dominant strain in the United States, accounting for about 28 per cent of infections in the country in mid-May. This is up from just 6 per cent in mid-April and 1 per cent in mid-March, according to data by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). KP.2 has also spread to other countries, including China , Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The US CDC said on May 16 that while KP.2 is the main variant, it isn’t causing more severe illness than other variants. Singapore's Health Ministry similarly said on May 18 that there are currently no indications that KP.1 and KP.2 are more transmissible or cause more severe disease than other circulating variants. But slight differences in KP.2’s spike protein might make it better at evading our immune defences and slightly more infectious than JN.1, according to Dr David Ho, a virologist at Columbia University who was quoted by the New York Times. It could even infect people who received the most updated vaccine, Dr Ho added, since that shot targets XBB.1.5, a variant that is different from JN.1. \"They certainly can evade the immunity conferred by the earlier vaccinations ... or earlier infections before JN.1,\" said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases expert at Rophi Clinic in Singapore. He was referring to earlier versions of COVID-19 vaccines such as the bivalent ones. The symptoms for KP.1 and KP.2 are the same as earlier variants, Dr Leong said, adding that there is no indication the variants lead to more severe illness. In fact, said Professor Paul Tambyah who cited the Infectious Diseases Society of America, disease caused by KP.2 and KP.1 is less severe than their ancestor JN.1. However, KP.2 and KP.1 may be more transmissible, said Prof Tambyah, who is the president of the International Society for Infectious Diseases. Their behaviour follows that of all viruses, which eventually evolve to become more transmissible and less virulent. \"Even the deadly 1918 influenza pandemic virus, which killed one in 50 people worldwide, simply evolved to become the dominant strain of seasonal influenza from 1920 to 1957,\" noted Prof Tambyah. Like JN.1 and previous Omicron variants, it may take five or more days before a person starts to develop symptoms after exposure, although symptoms may appear sooner, said Professor Andy Pekosz from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “When it comes to symptoms, we’re not seeing anything new or different with these variants,” he added. “We continue to see more mild disease, but that’s likely not because the virus is milder, but because our immunity is so much stronger now.” Symptoms include fever, sore throat, runny nose and fatigue. Fewer people lose their sense of taste and smell now than they did at the start of the pandemic, but some may still experience those symptoms. Infected people could also experience gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, which are sometimes confused with norovirus symptoms. Globally there has not been a large number of hospitalisations. The mortality rate has also remained low. Dr Leong said that there will be a “minor uptick” in cases in Singapore over the next few weeks due to the KP.1 and KP.2 variants. He added, however, that this increase will be “relatively minor compared to JN.1\", as prior infection from JN.1 will confer “significant protective benefit” to KP.1 and KP.2. Immunity from previous and ongoing vaccinations, previous infection and personal hygiene measures might reduce the height of this surge, said Dr Shawn Vasoo, clinical director of Singapore's National Centre for Infectious Diseases. \"We’ve been through multiple waves of COVID-19. Right now, there is no increased concern about these new strains compared to previous Omicron variants,\" he added. The danger is that repeat infections could raise the risk of developing long-COVID, said Dr Fikadu Tafesse, a virologist at Oregon Health & Science University. And there is no cure for long-COVID, Dr Leong noted. \"It is a black hole of unknowns,\" he said, adding that people should get vaccinated to avoid the risk of long-term illness. According to Dr Tambyah, MOH data suggests that COVID-19 numbers are already plateauing. \"Things might change with the school holiday travel but I doubt it would change much,\" he said. Against JN.1, the current vaccines designed around Omicron XBB.1.5 do generate some cross-reactive antibodies, said Professor Pekosz. Studies have not been done with some of the newer variants, he noted, adding that those are likely to be \"a little less cross-reactive\". Dr Leong provided a similar view. “We know that the XBB1.5 vaccine was about 50 per cent effective against the JN.1. We suspect that the current vaccine will be less effective in preventing infections with KP.1 and KP.2,” he told CNA. \"The chief reason is the presence of the FLiRT mutations. The F amino acid became L and the R became a T. This allowed the virus to evade the existing immunity against COVID.\" It has also been several months since many people received their last dose of the vaccine, and that immunity wanes over time. Scientists say vaccination remains the best bet, especially against severe illness. “We firmly believe that it (the vaccine) is still effective against preventing severe disease such as hospitalisation and death,” Dr Leong said. Singapore's Health Ministry said that during the peak month of the previous JN.1 wave in December 2023, the incidence rate of COVID-19 hospitalisations and intensive care admissions among seniors aged 60 and above was 25 per cent higher in those who had not kept their vaccination updated compared to those who had. The US CDC said the agency was continuing to monitor how vaccines perform against KP.2. Governing bodies like the WHO and the US Food and Drug Administration are also expected to recommend a formulation for updated COVID-19 vaccines that will roll out in early fall. New COVID-19 variants are likely to crop up after a decision is made, but Professor Pekosz said the goal remains to select a formulation that will match the circulating variants as closely as possible. Dr Leong and Dr Vasoo said COVID-19 test kits are able to detect the KP.1 and KP.2 variants. \"The COVID-19 test kit tests against the N protein. But the mutation of KP variants is mainly due to the spike protein,\" Dr Leong explained. \"In fact, the N protein has been consistently stable with only minor mutations since the beginning.\" Dr Vasoo noted that some lateral flow tests have been reported to have possibly diminished performance with the Omicron variants. \"However, they can still detect the KP.1 and KP.2 variants,\" he said. Testing gives a definite diagnosis, which can better guide a treatment plan as many COVID-19 symptoms overlap with that of other respiratory viruses such as influenza. \"This is more pertinent for the medically vulnerable or elderly, who require closer monitoring of their symptoms to prevent worsening of their condition or specific medical treatment,\" Dr Vasoo advised.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore The SQ321 incident highlights the potential dangers of turbulence, especially as scientists warn its occurrence could worsen with climate change. This audio is generated by an AI tool. Extreme turbulence hit Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight SQ321 from London to Singapore on Tuesday (May 21), and forced the aircraft to make an emergency landing at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport. A 73-year-old British man died of a suspected heart attack and at least 30 people were injured, some critically. The incident highlighted the potential dangers of turbulence, especially as scientists warn its occurrence could worsen with climate change. But what causes turbulence, can it be avoided, and how can you keep yourself safe? Turbulence occurs when an aircraft is caught up in a sudden shift in airflow caused by changes in wind speed and direction. They can be created by atmospheric pressure, thunderstorms, mountain ranges, or strong air currents called jet streams. Planes can shake or jolt when encountering turbulence, much like boats in choppy waters. Flight tracking data showed SQ321 experienced a 6,000-foot (1.8km) drop within four minutes. While turbulence can cause planes to lose altitude quickly, experts said the sudden dive for an aircraft the size of the Boeing 777-300ER was highly abnormal. Instead, it would more likely have been the pilots’ reaction, said analysts. “That amount of descent (relative to) time may not be subjected to a downdraft, it could be more indicative of the pilots reacting to the situation,” Mr Michael Daniel, managing director of consultancy firm Aviation Insight, told CNA's Singapore Tonight. Turbulence can be detected on a plane’s weather radar if they contain water particles. “Normally, for turbulence caused by movement of clouds, pilots will be alerted so they can avoid it or notify the crew and passengers to wear their seatbelts,” Mr Shantanu Gangakhedkar, senior aviation consultant at market research firm Frost and Sullivan, told CNA938. Pilots also receive pre-flight weather briefing that includes information about potential turbulence, allowing them to make adjustments to the route, altitude or speed to minimise the impact. However, the least predictable type of disturbance is clear-air turbulence, which can appear without any visible signs. These invisible pockets of air can occur at high altitudes above 30,000 ft in clear skies. Clear-air turbulence is often behind injuries as it can happen without warning, and flight crew may not have time to instruct passengers to fasten their seatbelts. Currently, there is no technology to detect the phenomenon. NASA says it is developing an early-warning system, but experts caution it could take years. Multiple analysts CNA spoke to believe SQ321 was hit by clear-air turbulence due to the sudden nature of the incident. “Looking at the number of injuries, SQ321 (likely) encountered extreme clear-air turbulence, where a plane can be tossed about violently (and without notice),” said independent aviation analyst Alvin Lie. “Clear-air turbulence can hit anytime, anywhere, without prior knowledge. I believe there were many other planes flying in that area at the same time (but they were not affected). It was just hard luck (for SQ321).” The SIA plane was hit by “sudden extreme turbulence”, an intensity experts say planes rarely encounter. Turbulence intensity is classified by light, moderate, severe and extreme, according to the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Weather Service. During light turbulence – which happens fairly frequently – passengers may experience slight bumpiness. During extreme turbulence – which very rarely occurs – an aircraft may be tossed about violently and be momentarily impossible to control. It may also cause structural damage. Experts say commercial aircraft are designed to fly through difficult weather conditions. Turbulence-related fatalities or serious injuries also remain extremely rare. Some regions are more prone to turbulence, particularly areas with more weather activities. “Southeast Asia is a region known to have more storm activities, and hence likely to experience more turbulence,” said Mr Leithen Francis, managing director of Francis & Low, a marketing agency that specialises in aviation. The SIA flight was over the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar when it encountered the sudden and extreme turbulence. Scientists have warned that severe turbulence has jumped by 55 per cent in the past 40 years, and is expected to increase further due to the impact of climate change. Most turbulence-related injuries happen because passengers and crew members are not buckled down. Sudden and severe movements of a plane during turbulence may cause people to be thrown around the cabin. In the case of SQ321, witnesses said those not wearing a seatbelt were launched into the ceiling, hitting baggage cabins overhead. Even when buckled in, passengers may be hit by flying items or falling luggage if overhead compartments are flung open. Experts highlight crew members are most exposed to injury, as they are not strapped in most of the time, including having to check passengers’ seatbelts when the signs light up. Be diligent, say experts. Buckle up when seated, even at cruising altitude when the “fasten seatbelt” sign is not on. Attendants also advise passengers to pay attention to the safety briefing before take-off, and listen to crew and pilot announcements during a flight. “We can’t anticipate sudden turbulence, which might cause severe injuries when people are not buckled in. So, when you are in the seat, be diligent and buckle up, whether the fasten seatbelt sign is on or not,” said Mr Daniel.

File photo of SIA cabin crew (left) and the interior of Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 after an emergency landing at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi International Airport on May 21, 2024. (Photos: AFP, Reuters) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The issue of safety during in-flight turbulence has taken centrestage, after one passenger died and scores injured when Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight SQ321 encountered severe turbulence en route to Singapore from London's Heathrow Airport on Tuesday (May 21). Experts shared with CNA on Thursday a range of measures that both passengers and cabin crew can take in such situations. In a nutshell, yes. But there’s more: Experts told CNA that passengers should keep their seat belts fastened at all times while seated. Even when seat belts are fastened loosely, they are “very effective” in avoiding serious injuries during strong turbulence on flights, said Professor Rico Merkert, an aviation expert at the University of Sydney. “It pays off listening to the safety instructions and seat belts should always be fastened when seated.” Most people on long-haul flights often forget to fasten their seat belts when trying to sleep, including those in flat beds in business class, he added. During meal times, passengers should keep their seat belts fastened to lower the risk of encountering “unannounced turbulence”, said aviation safety consultant Michael Daniel. Buckle up when seated, even when the “fasten seat belt” sign is not on, he added. Children under the age of three should be held by their parents and have their infant seat belts fastened. “Infants are belted to the adult because they are not big or strong enough to be placed and belted on a separate seat,” said former airline executive Chow Kok Wah. The infant seat belt prevents the infant from separating from their parent. During turbulence, parents are advised to hold on to their infants. If the child is in a bassinet, they should be removed and placed on the adult’s lap with an infant seat belt on, said Mr Chow, who has more than 30 years of experience in aerospace. Clear air turbulence, which experts have posited was what struck flight SQ321, is actually quite frequent, a former SIA flight attendant, who declined to be named, told CNA. It is one reason why passengers are advised to keep their seat belts fastened even though the sign may be off. But this advice sometimes goes unheeded. “They see us walking around still, so they think it’s all fine,” the 32-year-old said. “We also explain to parents especially that when they put their babies in the bassinets, the baby inside needs to lie down with the zipper fastened; if not, it could just fly up and hit the ceiling (during turbulence).” As for that much-coveted row of empty seats next to you? Lying down across them is not advisable either because you can't be securely belted up in that angle, said the former flight attendant. If the plane encounters turbulence while passengers are moving about in the cabin or on their way to the toilet, Mr Daniel advises them to maintain a low profile, most likely by crouching. “First thing is to try to crouch low and hold on to an armrest or cabin or headrest, anything that you can hold on to,” he said, adding that passengers should avoid grabbing onto a service cart. Prof Merkert advises passengers not to go to the toilet when turbulence is likely, such as when the plane is over oceans. “If passengers are heading to the toilet and turbulence commences, they should return to their seats immediately,” he said. Mr Chow said the safety risk here is if passengers are queuing at the toilet. If possible, passengers should control their liquid intake to minimise visits to the restroom on the plane. Cabin crew should even go as far as to proactively guide passengers who are queueing for the toilets to return to their seats, said Mr Abbas Ismail, course chair for the Diploma in Aviation Management (AMS) at Temasek Polytechnic. He added that cabin crew who are on the move should also find a seat as quickly as possible when turbulence escalates. “If the crew are not able to get to the nearest crew seat in time, find the nearest available passenger seat and fasten the seat belt,” he said. According to experts, where passengers are seated can affect how they feel turbulence. Experts told CNA that the effects are less apparent in the middle of an aircraft, near the wings. Mr Daniel, who sits on the panel of experts for the Association of Aerospace Industries (Singapore), explained that these seats are “near the plane’s centre of gravity and not as prone to as much airplane pitching or pivoting”. “The middle of an aircraft, near the wings, can be marginally less turbulent,” said Mr Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of aviation news website FlightGlobal. “But seat selection shouldn't have too much of an impact,” he added. While Prof Merkert agrees that turbulence is felt less in the middle of the aircraft - essentially over the wings - what is more important than where one sits is whether the seat belt is fastened. “Statistically, the safest seats in case of a crash are the ones in the back of an aircraft,” he added. In cases of extreme turbulence, it is best to avoid seats near the galleys, as service carts and items are mainly stored there, Mr Daniel said. There are protocols to follow for when the plane hits turbulence, said the former SIA flight stewardess. “We have to secure ourselves, lay low, and grab onto the nearest seat. If the oxygen masks drop down, we have to grab one also and wear it first, before we can tend to the passengers,” she added. The woman, who spent eight years as a cabin crew member, shared that there are also “stronghold points” around the cabin for them to hold onto. “These are small little handles you see around the cabin, in the toilets and in the galleys. The passengers can use it too, but a lot of people are not aware of them. They think it’s just a hole in the wall, because sometimes it looks just like a cut-out,” she said. “When we see passengers walking around in the cabin during the flight, we also take the opportunity to introduce them to the stronghold points, so that they learn,” she added. The staff also receive information beforehand through onboard equipment, which can detect things like when the turbulence will hit, how strong it will be and how long it will last. “So the pilot will inform the crew, and when the time comes, will make an announcement across the PA (public address) system telling passengers to sit down,” she said. During turbulence, cabin service is paused depending on how severe the situation is. “If it’s the little bumps type but still alright overall, we just don’t serve hot things like hot drinks or soup. But if it’s really bad, like moderate or above, then the captain will say suspend service,” she shared. In those situations, the crew will have just five to 10 minutes to stow away all items in the galley, where everything is typically opened and laid out during service. On Thursday, SIA announced that it would now suspend meal service - in addition to the existing policy of not serving hot drinks - when the seat belt sign is on, as part of a \"more cautious approach\" to managing turbulence in flight. Even during tense moments, cabin crew still need to maintain a high quality of service, noted the former stewardess, who quit two years back. “Some of us may be very scared, but still need to pretend everything is okay, and to reassure passengers and let them know it’s fine.” Safety training is a component of the three-and-a-half-month programme to become a member of the SIA cabin crew, where trainees learn things like first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). “We also learn what to do when we meet with emergency situations that are unique to aircraft cabins, such as when a plane has to land in the water or when we have to deploy the emergency slide,” she shared. Cabin crew must attend a refresher annually on safety training, where they will be tested on their response to various scenarios – including turbulence. “Based on reports from passenger accounts, the SQ crew remained professional and dedicated in helping passengers despite being injured themselves. This is reflective of the good training they have received to deal with emergency situations,” said Mr Abbas.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (right) last year said he was willing to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"without any conditions\". (Photo: AFP/STR, Yuichi YAMAZAKI) This audio is generated by an AI tool. TOKYO/SEOUL: Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is seeking a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. If he succeeds, he will be the first Japanese premier in 20 years to hold talks with a counterpart in Pyongyang. Before splitting into North and South, Korea was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945. South Korea and Japan normalised relations in 1965, but diplomatic ties have never been formally reached between Pyongyang and Tokyo. Relations between the two countries have been defined mostly by distrust and tension. From time to time, North Korea has demanded Japan apologise and compensate for atrocities committed during its colonisation. North Korea is said to have abducted Japanese nationals in the 1960s, to train its spies in Japanese language and customs. After years of denial, Pyongyang admitted to the kidnappings during the first leaders’ summit with Japan in 2002, when then-Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi met with Kim Jong Il – his counterpart at the time and father of the current leader. North Korea subsequently returned five out of 17 abductees officially identified by Japan, though both sides differ on the exact number kidnapped. Japan believes North Korea has yet to provide an acceptable explanation for the fates of the other abductees. Pyongyang has claimed that the rest are dead and that the matter is settled. Japan however has said that the remains sent back did not belong to those identified, based on DNA testing. Many elderly family members of the abductees have since died, but the issue remains emotive in Japan. And so holding a summit and resolving this would bring broad public support for Mr Kishida. Japan feels threatened by North Korea’s weapons development . In recent years, Pyongyang has been testing the likes of nuclear-capable missiles designed to strike key facilities in Japan, South Korea and the United States. This has prompted Tokyo to make the case for significantly increasing defence spending . In an annual white paper, Japan’s defence ministry described North Korea’s military activities as posing a graver and more imminent threat to national security than ever before. In 2023, Mr Kishida said he was willing to meet face-to-face with Mr Kim without any preconditions, and to resolve all issues between them. Mr Kishida hopes such a summit will help improve his approval ratings, which have been dented by issues such as a slush fund scandal involving his ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The LDP is set to hold a presidential election by September, and its incumbent leader Kishida will need its backing if he hopes to remain Japan’s prime minister. There was optimism that Pyongyang would agree to a meeting, when Mr Kim sent Mr Kishida condolences in the aftermath of a deadly New Year’s Day earthquake in Noto Peninsula. But not much progress has been made since. Mr Kim’s powerful sister Kim Yo Jong has issued statements on being open to improving relations, and even inviting Mr Kishida to Pyongyang – but only if Tokyo “drops its bad habit of unreasonably pulling up (North Korea) over its legitimate right to self-defence and does not lay such a stumbling block as the already-settled abduction issue”. She said if Japan continues to bring up these issues, it would prove that Mr Kishida’s push for talks is just an attempt to improve his popularity at home. South Korean researcher Han Ki-bum, a fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said the fact that the North is showing some interest appears to be in line with its recent foreign policy moves. Following North Korea’s summit with Russi a last year, Mr Kim has attempted to expand diplomatic efforts, and a dialogue with Japan could be part of this. By extension, it might signal a willingness to engage with the US if conditions allow, said Mr Han, who dealt with North Korea for decades in his previous job as an intelligence officer. Other analysts said North Korea could also be trying to shake up an alliance between Japan, South Korea and the US, which has presented a united front against Pyongyang. During the first historic summit in 2002, Pyongyang apologised for the abductions of Japanese citizens; while Tokyo agreed to discuss compensation for causing the suffering of North Koreans during its colonial rule. This became known as the Pyongyang Declaration, which was signed by both leaders in a bid to normalise ties. But further talks stalled as Japan insisted on deeper investigation into the abduction issue. In 2004, both sides met again for the last time. For the summit to happen, North Korea would first have to agree to discuss the issue of the abducted Japanese nationals. Japan will then have to reciprocate: For instance, if the two countries establish diplomatic relations, Tokyo will need to provide economic assistance to Pyongyang. But that would be difficult in light of strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea due to, again, the rapid build-up of its nuclear and missile programme. Overall, the ongoing disputes and deep-seated differences make a summit an unlikely prospect, and even if it does materialise, analysts are sceptical about whether it’ll bring favourable results. Mr Han from the Asan Institute said Pyongyang has bigger priorities. These include another meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a possible trip to Beijing and a sit-down with former US president Donald Trump , should the presumptive Republican Party nominee return to the White House.

    "article_content": "Asia Asia From Oct 1, all foreign-registered vehicles entering the country by land from Singapore are required to be fitted with radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Here are the steps to install one. File photo of a Vehicle Entry Permit signboard at the Johor checkpoint leading to the Causeway. (Photo: Aqil Haziq Mahmud) This audio is generated by an AI tool. JOHOR BAHRU: Malaysia will require all foreign-registered vehicles entering the country by land from Singapore to use vehicle entry permits (VEPs) from Oct 1. Malaysian transport minister Anthony Loke made the announcement on Tuesday (May 28), when he explained that any foreign motor vehicle without a VEP entering or travelling in Malaysia from that date may be fined up to RM2,000 (US$425) or jailed for up to six months. Here's what you need to know about the VEP and steps to get one fitted. Owners of all categories of foreign vehicles – including private and commercial ones – are required to register for a VEP before entering Malaysia. This includes Singapore-registered motorcycles. Embassy and government vehicles are also required to register. The owner of the vehicle, or a representative appointed by the owner, must register online via the Road Traffic Department’s official website at https://vep.jpj.gov.my . After putting in your details, including a login identity and password, you will receive confirmation via email and be directed to the VEP portal at https://vepams.jpj.gov.my to complete the registration process. Make sure you have downloaded and registered your Touch N’ Go eWallet account before proceeding to the VEP portal. The eWallet can be downloaded from your mobile phone’s application store. After logging in to the portal, you will need to submit documents including your motor insurance, a copy of NRIC as well as certificate of entitlement. Once the application is approved, you will receive an email notification to choose your method of collecting the VEP RFID tag – either couriered by post to your address, or self-collection at a VEP collection centre in Johor Bahru. After making your pick, you will need to make payment online. This can be done by credit card. The tag costs RM10 excluding delivery and service charges. Once you receive your RFID tag, you need to perform “tag acknowledgement” by logging in to the VEP portal and clicking the acknowledgement button on your vehicle number. You should also input the RFID serial number for validation. The RFID tag can be attached either to the top left corner of the windscreen or the left headlamp. It must be fitted at least 5 centimetres away from any metal part of the car body. Paste the tag on a clean and dry surface. Gently peel the RFID tag from its edges and paste it horizontally on the left headlamp situated on the passenger side of the vehicle. The tag should not be fitted on the curved portion of the headlamp. For those fitting it on the windscreen, do ensure that it is not obstructed by the wiper blades. Once attached, snap a photo of the tag with your car registration number in the frame and upload the image on the VEP portal. You will be notified when your tag is activated. You can pay road charges and toll fees with the RFID tag by using designated RFID lanes on highway toll booths across the country. The tag is linked to the user’s Touch N’ Go eWallet account. It is valid for five years starting from the day the tag is activated. It is worth noting that foreign vehicles are allowed to stay within Malaysia for up to 90 days each time. The VEP system will provide the police with a more accurate database to monitor foreign vehicles which commit traffic offences in the country, Mr Tengku Ahmad Marwan Tengku Mahmud, a road safety affiliate with the Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research (Miros), told CNA. “It will give authorities a more comprehensive record to check whether vehicles entering or exiting the country have outstanding traffic summons or any records of traffic violations,” he said. “By increasing enforcement, this will hopefully reduce road traffic accidents in Malaysia,” he added. No, the VEP RFID tag is unique to each vehicle and not transferable. You will have to register for a new RFID tag if you acquire a new vehicle. When the ownership of a vehicle is transferred to another person, the tag becomes invalid. The onus is on the previous owner to update the ownership status on the VEP portal, or risk bearing fines for any traffic offences committed by the new owner. The vehicle’s new owner is responsible for applying for a new RFID Tag. If the VEP tag is stolen, lost or damaged in an accident, you are required to update your vehicle status on the online portal and produce a copy of the police report of the incident to the Road Transport Department when you collect the new VEP RFID tag. An administrative fee will be imposed. If your VEP tag is faulty, you will be issued with a replacement for free. This does not apply to tags that have been removed or tampered with – in these cases, motorists will be charged a fee for a new tag.

    "article_content": "World World “This is the first time that we'll probably see a handshake between (US Defense Secretary Lloyd) Austin and (Chinese Defence Minister) Dong Jun,” said one expert on how symbolic plays can create the right atmosphere for further talks. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Hundreds of delegates from the global security community will gather in Singapore this weekend for the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia’s premier defence summit. Now in its 21st edition, the dialogue will take place from Friday (May 31) to Sunday at the Shangri-La Singapore hotel. The dialogue is a platform for government officials, business leaders, and security experts to discuss pressing regional security concerns. It involves speeches, debates, as well as private meetings on the sidelines. The forum is held annually by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). Dr Lim Tai Wei, adjunct senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore (NUS), said: “As we are increasingly seeing a multipolar world, the Shangri-La Dialogue will play a very important part in gathering many important defence and intelligence officials, as well as foreign diplomatic officials to discuss very important hot-button issues.” The dialogue started as a huddle of about a dozen defence ministers at the Shangri-La hotel in Singapore in 2002. It came in the wake of global security concerns and terror attacks such as 9/11. Back then, it was called the Asia Security Conference. Fourteen defence ministers and 160 delegates convened for the dialogue, with the United States sending a delegation led by its deputy defence secretary. Over the years, the one-and-a-half day summit continued to expand its invitation list and sessions. The forum was later named after the hotel it is typically held in. In the fifth year of its establishment, high-level officials from China took part in the dialogue. By 2018, nearly 50 countries were represented. The event was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr Choi Shing Kwok, director and CEO of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said the Shangri-La Dialogue has come a long way. “It has grown both in terms of the size, and also in terms of the level of stature,” he told CNA’s East Asia Tonight. “So clearly today, it is the most important defence and security conference for Asia, just as the Munich Security Conference is the one for Europe.” Today, the Shangri-La Dialogue spans three days, opening with a closely-watched keynote address made typically by a head of state. Previous world leaders have used the platform to outline their views on regional and global security challenges, and offer ideas to resolve potential flashpoints. Some have also outlined their country’s position on contentious issues. Seven plenary sessions on critical and emerging security issues will then follow, featuring defence ministers and senior officials. There are also six special sessions where policymakers and scholars touch on strategic challenges in the region, from green defence to cybersecurity. But many of the discussions take place off the stage, with multiple bilateral meetings held on the fringes of the event. While the summit’s organisers do not suggest a single overarching theme, several topics have been prominent in recent years, including US-China relations and more recently the ongoing war in Ukraine. The Gaza conflict is expected to be in focus this year. “The theme has kind of naturally adapted with the changing times, focusing on various topics like terrorism, non-traditional security, (and) tensions in the South China Sea,” said Mr Choi. “So it has maintained its relevance by adapting to what are the topics of the period.” Dr Lim from NUS added: “There will be a multitude of talks going on on the sidelines, in the corridors, (and) behind closed doors, so we'll never know what is the full extent of the topics that will be covered in the dialogue.” For instance, Reuters reported last year that senior officials from the world's major intelligence agencies held a secret meeting on the sidelines of the dialogue. Sources said such meetings have been discreetly held at a separate venue alongside the summit for several years. Experts noted that with wars and crises piling up, the Shangri-La Dialogue has to prioritise the most urgent issues at the moment. “There'll quite likely be a kind of a priority order in which the issues are to be tackled, and it also depends on the players involved within the dialogue,” Dr Lim told CNA’s Asia First. “Different players will have different national agendas and interests, so it really depends on each country's prioritisation of the issues to be brought to the table.” Mr Choi believes smaller nations can leverage the Shangri-La Dialogue to advance their interests, amid tensions among the superpowers that often dominate the agenda. This year, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr will be delivering the keynote speech on the opening night of the dialogue. He is likely to reiterate his country's stance on the contested South China Sea, where tensions have been escalating. “He will certainly have a very good platform to make his views known. So this is one way in which countries that participate can actually get more airtime and also more limelight,” said Mr Choi. Smaller countries in Southeast Asia also get to air their views at the plenary sessions, he noted. “I think it's important they continue doing so because they do then make their positions known to the rest of the world, (and) to the global powers,” he added. “They also present this different perspective. This is, after all, a period when there's great competition and volatility between the great powers.” High-level security conferences such as the Shangri-La Dialogue can cumulatively contribute to a greater understanding of global issues, stressed Dr Lim. “There is hardly any detriment in talking and dialoguing, so this dialogue is particularly important as it gathers high-level officials,” he added. “Just as importantly, corridor diplomacy and closed-door diplomacy will offer the opportunities for great powers to talk to each other. All these are very important sort of contact points and exposures for personal diplomacy to take place.” For instance, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is expected to meet with his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun at the dialogue this weekend. It will be the first meeting between the two defence leaders following a phone call in April, which comes as both countries gradually work to mend relations. “This is the first time that we'll probably see a handshake between secretary Austin and his counterpart, minister Dong,” said Dr Lim. “So this will be seen as a very important symbolic gesture , particularly in a high-context culture in East Asia.” He noted that symbolic plays are crucial and can create the right atmosphere for further talks to take place. “In addition, this is an election year in the US. It will also carry symbolic significance for the ongoing political contestation that's going on in the US domestically right now,” Dr Lim added. On US-China ties, Dr Lim said communication has improved since a highly-anticipated meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping took place at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco last November. “Overall relations have improved, so this is a good time for them to meet,” he added. “A breakthrough will be very difficult in a public dialogue like this, even for closed-door sessions. But it will create the right atmosphere for people at the field level to be able to carry out the breakthroughs in the day-to-day operations.” This comes as the world is \"fragmenting\", said Dr Stephen R Nagy, senior associate professor at the International Christian University’s Department of Politics and International Studies. “We have authoritarian states that really want to weaken international institutions, weaken rule of law, weaken ideas of democracy,” he told CNA938. “This is not good for smaller states like Singapore. We depend on an international order based on rule of law so that we're not eaten up by big powers.” Mr Choi from ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute noted that the Shangri-La Dialogue has set out to bridge the gap between different sides. “I think that what the organiser IISS has done from the very beginning is try to be inclusive, and I think that's why they went out and invited China to participate as early as they were comfortable to do so,” he added. “They have also, I think, quite consciously given China a very prominent speaking slot, so that China would be at the conference and will have enough air time to make its case.” Despite this, Chinese delegates “may not feel as comfortable” at the Shangri-La Dialogue as compared to other contexts where it may be surrounded by its closer partners, said Mr Choi. “The style of speaking in the Shangri-La Dialogue is also a little bit more western in nature - in that it is more candid, it's more direct - whereas the Chinese may be used to and may prefer a more sort of diplomatic and very indirect approach and tone.” Yet Mr Choi believes the security summit in Singapore is still relevant, and “maintains its utility above any other regional forums” as the world gets more volatile and dangerous.

    "article_content": "Asia Asia Economic issues played a much bigger role in India’s mammoth general election than the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party hoped, said one expert. This audio is generated by an AI tool. India’s marathon general election drew to a close on Tuesday (Jun 4), with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failing to win a parliamentary majority for the first time in a decade. The shock result came as commentators and exit polls projected an overwhelming victory for Mr Modi, who will still enter a rare third term in office. The election, which was conducted in seven phases over six weeks, concluded with more than 642 million votes cast in the world's largest democratic exercise. With the final vote count concluded, official results show that Mr Modi’s political alliance - known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and led by BJP - has won enough seats needed to form the next government. However, the BJP only secured 240 out of 543 parliamentary seats. This is much lower than the target of 400 seats that Mr Modi set during the election campaign, and the 303 seats that it won at the last polls five years ago. The halfway mark is 272 seats. The BJP also lost its national majority after major defeats in key states. After dominating Indian politics for a decade, it will need to rely on coalition allies to pass legislation in parliament. Its current vote share at 36.6 per cent is marginally lower than at the last general election. Meanwhile, the main opposition Congress party performed better than expected, defying several exit poll predictions. It is set to take 99 seats, almost doubling its 2019 tally of 52. It also managed to end the BJP’s total dominance in Mr Modi’s home state of Gujarat, winning one seat out of 26 after coming up short in the 2014 and 2019 elections. Congress leads the opposition INDIA coalition, which won 232 seats. Analysts whom CNA spoke to pointed to voters being dissatisfied with issues like high unemployment, as well as the tactics used by the BJP to suppress the opposition. Dr Irfan Nooruddin, professor of Indian politics at Georgetown University, said that economic issues played a much bigger role in this election than the BJP hoped. “India’s economy is not quite as booming as a lot of the official numbers suggest. The official GDP (gross domestic product) numbers are very, very gaudy,” he told CNA938. India faces a significant job crisis, he noted, with less than 10 per cent of its massive population of 1.4 billion people working in the formal sector. Nearly 83 per cent of the country’s unemployed are its youth . “Rural distress is very high and the majority of India still earns its income from agriculture, in some form or other, and don't do particularly well. Food insecurity has been increasing as inflation has gone up,” Dr Nooruddin said. He added that while large pockets of tremendous wealth have emerged in India, that is not the ground reality for hundreds of millions of Indians. “I think they … found the opposition alliance’s emphasis on social justice issues and economic issues more attractive, and felt maybe the BJP have gone a bit out of touch with their aspirations and needs,” he said. Mr Neelanjan Sircar, senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi, noted what had happened in the run-up to the election: the BJP using state institutions to dampen and harass the opposition. Chief ministers were imprisoned, countless others had to deal with the tax authorities, and Congress’s bank accounts were frozen in February, leaving it unable to campaign properly. “I think there was a larger understanding that … this may not be the most fair election, and (for) the voters, there was a narrative that this is the election to save democracy,” Mr Sircar told CNA’s Asia Now. Dr Nooruddin said that a big surprise was how poorly the BJP performed in north India – particularly Uttar Pradesh state, the country’s most populous and the base of the party’s previous majority in the 2014 and 2019 elections. “A lot of the rhetoric that the BJP had begun to use in this campaign, about anti-Muslim rhetoric and emphasis on religious symbolism, simply didn't resonate - including in places that were really the base constituency. So that was quite a surprise and quite a shocker for many observers,” Dr Nooruddin added. “You can't distract hungry, poor people (by talking) about God and religion forever.” The experts said it remains unclear how exit polls predicted a far too optimistic outcome for Mr Modi, projecting a landslide victory for him. Dr Nooruddin said: “The exit poll industry remains relevant, but I think we have to do a much better job of discerning high-quality exit polls from a lot of the stuff that gets paraded on national television.” He added that a large part of these polls are “super opaque”, with no clarity on the sample sizes and sampling strategy. Much of the attention was focused on nine polls commissioned by major news stations. Dr Nooruddin advised people to diversify their sources, such as looking at the vernacular Hindi language media. “They are often more accurate and closer to the ground,” he added. Mr Modi, a popular but divisive figure, created a cult of personality over the past decade. But analysts said his appeal may have peaked. One way to read the results is that the Indian electorate has voted against the election being a referendum on a person, rather than a party, said Ms Prerna Singh, Mahatma Gandhi Associate Professor of political science and international studies at Brown University. “The election was really fought on a cult of personality, a politics of hubris,” she told CNA’s Asia First. Dr Nooruddin noted that Mr Modi, who is by far the country’s most popular politician, saw his vote margin in his own constituency drop by 60 per cent from about 400,000 to 150,000 votes. Although this remains a convincing win, Dr Nooruddin said the much smaller margin of victory signals that something fundamentally has changed. He added: “One other observation is that Modi is 73 years old. He himself said a while ago that no politician should be in office past the age of 75, but (whether) he intends to stick to his own mandate is unclear.” In terms of Mr Modi’s Hindu nationalist agenda, Ms Singh said the BJP’s loss in the backyard of his signature Hindu temple was a “very important symbolic” one. Mr Modi had inaugurated the controversial Ram temple, located in the northern town of Ayodhya, in January in what was seen as his trump card to retain power. Ms Singh said BJP’s loss there signalled that Mr Modi’s anti-Muslim rhetoric reached a vitriolic pitch in the election campaign. The focus shifted towards questions of livelihood and the Constitution, which emerged as an unexpected and important rallying force for the electorate, especially in the countryside. Nevertheless, Mr Modi clearly has the people’s backing and the mandate to get on with his economic policies, said Dr Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow and research lead in trade and Economics at the National University of Singapore (NUS)’s Institute of South Asian Studies. “More people have actually voted for Modi than the others. The BJP might not have caught the maximum votes, but they have gotten the largest (number of) votes,” Dr Palit told CNA’s Asia Tonight. Analysts said that India’s core foreign policy interests and objectives will likely not change that much, as it seeks to retain influence in the region and strengthen strategic partnerships. Mr Karthik Nachiappan, fellow at NUS’ Institute of South Asian Studies, told CNA’s Asia First that trade and investment will “get a lot of attention” and become an important policy going forward. “That could mean more in Southeast Asia,” he added. With India having become a key security partner and an actor in Southeast Asia in the past few years, there are hopes of further economic integration with the region, Mr Nachiappan said. “I think India's general weakness in Southeast Asia has been economically embedding itself within the region. For various reasons, it hasn't been able to do that effectively,” he added. India is not part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – a free trade agreement among Asia-Pacific countries including Singapore, Malaysia, China, Japan and South Korea. Because of this, it has not been able to connect to regional value chains and economic structures, said Mr Nachiappan. “Besides that, there are other issues that I think that could be also worth focusing on - issues like digital payments, fintech infrastructure,” he added. Ms Singh said India faces a “very different era” compared with the last five years. “In many ways, this is the shift to what had already been the norm before the rise of Prime Minister Modi. That is a return to coalition partners, a return to alliance politics,” she added. Ms Singh said that the cult of personality politics, as well as the concentration of politics in New Delhi, will also dissipate. At least two of the major coalition partners that Mr Modi must rely on – the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal (United) – have influence in South and East India respectively. This means regional politics will begin to play a more important role at the national level, Ms Singh added. Mr Sircar from NUS said it will be “really unchartered territory” for Mr Modi, who “aggressively centralises power” and “does not play nice with coalition partners”. He questioned whether Mr Modi would form new state institutions to keep his coalition together, like what he did against his political opponents. On what role the opposition could play in the next government, Mr Sircar noted that citizens had to take to the streets to air their grievances against the BJP in the past decade, given that there was no parliamentary or electoral opposition for all intents and purposes. “Perhaps now, people who have grievances can use formal parliamentary procedures again,” he added. “So perhaps this is going to be a very, very good thing for parliamentary democracy.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Is it true that lawyers' fees will eclipse the final sum? This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A Singaporean man who suffered permanent brain injuries from a car chain collision in Malaysia was awarded S$4.7 million (US$3.5 million) in damages by Singapore's High Court earlier in June. CNA spoke to lawyers to answer commonly asked questions on how victims of motor accidents can obtain compensation via lawsuits for damages. There are typically four main components in death or injury claims, said Mr Raj Singh Shergill, managing partner at the Lee Shergill law firm. These are: That would be the defendant's insurer, as mandated by law. There is a common misconception that a claimant will not be able to get large judgment sums if the defendant cannot afford to pay. This is not relevant here because it is the motor insurer who must pay, Mr Shergill reiterated. \"Singapore law makes it mandatory to have motor insurance covering the risk of death or injury to third parties arising from the use of a motor vehicle and compels the motor insurer to satisfy the judgment sum awarded against the defendant,\" said Mr Shergill, noting that Malaysian law is broadly similar. Under Singapore law, even if the insured person is bankrupt or has breached certain policy conditions such as by drink driving, this doesn't affect the right of third-party claimants to recover the judgment sum from the motor insurer, he added. Mr Muhammad Razeen Sayed Majunoon, director at Advance Law, told CNA that amounts are typically paid in a lump sum, with insurers usually disbursing the full amount once the claim is settled and all documentation is in order. \"In some cases, especially in larger claims, the parties might agree to structured settlements where the payment is made in instalments or tranches. This, however, is less common and usually subject to agreement between the claimant and the paying party,\" he said. Mr Razeen said it was rare for defendants to renege on payment when insurance is involved, and that claimants \"almost always receive the awarded compensation\" in insured cases. Claimants will still get their money in such cases, said Mr Shergill. In 1975, the Minister for Finance entered into an agreement with all motor insurers, under which the Motor Insurer's Bureau of Singapore (MIB) will compensate such victims, he pointed out. \"In situations where a policy was issued by a motor insurer but did not cover the particular driver, the motor insurer will satisfy the judgment on behalf of the MIB,\" said the lawyer. \"In all other cases, an application may be made directly to the MIB. The MIB cannot be sued in court, but their decisions can be appealed to the Public Trustee.\" That's a government body with the discretion to administer compensation in motor accident cases. In any case, recovery of sums awarded is \"simplified\" and rarely requires enforcement proceedings, which would in any event be \"relatively straightforward\" and not concern the claimant, said Mr Shergill. Even if a defendant is uninsured because he breached certain conditions in an insurance policy, the insurer still has to satisfy the judgment sum as it cannot avoid the claim. Once a court awards damages, the timeline for receiving the money can vary, said Mr Razeen. \"If the payment is made by an insurer, it is usually processed and disbursed within a few weeks to a couple of months, depending on the insurer's procedures and whether there are any appeals,\" he said. \"If enforcement actions are required (usually in cases involving uninsured defendants), the process can take several months to over a year, depending on the complexity of the enforcement actions needed,\" said Mr Razeen. Mr Shergill said cases in Singapore typically take anywhere from six months to three years to resolve. Some may take even longer in scenarios where it takes time for long-term disabilities to emerge; where parties cannot agree on costs and disbursements; or in cases involving overseas accidents or defendants. This is because permission must be obtained from the court to serve proceedings overseas, said Mr Shergill. Enforcement proceedings may also have to be initiated against motor insurers or defendants if they do not pay out. If claimants need funds to tide them over while they're waiting to receive the damages, they can apply for interim payments to be given upfront and to be offset from the eventual damages, said Mr Shergill. \"To do so, the claimant must establish that the defendant is insured, will be substantially liable, and the advance sought is proportionate to the prospective damages.\" Lawyers told CNA this was a \"misconception\" and \"not entirely accurate\". Such fees in Singapore for motor accident injury claims are regulated to be fair and transparent, and are typically reasonable relative to the damages awarded, said Mr Andy Yeo, partner at Eldan Law. The Public Trustee will review the amount of legal fees claimed by the representing lawyer, in cases involving damages exceeding S$5,000. There are also guidelines set by the Law Society of Singapore. On average, claimants can expect to receive between 70 to 85 per cent of the awarded sum after deducting legal fees and other costs, said Mr Razeen. \"The exact percentage can vary based on the complexity of the case and the fee arrangement with the lawyer,\" he added. Lawyers in Singapore typically charge on an hourly basis or fixed fees, and these costs are usually agreed upon at the outset of the case. Lawyers in Singapore also cannot charge contingency fees - a sum that they receive only if they win the case. Mr Razeen noted that many law firms offer initial consultations at no cost or at a reduced fee, to evaluate the merits of the case. Some firms might agree to defer fees until the conclusion of the case, providing claimants with financial flexibility. The court also considers legal costs when awarding damages for the claimants, which helps claimants retain a significant portion of the awarded compensation even after legal fees are deducted, said Mr Razeen. When a court awards damages, it will order the defendant to contribute to the claimant's costs, which are intended to cover the bulk of the legal expenses and the court's, said Mr Shergill. The motor insurer then pays the lawyer and the balance goes directly to the claimant. \"This mechanism also ensures that lawyers do not handle the damages directly, which also eliminates the risk of unscrupulous lawyers absconding with such damages or trying to pocket the damages under the guise of legal fees,\" he said. Singapore law has an additional safeguard for claimants who are minors or people with disabilities: The court's approval is mandatory for any settlement payable to their lawyers. Singapore law provides for the courts to exercise jurisdiction where the losses are largely incurred in Singapore, and where witnesses such as medical experts are based in Singapore with a sufficient connection to Singapore, said Mr Shergill. Upon filing the claim in court, the claimants' lawyers will apply to serve the papers on overseas defendants and provide preliminary justification for this. This was the case for Mr Lim Chun Yong, who won a S$4.7 million payout after his accident in Malaysia . \"Thereafter, none of the defendants or their motor insurers challenged the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. Instead (save for two defendants who did not participate), all the motor insurers and defendants submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore High Court by actively participating in the proceedings,\" said Mr Shergill, who handled the case. He noted that the court rules require defendants to expressly raise challenges to the jurisdiction of the Singapore Court at the outset. \"This would also impact adversely on Malaysian insurers who choose to ignore Singapore proceedings but subsequently try to contest the jurisdiction of the Singapore court during enforcement proceedings in Malaysia,\" said Mr Shergill. Mr Shergill, whose firm specialises in personal injury cases, said Singapore and Malaysia operate similar frameworks to deal with foreign judgments. \"These laws enable judgments from the Singapore High Court to be registered and enforced in Malaysia, without the necessity for a new trial,\" he said. But there are exceptions in Malaysian proceedings for judgments to do with gratuitous passengers, or those who hitch a ride without paying. This group is excluded from Malaysian statutory requirements for motor insurance coverage against the risk of death or injury. On how payment for a Singapore judgment could be enforced in Malaysia, Mr Shergill used Mr Lim's case again as an example. Even in the unlikely event that all of the motor insurers involved refused to make payment, Mr Lim simply needed to \" register the judgment in Malaysia against the defendants\". After that, he would have been able to enforce payment against any of the motor insurers for the full sum, under Malaysian law. There are certain advantages for a Singapore claimant to obtain a Singapore judgment, even if there are similarities between Singapore and Malaysia's legal networks, said Mr Shergill. First, it's easier to monitor the progress in local jurisdiction. Second, if the witnesses are predominantly based in Singapore, it's more practical to have them testify here. There's also potential for more compensation, said the lawyer. \"Singapore may award a potentially higher multiplier (number of years) for future losses, such as loss of earnings,\" he said, pointing to an updated compensation system which takes into account current investment returns, mortality rates and inflation. In contrast, the computation of such awards in Malaysia has yet to be revised, potentially resulting in lower compensation amounts. But the most significant advantage may be in the structure of legal costs. \"In Malaysia, the party and party costs may be comparatively minimal whilst lawyers may levy significantly higher fees as solicitor and client costs, which may include a percentage of the damages,\" said Mr Shergill. Singapore prohibits lawyers from charging victims a percentage of the damages. Malaysian lawyer Andrew Teh told CNA that the assessment of solicitor-client costs in Malaysia is at the discretion of the trial court. There is also no Malaysian equivalent of Singapore's scheme for court-approved settlements for minors or persons with disabilities. Editor's note: This article has been edited for clarity, specifically in the section on what claimants can do if the defendant is not insured or cannot be traced. Claimants should be proactive in gathering and preserving all relevant evidence immediately following an accident, said Mr Razeen. These include: There are also time limits for filing claims - for personal injury claims, this is three years from the time of the injury; for property damage claims, it's six years from the time of damage. \"Seeking prompt legal advice can also help streamline the claims process and ensure that all necessary documents and procedures are handled correctly,\" said Mr Razeen. \"Understanding the typical timeline and process for motor accident claims can help manage expectations and reduce anxiety during the legal proceedings.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

The interior of Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 (left) after turbulence forced an emergency landing in Bangkokxy and (right) the exterior of Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital, where some injured passengers were being treated. (Photos: Reuters/Stringer, AFP/Manan Vatsyayana) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) on Tuesday (June 11) announced compensation offers to the 211 passengers on the turbulence-hit SQ321 flight. The plane was flying from London to Singapore when it was forced into an emergency landing in Bangkok on May 21, with one dead and dozens injured, some seriously. Passengers with “minor injuries” have been offered US$10,000 (S$13,500). Those who sustained more serious injuries have been invited by SIA to further discuss compensation to meet their specific circumstances, while they will also be offered an advance payment of US$25,000 for immediate needs. CNA spoke to civil and aviation lawyers, some of whom represent the SQ321 passengers, to answer questions raised by the incident. When it comes to establishing the extent an airline is liable to passengers, the legal framework most jurisdictions follow is the Montreal Convention. Under the Convention, in the event of an accident resulting in injury or death, airlines are “strictly liable” for the first 128,821 \"Special Drawing Rights\". This refers to an international reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund, that is contested in a legal claim, said lawyer Robert Hedrick from Aviation Law Group in Seattle. Special Drawing Rights of 128,821 converts to approximately US$170,000. “For damages in excess of that amount, if the air carrier proves that it was not at fault, it is not liable for more,” said Mr Hedrick. Over 130 countries or jurisdictions have agreed to abide by the rules and regulations set forth by the Convention. These include the United Kingdom where SQ321 departed; the plane's original destination Singapore; and Thailand where it made an emergency landing. Under the convention, passengers can file legal claims either in the country which is the principal business of the air carrier; the country where the ticket was issued; or a country where the passenger resides and the carrier operates. Disputes lawyer Chooi Jing Yen from Singapore firm Eugene Thuraisingam said it would make the most sense for passengers to file legal claims in Singapore, rather than in Thailand or the UK. “A UK passenger could take matters to a UK court, but if SIA doesn’t have any assets in the UK, they still have to bring the judgment to Singapore,” he said. “Thailand is just the emergency landing place, and you may not want to litigate in Thai court, as they are run by a set of rules that (passengers) may not be familiar with.\" But aviation compensation lawyer Peter Carter, who said he was advising up to 13 Australian and Singaporean passengers of SQ321, believes the choice of jurisdiction depends on the claims being brought forth. For instance, one country might calculate compensation for permanent impairment differently from another, said the director of Carter Capner Law, a Brisbane-based law firm. In general, no – not in the immediate wake of an accident, and especially not when full investigation results have not been released, according to experts. Mr Hedrick from Seattle said that in offering compensation \"promptly\" – three weeks after the incident – SIA was taking the right step towards caring for customers. \"The airline has the option of doing nothing and leaving it up to the passengers to make claims,” he said. Mr Carter said the US$25,000 interim offer was “very welcome” and a good move by SIA's insurer. “We advise people to accept that as an advance, because that doesn't compromise their rights, they’re still entitled to recover their full compensation, that's just an advance,” he said. Other lawyers have noted however that it remains unclear if \"full compensation\" could come with conditions. Some lawyers CNA spoke to advised passengers to consider their legal options before accepting the compensation. Aviation lawyer Sarah Stewart, who said she was representing passengers injured in SQ321, noted that in the wake of accidents, airlines and their insurers would look to resolve legal proceedings “for the minimum amount of compensation”. “Particularly for more serious injuries it is vital that passengers speak to aviation lawyers and obtain medical expert reports in order to evaluate the severity, effect and prognosis of their injuries,” she added. “Lawyers acting for passengers will then be able to ensure that the claims are fully evaluated and a calculation of their financial losses - which for those with truly life-changing injuries will likely run into the millions - is put to (the airline),” she added. Aviation lawyer James Healy-Pratt, who also said he was representing SQ321 passengers, pointed to how others in the past have received more compensation after seeking legal representation. This happened in the aftermath of the SQ006 crash in Taipei in 2000, which claimed 83 lives onboard. SIA had offered to pay US$400,000 for every passenger and crew member killed, and US$20,000 to those who survived. “That tactic did not work particularly well,” said Mr Healy-Pratt, who is with the UK-based Keystone Law firm. However, Singapore-based lawyer Chooi said passengers with minor injuries might have different considerations. “With any personal injury claim against a big company, there will be insurers involved, so the legal road is always going to be very long, very costly and very uncertain,” he said. He said passengers would have to document their physical recovery “every step of the way” to prove in court that they have grounds for their claims. So in some cases, it would be advisable to accept SIA's compensation offer, said Mr Chooi. “For those who don’t have the means to go through the hassle (of legal proceedings), they can get something pretty quickly, and it’s a form of closure.” Some online commenters have lauded SIA's compensation offers as generous, saying that the flag carrier had taken the initiative to dole them out even before investigations were complete. Experts said it was good public relations. “The SIA compensation package looks like a goodwill gesture from SIA, as there has been no known investigation findings or conclusions on the incident,” said Ms Nicole Evangeline Poh, associate director at Singapore law firm Covenant Chambers. Since investigations take time, SIA needs to show the public that it's taking tangible steps; that it's committed to supporting affected passengers - and \"not just saying it without any action or cost to them\", she added. Ms Poh noted that given investigations are not yet complete, the compensation offered also cannot be taken as “an acknowledgement of liability or assumption of responsibility for the incident”. Other lawyers suggested that the compensation offers could possibly come with conditions, should passengers accept them. Mr Chooi, for one, expects there to be a clause limiting SIA’s legal obligations towards passengers once they take up the offers. “Otherwise, there is no reason why SIA would want to do it.\" CNA has reached out to SIA to ask if this is the case. SIA did not comment nor provide details on the number of passengers who have accepted the compensation offers so far.

An accident over two decades ago involved 7,000 tonnes - but that wasn't Singapore's largest oil spill ever. Bags of oil-covered sand are seen at East Coast Park on Jun 16, 2024, two days after an oil spill at Pasir Panjang Terminal. (Photo: CNA/Davina Tham) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: An oil spill on Friday (Jun 14) has led to beaches around Singapore being closed. Clean-up efforts are still underway, with slicks also spreading to the Southern Islands tourist attractions and sighted as far east as the Changi area. The spill was sparked by Netherlands-flagged dredger Vox Maxima hitting Singapore-flagged bunker vessel Marine Honour at Pasir Panjang Terminal at about 2.20pm on Friday. According to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), Vox Maxima reported a sudden loss in engine and steering control before its allision with Marine Honour - referring to when a moving vessel hits a stationary object. This ruptured one of Marine Honour’s oil cargo tanks, releasing about 400 tonnes of low-sulphur fuel into the sea. The incident was not caused by port congestion, Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat said on Tuesday as he gave a brief timeline of events. On Saturday, oil washed up along several beaches including at Sentosa island and East Coast Park, as well as the shoreline at Labrador Nature Reserve. The next day, beaches at St John's, Lazarus and Kusu islands were closed. Oil slicks were also spotted at Marina South Pier. On Monday, some oil was seen off the coast of Changi . A 1999 Oil Spill Intelligence Report said the Singapore Strait was considered one of the world’s hot spots given its reputation as one of the busiest sea lanes globally. The largest oil spill in Singapore happened in 1997, when two tankers collided about 5km south of a Singapore Port Limit. About 28,000 tonnes of oil were spilled - 70 times that of Friday's incident. Emergency aid from the Japanese government was sought to help contain the spill, which damaged mangrove forests and coral reefs in the vicinity of Raffles Lighthouse. Waters west of Singapore were covered with greasy patches, with oil also washing up on Pulau Sebarok and Pulau Hantu islands. In 2000, about 7,000 tonnes of crude oil were spilled when a vessel ran aground just 8km from Sentosa. The oil washed up on the beaches of Sentosa, St John’s Island and Lazarus Island. A decade later, a tanker collided with a bulk carrier about 13km from Changi’s shore, spilling about 2,500 tonnes of crude oil into the waters. And 10 years ago, three separate ship allisions occurred in two months, spilling a total of 760 tonnes of fuel oil into Singapore's waters and polluting the beaches off Kusu and St John’s islands. On Saturday, 18 response craft were deployed to contain and clean up the spill. About 100 workers were deployed the next day to help clean up Sentosa's beaches, with vacuum pumps also used to remove surface oil. On Tuesday, authorities said close to 1,500m of containment booms have been deployed since Friday at Keppel Marina, East Coast Park and Labrador Nature Reserve to prevent further spread of oil onto the shore. Another 1,600m of these booms, which are temporary floating barriers, will be deployed over the next few days in areas such as Sentosa and the Southern Islands. The booms will also help prevent the oil from going back out to sea. Oil-absorbent booms have also been deployed off biodiversity-sensitive areas such as Pulau Ubin's Chek Jawa Wetlands, Coney Island Park, Pasir Ris Park and West Coast Park. Over the next few days, more booms will be deployed to protect fish farms at the East Johor Straits and also Chek Jawa Wetlands and Changi Creek. Other measures include a specialised oil floating containment and recovery device called a Current Buster, which has been deployed off Changi Exhibition Centre as a pre-emptive measure. Two such systems have also been deployed off Labrador Nature Reserve and Bedok Jetty. Each Current Buster system consists of a floating barrier sitting on the water’s surface, with a submerged extension called a skirt that extends below the surface to corral and collect the oil. Two sets of skimmer systems have also been deployed at Marina South Pier and off East Coast Lagoon. These include craft-towed booms to corral surface oil and a component to skim and “lift” oil off the water surface and into storage tanks. MPA has also deployed drones to surveil affected areas. The Singapore Food Agency said on Monday that local fish remain safe to eat, and that there was a “low risk” of the oil spill spreading to farms. National water agency PUB also said that Singapore’s water supply has not been affected. But yacht companies and water sports businesses have told CNA that they had to put their tours and rentals on hold over the long weekend, racking up thousands in lost earnings. MPA on Sunday said it was working with British Marine , the insurer of the stationary Marine Honour tanker, to set up a third-party claims contact for affected parties. CNA has contacted MPA for more information. Meanwhile, marine biologist Toh Tai Chong told CNA that organisms living on or near the water's surface such as sea birds, mangrove forests and corals could be smothered by the oil slick and end up ingesting chemicals. Dr Toh, a lecturer at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and also co-founder of non-profit organisation Our Singapore Reefs, warned that the impact of the pollution could be felt for months to come. For instance, with their movements restricted, birds cannot hunt for prey or evade predators well. Various toxins from the oil can also impact the reproduction of corals. If oil seeps into the soil at beaches, it will not be easy to eradicate, as was the case in the 2010 spill off Changi. Such oil can be ingested by organisms such as clams and worms, and in turn, poison their predators. “Nature will naturally recover ... Oil will disperse over time,\" said Dr Toh. \"But it depends on how fast the response is, and the scale of the impact.” He advised against fishing and foraging for marine wildlife in the medium term. “Try not to harvest (wildlife) and consume them in the coming three months, especially for filter feeders like clams,\" he said. \"They tend to accumulate more of the toxins.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Sport Sport :South Africa held their collective nerve to edge West Indies by three wickets under the Duckworth-Lewis method in a rain-disrupted shootout for a semi-final spot at the Twenty20 World Cup in Antigua on Sunday. The unbeaten Proteas joined England in the last four as Group 2 winners when Marco Jansen (21 not out) smashed a six down the ground off the first ball of the final over to get South Africa to their adjusted target of 123. Left-arm spinner Tabraiz Shamsi had earlier taken 3-27 as tournament co-hosts West Indies were restricted to 135-8 before the rainstorm swept in to stop play. Spinner Roston Chase (3-12) took three wickets late in the South African innings to set up a dramatic finish and give a glimmer of hope that West Indies might keep alive their quest for a third title. \"There's a lot of relief ultimately to get through to get to the semi-final,\" said South Africa captain Aiden Markram. \"I suppose it's been the story of our (tournament), get ourselves into tricky positions and sort of by hook or by crook get over the line.\" The other two semi-finalists will be decided on Monday when India and Australia meet in St Lucia and Afghanistan take on Bangladesh in St Vincent in the last two matches in the Super Eight stage. The South Africans won the toss and elect to bowl first in a decision that was quickly vindicated when danger men Shai Hope and Nicholas Pooran were dismissed inside the first two overs with just five runs on the board. Kyle Mayers, brought into the West Indies squad as an injury replacement on Saturday, steadied the innings in a partnership of 81 for the third wicket with Chase. Both had some fraught moments - Chase was dropped on 11 and Mayers survived an lbw call on review - before Shamsi separated them in the 12th over when Mayers slashed the ball to Tristan Stubbs at deep cover point to depart for 35. WEST INDIES UNDER-PAR That was the last partnership of note in an innings of fits and starts, Chase (52) and Sherfane Rutherford (0) falling victim to Shamsi's wrist spin, and Andre Russell thumping a couple of big sixes before being run out for 15. West Indies knew they were under-par and needed a big bowling effort and Russell gave them a great start. He struck with the first delivery of the innings to remove Reeza Hendricks caught behind down the leg side before having the other South Africa opener, Quinton de Kock, caught at backward square leg for 12 five deliveries later. The crowd at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium came to life but any momentum the West Indies had built was lost when the skies opened immediately and play was delayed for 90 minutes. Stubbs and Markram resumed on 15-2 and took the tally to 42 before local quick Alzarri Joseph struck with his second delivery to remove the captain for 18. Joseph's pace did for Heinrich Klaasen (22) in the eighth over but the other West Indies bowlers were proving expensive and the South Africans were now just a run-a-ball away from their target. Chase came on in the 12th over to bowl David Miller for four and then sent back Stubbs (29) and Keshav Maharaj (2) and ensure the chase went into the 17th and final over. \"I think credit must be given to the boys, I think they fought to the very end,\" said West Indies skipper Rovman Powell. \"As a batting group, this is one performance we'll try our best to forget. It was a commendable bowling effort, we said that we're just gonna give it our all and whatever happens, happens.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

Mandatory Credit: Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports Uruguay opened their Copa America campaign with a 3-1 win over Panama on Sunday but head coach Marcelo Bielsa was quick to temper expectations and said they must continue to improve. Bielsa took charge of Uruguay in May last year and steered them through a transitional period in which veterans Edinson Cavani and Diego Godin both retired, with all-time leading goalscorer Luis Suarez looking set to follow suit soon. The 15-times Copa America winners have been in excellent form over the last several months, beating both Argentina and Brazil in World Cup qualifiers. Those results have sparked hope of a record 16th continental crown for \"La Celeste\" but Bielsa said they were taking it one game at a time. \"When it comes to Uruguay's aspirations, we will see that and build it match by match,\" he told reporters. \"My expectation is that each match will increasingly help us to improve on our level. Uruguay has players of a very good level and we need to see if I can build with those players.\" Uruguay dominated the opening 45 minutes as they pressed and harried Panama but their energy levels appeared to drop in the second half. Panama looked likely to grab an equaliser after the break and Uruguay only regained control after Darwin Nunez's goal in the 85th minute. \"The first half gave us the edge over our opponent. We should have scored more,\" Bielsa said. \"In the second half, there were 15 minutes where we performed very poorly. They dominated the ball during that time and they created opportunities where we were only leading by one goal and if they had scored, it would have been complicated for us. \"We missed five goals and we scored one in the first half and then we missed five and scored two in the second half.\" Uruguay next face Bolivia in New Jersey on Thursday.

The co-hosts needed to beat South Africa in Antigua to reach the semi-finals but despite taking the rain-disrupted match down to the wire their bid for a third title came to an end in a three-wicket loss. \"When you look on a large scale, we haven't won the World Cup, we aren't in the semi-finals, but I think the cricket that we've played in the last 12 months or so is commendable,\" he said. \"Credit has to be given to the team, if you can take a year to move from number nine to number three in the world, that's tremendous work. \"We haven't won the World Cup but there was a lot of improvement and there's a lot of buzz around the Caribbean again about West Indies cricket.\" Powell paid tribute to the big, noisy crowds that had turned out around the region for the West Indies matches and for the fans who had shown their support for the team on social media. \"They have been fantastic,\" he added. \"It's good to see that some buzz is back in the Caribbean for the cricket because we know for how long that has died down. And I know people are rallying around the West Indies as they do. \"Now, when we hear the anthem play as players, we feel something, and I think that is heading in the right direction. Credit has to be given to the guys, they fought tonight and they fought throughout the last 12 months.\" West Indies have faded as a force since the days of the 1970s and 1980s when they were feared throughout the cricket world and Powell hoped this tournament would mark a turning point. \"Now is where the work starts for us to continue to work as a group still be tight,\" he said. \"And hopefully, just hopefully we can continue to climb the rankings and make the Caribbean people proud.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

Lock Barrett will have his centre brother Jordie and reigning World Player of the Year Ardie Savea to support him as vice-captains when New Zealand take on England in Dunedin and Auckland and the Fijians in San Diego. \"There are some great leaders in our group, but having that existing connection to Scott was important,\" said Robertson, who coached Barrett for seven years at the Canterbury Crusaders. \"He's tactically astute, he leads from the front, and he’s got the respect of the players and coaches.\" Barrett is a certain starter for New Zealand but there was a question mark over his disciplinary record as the only All Black to have been sent off twice in tests. \"When you think of the leaders who have gone before you, it's quite humbling to be asked to captain the All Blacks, so it's not something I took lightly,\" the 30-year-old said. \"It’s a big responsibility, but I have two great leaders beside me in Ardie and Jordie.\" Wallace Sititi earned the opportunity to win his first cap with a breakout season for the Waikato Chiefs but there was no place for his fellow number eight Hoskins Sotutu, who had an outstanding season for the Super Rugby champion Auckland Blues. Injuries to Cam Roigard and Samisoni Taukei'aho have opened up opportunities for Cortez Ratima and George Bell to get into the squad at scrumhalf and hooker respectively, while prop Pasilio Tosi was perhaps the most surprising rookie selection. Centre Billy Proctor was the fifth uncapped player named but his Wellington Hurricanes team mate Ruben Love, one of the standouts of the Super Rugby season at fullback, will join the 32-man squad only as injury cover. Damian McKenzie and the third Barrett brother, Beauden, will vie for the flyhalf position left vacant by Richie Mo'unga's departure for Japan at the end of last year's World Cup. Stephen Perofeta was the only specialist fullback included in the squad but whichever one of McKenzie or Beauden Barrett misses out on the flyhalf slot is likely to fill the number 15 shirt. Scrumhalf TJ Perenara and lock Patrick Tuipulotu both return to the squad after missing the World Cup campaign in France through injury. Previous captain Sam Cane was not considered because of injury, the team said, suggesting the flanker could play a part in the Rugby Championship later this year despite announcing he would be quitting test rugby at the end of the season. \"As a coaching group, we are excited about the squad we’ve selected,\" Roberston added. \"We know it's a group that can play the style of rugby we want the All Blacks to play in 2024.\" Forwards: Asafo Aumua, Codie Taylor, George Bell, Ethan De Groot, Tyrel Lomax, Fletcher Newell, Pasilio Tosi, Ofa Tu’ungafasi, Tamaiti Williams, Scott Barrett, Tupou Vaa’i, Patrick Tuipulotu, Ethan Blackadder, Samipeni Finau, Luke Jacobson, Dalton Papali’i, Ardie Savea, Wallace Sititi Backs: Finlay Christie, TJ Perenara, Cortez Ratima, Beauden Barrett, Damian McKenzie, Jordie Barrett, Rieko Ioane Anton Lienert-Brown, Billy Proctor, Caleb Clarke, Emoni Narawa, Stephen Perofeta, Sevu Reece, Mark Tele'a Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

The Dutch edged Poland 2-1 in their opening game in Hamburg and were fortunate not to lose to a wasteful France in their second match in Leipzig, escaping with a 0-0 draw. \"Against Poland we played well for 60 minutes and created many chances,\" Van Dijk told reporters. \"But we were also under pressure. Against France we were more compact as a team. \"Keeping a clean sheet against the World Cup runners-up is good. But in possession of the ball, we were very poor.\" The Dutch team came under fire from TV pundits and newspaper columnists following the game against France but Van Dijk was unruffled by the criticism. \"Everyone is allowed to have their own opinion, that's fine,\" he added. \"It doesn't bother me, it's part of football. If it irritated me, I would have a very unpleasant life. \"Expectations are high, also among ourselves. We have a good team; I sincerely think so. We want to show it in big matches. After the match against France, we as players clearly said to each other what needs to be improved. “We can and must do better than we did against France. We can still make progress in this European Championship.\" The Dutch, who are almost certain to advance to the round of 16, complete their group fixtures against Austria in Berlin on Tuesday.

    "article_content": "Sport Sport STUTTGART, Germany : Scotland arrived at Euro 2024 buoyed by optimism after a dazzling qualifying run but crashed out of the tournament in achingly familiar fashion, bringing the passionate Tartan Army's party to an abrupt halt. Searching for their first appearance in the knockout rounds in 12 major tournaments dating back to 1954, Scotland needed a win over Hungary on Sunday to advance though even a draw might have been enough depending on other results. Instead, pressing for a goal in the dying seconds, Scotland left themselves open at the back and were punished by Kevin Csoboth, who scored the latest regular-time goal in European Championship history with 99 minutes and 32 seconds on the clock. The heartbreaking loss had captain Andy Robertson apologising and manager Steve Clarke looking despondent. \"We'll take a long time to get over this one,\" Robertson said. \"Thank you to the country because we felt everyone behind us, and we knew the excitement back home - sorry for letting you down.\" An estimated 200,000 of Scotland's friendly, kilt-wearing supporters had descended on Germany for the tournament but the fans' passion was not rewarded by performances on the pitch. With a limited pool of players and a squad hampered by injury, Scotland finished with a single point from three games. They managed two goals, both of which went in off opposing players. Clarke's team had a woeful 17 shots across their three games, matching Northern Ireland in 2016 for fewest shots since the group stage was introduced in 1980. While Scotland had 60 per cent possession against Hungary they failed to produce any decent chances in the final third. Clarke lashed out at officials after Stuart Armstrong was caught by Hungary defender Willi Orban in the box but the referee did not award a penalty and there was no VAR check. \"A 100 per cent penalty,\" the manager said. Scotland's early exit immediately sparked speculation around Clarke's future. The 60-year-old guided Scotland to back-to-back European Championship appearances for the first time since 1996 with a brilliant qualifying run that saw them lose just once to group winners Spain. But they arrived in Germany amid a poor run of form and that continued when they were crushed 5-1 by Germany in their opening match before rebounding to draw Switzerland 1-1.

England began their quest for a first European Championship trophy with two tepid performances against Serbia and Denmark that drew flak from former players turned pundits Gary Lineker, Rio Ferdinand and Alan Shearer, among others. \"I always feel like they have a responsibility,\" the England captain said on Sunday. \"I know they have got to be honest and give their opinion but also they have a responsibility of being an ex-England player that a lot of players look up to, that people do listen to them and people do care what they say.\" Kane, who said he is fully fit amid speculation about a back injury that bothered him late in the Bundesliga season, took a swipe at the pundits by noting they never won an international trophy during their careers. \"I would never want to be disrespectful to any player, especially a player who has worn the shirt and knows what it is like to play for England,\" said Kane. \"(But) the bottom line is we haven't won anything as a nation for a long, long time and a lot of these players were part of that as well and they know how tough it is.\" Despite their sputtering start, England lead Group C on four points ahead of Tuesday's final group game against Slovenia in Cologne.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider A former commando from Singapore, a national footballer from Indonesia, an AI expert from China — they are some of the Asian migrants eyeing new heights in the Middle East. The documentary Gulf Falcons tells their stories. Singaporean businessman Pach Ang, wife Vivien and daughter Sephina Christine getting ready for Lunar New Year guests in February in the United Arab Emirates. This audio is generated by an AI tool. ABU DHABI and RIYADH: As a former Singapore Armed Forces commando and founding member of the Red Lions parachute team, Pach Ang was no stranger to risk-taking after three decades of service. So after he hung up his chute and was exploring a new career, he decided to venture into the meetings, incentives, conferences and events (Mice) sector in Abu Dhabi, where he saw “a lot of potential”. He planned for a two-year stint to “see how it’d go”. Fifteen years on, the company he founded, RedFilo Events, has won numerous awards to become a key player in the United Arab Emirates’ events space. Today, the 62-year-old feels he might not have enjoyed the same success if he had established his business in Singapore. “In one single exhibition, you can have up to 5,500 exhibitors from … 190 countries coming here,” he said. “Everybody wants to be here in Abu Dhabi doing that event because this is the hub. You can see there’s a sudden influx … in the Mice industry, lots of conferences (and) major conferences like COP28.” Living in the capital, he has had a ringside seat for the UAE’s transformation into a commercial hub in recent years. And he has been joined by more South-East Asians and East Asians seeking opportunities. They are moving to not only the UAE, but also the other oil-rich countries in the Middle East nicknamed the Gulf Falcons after the bird that has long been synonymous with the region. As these Gulf states diversify their economies amid the global transition from the fossil fuels that have brought them wealth for decades, they have gone all out to attract talent to help build new engines of growth. Millions of Asian expatriates are now working in the Gulf. How are these professionals helping their host countries soar to new heights? What headwinds do they face? And will they stay for the long run? CNA documentary Gulf Falcons finds out what life is like for those who have made a home from home in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. One of the sectors the UAE has invested much of its oil revenue in is artificial intelligence. And one of the country’s AI experts is Hector Ren from China. “What I find most exciting about the UAE is the increasing awareness ... of AI among the government and business community and the swift adoption of these cutting-edge technologies,” he said. “We now see more autonomous cars on the streets and various innovations being used by different companies.” Notwithstanding the “vast” differences in culture and language between the UAE and China — which is the “biggest challenge” he faces living far from his loved ones — he has worked in Abu Dhabi for five years now. And he gets to feel a sense of “freedom” thanks to a long-term residency permit known as the Golden Visa. Introduced in 2019, it is offered to individuals in professions that are in demand in the UAE. They include athletes, computer scientists, data analysts, doctors, engineers and specialists in the arts and creative industry. To attract these foreign professionals to grow their careers here, the Golden Visa accords its holders benefits such as residency for up to 10 years, inclusion of family members and the flexibility to move in and out of the UAE. WATCH: How Asian foreign talent in Middle East is helping to build its post-oil economy (46:51) It is also not tied to an employer, unlike a traditional visa. “Traditional visas must be renewed every two years. This is a very cumbersome process. We need to undergo medical examinations and queue for a long time. With a Golden Visa, I needn’t go through these tedious procedures,” said Ren. “I can now work for myself, start my own business, without being bound to a single employer. It offers me full autonomy.” It has granted him the flexibility to work remotely, from his flat in the heart of the city and from overseas, even before the pandemic made hybrid work arrangements a norm. He has run multiple tech start-ups out of the UAE, on top of his technical advisor role at a local university. These enterprises not only generate revenue for him, but also keep him plugged into the country’s AI sector. The industry has grown especially since 2021, when the UAE launched its Operation 300 Billion strategy aimed at increasing the industrial sector’s GDP contribution to AED300 billion (S$111 billion) by 2031. It includes the manufacturing of new technology, and both government and businesses have “increased their investments in digital transformation”, said Ren. Other nascent industries include digital health and aerospace engineering. Today, the non-oil sectors can account for more than 70 per cent of the country’s GDP, making its economy one of the most diversified in the Gulf Cooperation Council, which also comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. While the UAE may be one of the front-runners in the race to seize opportunities in a post-oil future, its neighbours are catching up, each with its own diversification plans that have drawn expats, entrepreneurs and investors to the region. In Saudi Arabia, these plans include Khawlani coffee beans, a variety of arabica beans. They are known for their rich aroma — a result of being grown on volcanic soil in the south-west of the kingdom. While neighbouring Yemen and Ethiopia have traditionally been more dominant players in the global arabica coffee market, Saudi Arabia is seeking to up its game. Its sovereign fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), is investing nearly 1.2 billion riyals (S$436 million) to transform the national coffee industry over a 10-year period, boost annual production from 300 tonnes to 2,500 tonnes and export Saudi coffee globally. To do this, the PIF is partnering the private sector to apply best practices in all aspects of coffee production, from harvesting to roasting. This is where Indonesian Amirrakhim Putrantyo comes in. Having established himself as a specialist roaster back home and then in Kuwait, he was recruited by a Saudi roastery about two years ago. He had heard about the kingdom’s plans for its coffee industry and decided to move. His job is to teach staff how to bring out the flavours in this beverage. Explaining how it can be done, he said changing the temperature of the coffee during roasting towards the end will determine its flavours. For example, the coffee becomes sweeter if its temperature is raised slowly. If the temperature is raised faster, the coffee will taste more acidic. What attracted Amirrakhim to Saudi Arabia was the relocation package. Firstly, the salary is “much higher” than what he earned in Indonesia as a coffee roaster. Like most employers in the kingdom, his provides free health insurance — plus a free visa, free accommodation and free transport, he cited. “It means (our) take-home pay (is) precisely (what) they put in the job offer,” he said, pointing out also that there is no personal income tax in Saudi Arabia. A growing coffee industry offers just a taste of the changes brewing across Saudi Arabia as part of its Vision 2030 diversification master plan. The kingdom also welcomes foreign collaboration to help shape nascent industries such as the creative sector. Take, for example, Manga Productions, a creative studio based in Riyadh. It produces animated films, video games and comics for local and international audiences using styles inspired by Japanese art forms such as anime and manga. With the mantra, “inspire the heroes of tomorrow”, the studio seeks to cater for a growing market in the Arab world, home to about 60 million anime viewers in 2022. Shota Mizutani, who spent more than nine years as a Japanese teacher at a local university in Riyadh before joining the studio, was “surprised that so many Saudi people were interested in Japan” when he first came to Saudi Arabia. “Japanese people don’t know so much about Saudi Arabia,” he said. “A lot of media talked about Arabs or Islamic countries kind of negatively.” He has since learnt that family ties and hospitality, for example, are “highly valued” in the kingdom, like in Japan and “maybe more than in Japan”. “We have a lot of similarities, a lot of things in common,” he said. Today, he teaches Japanese to Manga Productions’ staff, on top of his roles as a researcher and a liaison between Saudi animators and their counterparts in Japan. To replicate the quality and standards Japanese productions are known for, the company regularly partners studios in Japan. In facilitating these collaborations, Mizutani translates scripts, storyboards and correspondence between the two sides. “I’d like to be a bridge (between) Saudi Arabia and Japan, and … would like to introduce the beauty of Saudi Arabia to Japanese people as (much) as I’d like Saudi people to know about Japan and its culture,” he said. Through its Vision 2030 master plan, Saudi Arabia also aims to enhance the quality of life for its residents, both local and foreign. To this end it has taken steps to create a more welcoming environment for expats and investors. One of its civil reforms has been to give women new rights by, for example, lifting restrictions that prevented women from driving. Women have been allowed to go out in public without wearing a headscarf or the abaya, the black robes that have long symbolised Islamic piety. These changes represent a broader trend towards modernisation in the conservative kingdom. With women also no longer needing permission from a male guardian to travel, that mobility translates into the ability to enter the workforce, cited research fellow Clemens Chay at the National University of Singapore’s Middle East Institute. “But one should understand that because of the long-standing high level of conservatism in the kingdom, these changes can be rolled out in policy but not be accepted socially,” he said. “Society needs time to … digest the kind of policies that are, to (the people), considered revolutionary.” Still, the government has sought to empower women through training. This has helped lead to a rise in the labour force participation rate of Saudi women, from 20 per cent in 2018 to 36 per cent in 2022. The sports sector in particular saw a 150 per cent increase in women’s participation between 2015 and 2019 as restrictions on women taking part in competitive sport were progressively lifted. Today, the country has more than 6,000 registered female athletes, a number expected to grow as professional clubs and Saudi national teams ramp up training for women. This is what attracted Fani Supriyanto to Saudi Arabia last year. The Indonesian national team goalkeeper plays for Al Hmmah in the kingdom’s first women’s football league, working alongside locals and other international players to realise shared goals. “It’s exciting to see the government open up society and allow women to participate in sports. This provides opportunities for women to unlock their potential and work towards competing internationally,” she said. “Although we come from different countries, we’re united by the same objective. We all want to achieve results for our team. When we win, we celebrate together. When we lose, we share the disappointment. We support each other.” Saudi Arabia’s efforts to project inclusivity come ahead of the 2034 Fifa World Cup, the multi-billion-dollar project that it is set to land and that is emblematic of the Gulf Falcons’ ambitions to become, in football terms, global playmakers. The UAE, too, is starting to play a more prominent role on the world stage. Over the next decade, it seeks to establish itself as a global hub for plastic recycling. This fills a void left by China in 2018, when it stopped buying the world’s discarded plastics. The UAE intends to turn used polyethylene terephthalate, the plastic widely found in food wrappers and beverage bottles, into products that could be exported to the rest of the world. Chu Weijun, who runs a factory that recycles the country’s plastic waste, welcomes the challenge. “We have the experience; we can get the work done. If we’re expected to increase our output, we’ll reap increased economic benefits together,” he said. “It also provides social benefits for the UAE. Recently, more people have been coming to the UAE. This has led to more household refuse. … If we could help the government shoulder this burden, it’d also make the country’s environment cleaner.” Chu is part of a “close-knit” Chinese expat community in the UAE. They make up an estimated 4 per cent of the population and make him “feel at home”, he said. “You don’t feel lonely.” Following the pandemic, after months of a self-imposed lockdown, he joined a running club formed by the Chinese community in Dubai. More than an exercise routine, it has since become a celebration of camaraderie and common identity. “One benefit of being part of a running team is that it’s community-led. There are no fees; we’re all volunteers. At the resting point, we’ll share food and other supplies. We help each other and share our experiences,” he said. “We share tips on preventing injuries. We recommend good shoes and where to buy them at a cheaper price. We train for races together. We encourage carpooling if there’s space in someone’s car. … It’s really enjoyable.” As for Ang, the UAE’s cosmopolitan hive of activity has made him comfortable enough to express his Peranakan identity, which also serves as a networking tool. In 2021, he and his wife established Rumah Peranakan, a private dining experience. In opening up their dining room to guests from all walks of life and nationalities, the couple can bond with fellow expats. “Being Singaporean, especially Peranakan, we’re very into food. … You tell the stories about Peranakans through food,” he said. “I get to meet new people, learn new cultures from them. “Importantly, I make new friends. And some of the new friends that I make evolve into business.” The country has also become an attractive place for expats seeking to bring their loved ones along for the ride, he feels. “The way Abu Dhabi is designed is very similar to Singapore. It’s very safe. You have a lot of activities for the family. School is good here. (There’s) easy access, driving from one place to another,” he said. “(There’s) a great community — lots of Singaporeans, Malaysians (and) Indonesians who we’ve made friends (with) along the way. (Over the past) 15 years, I’ve had my own group (from the) Asian community. And we always do get together. “Never once (did) I feel homesick.” Watch the documentary Gulf Falcons here .

And geopolitical tensions mean the fight for resources is heating up. A magnetic plate, acting like an X-ray machine, can reveal the magnets in a smartphone — magnets with rare earths, a class of critical metals whose supply China controls. This audio is generated by an AI tool. KUALA LUMPUR/SYDNEY/SULAWESI: It is a question that major economies are deliberating: Can anyone break China’s hold on critical metals powering the world’s high-tech applications? These metals include rare earths, which are used in some of the world’s strongest permanent — and portable — magnets to date and which are essential for just about everything, from the newest gadgets to green technology such as wind turbines. They include other metals such as nickel, used in electric vehicle (EV) batteries to also move the world beyond fossil fuels. And as some countries are forced to look beyond China for these resources, some of the places that could help safeguard against supply chain disruptions are emerging in Southeast Asia, for example Malaysia and Indonesia. WATCH: Can anyone challenge China’s near monopoly on metals powering our tech? (46:30) Just last month, the Malaysian government announced that it was permitting a rare earths plant near Kuantan, Pahang, to continue importing and processing the material until 2026 instead of early next year. The plant, operated by Australian miner Lynas, covers 100 hectares, the size of almost 150 football fields. It is the world’s largest, and Lynas is now the largest processor of rare earths outside China. Lynas has said the plant could meet nearly a third of global demand, excluding China. “Malaysia is breaking (China’s) dominance of rare earths,” said foreign affairs and security analyst Collins Chong at the University of Malaya, who has been studying Malaysia’s strategic stake in this sector. But some people are worried about history repeating itself. In 1994, a rare earths processing plant in Bukit Merah, Ipoh — a five-hour drive from Kuantan — was shut down after it was blamed for birth defects and leukaemia cases (seven were fatal) in the local community. The plant, run by Japan’s Mitsubishi Chemicals, had no long-term waste facility, and radioactive materials were stored in rusted drums. This caused radiation leaks, contaminating the area. Mitsubishi Chemicals donated RM500,000 (S$145,000) to the local community as part of an out-of-court settlement and spent US$100 million (S$136 million) on the clean-up, which took years. A permanent facility for sealing off the waste was built decades later, in 2014. The incident is little known even elsewhere in Malaysia. WATCH: The Malaysian town still haunted by radioactive pollution 30 years after rare earths refinery shut (9:52) As the CNA series Power Scramble finds out, the world’s appetite for rare earth metals and tiny magnets — which China has had a near monopoly on for decades — has repercussions that are hidden in unlikely corners of the region. And recent geopolitical tensions, especially between the United States and China, mean the fight for such resources is heating up. Rare earths are a series of 17 elements that have similar chemical properties and so behave similarly. Their colour-expressing quality, arising from the ways they react to light, is one of the properties that make them valuable. These metals help to give smartphone screens their vivid colours. But it is rare earths’ magnetic properties that are making the world scramble for their supply. Magnets are essential to electric motors, which use magnetic attraction and repulsion to create continuous motion. For example, a magnet with neodymium — one of the most sought-after rare earths — added to it is at least 10 times stronger than one made of iron only. “When you make a magnet really powerful, you can afford to make it really compact,” said Veena Sahajwalla, the director of the University of New South Wales’ Centre for Sustainable Materials Research and Technology. Depending on the model, a smartphone could have up to five magnets per speaker, while the camera’s autofocus uses two to four magnets. With the magnets for the microphone and vibration motor, a smartphone could have up to 14 magnets. Neodymium is no rarer, however, than nickel, which is commonly found in the Earth’s bedrock. The rocks must be mined and crushed to a fine powder to extract the minerals in which both metals are trapped. But isolating neodymium from its mineral is when things get tricky. Rare earths tend to occur together — often, all 17 in the same ore — and as they are chemically similar, they are harder to process than other metals. “What makes (them) so ‘rare’ is the complexity of extracting them,” said Sahajwalla. While rare earth projects are spread across the world, China stands out, with 70 per cent of production last year. The US makes up 14 per cent, followed by Australia, Myanmar and other countries, US Geological Survey data showed. And even the US must export its rare earth raw materials to China before they can be used in the manufacture of magnets. “There are enough deposits in the world that can supply rare earths. But … the critical point is who controls the processing technologies,” said Marina Yue Zhang, an associate professor at the Australia-China Relations Institute, University of Technology Sydney. “China is the only country in the world that’s developed the capacity to cover the entire value chain of 17 rare earth elements. … China has developed the advantages in not just technology, but also waste management.” Lynas managing director and chief executive officer Amanda Lacaze told The New York Times in 2018 that there were “about 100 PhDs in rare earths working in applications inside China” — and none in the West. It is not only about brainpower but manpower. Zhang said: “In several research institutes related to rare earths processing, China has employed educated engineers (in the) thousands. So, no other country can compete with China on that front.” The labour-intensive process of separating rare earths is also dirty work that could harm environmental and human health, but China has decades of experience in running these operations, doing it more cheaply than other countries. If the West wants to set up processing plants on their own soil to separate rare earths, then time, money and effort would be needed for the infrastructure and safety measures. China’s domination of the rare earths supply chain does not stop at the processing but extends downstream. According to estimates, Chinese factories make as much as over 90 per cent of the high-strength rare earth magnets used in the world. Because of this ready supply, many electronics makers, whether for foreign or domestic brands, have located their manufacturing plants in provinces like Guangdong. What then leaves China are the finished, “Made in China” products, from smartphones to earbuds and more. “You may be surprised to learn that electronic products account for less than 10 per cent of the total magnetic material applications,” Beijing Magtech CEO Yoki Xu told Power Scramble. “Among other applications, the most important one is in automobiles. This part already accounts for more than 40 per cent. The next highest consumption is, for example, in energy-saving home appliances and some energy-saving lifts … and wind power generation. “Anything that needs to move has a motor. … And rare earth magnets have this ability to improve the performance of motors and help them save energy. So this usage is rapidly increasing every year.” WATCH: Inside a Chinese factory that makes the powerful magnets in our smartphones (4:08) The rare earth magnets in an electric car, for instance, can amount to as much as five kilogrammes, she cited. But the growth of EVs may not even compare with the need for magnets in the wind turbine sector. The permanent magnet required for a wind turbine would be in the tonnes. And China is building offshore wind power capacity at a breakneck pace. The country’s operating offshore wind capacity last year — almost half the world’s total — claimed the global top spot for the first time, surpassing Europe. China’s newly installed capacity last year was about double that of Europe, reported Nikkei Asia. All that infrastructure will require more resources than what China can extract from its mines. In fact, Beijing is now the biggest importer of rare earths, specifically in their raw material form. Cities round the world need to shift to low-carbon energy too. “We won’t transition without a really good supply of rare earths,” said Allison Britt, the director of mineral resources, advice and promotion at Australian government agency Geoscience Australia. “We’re going to need seven times more than we currently use, which is quite an extraordinary amount of growth.” Even as demand is set to skyrocket, including for use in defence equipment, China announced tighter export controls last week over rare earths, requiring firms to report transactions and export destinations. This comes against a backdrop of increasing Sino-American rivalry, with the US Congress passing the Chips Act last year to cut off the sale of high-end chips and related technology to China. Beijing has “used rare earths as a weapon” before, pointed out Chong. In 2010, following a dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyutai islands, China halted these exports to Japan before resuming them eventually. “It showed that (rare earths) can be used as a convenient strategic tool by China, to serve its national interest,” he said. “And this shows the need for countries to ensure that they aren’t beholden to certain countries.” Having learnt its lessons from the 2010 incident, Japan has invested in Lynas “to ensure a long-term, resilient supply chain” for rare earths. The company mines the metals in Mount Weld, Western Australia — which holds “one of the best rare earth materials in the world”, said Chong — processes them in Malaysia, where “it’s more cost-effective”, and exports the eventual products to markets worldwide. The plant near Kuantan has been processing rare earths for more than 10 years, which also involves processing radioactive materials contained in the ores. And the International Atomic Energy Agency has said Lynas meets all the requirements for radiation safety. But Malaysian Nature Society (Pahang) chair Noor Jehan Abu Bakar is worried because a permanent disposal facility for low-level radioactive waste is being built only now, “after a lot of protests from the local community”. “There’s already been exposure for more than 10 years,” she said. While there has been no evidence of people falling sick, she attributed her worries to “what happened in Bukit Merah in the late 80s and 90s”. Lynas, however, says the comparisons are unscientific as the Bukit Merah residues had 50 times the radioactivity that Lynas residues have. Chong, too, dismisses the idea that history will repeat itself in Kuantan. “This is an entirely different setting, and Lynas has proven itself to be strictly adhering to all the regulations in place,” he said. What is now breaking ground in Malaysia is rare earth mining itself. Last year, a rare earth mine in Perak was approved as a pilot project. The northern state’s deposits were estimated last year to be worth US$20 billion, while the estimated worth of Malaysia’s total reserves is RM809.6 billion. “In Malaysia … there’s a lot of new guidelines to be created so that rare earth mining is safe,” said Damien Thanam Divean, the president of the Association for the Protection of Natural Heritage of Malaysia. But there are miners who do not want to wait for laws to be drafted, as evidenced by the illegal mines that have been uncovered this year. One of the mines is in Kuala Pilah district, Negeri Sembilan, where an investigation is under way. Damien, who has closely followed this problem of illegal mining, said the Kuala Pilah operation extended “a few kilometres inside the forest” and used pipes and toxic acid to pump rare earths out of the ground. “The quality of the pipes is very questionable. We don’t know whether these pipes were manufactured for such an operation. There’s a high risk of toxic acid … leaking into the ground.” He also fretted that the pond where the waste was stored was “not a proper pond”, compared to the “purpose-built” mine in Perak, where the pools have a “proper cement base” and an alarm system to detect any leaks. So far, no illnesses have been reported in Kuala Pilah. But the illegal mine, which authorities have sealed off, is surrounded by palm oil plantations, and if the operation had continued, it “would’ve definitely damaged the harvest”, he added. Quite how many illegal mines are still running and escaping detection is not clear, but he knows a handful “have been busted” and “Chinese nationals have been arrested, from mine owners to labourers”. Worries about environmental damage caused by rare earth mining have surfaced in China too. Since 2016, China has intensified efforts to clean up the industry and closed many toxic mines in Ganzhou, known as its “rare earth kingdom”, in the southern province of Jiangxi. WATCH: From Malaysia to Myanmar — Paying a price for world’s rare earths demand (46:35) But this, along with worries about dwindling deposits, meant China needed new sources of raw materials. And mines have popped up in places where the regulatory regime is not as rigorous. One of them is neighbouring Myanmar, which has rich deposits. Thousands of people have crossed over to set up and work in its new mines, bringing with them the money, technology and equipment to keep supplying China with rare earths. And since the military coup in 2021, it has been reported that illegal mining has surged. “There’s a lot of activists around there now. They’ve been (keeping track), and we know that that’s illegal mining,” said pro-democracy activist Lewis Myihtoi. “The mining companies … don’t get permits. When they (mine) illegally, they don’t have to pay all the costs — the legal costs, all the consultations, all the right procedures. So they can cut costs.” Tun Aung Shwe, the Myanmar civilian government’s representative in Australia, said the illegal mining area in Kachin state, which borders China, could be “equivalent to the size of Singapore”. “These (mines) are owned by Chinese business firms and local owners,” he added. “Because of the illegal practices, Myanmar rare earths are really cheap for China. Pools of toxic material in Kachin can be seen in Google Earth imagery. These are lined with plastic sheets, which could tear or corrode over time. “And that’s exactly what happens,” said Jonathan Liljeblad, an associate professor at the Australian National University College of Law. “Then the chemicals leach out, into the soil, the groundwater. “It has severe consequences that include cancers, like bowel, kidney and brain tumours. It also impacts the heart and … has been found to affect pregnancy and fertility.” A mine worker told Myanmar journalist “Naing” (names withheld) that when the chemicals come into contact with his skin, he gets a rash and develops swelling. Personal protective equipment is provided, but “not proper ones”, he said. He added that he was paid in Chinese currency, at a daily rate of 130 yuan (S$24) as a “casual worker”. The locals, meanwhile, are facing a shortage of drinking water because of the pollution, according to a Kachin villager, who added: “Previously, we could eat the river fish we catch here but not any more.” “The outside world hardly knows what’s happening,” he said. “The (military-backed) Border Guard Force is very strong. They use their power to silence people. Everyone is afraid.” Media reports, for example in the Associated Press, have said the illegal mines are in areas controlled by junta-linked militia, which means the rare earth profits the junta gets from the militia “may be fuelling a violent crackdown against civilians”. This is why illegal rare earth mining worries activists such as Myihtoi. “That’s how (the military forces) get all the weapons. And then back to killing us,” he said. The environmental and human costs of the exploitation of raw materials sometimes also get neglected when it comes to battery production. It is a market China dominates too. Six of the 10 largest EV battery makers are Chinese companies, and the country accounts for more than 70 per cent of market share by shipments. WATCH: Is a new US-China trade war brewing — over batteries? (46:54) China is not, however, the largest source of nickel, which is becoming a core part of EV batteries. Instead, the world’s largest nickel miner is Indonesia, which accounts for about half of global production. And the skyrocketing demand for battery components has reverberated across the archipelago, even on the island of Wawonii off the coast of Sulawesi. Roughly the size of Singapore, the island is dotted with fishing and farming villages — whose tranquility has recently been disrupted by nickel mining. “It’s destroyed our main water sources,” said farmer “Ismail”, who plants cashew nuts and nutmeg and supplements his income by fishing. He spoke to the programme Insight on condition of anonymity. “The water … is needed for our plantations. Since it started becoming polluted with mud, I’ve had to ferry clean water from another place, quite far from where I live, using my motorbike.” The mines are operated by Gema Kreasi Perdana, which has secured mining concessions covering 1,800 hectares on the island. During the dry season, “nickel ore dust flies everywhere”, said Andi Rahman, the director of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment’s Southeast Sulawesi chapter. This is an important issue because dust covers leaves — which stops photosynthesis. And it is happening on Ismail’s farm, so he is potentially facing “another harvest failure”, he lamented. Then there is the issue of land rights; in parts of rural Indonesia, land ownership is often murky. “Land disputes are always a big problem in the mining areas,” said senior fellow Siwage Dharma Negara of the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute. “The government gives the concession or permit to the mining companies to operate, but in many cases, … the concession area (is already occupied by) a certain community.” The dispute in Wawonii has sparked demonstrations, riots and, in some cases, armed confrontations as villagers asserted their land rights. “Until now there’s no clear certainty over what their rights are, as their land’s been forcibly seized by the nickel mining company,” said Andi. Indonesian Nickel Miners Association secretary-general Meidy Katrin Lengkey cautioned against generalising the situation, however. “Companies aren’t careless,” she said. “There are people who claim the land belongs to them even though it belongs to the state. This means (the mining companies) must compensate for their ‘losses’. The story of Wawonii reflects what is happening across the globe — a battle to secure critical metals. Just this week, when the US and Indonesian presidents met for discussions, a potential minerals partnership focused on nickel was on the agenda. Will sustainability always be a priority, however, as demand grows? That is a question that will bear on the lives of more and more people in the region going forward.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Billions of dollars have been invested in green technologies in China. But at the same time, the country is building more coal power stations. The programme Insight explores why this is the case and what resolutions are in sight. The molten salt solar thermal power station in China’s northwest Gansu province. It is known as the “super mirror power plant”. This audio is generated by an AI tool. GANSU, China: Chinese farmer Wu Wenju lives in a little house that is unassuming except for the 48 solar panels installed on its roof, glistening in the midday sun. His family own a cotton and sheep farm in a village in Dunhuang, Gansu province. And the solar panels provide an additional source of income: A power company installed them for free and rents the roof space from the family. The electricity generated is connected to the local grid but is also made available to the family, free of charge. “Normally, our … electricity consumption is about 100 yuan (S$19) per month,” says Wu. “We can save about a few hundred yuan a year now.” Not all the families in his village have installed solar panels at this point, but more are warming to the idea. Indeed, in the past few years, more villagers across China have done something similar. Through the government’s Solar Energy for Poverty Alleviation Programme (SEPAP), announced in 2014, home owners lease their roof and land to solar companies. The electricity generated is sold to the grid, with profits shared with the home owners. He Jijiang, executive deputy director of Tsinghua University’s Research Centre for Energy Transition and Social Development, described this programme as “one of China’s signature energy transformations”. “(Photovoltaics) are built in the poorest villages, and income generated from the power stations is reserved for the villagers to address poverty issues,” he said. SEPAP has benefited more than 400 million people, according to China’s National Energy Administration. And by 2020, the programme increased national solar power capacity by 26 gigawatts, exceeding the initial target of 10 gigawatts. This April, China’s solar capacity reached 430 gigawatts, which is triple that of second-placed United States, with 142 gigawatts. China has invested heavily in other renewables too. In 2012, the country saw US$67.7 billion (S$90.2 billion) of clean energy investment. A decade later, this shot up to US$546 billion. Today, China is the world’s biggest producer of renewable energy, and not only solar energy. It has more than 4,300 wind farms in operation or development. Last year, these generated 46 per cent more wind power than all of Europe, the second-largest wind generation market. Despite these achievements, there are inherent contradictions. China is the world’s biggest climate polluter and permitted more coal power stations last year than any time since 2015. Why is this the case? The programme Insight finds out the true story of China’s green energy revolution and whether the world has something to worry about. WATCH: China’s contradiction: World’s biggest clean energy producer and biggest polluter? (45:21) China’s green energy push had its roots in air pollution. “If you were here back in 2013, you probably had to wear masks, not because of COVID but because of the (air pollutants),” said Ma Jun, former chief economist of China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China. Ma, who is now the president of the non-profit Institute of Finance and Sustainability, helped draft China’s first green finance guidelines. He noted that dealing with pollution — not only air but also water and land pollution — required “a lot of money”: About 4 trillion yuan yearly. But experts attribute China’s growing motivations to economic reasons as much as the environment. While more than 80 per cent of the world’s solar cells are made in China today, there was no domestic market at the start. “It was mostly the European demand that triggered China’s investment in the whole renewable energy sector,” said Hang Seng Bank (China) chief economist Wang Dan. It was in 2006, with the start of the European photovoltaic market and the support of a series of European policies, when China’s photovoltaic cell industry’s technology began to advance. Back then, China bought raw materials from overseas and used foreign technology to process photovoltaics domestically before exporting them. “Because of the lower costs in China, … (Chinese photovoltaic companies) could quickly become profitable and raise the funds for rapid factory expansion,” said Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore chief executive officer Armin Aberle. Perhaps most emblematic of China’s green investments is Dunhuang’s molten salt solar thermal power station, known as the “super mirror power plant”, on the doorstep of Wu’s village. Built at a cost of 3 billion yuan, it covers 7.8 square kilometres in the Gobi Desert — the size of almost 1,100 football fields and the largest of its kind in China. The 100-megawatt station can generate over 2.3 million kilowatts per day, enough to supply electricity to Dunhuang city for a whole day, said its general manager, Liu Fuguo. The station uses 12,000 photovoltaic mirrors to concentrate and reflect sunlight onto a receiver tower. Molten salt is pumped into the tower and then heated. Whereas conventional photovoltaics convert sunlight into electricity, which means the electricity generation stops once the sun has set, the station’s technology is different, according to Liu. “During the day, the electricity generation process collects and stores the heat,” he said. “After the sun sets, the stored heat continues to generate electricity.” Even as China constructs clean energy projects such as Dunhuang’s solar thermal power station, it is responsible for about 30 per cent of global emissions, largely because of its dependence on coal. China is also building more coal power stations than any other country. Last year, it produced a record 4.5 billion metric tons of coal, Reuters reported . Despite its clean energy investment, experts note that coal is still the lowest-cost energy option in China today. “China sits on huge reserves of coal,” said Aberle. “It doesn’t want to import energy from other countries; it wants to use as much local coal as possible. … That’s why coal is so attractive.” Clean energy generation, added Wang, is also “mostly intermittent”, which means there is no better alternative to coal power for heating. “(You) need to have continued sunshine or continuous wind blowing in order to generate enough of the (power) supply,” she said. “If you build one more power plant using solar or wind, you almost have to build a separate coal power plant in order to stabilise the power supply. “So a coal power plant in many areas of China is simply a necessity.” Moreover, in China, economic growth “dominates everything”, and the environment “comes second”, said Aberle. “I don’t think they’re ready to serve as a global role model in the sustainability arena.” Nonetheless, the Chinese are optimistic about emissions reductions and that they can reduce their dependence on coal. Describing its current energy mix as “a situation in transition”, Ma said China’s determination “to move towards net zero is the strongest in the world”. How quickly China can wean itself off coal may come down to clean energy cost reductions. The cost of photovoltaic power per kilowatt-hour in China is now “significantly lower” than the cost of coal power, said Tsinghua University’s He. “In the next step, China’s photovoltaics will continue to increase and reduce its dependence on coal.” Over the past decade, Longi Green Energy Technology — one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers — has invested about 20 billion yuan in research and development, according to Huo Yan, its general manager for branding and head of global marketing. As a result, the price of its solar silicon wafers has gone down from about 100 yuan in 2012 to 3 to 5 yuan now, he said. “The cost of photovoltaic energy has decreased significantly in the past decade owing to Longi’s innovations. Currently, photovoltaic energy is the cheapest source of energy in many countries.” Longi also set a record last year for silicon cell efficiency, which measures how much of the sun’s energy is converted into usable electricity. The higher the cell efficiency, the more power it produces, lowering the unit cost of electricity. While China has made a long-term commitment and its bet on clean energy appears to be paying off, its dominance has some countries worried. Wang pointed to anti-dumping and anti-subsidy programmes implemented by the US and Europe since 2012, which has resulted in more restrictive measures against China’s exports. Next year, the US will expand import duties on photovoltaic products originally from China. Import tariffs have been added “many times”, Tsinghua University’s He highlighted. “The US wants to protect its own photovoltaic companies, because the US cost of production of photovoltaics is much higher than China’s.” The European Union, meanwhile, has plans to ban products made with forced labour, with solar panels made in China’s Xinjiang province central to such a ban. All this prompted Beijing to hit back earlier this year with the threat of a ban on solar technology exports. According to reports, China currently controls at least 75 per cent of every stage of the industry’s global supply chain. In the first half of this year, China’s solar panel exports reached a capacity of 114 gigawatts, well on the way to eclipsing the 164 gigawatts it exported the whole of last year, according to energy think tank Ember. China’s half-year exports are equivalent to the total installed solar capacity in the US. “China feels it has to flex its muscles — ‘and if you do that to me, I do this to you,’” said Aberle. There have been breakthrough moments. In July, US climate envoy John Kerry visited Beijing to restart climate talks, which China had cut off last year in protest at then US Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. This shows that the US is “willing to continue the communication and collaboration with China” on the climate change front, said Wang. “It’s still a positive sign for China because that door isn’t completely closed.” Last month, Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping also agreed that negotiations on renewing a decades-old science and technology agreement, which allows for co-operation in R&D between the US and China, would start. Beyond geopolitics, there is a domestic political impetus for China’s green energy revolution. According to the European Investment Bank’s 2019-2020 climate survey , 73 per cent of Chinese think climate change is a major threat to society, compared with 47 and 39 per cent of Europeans and Americans respectively. Chinese authorities have spent a “tremendous amount of money” pushing companies to adopt clean technology and reduce their use of coal and other polluting technologies, said Wang. “For a lot of local governments, this is part of their evaluation.” “The political leaders are very aware that pollution in big cities or some regions can cause dissatisfaction, and mass protests even,” said Aberle. “So I think they like this idea of pushing the green energy revolution and thereby fighting local pollution in China.” Today, there are also green regulations in place for new buildings and construction projects. For example, it is mandatory for new buildings to have solar energy systems installed, while carbon emissions from new civil buildings must be 40 per cent lower than 2016 standards. Amid the concerns and contradictions in China’s green revolution, what can be found in the country is consensus on climate change. “I believe (climate change) is something that every human being should pay attention to,” said Tsinghua University student Zhang Jie. Her fellow student, Zhou Dao, added: “Every student (in China) who’s gone through primary and secondary education will have some understanding of climate change. “We should have a common responsibility and not differentiate between people when it comes to environmental protection.” Watch this episode of Insight here .

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider As travellers flock to the island possibly in record numbers this year, the programme Insight explores what lies behind the locals’ love-hate relationship with tourism and what can be done to stem the feelings of discontent. The traditional village of Penglipuran in the east of Bali now attracts thousands of people a day. This audio is generated by an AI tool. BALI: The resort island of Bali has been called by many names, from the Island of Gods to the Morning of the World. To many, it is simply paradise. But its free and easy atmosphere may not be quite what it was. In February, the local government launched a new tourism police unit to deal with problematic foreign and domestic tourists. It has handled drunk tourists and even those who beg for money. “They must’ve been running out of resources and then turned to begging. There are cases like that,” said Dewa Nyoman Rai Dharmadi, the head of Bali’s Civil Service Police Unit. “Sometimes there are locals who disturb tourists at places of interest. Basically, we remind everybody to create a conducive atmosphere for all tourists.” More than 70 tourism police officers have been deployed in popular districts, such as Canggu, Seminyak and Kuta. Part of their job is also to ensure that tourists dress appropriately — for example, by wearing sashes provided — in the temples of Bali, the only Hindu enclave in Indonesia. “Because of their ignorance, they don’t follow the rules when entering sacred places,” said Dharmadi. In this slice of paradise, discontent is brewing. Last May, Bali’s then governor, Wayan Koster, proposed a cap on visitor numbers, citing misbehaving tourists as the reason. Although the proposal did not materialise, the island continues to grapple with its status as Indonesia’s most popular tourist destination. Last year, Bali deported 340 foreigners, up from 188 in 2022, mainly from Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Nigeria. Their violations included overstaying, working illegally and exposing themselves in sacred places. In December, after a video of a payment dispute in a beauty salon went viral, two female tourists — an American and a Bermudian — were arrested for allegedly attacking salon staff, then deported in February, according to local police. Earlier this year, police arrested three Mexicans for an alleged robbery that left a Turkish tourist wounded. As travellers flock back to Bali after the pandemic, possibly in record numbers this year, the problem of overtourism has become more apparent than ever. Still, Bali wants to have more visitors to make up for lost time, and lost tourism receipts, when the pandemic laid waste to its economy. In 2021, only 51 foreign tourists visited the island, compared with 6.3 million in 2019. Last year, that number was close to 5.3 million, exceeding the target of 4.5 million. This year, Indonesia’s Tourism and Creative Economy Minister, Sandiaga Uno, has raised the benchmark to seven million, cited Bali tourism chief Tjok Bagus Pemayun. “That’s quite high,” Tjok told the programme Insight . “Hopefully, we can reach the target because many airlines have added flights to Bali.” The influx of tourists is not just giving rise to occurrences of misbehaviour, however. It is putting a strain on resources and tarnishing Bali’s image because of rampant development, overcrowding and gridlock. WATCH: Bali’s love-hate relationship with tourism on Indonesian island paradise (46:24) Bali made headlines in December when a traffic jam on a toll road forced people to walk up to four kilometres to the airport. There are also constant jams on roads leading to places of interest. With a population of 4.5 million, how many tourists can the island accommodate, questioned Nyoman Sukma Arida, a vice dean of the tourism faculty at Bali’s Udayana University. “Do we have enough land and water supply? Tourists need food and so on,” he said. The latest neighbourhood caught in a developmental dilemma is Canggu, after decades of tourist development spreading north from Kuta beach to Legian, then Seminyak. There are now concrete buildings on every street in Canggu. Developers are attracted by its relatively cheap land prices. But the area is “suffering from massive traffic jams”, said Sukma, because “there’s no master plan”. Locals such as traditional community chief Made Kamajaya, who was born and raised in Canggu, have a love-hate relationship with tourism. “The local people’s economy is getting better,” he said. “(But) our surroundings have changed. You’re seeing destruction behind your house, in front of your house. … We’re dealing with uncontrolled development, of which almost 90 per cent disregards the environment. “There’s no desire to plant trees. Waste management is non-existent.” He is worried that “all the unregulated infrastructure projects will threaten tourism itself”. Even the rice terraces of Jatiluwih in central Bali — a Unesco World Heritage Site and one of the reasons tourists visit the island — are at risk of urban encroachment. “There are always new developments,” said tour guide Wayan Kaung. “The process is slow. Usually, it starts with a small hut selling coconuts, and slowly it turns into a restaurant.” He brings tourists to Jatiluwih at least four times a week. Foreigners pay 50,000 rupiah (S$4.20) as an entrance fee, while Indonesians pay 15,000 rupiah. “This is valid because I’ve seen rice field destruction near my home. There are many housing complexes, and the regulation of land conversion is unclear. So we must pay to protect something like this,” he said. But it does not protect the rice fields completely. A 2018 report from the Amsterdam-based non-profit Transnational Institute estimated that Bali was losing 1,000 hectares (1,400 football fields) of agricultural land to development every year in the preceding 15 years. According to a recent study by Udayana University agriculture professor Wayan Windia, the island is experiencing a deficit of 100,000 tonnes of rice per year. As much as 65 per cent of Bali’s groundwater goes to the tourism industry, drying up more than half of the island’s rivers and threatening sites such as Jatiluwih. For some farmers, it is more lucrative to sell their land to developers than to eke a living in agriculture. “So long as there’s a good view, there’ll be an opportunity to build villas,” said Kaung. “If one person sells his land for villa construction, others will jump on the bandwagon because of the access road.” Some of the remaining farmers supplement their incomes by making handicrafts. “Because of the opportunities offered by tourism, villagers work hard to make handicrafts. But they get only a small amount of money. It isn’t fair. That’s what we want to address,” said Agung Alit, the founder of Mitra Bali. His social enterprise buys and sells handicrafts from these Balinese artisans. “We invite the craftsmen to work together. We give a 50 per cent down payment, then when the goods arrive here, we check them, we select and pay cash,” he said. The irony of the situation — that Bali is so dependent on the tourism said to be destroying the island — is not lost on him. “Tourism is ingrained in Bali,” he noted. “And it’ll be a challenge changing it.” Elsewhere, towards the north of Bali, Lake Tamblingan is becoming increasingly popular with tourists. It was formed from an ancient caldera, surrounded by a rainforest called Alas Mertajati. The lake and the forest help to protect water resources for the indigenous communities, who are mostly farmers. They grow coffee, oranges and vegetables. The forest has a nature tourism zone, which allows investors, and a designated protected zone. “We’ve seen illegal logging, which affected the forest,” said indigenous leader Putu Ardana. “We don’t want that.” He is working with the locals to protect the forest. They are lobbying the government to return stewardship of the forest to the villagers. To do so, the government must first recognise the indigenous tribes’ ancestral rights to the land. Putu has some “harsh” criticism, however, of the government and of investors. “The government treats Bali like lucrative merchandise. Investors offer funds, and the government offers regulations, permits and so on,” he said. “It shouldn’t be the concept of selling (but of) preserving.” Culturally, tourism money and interest over the years meant more funds for the upkeep of temples and to hold traditional ceremonies. But some people question whether the pageantry loses its authenticity when put on for a show. Rucina Ballinger, co-author of the book Balinese Dance, Drama and Music, calls it “cultural degradation” when there is “very little understanding” on tourists’ part. “(On) the Balinese side, it’s when … they tell (visitors) to go and see these tourist performances, as opposed to ‘go to a warung — a little food stall — sit down, talk to the locals, have a cup of coffee and learn about their life,’” she said. “Tourists are coming, and they’re … taking pictures. It’s an Instagram culture, it’s ‘let’s go to the beautiful spot’. And now all of these places are making Instagram spots for the tourists. And some people come here just to do that.” For tourism consultant Lenny Pande, art, culture, tradition and the environment are the four pillars of tourism and are important “because those pillars exist in Hinduism in Bali”. But she, too, has observed that “the preservation of those pillars is slightly diminishing” because of overdevelopment. As concern over the impact of overtourism grows, the government has promised a more sustainable future for Bali. Last July, outgoing governor Koster issued new guidelines on Bali’s development for the next 100 years (2025 to 2125), which cover the protection of nature, culture and the Balinese people. For the first time, the government acknowledged the impact of mass tourism on Bali, citing land conversion, violations of sacred places, environmental damage and illegal businesses and activities as examples. “One of the concerns is that Bali is being sold as a cheap tourist destination. Hopefully, we can minimise that so we can do better for Bali in future,” said Tjok from the local tourism authority. “We want to have tourists who … respect Balinese culture. Secondly, we want tourists who are willing to stay longer. Hopefully, they’ll also spend more money.” Since Feb 14, the government has levied a tourist tax of 150,000 rupiah. The revenue collected is meant to preserve Bali’s cultural heritage and protect its environment. “The environment is our big house. The guidance from the top is to use the levy to deal with the waste problem,” said Tjok. As for traffic management, the measures being taken include the construction of new underpasses. There are also plans for a Light Rail Transit system. The forces of tourism may prove too strong, however, for some government plans. In January, a proposed entertainment tax of up to 75 per cent met with fierce resistance in the tourism industry. The steep tax has since been put on hold. Last May, Koster announced a ban on tourist activities on all 22 of Bali’s sacred mountains, blaming tourist misbehaviour. But activities continued, and the ban is as good as axed. With the lure of tourist dollars hard to resist for many, it could be up to local communities to preserve their way of life. In the village of Penglipuran, in the east of Bali, a customary law forbids villagers to sell their land to outsiders. The traditional village is popular among Indonesian tourists, who pay an entry fee of 25,000 rupiah per person. Tourists are allowed to enter family compounds to look around and buy snacks and souvenirs, so it can be intrusive. But the money collected from visitors — up to 5,000 a day — has proven useful in protecting the culture and livelihood of the 1,100-plus villagers. During the pandemic, around 3 billion rupiah was distributed among them. Deputy village chief Nyoman Setiawan is grateful that their culture is “still being upheld”. He said: “So long as our customs are strong, we’re convinced what happens to places like Denpasar, Kuta and Canggu won’t happen to us.” Indonesia’s tourism ministry says the future of Bali lies in such small-scale, sustainable initiatives. There is still a need, however, for authorities to first calculate “the carrying capacity of each zone and Bali as an island”, stressed Sukma the academic. “Next, they must empower the local communities to be involved in controlling what happens in their areas,” he said. “The problem is the communities are … involved only when problems arise.” As the post-pandemic revival of tourism continues at full steam for now, with every gridlocked motorway, every piece of rubbish thrown in the sea and every paddy field that disappears, a bit more of paradise is lost for some. “Bali is doomed,” said Ballinger, who is married to a Balinese and has two sons and three grandchildren. “There’s no way that these concrete jungles can be turned back into rice fields … or into something that’s Balinese.” With the growing attention on overtourism, however, some others see a chance for change. “If we respect and preserve our culture, other people will be respectful,” said Sukma. “Perhaps it’s the Balinese who are complacent. This is my reflection.” Watch this episode of Insight here . The programme airs on Thursdays at 9pm.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Some teachers lament the revamp of a school subject that sought to nurture independent thinkers, while others feel schools are merely playing catch-up in national education. The programme Insight examines the academic shake-out. Some teachers worry that they risk censure should class discussions run afoul of the law. This audio is generated by an AI tool. HONG KONG: She had been a teacher in Hong Kong for 17 years. But a year ago, Lo Kit Ling packed her bags and left for the United Kingdom. She was no stranger to 12-hour working days, but the load had become “abnormal” after the territory’s national security law came into force in 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic brought on other shifts. Lo is part of the recent wave of teachers in Hong Kong who have quit. Nearly 12,000 of them have done so since 2021, according to Education Bureau data in April. Previously an average of about 3,600 teachers resigned or retired annually at subsidised or government-run kindergartens and primary, secondary and special needs schools, reported the South China Morning Post. WATCH: Hong Kong’s teachers are leaving. Is the national security law behind it? (46:16) The figure rose to 5,270 (of 73,118 teachers) in the 2020-21 school year and shot up to 6,550 (of 72,374 teachers) the following year. While the Hong Kong Education Policy Concern Organisation — which advises the government on educational matters — stopped short of calling the resignations a crisis, chairman Mervyn Cheung acknowledged that the increase was “quite substantial”. It worries him, however, that the more experienced teachers are leaving. “Schools have to make do with … young teachers, who have yet to prove their interest and also capability in a school environment,” he said. Students have borne the brunt of teachers’ departures. Bernice Chang, who recently graduated from secondary school, experienced “quite a major turnover” of teachers. There were 12 different teachers in her four core subjects over three years, the 17-year-old recalled. This affected the students’ “learning efficiency”. In English class, for instance, “maybe the previous teacher didn’t properly hand over to the next one,” she said. “So the next teacher asked us to do the same paper again, which was a waste of time and effort.” But why are more Hong Kong educators quitting, the programme Insight asks. Scores of residents left after China passed the national security law in June 2020, which was aimed at tackling secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces in the territory. The law came after the 2019 pro-democracy protests. By the middle of last year, more than 202,000 residents had left for countries such as the UK, Australia and Canada, which eased pathways to immigration for people from Hong Kong. While teaching is considered a stressful profession with some degree of attrition, a survey conducted in 2021 found that 40 per cent of Hong Kong teachers planned or wanted to leave their jobs. Of this group, the majority cited “increasing political pressure” as the main reason. Dissatisfaction with educational policies was another reason, according to the Professional Teachers Union survey of 1,178 teachers. The union disbanded months later, citing “enormous pressure”. The national security law would transform the school curriculum. Under Article 9 of the law, the Hong Kong government shall take “necessary measures to strengthen public communication, guidance, supervision and regulation” on national security matters, including those relating to schools and universities. Under Article 10, national security education shall be promoted at schools and universities. One subject in particular came under scrutiny: liberal studies, introduced as a core subject to secondary school students in 2009. It was aimed at developing critical thinking skills through discussion of controversial topics but was singled out by pro-Beijing critics as stoking the radicalisation of youths in the 2019 protests. Lo, who taught the subject, disagrees. She feels it was made “a kind of scapegoat” for the social unrest. Liberal studies teachers “had to revise all teaching material (with) any potential to violate the national security law, … module by module, chapter by chapter”, she recalled. “So horrible.” The subject was revamped and, in 2021, renamed Citizenship and Social Development (CSD). Unable to bear “such suppression and restriction”, Lo uprooted and headed for England to “find a place (where) I can get back to (being) myself”. Last year, new CSD textbooks made the headlines for stating that Hong Kong was formerly an occupied territory, instead of a British colony. Explaining its stance in a statement in August last year, the Education Bureau said it did not deny “the history of the British occupation of Hong Kong”. “We must develop a correct understanding among students that, as a matter of fact, China has all along held the sovereignty of Hong Kong,” the bureau stated. “Though the British had implemented ‘colonial rule’ over Hong Kong since 1842, they did not hold the sovereignty of Hong Kong. Therefore, Britain did not have the right to allow Hong Kong to become self-governing.” WATCH: How Hong Kong textbooks changed after 2019 — “Liberal Studies” vs “Citizenship and Social Development” (10:09) On July 1, 1997, China officially resumed “the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong”, it added. The CSD curriculum has scrapped the parts on Hong Kong identity, said Johnny, who has taught the subject for 13 years and spoke on condition of anonymity. “It only allows students to understand the concept of being a Chinese citizen.” The revamp, he said, has changed the way the subject is taught. Whereas teachers could “gather different teaching materials to discuss social events with students” in the past, they now follow textbooks recommended by the Education Bureau. “Those textbook materials are sometimes like political propaganda, so the classroom discussions become homogenous,” he added. “Whether it’s Hong Kong or the mainland, we can only talk about the positive developments. … We can’t talk about the negatives.” Teachers will be “100 per cent safe” if they follow the textbooks, he said. “The problem is that students will ask the teachers for their views. If you can’t handle it properly, will students denounce you?” This has created an atmosphere where teachers and students find it hard to trust one another, he feels. “Suppression and concern are growing on campuses.” But some welcome the revamp. Previously “many” school leaders and teachers knew little about national education topics such as Chinese history and how the Chinese Communist Party came about, said Hui Wai Tin, a former lecturer in education studies at the Hong Kong Baptist University. Students should be nurtured to become not only “good citizens” of Hong Kong but also China, he said. National education “isn’t unique to Hong Kong”, noted Legislative Council member Regina Ip. The new curriculum aims at filling “the gaps (left by) what we failed to do in the past two decades” and promoting understanding of the importance and concept of national security. The Legislative Council’s education panel received “a lot of complaints about teachers hijacking the classroom to promote anti-China views and misrepresenting Hong Kong’s political system”, she said. Under the territory’s common law system, “people are free to do whatever they like” so long as they are “careful not to incite Hong Kong independence or (the) overthrow of Hong Kong authorities”, said Ip. “If national security is taught properly, there’ll be no limitation, no damage to freedom of expression or freedom of academic instruction,” she said. Hui added: “If the education is successful, they’ll become patriotic.” So, what does the future hold for Hong Kong’s education sector? There are reasons for hope or at least some breathing space, say some stakeholders. Along with the increased departure of teachers, there has been a decrease in student enrolment owing to the emigration wave and Hong Kong’s declining fertility rate, which stood at 0.772 births per woman in 2021. “The relatively large-scale departure of students from the local schools has helped the government to solve the so-called teacher shortage problem, because fewer teachers … are wanted these days,” said Cheung. The teacher-student ratio has also improved, he added. Ip said the Education Bureau is “promoting school mergers and the closures of some schools” that fail to attract students. “An industry shake-out is no bad thing in my opinion,” she said. “Hong Kong is a free-market economy. … We believe in survival of the fittest. I don’t think we should (be) maintaining schools just for the sake of providing jobs to teachers and headmasters.” At Tsuen Wan Trade Association Primary School, principal Chow Kim-ho has taken the changes in his stride. Although leading a team of less experienced teachers “can be challenging”, they are “ideal” when it comes to energy levels. “Hong Kong’s universities are continuously cultivating new teachers, so there’ll be a replenishment of the lost teachers,” he said. “Overall, I think this issue will have a soft landing.” Meanwhile, Johnny is weighing up all his options and mulling over migration, not for his sake but that of his child. “My original plan was to keep my mouth shut, focus on my work and stay here. I’ve built my profession here. I’ve built my network here. I feel attached to this place,” he said. His attitude changed after he became a parent. He wants his offspring to be able to “freely discuss” questions to get at the truth. “There’s a (heavy) price to pay (for leaving), but when you have children, you’ll think about their long-term development,” he said.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Malaysians took RM145 billion out of their pension fund to cushion the impact of the pandemic. More than half aged below 55 ended up with less than RM10,000 in their accounts. Is Malaysia facing a retirement crisis, the programme Insight asks. During the pandemic, some Malaysians emptied almost all their Employees Provident Fund savings that ordinarily could not be withdrawn before age 55. This audio is generated by an AI tool. KUALA LUMPUR: Norazlan Ismail can usually be found behind the wheel of his taxi. But in March, the 49-year-old set off on foot for the National Palace in Kuala Lumpur, from his home town in Johor. He walked 312 kilometres in six days to deliver a message to the King: to tell Malaysian lawmakers to hear the cries of people like him, in need of financial help. The father of five wanted the government to release monies from the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Malaysia’s compulsory savings scheme. With an income of around RM80 (S$23) a day, he found it tough to support his family. He had more than RM57,000 in his EPF account and hoped for a “last” round of withdrawals, after workers had previously been given dispensation to dip into their accounts to cushion the impact of the pandemic. But other than a few blisters, he has gained little in the months since his journey and still cannot afford much on his income from driving. “I’m just scraping by,” he recently told the programme Insight . “I need (money for) my daily expenditure, my children’s education. I also need to repay my loans. … Sometimes I don’t even have money to buy milk. “My marriage has collapsed because of it, and I need the money (in the EPF) to rebuild my marriage.” For many others, however, their EPF well is running dry. Between 2020 and last year, through four rounds of COVID-19 withdrawals, 8.1 million Malaysians took RM145 billion out of the pension fund. As early as February 2021, the EPF reported that about 30 per cent of members had emptied almost all their retirement savings in Account 1, which ordinarily cannot be withdrawn before age 55. By the end of last year, 51.5 per cent of members under the age of 55 — nearly 6.7 million people — had less than RM10,000 in their accounts. Based on the EPF’s calculations last year, only about 4 per cent of Malaysians could afford to retire. “It’s a reality today, to be honest,” said EPF chief strategy officer Nurhisham Hussein. “Some of our members do fall into poverty at retirement or even before retirement because they don’t have the capacity to continue generating the kind of income they need.” Despite this state of affairs, calls for a further EPF withdrawal have grown louder, by not only Norazlan but also opposition coalition Perikatan Nasional, as inflation pushes up the cost of living. After having vetoed this all year, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim proposed in the Budget two weeks ago a new EPF account that workers will be able to access flexibly during emergencies. As the details are worked out, and with the pandemic in the rear-view mirror, some questions also continue to be raised. Did the previous administrations make the right move in unlocking the EPF? Or is Malaysia facing a retirement time bomb? Is it a crisis that can be defused? What would happen if the pension funds cannot be replenished? WATCH: Very few Malaysians can afford to retire. What went wrong? (45:35) For those who drew down on their EPF accounts during the pandemic, it is not just a case of depleted funds now. There has been an opportunity cost: The interest their accounts would have paid from EPF investment earnings. Since 2011, the average return for EPF members has been 6 per cent a year. “For members who have money in their accounts, it’s one of the best investments that you can make. For members who don’t have any money in their accounts, it’s not working for them,” said Malaysia University of Science and Technology economist Geoffrey Williams. By making early withdrawals from the EPF, the poor have become poorer. There were, however, extenuating circumstances: The economy contracted, many small and medium enterprises shut down, and 580,000 middle-income households effectively fell into the B40 category, the bottom 40 per cent of the population. The poverty rate also spiked in 2020. “Critical times require critical action. I don’t disagree with whatever decision that had been made by (then PMs) Muhyiddin (Yassin) and Ismail Sabri,” said Lee Chean Chung, the communications director of Parti Keadilan Rakyat, which was in the opposition then. But others including Williams look on the decision as a “disastrous move”. “It’s not the government’s money in the EPF, it’s people’s own money. So they had to use their own money to look after themselves during the lockdowns because the government wasn’t giving them sufficient direct cash transfers,” he said. Institute of Malaysian and International Studies research fellow Muhammed Abdul Khalid did not mince his words. “(It) is the worst policy ever (that) the country has announced and implemented,” he said. “It’s irresponsible.” The government did allocate RM530 billion for eight stimulus and aid packages in 2020 and 2021. But as the pandemic wore on, government resources ran low. “Given the depleted resources that the country had during that time to assist the needy people, maybe this was one of the options — to tap (into) EPF savings — to alleviate their situation,” said Lee. “I don’t think the government would’ve been able raise enough money at a reasonable rate. So that’s why they made the decision — use your own money to save yourself.” The EPF is not running out of money, however. Its overall balance sheet remains healthy: Its asset size stood at RM925 billion at the end of 2019, and it ended last year with total investment assets of above RM1 trillion. “It wasn’t a financial problem for the EPF itself. The impact was more (on) the savings for our members, … especially for those in the lower rungs,” said Nurhisham. What the pandemic has exposed is a larger issue: Malaysians were just not saving enough. The basic savings target for retirement set by the EPF is RM240,000. Peter Yong, financial planner turned YouTuber — who co-founded financial education channel Mr Money TV — thinks that figure should be at least RM300,000 to RM350,000, “if you’re looking at the 20 years after retirement and a very thrifty retirement lifestyle”. But many Malaysians are nowhere close to these numbers. Just over half of EPF members aged 50 to 54 have less than RM50,000 in EPF savings. This translates into less than RM208 a month during retirement, spread over 20 years. Only “a little over half” of members contribute regularly to the EPF. “The other half don’t,” said Nurhisham. “You might contribute for three or four or five years, then you switch jobs, to something that doesn’t require you to contribute. EPF contributions — ordinarily, 11 per cent of monthly salary, with employers contributing another 12 to 13 per cent — are applicable to civil servants and formal employees in the private sector. Gig workers and freelancers are exempt, though they can make voluntary contributions. And for many, it is a bit of a challenge making ends meet, let alone planning for retirement, via EPF contributions or otherwise. According to survey results announced this week by financial comparison website RinggitPlus, 71 per cent of respondents save less than RM500 a month, and 55 per cent live from pay cheque to pay cheque. Making up for the EPF withdrawals by saving more is proving difficult. “Income isn’t growing as fast as it should’ve been, compared to the cost of living,” said Hafidzi Razali, a director at strategic advisory firm BowerGroupAsia. “We’re talking about a median salary of just RM2,600 (for formal employees). That’s very low.” While Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 8.7 per cent last year, and there are signs of recovery everywhere, “the growth is not yet inclusive”, said Muhammed, who was economic adviser to former PM Mahathir Mohamad from 2018 to 2020. “It’s not yet translated (into) the well-being of the people,” he said. “The share of wages (in) GDP — we call it compensation of employees — remains low.” Compensation of employees last year was 32.4 per cent of GDP in Malaysia and 36.6 per cent in Singapore. In high-tax countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, the figure is more than half of GDP. The problem in Malaysia is systemic, thinks Yong. “The government, over the years, failed to increase the living standards of Malaysians in terms of bringing in higher-value industries (and) jobs,” he said. “We may be involved with big companies, big brands, but low-skilled, low-cost (labour). And (for) the ones who are highly skilled, generally a portion of them will move to Singapore.” The government is now exploring ways to boost income. The minimum monthly wage was raised to RM1,500 in May last year, and for micro enterprises, it came into force this July. The government is also exploring a progressive wage model, and plans will be unveiled in future. “If done properly, this could be something (like what) is implemented in Singapore, where the wages are progressively increased,” cited Hafidzi. But this, along with some other policies, will not bear fruit anytime soon. “We can’t just say, ‘Let’s increase the wages of construction workers to RM3,000 tomorrow.’ The industry will collapse,” said Lee, who cited other economic restructuring being done to help workers. “The government, through the energy transition road map, through our national investment policy master plan, is trying to revive the economy, so that we can all move to a higher value-added economy. … But that’ll take some time.” It is becoming a race against time to rebuild Malaysia’s retirement kitty owing to the country’s changing demographics. “We’ll be going from ageing to aged to super-aged within a short span of 50 years,” said Nurhisham. “People like to say ‘ticking time bomb’, right? We’re seeing some of that happening today.” The EPF started in 1951, when Malaysia’s life expectancy was nearly 54 years. The savings withdrawal age has remained unchanged, but the life expectancy now is 75 years. “You live longer without money,” said Muhammed, who added that Malays will be the most affected by “old-age poverty”. According to EPF data as at May, the median EPF savings was RM47,385 among Chinese members, RM15,985 among Indian members and RM7,078 among Malay members, whose savings fell by the biggest proportion among the three ethnic groups following the pandemic. “It’s not healthy for a multiracial country,” said Muhammed. “(Old-age poverty) is going to get much worse. … The amount (of social assistance) that the government has to give is going to be much increased.” Some people have suggested higher EPF contribution rates. The latest Budget, meanwhile, included measures such as encouraging voluntary contributions and enhancing incentives for housewives. In March, Anwar had also put forward a proposal on the use of retirement money as collateral to secure bank loans in emergencies. But this has come under fire from several quarters such as the opposition. Malaysia’s household debt to GDP ratio is the second highest in the region after Thailand, pointed out Muhammed. “You want them to go and borrow some more? What’s the reason?” Raising the current retirement age of 60 years and increasing employment among the elderly can be other policy mechanisms to boost savings, suggested Nurhisham. But increasing the retirement age has its limitations. Those in their 40s and older would still have “little time left to work” to save at least RM600,000 for a “decent” retirement in Kuala Lumpur — a threshold calculated last year by the EPF — cited Williams. If large numbers of Malaysians retire without sufficient savings, the burden will also fall on the next generation and create a sandwich class. “The family system has started to break down because people are having (fewer) and (fewer) children,” warned Nurhisham. “So we’re starting to see that first wave of people who are having trouble in retirement really coming through.” There appears to be no quick fix or magic bullet that will solve the problem and turbocharge retirement savings. Nonetheless, he sees a window of opportunity for “reform” within the next 10 to 20 years. He added: “In terms of educating the public on the need for saving for retirement, … we have a receptive audience. People do realise the importance of it. It’s just whether they have the capacity for it.” Take, for example, 30-year-old Sukhvinder Singh, who delivers parcels to offices and residences in Kuala Lumpur. He earns up to RM5,000 a month, which is enough to support himself and his elderly parents — in contrast to the days of COVID-19 restrictions. He never made any EPF contributions before because of a lack of money, he said. But he has started to put money into his account voluntarily. His target: 30 per cent of income, although it has been a struggle. “Things are getting more expensive,” he said. “It’s difficult because I have to support my family. … (My parents) are the ones who brought me up, so what they want I give them. What I can’t give they’ll understand.” He is “not sure” what he can afford in future, but the EPF will remain important to him. “If I have money — more money — I’ll put (it) in the account,” he said. “Just let my money grow there.” While Norazlan, on the other hand, wishes that his EPF money was not locked up, poor financial planning was a reason why he did not have much money squirrelled away prior to the pandemic. Before he was a taxi driver, he worked as a chauffeur and bodyguard, bringing home RM8,000 per month. “I thought the good times would go on indefinitely,” he said. “That’s truly my mistake. “Whatever happens, I’ll still work hard to raise my children. … Meeting my daily expenditure will, of course, be very hard (work). But that’s my responsibility.” Watch this episode of Insight here . The programme airs on Thursdays at 9pm.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Taiwanese voters will go to the polls on Jan 13 to elect a new president. But there is much more at stake. The programme Insight finds out how global power rivalry is playing out on the ground. This audio is generated by an AI tool. TAIPEI: It is about 9 a.m. in Ruifang, the seaside district close to 40 kilometres north-east of Taipei, and fishermen have just returned from the sea. Their catch: Ribbon fish, caught off the coast of Taiwan, in the East China Sea. These fish can grow more than 2 metres and are a popular dish in Chinese cuisine. They are mainly sent to mainland China, says Huang Chih-ming, who heads the Ruifang District Fishermen’s Association. “The catch today is pretty good,” he observes. “Almost 500 kilogrammes.” But there is a cloud of uncertainty over their future. It was only last March when China lifted a ban on ribbon fish from Taiwan — a ban that coincided with the then United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei months earlier, affecting products from over 100 Taiwanese exporters. “There are fishermen starting to say, … today (the Chinese) ban ribbon fish, tomorrow they might ban groupers or pencil squids or everything else,” says Huang. “Then (the fishermen) will really have no clue about the future.” That is why he thinks the fishing community “might be more inclined” toward the Kuomintang (KMT) in Taiwan’s Jan 13 presidential election, since the opposition party “communicates better with mainland China”. “We don’t understand politics, but we want (to secure) our livelihood,” he adds. For some voters, China’s assertiveness has helped them decide otherwise. The ramp-up in China’s military flights around Taiwan, for example, has not gone unnoticed by aviation enthusiast Eric Chan. There were 380 incursions into Taiwan’s Air Defence Identification Zone in 2020 and nearly 1,630 incursions last year. “The more the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) oppresses Taiwanese, the more united the people of Taiwan become. This, in turn, becomes an encouragement to a certain political party,” says Chan, 54. He is referring to the incumbent Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has been in power since President Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016. The party, a strong proponent of Taiwan nationalism and autonomy, will be represented by William Lai Ching-te, 64. Opposing him is Hou Yu-ih, 66, from the KMT, which last held power between 2008 and 2016 and is regarded as the more Beijing-friendly party. The third option, the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), founded in 2019, is headed by former Taipei mayor Ko Wen-je, 64. For a while, the TPP had considered forming an alliance with the KMT, but the talks collapsed. As the campaign period kicks into high gear, both China and the US may be looming large in voters’ minds, the programme Insight finds. And the question arises: Will the Taiwanese elections be about choosing between the two powers? For their part, the candidates have made their respective party’s platform clear. Lai, who is Taiwan’s current vice-president, will continue Tsai’s “four commitments”, starting with a commitment to a “democratic constitutional order”, says the DPP’s international affairs director, Vincent Chao. The second commitment is to ensure that Taiwan and China “aren’t subordinate to each other”. The third commitment is to “resist encroachments on our sovereignty, or annexation”. “The fourth commitment is … that the future of the Republic of China will be decided by the 23 million people here on Taiwan,” says Chao, using the island’s formal name. WATCH: How Taiwan’s 2024 election could change its relationship with China, US (46:25) Because of the DPP’s position on cross-strait issues, the KMT says a vote for the incumbent is a vote for war. “Knowing that, presidential candidate Hou has put forward the three-D strategy,” says political scientist Tso Chen-dong, a foreign affairs adviser to the KMT. “First, deterrence: Taiwan must enhance its self-defence capabilities, … reducing the adversary’s willingness to invade and discouraging hasty warfare. Second, dialogue: The candidate advocates promoting cross-strait relations between the people of the Taiwan area and the mainland. “Third, de-escalation: Continuous interaction in functional matters between the two sides will help de-escalate future risk.” TPP secretary-general Chou Tai-chu, meanwhile, tells Insight his party “can’t just look plainly at the relationship between Taiwan and China — we also need to look at global relations”. “Caught in the middle, we need to also consider America’s feelings when we’re handling the cross-strait relations,” he says. “As the US-China relationship evolves, Taiwan needs to find a balance in between.” But this balance could become increasingly difficult to maintain, as Beijing still considers Taiwan a renegade province, and Chinese President Xi Jinping has not ruled out the use of force in pursuit of reunification. It has always been a difficult balancing act, “regardless of who’s in power in Taiwan”, says J Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior adviser on countering foreign authoritarian influence at the International Republican Institute. “We’ve had the administrations that leaned closer towards China, and that was also difficult for them because ultimately, the only guarantor of Taiwan’s security is the US.” From the DPP’s perspective, the US is “very important for Taiwan”, says Chao. “Our job is to … ensure that we have clear lines of communication with the US. We have a high degree of mutual trust (and) respect.” The party’s second concern is to ensure that “interests and values” remain closely aligned. He cites democracy and freedom as “what’s guided the baseline of our values in past years”. With US-China relations on shaky ground, however, some voters believe that Taipei’s growing ties with Washington are provocative. One of them is Feng Chien-san, whose family tree in Taiwan spans nine generations and whose forebears came from China’s Fujian province. The 64-year-old communications professor at the National Chengchi University (NCCU) is a member of a group of retired and active academics who advocate for Taiwan’s autonomy while maintaining an equal distance from China and the US. “Taiwan’s been strengthening its military and purchasing a lot of military equipment,” he notes. “This increases the hostility of cross-strait relations. We feel that this isn’t a good thing for Taiwan (and) for both sides and the world. “The US is using Ukraine to weaken Russia — this is what Defence Secretary (Lloyd) Austin has said himself. If the US has such plans, we’ll be worried if they use Taiwan to weaken Beijing. … Why should we be your proxy?” Most Taiwanese, however, view the US more positively than China — by a margin of nearly two to one, the Pew Research Centre found in 2020. Younger Taiwanese are especially likely to favour closer ties with Washington over Beijing. WATCH: How do the Taiwanese view America? The US factor in Taiwan’s 2024 elections (6:35) And young voters, who helped carry Tsai and the DPP to a landslide victory in 2020 — just after the pro-democracy protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong — could play a crucial role again in the coming elections. Wilson Chen, a third-year student majoring in political science at the NCCU, was in high school when he saw what was happening across the strait. Aged 22 now, he will be voting for the first time. “I feel China is governed by one person, and we’re unsure what his next steps are. The US is democratic — we’re certain that the elected leaders will follow the will of the electorate,” he says. “But (with) China, you won’t know what their leader will decide to do tomorrow.” If the KMT hopes to win, the party cannot ignore the youth bloc. Indeed, in September, Hou visited the US and during his visit called the country “Taiwan’s sincerest ally”. Visiting the US “seems like a norm” for Taiwan’s presidential candidates, observes Wang Yeh-lih, a political science professor at the National Taiwan University. “It’s almost as if … to tell the Taiwan voters loudly that ‘the US acknowledges me and is supportive of me’, and at least (has no) objection,” he says. The “original thinking behind the trip”, shares Tso, is to “convey the candidate’s personal stance and to illustrate Taiwan’s willingness to take on (our) responsibility in the Indo-Pacific region so as to enhance US-Taiwan relations”. Yet, there are voters who tire of the two-party system and the US-China dichotomy. This is where the TPP offers an alternative. Although the party is trailing in the polls, Ko is popular among those under the age of 40. “This is because Ko is rather straightforward,” says Wang. “He’s very different from other political personalities, … from the usual stereotypes of a political personality. “The main point is that many youngsters admire Ko’s style of doing things and personal charisma.” For many voters too, it is domestic issues that weigh on their minds, especially with Taiwan’s sluggish economy. They are faced with an increase in the cost of living, for example. While inflation in Taiwan is by global standards relatively low, the 2.95 per cent hike in prices in 2022 was the highest on the island since 2008. More recently, prices rose 3.05 per cent in October, a 15-month high. “The government tried to manage … the price (of) public utilities (as) most of the public utility companies are state-owned,” notes Kristy Hsu, the director of the Taiwan Asean Studies Centre at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research. “We’ve frozen, for example, the electricity price, gasoline price, and … that helped stabilise the prices.” Housing, however, remains expensive. According to the government’s rent index in June, rents in Taiwan were the highest since records began in 1981. Driven up in part by speculators, high property prices coupled with low wages are pricing young voters out of homes of their own. Take, for example, fresh graduate Tim Huang from Taichung city, who just found a job in Taipei. “Food and rental costs here are high,” he says. “When your income isn’t so high, you only manage to save a little. “Under such circumstances, it might not be quite possible to buy a property in Taipei city even after 10 or 20 years.” The presidential candidates have put forth plans to raise wages and control prices. The DPP’s Chao cites several initiatives Lai launched previously, such as regulatory changes for start-ups, including relaxing some financial restrictions and building regulatory sandboxes. “The second part is to really ensure that we can bring some manufacturing back to Taiwan as well, particularly … high-end precision manufacturing,” says Chao. The KMT’s Hou has proposed a “three-element policy”, the first of which is pay rises, cites Tso. “This has to be done through tax reduction — so the companies that can offer their workers a pay raise will receive tax reduction. According to the TPP, both its rival parties must be held responsible for the issue of low salaries. “If Taiwan wants to improve her economy and living standards, you need to let every industry and field prosper,” says Chou. “Our focus is all on the technological sectors now. … However, we also need to pay more attention to the traditional industries.” In facing its economic challenges, however, Taiwan cannot escape the turbulence of global power rivalry. The recent ban on the island's agricultural and fishery products illustrates how China has flexed its economic muscle. But this has had “limited impact” on Taiwan’s overall gross domestic product because agriculture accounts for a “very little share of our exports”, says Hsu. Instead, the pressure could be coming from the US and its Chips Act, which restricts the sale of advanced chips built with underlying American technology to China. Some chips made by Taiwanese firms fall into that category. “It’s something that US officials, trade officials and thinkers are also trying to navigate, … to reduce the impact on Taiwanese companies because it makes absolutely no sense for US sanctions to hurt their ally in Taiwan,” says Cole. As a solution to the challenges on both sides, all three parties in Taiwan want to diversify the island’s trading relationships. “If we have to face possible economic sanctions from mainland China, we’ll have to increase our competitiveness,” says the TPP’s Chou. One of those regions with investment opportunities is South-east Asia, says the DPP’s Chao. “We need to create incentives for businesses to look elsewhere. “But we need … trade incentives. And this is why the Tsai administration, over the past eight years, has had a robust focus on bridging new trade deals with important trading partners.” Still, China and the US are Taiwan’s biggest trading partners. And trade with the US, the island’s second-largest export market, remains on an upward trajectory. Hence the KMT advocates continuing the work on the US-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade and negotiating a Taiwan-US tax agreement, says Tso. As the presidential candidates continue to spar, a survey released on Dec 30 by pollster My Formosa showed 40 per cent of those polled were in favour of Lai, 28.5 per cent supported Hou and 18.9 per backed Ko. Beijing and Washington are not the only ones watching closely. “The rest of the world is certainly paying very close attention to any development, anything in Taiwan that could result in China deciding to ramp up the pressure,” says Cole. At stake is not only the fate of cross-strait relations but also regional stability. “The degree to which Taiwan is able to maintain its stability in its area … is useful and important for the region,” says National University of Singapore political scientist Chong Ja Ian. “Taiwan sits astride major sea lanes, major air routes and also submarine cables, so any disruption … will unsettle the links between North-east and South-east Asia.” If Lai were to win the election, the likely outcome is “four more years of greater tensions” in the Taiwan Strait, says Nanyang Technological University associate professor of social sciences Hoo Tiang Boon. If either Hou or Ko were to win, “then the conventional wisdom is that this would lead to a lowering of tensions because those two candidates would say things that’d be more pleasing to the ears of China”, he adds. For a few voters, the burden of being caught between titans might be weighing heavily on them. “No matter what decisions Taiwan makes, we have to consider how the US and China think. To be honest, I’ve (grown) very weary of this,” says Huang, an undecided voter. “It’s almost as if … we must observe their next steps to get feedback before making our next decisions. In the long term, this isn’t a good position to be in.” Watch this episode of Insight here . The programme airs on Thursdays at 9pm.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Amid geopolitical tensions, the term ‘de-risking’ entered the global lexicon last year, and China has lost billions’ worth of investment. The programme When Titans Clash looks at the trends and what lies ahead for the Chinese economy. Chinese workers on an assembly line making robot vacuums. In some other companies, it is the end of the line for their manufacturing operations in China. This audio is generated by an AI tool. MEXICO CITY and SHANGHAI: For years, the United States’ top trading partner has been China. That has now changed — Mexico is in top spot, as of last year. It is the culmination of a trend that began during the Trump presidency, when tariffs were slapped on Chinese exports to the US. It is also an example of the top trends in “de-risking” amidst all the geopolitical tensions: nearshoring or friend-shoring. Nearshoring means to locate production close to one’s consumers; friend-shoring is the policy of locating production in friendly countries. In Mexico, the result is a manufacturing boom. One company that has grown, for example, is original equipment manufacturer Creation Technologies, whose customers include Fortune 500 companies. With many of those customers shifting some of their manufacturing operations from China to Mexico, the company’s revenue growth has doubled in five years, said Julio Bello, its vice-president and general manager in Hermosillo city. “In the next six months, we’re going to be adding some lines and expanding our capacity. That’s going to support our plans for 2024 and 2025 growth.” Another beneficiary is Collectron International Management, which helps foreign companies relocate to Mexico. Staff head count has increased from 8,000 to 10,000, said Collectron Group president and chief executive officer Maria Elena Gallego. The US-China trade war that began in 2018 is not the only reason foreign investment is pouring into her country. The pandemic is another. “And of course, it has escalated (due) to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine,” she said. It helps that costs in Mexico are competitive, and the workforce is skilled. “We’re fortunate to be in an area with a lot of universities around and a highly talented and skilled workforce,” said Bello. But it is not the only country companies are moving to, and US firms are not the only ones moving out of China. HP has started shifting part of its laptop production from its main production base in Chongqing to Mexico as well as Thailand. Dell is doing the same. Apple has shifted part of its production to India, while Japan’s Mitsubishi Motors has ended production in China. As de-risking intensified, foreign investment in China turned negative for the first time since 1998 in the third quarter of last year. Between December 2021 and last June, global investors also pulled about 1.37 trillion yuan (S$258 billion) out of Chinese stock and bond markets, then sold another 219 billion yuan of mainland Chinese shares between August and last month. “The trend lines are already pretty far along in terms of companies deciding that their interests are better served by having more diversification,” observed Ryan Hass, the director of the Brooking Institution’s John L Thornton China Centre. “President Xi (Jinping) and China’s leaders would like to believe that a better (geopolitical) environment … will compel companies to continue … expanding their footprint in China. The reality, though, I think, is much more complicated.” So is this the beginning of the end for made-in-China goods, asks the programme When Titans Clash . WATCH: China vs the West — Does trade war spell end to made-in-China goods? (45:47) One thing is clear: Manufacturing is on the march. Chinese companies, too, are going to Mexico, mainly to be closer to their American customers. Under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, goods made in Mexico also can enter the US tariff-free. Since 2018, Chinese enterprises have poured more than US$8.29 billion (S$11.09 billion) into Mexico-based projects, according to data from research portal Latin America and the Caribbean Network on China. When Jorge Zermeno, the former mayor of Torreon — not too far from the US border — made a trip to China, there was “plenty of interest from Chinese companies who’ve come to Torreon, who’ve seen what we’re doing”, he said. In neighbouring Monterrey city, more than 10 brands from China have set up production. The companies in Mexico include car parts makers Ningbo Xusheng Group, Ningbo Tuopu Group and Bethel Automotive Safety Systems, home appliance maker Hisense and furniture manufacturer Kuka Home. “Chinese companies are setting up or forming joint ventures in other countries. Vietnam is one clear case as well as Mexico,” observed Anthony Saich, the director of the Rajawali Foundation Institute for Asia and Daewoo professor of international affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School. “(China) is using those countries to become the exporter into the US.” WATCH: Is Mexico China’s back door to the US? (6:17) The increase in many of these economies’ exports is then driven by increased imports from China, said World Trade Organisation research economist Victor Stolzenburg. “In effect, there seems to be triangular trade, which really doesn’t look like a lot of de-risking. It’s just the same trade happens more indirectly and less transparently. And I don’t think this is sustainable,” he said. “What we already see is that it drives up prices quite a bit.” For all the talk about de-risking now, it was China’s government that encouraged its companies to set up overseas factories 10 years ago, in the grand scheme known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Take, for example, the Huajian shoe factory in Ethiopia: Its annual production capacity of three million pairs of shoes for export as of last May makes it one of Ethiopia’s largest export enterprises. “More and more Chinese companies have tried to shake off the pressure of rising costs domestically and started considering Africa as a viable option,” said Yin Xinjun, vice general manager for Huajian Industrial Holding’s Ethiopia division. “Africa is a populous continent, equivalent to China when it was opening up in the 70s and 80s. What it lacks are funds, know-how and systems. So Chinese companies that have hit a bottleneck domestically are looking to invest.” Under the BRI, thousands of Chinese companies have gone overseas in search of lower land costs and wages. “Even without the geopolitical tensions … or other such conflicts, the inevitable relocation of Chinese industries would still occur,” Xu Qiyuan, the head of the Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. “Since 2007, we’ve noticed … the continuous appreciation of the Chinese yuan’s exchange rate, the ongoing increase in labour costs and growing domestic environmental pressures, among other challenges.” Large-scale manufacturing offshoring has happened several times before. In the 60s and 70s, for example, developed countries moved manufacturing to developing areas such as Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong. Today, China is also moving towards a more service-oriented industry, like the economies of the G7 countries, which are now looking to de-risk their relationship with Beijing. “We’ve reached a stage that resembles an inverted U-shaped curve, approaching the peak or descending from the peak,” said Xu. “This means the proportion of manufacturing in the economy has already peaked and is beginning to decline.” Despite the geopolitical tensions and China’s supply chain restructuring, some titans of industry are doubling down on their Chinese investments. Tesla, for example, has a mammoth factory under construction next to its existing factory in the Lingang area of Shanghai. And it will not be manufacturing only cars. Last April, Tesla inked a deal with the city to mass-produce its Megapack, “a powerful battery that provides energy storage and support, helping to stabilise the grid and prevent outages”, as the company describes it. Large projects like these would not have possible without the Chinese government’s support. When China reopened last year after the pandemic, Tesla CEO Elon Musk met top officials and was quoted by the Chinese press as saying he had “full confidence” in the Chinese market. “Elon had stated a goal of selling 20 million vehicles by 2030 for Tesla. A large part of that … is to sell (them) into the China market,” said Tu Le, the founder and managing director of Sino Auto Insights. Nearly 26 million new cars were sold in China last year, compared to nearly 13 million in Europe and almost 15.5 million light vehicles (passenger cars and light duty) in the US. A 20 per cent market share in China would get Tesla “well on their way to that 20 million number”, said Tu. Like Tesla, many American and European companies depend on China for a large portion of their sales. In 2006, foreign businesses in China exported roughly seven times the amount they sold domestically, according to Xu. Around 2012, the ratio was nearly equal, “fluctuating in the range of around US$900 billion to US$1 trillion”. By 2021, foreign companies’ domestic sales were more than double their exports. “If you consider foreign businesses as whole, then two-thirds of their business is ‘in China for China’ — producing in China and selling in China,” Xu said. That is among the reasons why German company BASF is spending €10 billion on a new chemical production complex in China, and why Volkswagen is reinforcing its presence with plans to invest around €1 billion in a new China centre. With China’s rising middle class, Wang Huiyao, the founder and president of the Beijing-based Centre for China and Globalisation, believes multinationals realise that “China has huge potential”. “In a developed country like the US, (a population of 1,000) may have 800 cars, … but in China probably it’s only 200 (cars). So there’s a huge (growth) wave for China,” he said. US businesses in China, however, have a “less optimistic outlook”, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. Its survey of member companies found that 31 per cent were increasing their investment in China last year from the year before, 22 per cent were decreasing their investment, and 40 per cent were redirecting or planning to redirect investment originally planned for China, mainly towards South-East Asia. The world cannot do without some made-in-China products, however. Just last year, for example, China became the world’s largest passenger car exporter, overtaking Japan. China is also the leader in electric vehicles (EVs). While it accounted for only 4.2 per cent of global EV exports in 2018, its share in 2022 was 35 per cent, according to the International Energy Agency. In contrast, Japan was the largest EV exporter in 2018 with a 24.5 per cent share, but this plummeted to 9.3 per cent in 2022. The world’s top seller of EVs is now Chinese maker BYD. Tu, whose first job was at a car assembly plant in Michigan, has seen the difference in BYD’s quality compared to before. “When I first landed in Beijing in 2009, I got into a BYD, and … it was pretty bad,” he recalled. “The doors were paper-thin. You could hear everything. The fit and finish of the interiors weren’t great.” At last year’s Shanghai Auto Show, he saw BYD was not the only Chinese EV maker leaving the world’s biggest car brands to play catch-up. There was also Zeekr, whose “little car” Zeekr X he waited 10 minutes to see “because there were so many people who wanted to see it”. “The management of these European automakers also saw this, and then in disbelief, they got into the vehicles themselves,” Tu recounted. “They closed the door, they heard the sound that matches what they were traditionally able to do, and then looked at the technology on the instrument panel and the infotainment system. And jaws … dropped.” WATCH: Will the world give up European cars for made-in-China electric vehicles? (10:17) At that same car show, Honda’s executive vice-president and representative executive officer, Shinji Aoyama, declared: “China is the world’s most advanced country in terms of (vehicle) electrification.” But it was not always rosy for China’s EV makers. Companies such as Nio, XPeng and Li Auto were set up around 2014 and 2015 and were struggling. Nio almost went bankrupt in 2020, but the Hefei government underwrote 7 billion yuan in funding for the company, and it was able to “weather that storm”, said Tu. “Now they have six or seven products in the market.” It is no secret that government policy has been crucial to China’s EV industry. But the growth of these Chinese companies is prompting other governments to push back. In September, the European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into EV vehicles from China, with its president, Ursula von der Leyen, saying: “Europe is open to competition but not for a race to the bottom. … De-risk, not decouple.” On the same day, in what was widely seen as a retaliatory move, China extended anti-subsidy duties on imports of European Union potato starch for five years. Tu envisages the possibility of “repercussions in the Chinese market for the European brands” if there is “any real protectionism” in the European EV market that would hit China. Not only do some of China’s EV makers rank among the largest in the world, six of the 10 largest EV battery makers are also Chinese — the country accounts for more than 70 per cent of market share by shipments. China also controls 70 per cent of global solar panel production and supplies at least 50 per cent of the world’s wind power equipment. So there is some question as to whether Western countries can de-risk their green tech supply chains if they are to meet climate change goals. “My sense, from looking at how the world’s been able to manage this (climate) transition, is it’ll be very expensive if not impossible,” said Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy dean Danny Quah. “If you want to save the planet, you can’t go on about somebody’s values being different from yours. Save that for some other time.” Hass, who was the China director on the US National Security Council (2013 to 2017), agreed that the US should do “whatever it can to accelerate the transition to renewables and green energy”. “The simple reality is that much of the leading technology in the world resides in China,” he noted. “If the US wants to move forward as quickly as possible, then it’ll need to do so in partnership with China.” Watch this episode of When Titans Clash here .

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Can India replace China as a manufacturing powerhouse? Can Indonesia navigate the geopolitics by bringing in companies from the East and the West to work together? The programme When Titans Clash looks at the shape of things to come. This audio is generated by an AI tool. MUMBAI and JAKARTA: Last year, India had plenty to celebrate. Apple opened its first flagship store in the country and shifted a chunk of its manufacturing from China to India as well. And it was joined by many other companies. United States-based Micron Technology agreed to build a US$2.75 billion (S$3.7 billion) semiconductor facility in Gujarat state, with Micron spending up to US$825 million and India funding the rest. US-based Applied Materials announced it will build a collaborative engineering centre in Bengaluru, with an investment of US$400 million. Another semiconductor firm, Lam Research, will start a training programme for 60,000 Indian engineers. Taiwan-based Foxconn, the world’s largest contract manufacturer of electronics, said it will double its workforce and investment in India by this year. The sense that it is India’s time to shine comes as both the US and China de-risk by, for example, reducing excessive dependency on any one country. De-risking is altering global supply chains, resulting in changes across several regions. One of them is India; another is Southeast Asia, such as in Indonesia, where rapid industrial changes are afoot. “India is in this sweet spot at the moment, with the combination of geopolitics as well as domestic policies,” said Jivanta Schoettli, assistant professor in Indian politics and foreign policy at Dublin City University. With de-risking underway across the world, the programme When Titans Clash looks at how the biggest economies in the subcontinent and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), respectively, stand to benefit. WATCH: New economic world order? Industrial policies and de-risking from China (45:56) In India, the Apple story “perhaps took a lot of people by surprise”, according to Schoettli. “There was quite a lot of scepticism in terms of … India actually (being) able to deliver the skills (that are) necessary, the talent, the land, the locations, the logistics,” she cited. “Somehow all this is being worked out. “Now the projections are that Apple’s going to possibly get 15 per cent of its revenue (growth) and 20 per cent of its (user growth), I believe, (from India) over the next five years.” For a long time, job creation in India had been “a big problem”, said S Rajaratnam School of International Studies senior fellow Sinderpal Singh, the assistant director of the school’s Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the “Make in India” campaign in 2014, but only in the last two years did chief executives and governments start paying close attention. “It’s very hard to ignore the geopolitical background,” said Singh. “India is coming of age. And there’s some sense that this is a zero-sum game — that what China’s losing, India’s gaining.” Western countries are courting India even though Modi has not turned his back on Russia, with his country importing more Russian oil and bilateral trade accelerating as the Ukraine conflict continues. At the White House, new partnerships between the US and India in defence, space exploration and semiconductor manufacturing were inked last year. One of the agreements allowed the sale of American-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones to India and for US-based General Electric to partner with Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft. India also signed the Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space exploration co-operation among nations participating in American-led lunar exploration plans. The US’ National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Indian Space Research Organisation also agreed to make a joint mission to the International Space Station this year. Amid the diplomatic engagements, including in France, there was little mention of India’s backsliding on religious and press freedoms. Under Modi’s government, religious hate crimes have increased, with several high-profile lynchings of Muslims. “The American administration understands how important the relationship with India is at the strategic level,” said Singh. “Especially now with (President Joe) Biden, India is so important that they’ve been trying to stay clear of … some of these issues.” Geopolitics is not the only factor, however, behind some of the recent corporate decisions. China has an ageing population, of which more than 30 per cent will be over 60 years old by 2035. India, on the other hand, overtook China last year to become the world’s most populous nation, with just over half of its 1.4 billion people under the age of 30. “It’s not just about producing for export, but it’s combined with the huge market potential, the huge attraction of an increasingly affluent middle class, or not necessarily affluent but a class that’s got some discretionary spending power,” said Schoettli. India does have bottlenecks but is now trying to resolve them by streamlining the implementation of infrastructure projects across the country. The national highway network, for example, will be expanded along with railway capacity for transporting cargo as well as the electricity transmission network for easier access to electricity. The infrastructure plan includes the creation of around 200 new airports, heliports and water aerodromes to boost aviation as well as 20 new mega food parks, 11 industrial corridors and two new defence corridors in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. Like many other countries, India is also offering subsidies and facilitating trade. It has set up a production-linked incentives scheme for sectors such as the manufacturing of solar photovoltaic modules and advanced batteries. Even so, government ministries are “quite frank” about the current challenges, from the issues with reliability of electricity to logistical and regulatory issues, which foreign investors may be “well aware of”, cited Schoettli. “If you decide to come to India and invest, you’ve probably come in with that preception … that (there) is going to be a lot of hurdles,” she said. For companies thinking of moving their supply chains from China to India, the challenges include a lack of skills. While India has cheaper, abundant labour, the quality of its workforce needs upgrading. India continues to have high levels of poverty and malnutrition, with almost 12 per cent of its population living below the World Bank’s extreme poverty line. In China, that same poverty rate is nearly zero. When it comes to tech talents, China reportedly graduates nearly twice as many science, technology, engineering and mathematics students compared to India. Beijing also invests significantly more in research and development and industries such as robotics, artificial intelligence and biotechnology. For these reasons, Anthony Saich, the director of the Rajawali Foundation Institute for Asia and Daewoo professor of international affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School, thinks it is “very difficult” to shift industries out of China. He cited Apple supplier Foxconn, which has about 200,000 workers at its plant in Zhengzhou, Henan province. “Roads, bridges built by the Chinese government, dormitories set up by the Chinese government — it’s hard to think of another country that’d be able to provide that sort of infrastructure for a major company like that,” he said. “(Apple) can’t really get out of China, no matter what the bigger politics (are). … Value chains, supply chains (are) integrated into a global model, so you can’t just snip that off and say, ‘… We’re off to India.’” For Southeast Asia, the open multilateral trading system has been highly beneficial. In the 1980s, the region’s gross domestic product per capita was at the level of sub-Saharan Africa. Today, it is 3.5 times higher than sub-Saharan Africa, cited World Trade Organisation (WTO) research economist Victor Stolzenburg. But de-risking, in the form of supply chain diversification, has also brought in investment. One of the region’s largest nickel production centres, if not the largest, is the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP) in Sulawesi. Here, the floodlights stay on throughout the night, and more than 40,000 workers operate the site round the clock. The park covers nearly 4,000 hectares — it takes 45 minutes to drive from one end to the other — and has its own power plants, port area and even an airport. Just 11 years ago, the land was dense rainforest and home to about 3,000 villagers. Chinese investment, led by stainless steel giant Tsingshan Holding Group, was critical to the transformation of forest into factories. Nickel exporter Hamid Mina was supplying the ore to China when his company, in partnership with Tsingshan, started building the first nickel processing plant in 2013. “Tsingshan said, ‘We’re good (at) building the factory and producing. This is our know-how. You’re Indonesian, you know Indonesian rules, regulations, everything.’ So we split our jobs,” recalled Hamid, now IMIP’s managing director. “They have the technology, so we co-operate.” Nickel, which has long been used for making stainless steel, is becoming an increasingly key component for lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles. The International Energy Agency estimates that by 2040, clean energy technologies will account for up to 70 per cent of total nickel demand. Indonesia holds the world’s largest nickel deposits and is the largest nickel miner, extracting almost half of the global supply. China, meanwhile, has some of the world’s largest battery and green tech companies. At its core then, IMIP exists to smelt and refine nickel on a massive scale. And it contributes to China’s efforts to diversify its sources of critical inputs that fuel its economic growth. Global growth in the electric vehicle (EV) and battery industries is not, however, the only driving force behind Morowali’s growth. There is Indonesia’s ban on nickel ore exports since 2020, a move the EU, the WTO and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have criticised. But the ban compelled foreign investors to build smelters in the country, adding value to its metal exports and creating jobs. In 2014, Indonesia’s nickel ore exports were worth US$1.1 billion; in 2022, it exported US$34 billion in nickel products. “You see, the multiplier is very huge,” said Septian Hario Seto, a deputy minister in the Co-ordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investment Affairs. Today, various companies are working together in Morowali to produce this 21st-century gold — with almost US$5 billion to US$6 billion of investment “now coming in every year”, said Hamid. “We welcome everybody,” he added. “We don’t care (whether) you’re from the West or from the East. We’re for the business. No politics.” To move further up the value chain, Indonesia is creating an “ecosystem” for EVs and lithium batteries, said Septian. In 2022, President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) launched the first EV assembled in Indonesia, made by Hyundai. The company is working with another two South Korean companies to make EV batteries in Indonesia. Last year, when Jokowi visited Australia, the two countries signed deals in mining lithium and nickel to produce EV batteries as he highlighted strategic co-operation between the two countries in this field as a priority. WATCH: Does world’s largest nickel miner need to choose between China and US? (8:34) Setting up shop now in Indonesia is BYD, which joins fellow Chinese EV maker Wuling, while US company Tesla continues its investment discussion with the Indonesian government. In the foreseeable future, nickel could be processed in Indonesia by Chinese companies, then assembled into EV batteries by South Korean and, potentially, Australian firms there, for cars made in Indonesia by American and Chinese manufacturers. In a world grappling with geopolitical tensions, Jakarta sees such global partnerships as the way forward. “We should avoid a concentration of the supply chain (in the hands of) one single party. But I think in an effort to diversify the supply chain, … we can’t just say, ‘Oh, I don’t want China,’” said Septian. “Western countries would be 10 to 15 years behind … Chinese technology in terms of the nickel processing, so we can’t exclude. “We can have co-operation that’s beneficial and mutual for every party, because … no single country, even no single region, can fulfil all the critical minerals that we need for this energy transition.” For Southeast Asia, the outlook “remains very positive” because the region “continues to be critical to the multilateral trading system as we have it”, said Stolzenburg. The IMF recently estimated that Asean “will continue to outgrow the world average by a factor of 1.5”. In trade, the region outgrew the global average in 2022, for example, by a factor of five. “The starting point … is very positive,” said Stolzenburg. “Of course, there are downside risks. So far, it seems that Asean countries … are managing this well.” He made it clear, however, that the positive outlook depends on this factor: that Asean is not forced to choose sides.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider One inmate landed back behind bars six months after swearing he would never return. Another risked his Prison School education over a QR code. Nearly one year on, CNA finds out how the inmates in the documentary Inside Maximum Security are faring. Graceson Ang arrives at The Helping Hand halfway house for his community-based programme. SINGAPORE: Two weeks from completing his prison term, Graceson Ang found himself handcuffed and taken back to the Singapore Prison Service’s (SPS) Selarang Park Complex. He had broken the rules of a community-based programme that allowed him to spend the tail-end of his sentence at a halfway house – not once, but seven times between September and November. The 37-year-old had taken leave and sick days off from work without informing the halfway house and his reintegration officer Ponnarasi Gopal Chandra. For these breaches, he landed back in a cell last month. Under the SPS’ Reflection Regime, he was not allowed out except for counselling sessions. The only reading materials he had were the Reflection Regime coursebook and a Bible. “When there’re no classes, we will be (in the cell the whole day). There’ll be no movement, no nothing for us,” Graceson lamented. The experience, after tasting some measure of freedom for nearly six months, was “like hell”. “This is my fourth incarceration,” said Graceson who, on the day he was transferred from prison to halfway house, had pledged never to return. “While… back on this Reflection Regime, I (felt) like it’s the fifth time that I’m coming back to prison,” said the father of three, who was sentenced to six years and five months in jail, with 21 strokes of the cane, for drug consumption, criminal intimidation and carrying weapons. He wasn’t the only inmate featured in CNA’s award-winning documentary, Inside Maximum Security , to stumble after exiting Institution B1 of Changi Prison Complex. WATCH: A taste of freedom: Prepping for the outside world | Part 1/3 (46:46) For nearly a year after the documentary aired, CNA continued to follow the lives of four individuals – Graceson , Tian Boon Keng, Muhammad Khairil and Mohamed Iskandar Hameed Sultan – as they worked towards their eventual release and a more hopeful future. The result is a three-part sequel, Beyond Maximum Security, which is now available on CNA Insider’s YouTube channel . Here are some of the inmates’ milestones, missteps as well as moments when plans and hopes hung in the balance. Explaining the “minimal” facilities offered under the Reflection Regime, Ponnarasi said it was for Ang to “learn from (his) mistakes” and “really reflect”. Supervisees – the SPS’ term for inmates once they embark on community-based programmes – are supposed to inform their reintegration officers before they report sick to their employers “so that we are aware of their whereabouts”, she explained. They are also supposed to seek approval from the halfway house before applying for leave. “The communication should be between the halfway house and the supervisee, and not directly with the employer without keeping the halfway house in the loop,” she said. Graceson told Ponnarasi he could not remember exactly where he was while on leave. Once, his son was sick. “Very rushed, and then I just did it my own way without informing (the authorities),” he said. On some other occasions, Graceson admitted he “just wanted to be outside with (his) friends to relax, talk, chat”. “To try to find ways to have more income,” he said. “But of course, not in… illegal ways,” he quickly added. This, Ponnarasi said, is a breach as supervisees are supposed to remain at the halfway house when they are sick or on leave. Another inmate who broke the rules was Iskandar, who escaped the death penalty for drug trafficking and is serving a sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for drug trafficking, drug possession and consumption. Into his third year in Prison School, the 42-year-old is pursuing a diploma in logistics. He recently stepped into a facility he had hitherto not had the chance to: The computer laboratory. It was like entering another world. “Inside the computer lab, you won’t have the thought that you’re in prison,” he said. “It’s air-conditioned, you just do your work and time goes (by) very fast.” Inmates are only allowed to access specific websites for their assignments. If they access unauthorised sites, the privilege of using the device could be taken away. They could also be expelled from their course. Iskandar landed in hot soup for generating a QR code without permission. “We saw the QR code on Iskandar’s project work. We did a scan and found out that it was his prison number,” said Paruk Kothari, vice-principal of the Prison School. One’s prison number is “equivalent to the identity card number of a person (and) can be abused”, he explained. If it falls into the hands of other inmates, they can log in to access his electronic letters to his loved ones and impersonate him, among other things. During investigation into the matter, Iskandar was segregated from other inmates. His lessons were suspended. Isolated in his cell, Iskandar regretted the “stupid mistake”. “I’m the type of person who’s very cautious. I won’t do stupid things. But that day, I don’t know why I (went and did that),” he said. \"This QR code, I (didn’t) even need it… I just wanted to act clever.” In the end, Iskandar’s punishment was a postponement of his release by four days. But he was allowed to continue his diploma course and remains on track to complete it well before his release. This was good news, he said. Throughout his 18 months behind bars, Khai, 32, had been wondering how his mother was faring. He last had contact with her last year and had been deeply worried – to the extent he wanted to end it all. According to him, his stepbrother took his mother away after his father died in December 2020. Soon after, Khai started serving his sentence of 29 months’ jail and two strokes of the cane for extortion, blackmail and voluntarily causing hurt. While in prison, he tried without success to call his mother. He wrote to his cousin but did not receive a reply. He then called his daughter to check in on her and pass her some money. When Khai finally walked out of prison in late October, the first thing he did – after the pleasant surprise of finding two friends and his daughter waiting outside the gates – was to buy lunch and head to his late father’s house in search of his mother. His heart “was beating so fast” when he stepped out of the lift. “Don’t know what’s (the state) of the house, and don’t know my mom’s condition,” he said. His mother took a moment to ascertain it was her son, then ushered him in. They enjoyed their first meal, post-release, as a family. She feels “blessed” that he is back to take care of her, Khai said. He also hopes his daughter will stop playing truant, focus on her studies and have a better life than him. “I always tell my daughter (to) be better than who I am,” he said. “My highest qualification is only Primary Two, and I don’t want (her) to study until secondary (school) and that’s it.” WATCH: Counting down to a life beyond bars | Part 2/3 (47:54) For Boon Keng, things are bittersweet on the family front. With help from his reintegration officer Simon Lee, he has managed to reconnect with his sister, whose home he is now living in. “Thank God that my sister gave me this place to stay,” said Boon Keng. “At least I have a roof (over my head).” The 35-year-old was released into the community in July under a remission order and the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme, which gives more intervention and support to higher-risk ex-offenders. This enabled him to reunite with his fiancée Gabrielle. They visited Mandai Columbarium the first chance he had to pay his respects to his late mother, who died while he was in prison. Sobbing as he pondered his failings as a son, Boon Keng said: “I don’t dare to say I love her because up to her last day, I did nothing. There is another loved one that Boon Keng – who was sentenced to three-and-a-half-years' jail for theft, drug consumption, criminal breach of trust and breach of personal protection order – has yet to see: His daughter. Lee is in touch with Boon Keng’s ex-wife about the issue, and said she has not decided whether to grant Tian access to their child. “She needs to speak to you first,” Lee told Boon Keng. “She needs to understand you and your current mindset. She needs to assess your situation.” WATCH: Roadblocks to redemption: Will the jailbirds fly free? | Part 3/3 (47:01) Employment was another big step for the inmates as they ventured back into society. Boon Keng had to secure a job to be on board the Work Release Scheme and, with the help of statutory board Yellow Ribbon Singapore, lined up two interviews with hotels. He scored a role with one and began work as a guest services agent in June. By October, however, he had quit as the salary was not enough for his expenses, which include maintenance for his daughter. WATCH: What former prison inmates do with first moments of freedom (6:25) He became a food delivery rider, working six days a week for more than 12 hours each day. “Although it’s hard work, at least whatever effort I put in, I can see the returns,” he said. “I can actually start to save up.” There is a reason for making this a priority. “It’s just a fear I have because in the past, I (committed crimes when I didn’t have money),” he said. Graceson quit as a mover with the halfway house after two months for the same reason. The S$500 he earned a month was not enough for his family’s expenses, he said. “It’s not that I am unhappy, it’s just that the pay is too low for me.” His next role as a procurement assistant at flower and gift company Xpressflower came with initial struggles. Although a colleague showed him the procurement process, it took time to absorb the information and he fumbled when searching for the right basket for a floral arrangement. Tasked with tying a ribbon around a box of chocolates, he said: “I didn’t expect (to) have to wrap (and) tie ribbons… It’s a lady’s job, actually.” Amid more fumbling, he remarked: “My hands (are) like (my feet).” Graceson could hardly contain his glee on the final day of his Reflection Regime. “Freedom, I smell freedom,” he said. He feels confident about not falling back into drugs, but acknowledged he needs to work on his anger management skills. “I’m still trying my best to change. We all have anger ... I want to try to control my anger,” he said. Then, picking up his items, he bid his cellmate goodbye. “Take care, five more days.” Catch the three episodes of Beyond Maximum Security here , and the four episodes of Inside Maximum Security here .

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider There was little hope when a 24-year-old had to fight a rare, terminal cancer. A clinical study and digital medicine platform at National University of Singapore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine helped fend off the disease for 16 months. In partnership with the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. Donavan Koh put up a good fight against a very deadly disease, said his doctor. SINGAPORE: He had just completed the “great experience” of full-time National Service and was looking forward to the future after having studied gaming at the Institute of Technical Education. Four months later, in January 2020, Donavan Koh’s voice began to grow hoarse. What he initially thought was a sore throat worsened to the point where his parents could not hear what he was saying. His father had a hunch that it was abnormal and got him to see a doctor. The result of the biopsy shocked Koh: It was Stage 4 natural killer (NK) cell lymphoma, a “very rare” variant of lymphoma, diagnosed his doctor, Daryl Tan, a haematologist in private practice. Lymphoma is a cancer that starts in infection-fighting white blood cells called lymphocytes, which are part of the body’s immune system, according to the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS). On his doctor’s advice, Koh immediately started chemotherapy, the first-line treatment for his condition. The side effect made him cry. “After two months, my hair started to fall,” said Koh, who had not told his friends about his condition. “I was devastated because I care a lot about my appearance.” Worse still, the treatment did not work. It was time to put him on standard second-line drugs. Only about 40 per cent of patients, however, respond to this treatment. Koh was not one of them, and his situation was dire at this point. “There isn’t any proven way to treat the disease after a patient’s relapsed or progressed beyond the first one or two lines of treatment,” Tan said. For many patients, the next step is palliative care, which focuses on relieving the suffering and improving the quality of life of people with life-threatening illnesses. But Koh, 24, was “probably the youngest” patient with the disease Tan had ever seen. NK cell lymphoma typically affects people aged 55 and over, and Tan estimates that there are about 20 new cases yearly in Singapore. Koh’s parents were distraught. To try to “salvage” the situation, Tan called a doctor-researcher conducting a clinical study in the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centre for Cancer Research (N2CR), a translational research programme at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine), to ask if it was open for enrolment. The study, involving a digital medicine platform called Quadratic Phenotypic Optimisation Platform (QPOP), let Koh live cancer-free for 16 months. First, doctors took a sample of his cancerous tissue, which was then incubated with 155 drug combinations for up to 72 hours. From a set of 12 drugs chosen by the researchers, QPOP had generated over half a million drug combinations that were possible for Koh, then ranked the different drug cocktails and identified the most effective one for him. Driven by robots and artificial intelligence, QPOP accomplished the task in the span of about six days — which would be impossible with manual tests, said Edward Chow, an associate professor at the N2CR and principal investigator at the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore (CSI Singapore), NUS. His team started working on QPOP in 2012 and have applied it to medical settings since around 2017. A collaboration among molecular biologists, cancer researchers and engineers, QPOP “marries the wet lab with computer science and mathematical analysis”, said Chow. Simply put, the platform is “a bartender lab for cocktails of drugs”, said fellow N2CR assistant professor and CSI Singapore principal investigator Anand Jeyasekharan. “Edward’s lab (team) are like expert bartenders. They come up with the best cocktails of these anti-cancer drugs, which are … bespoke for our particular patients,” said Jeyasekharan, who is also a consultant in the department of haematology-oncology at the NCIS. The individualised treatment offered through QPOP is a departure from cancer treatments where doctors follow standard protocols. In the first round of routine treatment, patients would be prescribed a combination of drugs that “typically has a chance of working” for people with a particular type of cancer. It is akin to every customer at a bar getting the same drink “whether or not they like it”, Chow said. He added: “There are plenty of new drugs being discovered every day, but we’re often still uncertain as to how best to use these new drugs, which patients should be receiving a particular new drug over another, (and) in what combination.” These are the “unknowns” that Chow’s team and QPOP seek to solve. WATCH: Personalised cancer treatment (6:51) Chow’s motivation for doing cancer research is personal: When he was in graduate school, his father was diagnosed with renal cancer. Chow witnessed the progression of the disease as his father went through “the different lines of standard therapy until, ultimately, he ran out of options”. “We did feel helpless, especially because his treatment was very regimented, so I wanted to see if I could do anything to make sure that people have as many options as possible,” he said. He decided to switch his area of research — which was on the effects of antiviral immune response on drug metabolism — to cancer, for more clini cal impact and “to give cancer patients and their families as much time together as possible”. And that was what he did for Koh. QPOP ranked two drugs highly for the patient, but both were not approved for use in Singapore at the time. The medical team successfully sought to bring the drugs here with the Health Sciences Authority’s approval. To the doctors’ surprise, Koh, who had been unable to talk intelligibly for about six months, regained his voice after the first treatment cycle, said Tan. “He couldn’t talk because the tumour was in his voice box,” the haematologist said. “But when he started to vocalise more clearly and began speaking in proper sentences, his parents were extremely overjoyed. “When we did the scan after two cycles of treatment, we were pleasantly surprised (to find) that … the tumour in the body had all cleared.” The first QPOP drug cocktail staved off Koh’s disease for 10 months. When it returned, he was given another set of highly ranked drugs, which helped him beat the cancer a second time. But in June, he had a “very aggressive relapse”, said Tan. As the treatments and disease had left him very frail, doctors could not treat him further, and Koh succumbed to cancer on July 12. “He put up a good fight against a very deadly disease,” said Tan. The scientists will keep working to make individualised treatment a reality for more patients. “There’s still more to be done. We still need to figure out how to keep (cancer) away once it’s gone away,” said Jeyasekharan. The researchers believe QPOP can ultimately apply to all types of cancer, but this will depend on advances in culturing cancer cells and tumour tissues in the laboratory, Chow said. He and Jeyasekharan want to find a way to incorporate more drugs into QPOP’s drug set — not only drugs that work directly on cancer cells, but also those that help patients’ immune cells to target and attack cancer cells. And “maybe in future”, instead of harnessing a platform like QPOP only after standard treatments have failed, scientists and doctors will be able to conduct tests earlier to see if there are “less toxic” options available for patients, said Jeyasekharan. This would spare some patients the side effects of standard treatments — and reduce costs by giving patients drugs that are more likely to work for them. “Cancer costs are the number one healthcare expenditure, so we need to find ways to rationalise the use of these expensive drugs,” he said. Thanking the Kohs for putting their trust in the study, Chow said they have helped the medical team “learn more about (ways) to improve the platform and the technology, so that we can hopefully benefit more people in future”. On what he would tell Koh, Jeyasekharan said: “I wish science worked faster, Donavan … I wish we could do more and better. That’s something we’ll continue to work towards.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Kunyah Cafe, which opened on Jan 9 on the SMU campus, has a visually impaired chef. It began as a project to prove that those with sight loss have a place in a commercial kitchen. Alex Seow, 55, estimates the amount of milk to add by feeling its weight. (Photo: Tan Wen Lin/CNA) SINGAPORE: At Kunyah Cafe, weighing scales can speak, light switches are paired with dimmers, and its chefs are more afraid of prejudice than sharp knives. And the signature sandwiches — filled with crispy breaded chicken thigh, tempeh, otah or shrimp cake — were creations of two visually impaired chefs. Alex Seow lost 70 per cent of his vision at age 50 owing to complications from a cataract surgery; Ernawati Fauzana Zakaria, 38, has had glaucoma since the age of 10 and cannot see objects in focus. Seow, now 55, has been a chef for more than a decade, his career truncated after the surgery. Erna, as she likes to be addressed, gained her love of cooking from her mother, who made her learn from a young age so that she would grow to live independently. These qualities were what inspired Aaron Yeoh, who is sighted, to set up the cafe with them — never mind that they would have to cook differently. “Most likely the productivity is low. And without full vision, how can they navigate dangers like heat and knives?” Yeoh added. “It got me thinking: Is it possible to overcome all these challenges?” About four years after the idea came to him, he is testing his “hypothesis” that with the right tools and environment, the visually impaired can have a “dignified” career in the kitchen. Kunyah Cafe at the Singapore Management University (SMU) opened its doors on Jan 9 to a steady stream of curious customers. A mix of excitement and anxiety filled the kitchen as the first order, one wasabi ebi sandwich and one tempeh sandwich, came through at 11am. “(The visually impaired) are just like us: They still have their aspirations in life,” said Yeoh, 44. “Unfortunately, there’s a lack of platforms … (and) empathy among the general public to allow them to showcase their talent and passion.” He had once asked Erna, whom he has been friends with for eight years, if she would ever try finding a job as a chef, since she loved cooking. Her reply: “No employer in this world would hire a visually impaired chef.” The journey towards those first two sandwiches has not been easy, and not necessarily because of the chefs’ disabilities. Differences have emerged, and Erna has left. Still, the folks at the cafe are determined to make a success of it. In 2018, together with Erna, Yeoh started free cooking classes for the visually impaired to find out what would help them be more confident in the kitchen. The pair were also looking for someone to join their business. They tested out assistive devices, like weighing scales that read out the amount of ingredients added and induction cookers that read out the stovetop temperatures. The tools did give the students more confidence, said Yeoh, but none were passionate enough to turn their culinary skills into a career. Then came Seow, who was referred to Yeoh by a friend. Having lost most of his vision, Seow felt like a burden in the last kitchen where he worked. “Sometimes I needed (my colleagues) to help (by) looking at the menu or the food. … After helping (me) for a long time, there was some friction,” he said. “I felt it was quite difficult and resigned from the job.” When the call from Yeoh came, Seow was “honoured”, albeit worried about the problems his eyesight would bring. “But (Yeoh) told me we can gain experience from these difficulties,” said the designated head chef. It was late last year when Yeoh secured a kiosk at SMU to run the business. Before setting up the cafe proper, he consulted an occupational therapist to tailor the space to the chefs’ visual impairments, as part of an application for SG Enable’s job redesign grant. Seow, for example, describes being able to see objects only up close and in front of him; his peripheral vision is blurred, and he often trips — so a ramp was built at the entrance instead of a step. The chefs also have different sensitivities to light: Seow requires a brighter working environment, while too bright a light causes discomfort to Erna. “I’m a cat,” said Erna. Seow replied: “And I’m a dog.” Hence all the light switches in the kitchen are fitted with dimmers so that the chefs can adjust the lighting according to their preferences whenever they switch stations. Yeoh also bought a convection oven that could, at the touch of a few buttons, grill chicken, steam eggs or cook rice. “I already knew (the chefs) could potentially be slow, so I needed to find technology to help them improve their productivity,” said Yeoh. “Without automation, for sure we can never reach the output we need to break even.” While the kitchen had to be redesigned to suit the chefs’ visual impairments, the menu had less to do with eyesight and was based on their strengths — local flavours — and foods that cater for a student population, said Yeoh. They settled on the four sandwiches and a rendang chicken bento box. Ingredients, however, were chosen intentionally to save on the preparation time, such as liquid egg so the chefs need not crack shells and risk leaving any fragments in the food. A month prior to opening day, Yeoh organised a food-tasting session for students and workers in the area. This was CNA Insider’s first glimpse of how the team worked in practice. For a start, they ditched some of the assistive tools that were not required for the current menu, said Seow. It also seemed that the chefs went with their gut. In measuring ingredients, Seow trusted his intuition, built up over the years before he lost his sight. He added half a carton of milk to an egg mixture with the confidence of someone who has indeed worked in a kitchen for a long time. He had estimated the amount from the weight of the remaining milk in the carton, he told this reporter. Erna, meanwhile, was in charge of breading the patties for frying. She, too, had built up an intuition in the kitchen — but in a different way from Seow. Yeoh described her as someone who operated with precision, which she did to compensate for her visual impairment. While she lacked the know-how professional chefs have, she knew where to find every ingredient or utensil in the kitchen and could tell salt from sugar by feeling the granules. The chefs’ anxiety showed a little, however, when asked how they would know whether their food is cooked. In the past, Seow could tell with one look. With things not as “obvious” now, he lets the food cook for longer just in case. Erna would poke the meat to check for doneness. But with a business to run and safety to ensure, there is kitchen assistant Chan Lay Hoon, who is sighted, to double-check. Chan, 61, used to work in a flavouring company and volunteers her time for the cafe. She also turns the knobs on the fryer and the toaster to the right temperatures, she said, and helps in cleaning the dirt off ingredients like onions, shallots and ginger more thoroughly as well as in chopping them. As the chefs worked, she hovered around and was occasionally called to check whether Seow was cutting up the otah and tempeh fillings in the right size, or to top up the panko and egg wash for Erna. The boss Yeoh doubled as an errand boy, washing dishes as they came and was at his team’s beck and call. As with many workplaces, it seemed that their productivity hinged on practice and team dynamics. The team scrambled to fulfil the food tasters’ orders when, with an hour to go, they could not get the convection oven to work. Seow, who was meant to deep-fry the sandwich fillings, had to fry the eggs manually; Erna and Chan settled to the meats and tempeh. Everyone was everywhere all at once. If Erna could have it her own way, she would have everyone walk only in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, she said, her ire aroused. “There are a lot of danger spots, especially where the deep (fat) fryers are. If you (don’t) co-ordinate and make your move properly, anything could happen, like food spills, or someone may get hurt.” Then there were instances where it could be said that too many cooks spoil the broth. The team could hardly agree on how long to toast the bread for their sandwiches, especially since they were using the toaster for the first time. Seow insisted that it should be toasted longer for crispness, while Chan felt it would be charred. “What I see may not be what he sees,” said Chan. “It could be shade of five, but to him it could be shade of three or two. So we had to come to a compromise.” And while Erna was slathering the chicken and tempeh sandwiches with rendang gravy, she got “frustrated” when Chan told her there was too much sauce while “someone else” complained that it was too little. “Let me do my thing, you know,” said Erna. “The person wrapping (the sandwiches) is responsible for how much sauce they use.” Though the team served their sandwiches about a half hour late, the food tasters were reasonably satisfied. Some loved the rendang sauce; others thought it could be spicier. And a couple agreed with Seow that the bread could have been toasted more, so as not to go soggy from the sauce too soon. By Christmas time, the team got into the swing of working together in the new kitchen. They settled on the right setting on the toaster and figured out the convection oven. They ironed out their workflow and roles to handle orders efficiently. Their next food-tasting session went off uneventfully. Then Erna resigned. She told CNA Insider that she and Yeoh no longer shared the same goal. She preferred teaching fellow visually impaired people cooking skills so they can gain independence, rather than running a business. With less than a month to the opening day, Yeoh was initially “angry” about Erna’s departure at a crucial time, he said. Eventually, he did not see it as a “negative thing”. He was glad to see Erna become more confident at work over the years. And he already had another employee coming on board in a bid to spread the workload. While she is not visually impaired, Oh Siew May, 50, was born with cerebral palsy. She worked at a farm, Bollywood Veggies, for a decade, then for one and a half years at a cafe where she helped to cook and serve customers. Kunyah Cafe’s mission continues to be to support people with disabilities who have a passion for cooking, said Yeoh. While Oh’s speech is slurred and her movements are not nimble, she can handle tasks such as breading and packing. She is also learning from Seow to stir-fry vegetables for the bento boxes. Asked how she finds working with the team, Oh said: “What Aaron’s doing is very good because he believes in disabled people.” On the opening day, the team was steady and organised. Seow was in charge of deep-frying and reading out orders, which he did by bringing the chits right to his eyes. Chan assembled the sandwiches while Oh packed and passed the food to the customers. Even Yeoh’s mother had come to help assemble bento boxes. Yeoh himself talked to customers and shared the team’s story. There is no shop sign, however, asking customers to be patient as the chefs have disabilities. “To create a mindset shift, I think we need to do the reverse. We let (customers) experience the food first, then we let them experience the team,” said Yeoh. “That’ll create a deeper impression. “Hopefully, they can inspire more change in the community.” Notwithstanding teething problems like the circuitry tripping, the automated payment system being slow to work and Seow misreading an order quantity once, the feedback on the food was positive. One customer rated the bento box a four out of five; another, wanting to try something new, was “pleasantly surprised” by his tempeh sandwich and felt it was value for money. Neither knew that the chefs had disabilities. By the end of the day, the team sold 20 sandwiches and 13 bentos, missing their sales target of 100 in total. But Yeoh gave them a rating of seven out of 10. It was past sundown, and he was the only one left cleaning up the kiosk. Has he proven his hypothesis? Will Kunyah Cafe succeed in letting the visually impaired work in a kitchen? Yeoh does not have an answer yet, but one thing is for sure. “Without Alex, Lay Hoon and, in the past, Erna, I don’t think I can even reach this stage,” he said.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider At the MOE Kindergarten @ Mayflower, pupils with different hearing abilities learn together, with some added support. Besides picking up sign language, everyone from the teachers to parents to the hearing kids have learnt surprising lessons. Friends with and without hearing loss in this MOE Kindergarten class. (Photo: Goh Chiew Tong/CNA) This audio is generated by an AI tool. • Children in the kindergarten with moderate to severe hearing loss learn and play together with their hearing peers. • Lessons are taught concurrently by two teachers, one speaking and the other signing. • The children with hearing loss start K1 without much language but, with the added support, learn to carry on conversations with others. • Hearing children pick up sign language just by being in the same classroom as their friends with hearing loss. SINGAPORE: Their giggles rang out round the classroom as the three girls raced to the play kitchen to assemble miniature hot dogs and pizzas. They queued, handed over pretend money to a “chef” in an apron and found a seat to eat their “food”. But in her excitement, 8-year-old Thea Ow moved too quickly, sending toy sausages clattering on the table and the floor. Her two friends, Azza Darwisya Lee and Nur Alana Alisha Muhammad Asyraf, giggled again. “She’s messing up the floor,” Alana said with a laugh. She tapped Thea on the shoulder and signed to her, “Pick it up!” To the casual observer, it might be nearly impossible to tell that two of the girls have hearing loss. In this K2 class last year at the Ministry of Education (MOE) Kindergarten @ Mayflower, four of the 13 pupils had moderate to severe hearing loss and used Singapore Sign Language to communicate. But to their classmates, it was other differences — in skin colour, hair length or even the water bottles they carry — that stood out. “Our hair isn’t the same,” said Alana, gesturing at Thea’s ponytail when asked if her friend was like her. “I have short hair; I can’t tie it.” In this classroom, where children with different hearing abilities continue to learn side by side, lessons on inclusion and confidence are learnt daily, without being taught explicitly. And it is not only the children who have learnt them, but also parents, teachers and even visitors to the kindergarten. The wheels of this initiative had been set in motion before the kindergarten, located within Mayflower Primary School, began operations in 2021. The MOE announced in November 2020 that the kindergarten would be supporting children with moderate to profound hearing loss from 2022. When she first heard the news, via an email from the ministry, centre head Melina Chen’s first reaction was excitement. Then she began to worry. “Oh dear,” she recalled. “How are we going to communicate with the children?” To be sure, the model the kindergarten would follow was not a new one: Mayflower has been the designated primary school for pupils with hearing loss since 2018. They attend classes with their hearing peers, supported by a dedicated signing teacher who communicates the lessons to them in Singapore Sign Language. WATCH: When 7-year-old deaf and hearing preschoolers learn side by side (18:40) Chen said she was reassured on this during subsequent visits from ministry representatives who briefed her. But at that point, no one in her team knew sign language or how to interact with children with hearing loss, much less teach them. Together with her teachers, they began researching how to get the children’s attention, get them to participate in activities, and even the best seating arrangements in the classroom with respect to the line of sight of the teacher. “We had different groups doing presentations on different things,” she said. “We wanted to be well prepared before we received the children.” But it needed the kindergarten’s dedicated signing teacher to join the team, in mid-2021, to really get things moving. Bernadette Pung had been at Mayflower Primary for four years in a similar role and decided to join the kindergarten because of her interest in working with younger children. She remembers that while many of her new colleagues did not know any sign language, they were willing learners. She arranged for a teacher from Mayflower Primary to come to the kindergarten and talk about deaf culture. The teacher also showed them some daily signs they could use with the children: words like “toilet”, “teacher” and “happy”. Adaptations to classroom spaces and learning materials were also made. Letters of the alphabet and pictures designating different corners of the classroom were accompanied by their equivalent in sign language. “The children with hearing loss can (use the signs) for a reference check, while the hearing children can learn alongside them,” said Chen. Even so, she and her team “didn’t know what to expect” when the 2022 school year began and the children came in. “My teachers and I … just (had to) wait and see,” she said. One of those children joining in K1 was Azza, who was previously in an early intervention centre. She was excited to be going to a new school and had practised introducing herself in sign language. But on her first day, she froze on the spot, recounted her mother, Norasyikin Jaafar. “Maybe because there were so many unfamiliar people in class.” Azza, then 6, already had a head start over the other three children with hearing loss: She was the only one who knew some basic sign language, picked up from her two elder sisters, who also had hearing loss, and her mother, who was learning sign from YouTube videos. “I had to memorise a lot, and sometimes I’d still forget (the signs),” said Norasyikin. “It was very difficult.” It is common to see hearing parents of children with hearing loss end up feeling “lost”, according to Pung, because learning to sign “is like learning a completely new language”. In some cases, parents may be encouraged to try other modes of communication for their child, such as the oral approach, which uses speech, she said. “That’s another difficulty parents may face — being torn between the many different ideas people have.” Children with moderate to severe hearing loss can attend centres offering the Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (Eipic), or Canossaville Preschool, which specialises in supporting children with hearing loss, or the MOE Kindergarten @ Mayflower. Eipic centres, however, take children with various disabilities and may not have teachers who use sign language, said Barbara D’Cotta, a training manager at the Singapore Association for the Deaf (SADeaf). Mainstream kindergartens are also an option. But she said the child’s ability to cope depends on his or her circumstances, such as degree of hearing loss, family support available and the pre-school’s ability to cater for the child’s needs. Learning sign language guarantees the child full access to communication at the earliest possible time. There are also other modes of communication, such as assistive devices (hearing aids or cochlear implants) and use of voice, which may require speech therapy. There are no drawbacks to exploring all these options, said D’Cotta. The different modes complement each other, and the child can use different modes in different scenarios. SADeaf also runs a communication programme called the Little Hands Bilingual-Bicultural Programme, which provides early communication and intervention for children with hearing loss. It is not meant, however, to be a substitute for pre-school. Its bilingual approach — whereby both Singapore Sign Language and English are taught — provides children with a choice between using either language, depending on their hearing skills, environment and what they feel more comfortable using. Children can start on the programme from the age of two. It prepares the child to acquire Singapore Sign Language and for early reading and writing in English, which are prerequisites for the transition to pre-school. A termly fee of S$4,000 is charged, but parents who have difficulty paying the fees are referred to SADeaf’s Community Services Department. Social workers will carry out a means test and apply for funding from other organisations. As a result, children may start kindergarten with “little to no language”, and Pung cited a “significant difference” in language ability between the hearing children and their peers with hearing loss when they began K1. “Hearing children can communicate and tell us what their name is, what they like or dislike, but the children with hearing loss may not know (how to),” she said. A child with hearing loss might know what a tree is, for example, but not be able to tell people what they saw. Children with hearing loss also lose out on incidental learning, she added. “You pick up a lot of things from listening to other people’s conversations. But these children don’t.” At the MOE Kindergarten @ Mayflower, each lesson is taught concurrently by the speaking and signing teachers, so the children with hearing loss can learn alongside their peers. Pung also acts as interpreter for them, so they can participate fully in class activities by, for example, answering questions or singing songs. She said each song is sung twice: once in sign language and the other with actions. This also means the rest of the children in class end up picking up sign language, purely by exposure. When they go to mother tongue lessons, children with hearing loss will learn Singapore Sign Language in a separate room. Pung remembers that at the start of K1 for the four children, she communicated with them using simple gestures, such as by mimicking a duck, or showing a picture. As they progressed, she would introduce the relevant sign. “Teaching them sign language gives them the first language to communicate what they want,” she said. “When the foundation is built, we need to continue building their vocabulary bank so we can teach them … concepts.” This could take a lot of work on her part, especially when teaching more abstract concepts like kindness. Role-playing helps in instances like this; for example, she could have a child mimic a fall, and ask the others what they could do to help their friend. As the days went by, she saw improvement as well as the children’s increased confidence. She highlighted Thea in particular, who came in a few months later than her friends. “You could see she wanted to play with her friends but just didn’t have the language,” Pung recalled. “But she’d push herself — when she wants to answer a question and her friends try to help her, she’d tell them not to because she wants to think and learn.” Today, Thea can express her opinion, argue and negotiate with her friends, Pung said with a laugh. “We always say that arguing is a good thing because you have the language to do that.” Azza, too, has improved by leaps and bounds. Her mother remembers when she used to watch her sisters signing but not want to participate much. That is no longer the case. “She’s so confident (about) using sign language and talking to me and her sisters” said Norasyikin. “She’s able to tell me what happens in school and even wanted to teach (sign language) to my friend’s child, which made my friend’s child want to learn sign language. “I was so impressed that she was confident enough to teach other people using sign language. That made me proud of her.” Norasyikin gives credit to Azza’s early start and exposure to sign language in her kindergarten, something the two elder sisters — who attended early intervention centres where signing was not taught — did not have. Her eldest daughter, now 13, started learning sign language only just before she entered Mayflower Primary. “(Her) primary school teacher told me she was a bit behind in signing,” Norasyikin said. “It was hard for her to learn it at primary school because it was something so new to her.” The hearing children also benefit. When they first started K1, the teachers briefed them on how to interact with their peers with hearing loss. “They asked very genuine questions, like what (their classmates) were wearing (next to their ear) and why ‘they can’t hear me when I call them,’” said Pung. She explained hearing aids to them and suggested they could tap their friends on the shoulder if they wanted to get their attention. “Kids, being kids, … don’t see the difference in their friends,” said centre head Chen. “The only difference is they know that they need to use sign language to communicate with their friends.” Indeed, right from the start Pung observed the children playing and learning together “very naturally”. “Some of them would … ask (me) certain signs so they could, for example, sign to their friend that they wanted to build a castle,” she said. “They slowly learnt that ‘when I sign, my friend understands me, so I continue using (sign).’” As they progressed to K2, all this came much more naturally to them. Casual conversations between the different children became commonplace as they compared their friendship bracelets, built blocks together and even argued over crayons. “If you don’t see the (hearing aids), you don’t actually know who has hearing loss and who doesn’t,” said Pung. This was something mum Sangeetha Sivakumar appreciated when she saw how naturally her daughter, Khariessha Kanan, who is hearing, made friends with the other children. Sangeetha had found out only during Khariessha’s orientation that there would be children with hearing loss in the class. “I was thrilled,” she recalled. “But I did have some concerns (about) whether she’d be able to communicate — would she be able to show kindness and patience or be confused or frustrated? “Then I realised that nothing could help her prepare for it until she was in that environment.” By the end of the second week, Khariessha would come home and try to teach her parents the sign language she had picked up. She refers to her “sign language friends” in a “matter-of-fact way”, and they are part of her group of friends in class, said her mother. “(Being in this class) has helped her be more expressive and pay a bit more attention to other people when it comes to their hand gestures, facial expressions and body language,” said Sangeetha. “When she (is in) environments where she’s not familiar with other kids, she usually takes the first step (and asks them) if they’d like to play with her. “It could’ve been sparked off by how (she’s) able to play together with different children in the same classroom.” Classroom visitors, too, have expressed surprise at how naturally the children interact with each other. “They’d say things like, ‘Wow, I can’t tell the difference,’” said Pung. She believes these observations come about because of a lack of awareness or direct exposure to people with hearing loss. “When (people) see someone or a child having a disability, they may feel (that) maybe that child can’t do (certain things), but actually (children) can learn and play together, if given the support in the classroom,” she said. The kindergarten teachers, too, have grown over the past two years. When the children with hearing loss first started K1, Chen was “very quiet” and hesitant to use the simple signs she had learnt. “Everything was just ‘good, good, good,’” she said, making the thumbs-up sign. As the weeks went by, she realised that if she were to sign to the children more, their confidence would grow as well. “The children feel good because I’m speaking their language,” she said. In mid-2022, Chen and some of her teachers went on a Singapore Sign Language course conducted by the Singapore Association for the Deaf, which spanned 24 hours, to build their vocabulary and confidence. It was done in their own time, on weeknights or at weekends. Since then, all the kindergarten’s teachers have completed the course, and many of them have chosen to go on to the next level of the course. Chen herself has completed the third level. “Instead of just saying ‘good’, I can say things like, ‘It’s nice’, ‘I like it’, and so on,” she said. Ivy Tham, who teaches the K2 pupils, together with Pung, also highlighted the benefits of doing the course. “Initially, I relied very heavily on Bernadette, and I’d feel worried and lost if she had to go off for breaks,” she said. “Now that I’m able to communicate better with the children, I feel that they’re closer to me. “They’ll come over and tell me what they did over the weekend or what they’ve eaten for lunch.” Chen can see the difference it has made to her teachers. “When they sign to the children, … the satisfaction is there (on their faces),” she said. Nonetheless, both Tham and Chen highlighted the need for constant practice to maintain their fluency. Every now and then, Chen sits in on Pung’s Singapore Sign Language lessons for the children to familiarise herself with the signs. Things remain a work in progress. Chen and her team are constantly seeing how they can make adaptations to their practices and learning spaces to better support the children. A recent modification to the kindergarten’s outdoor play area, once set up with different-coloured shapes on the walls and the floor to encourage the children to play Twister, involved the addition of two spinners labelled with signs. The spinners were added after teachers realised the children with hearing loss could not participate in the game, as they could not name the colours and shapes out loud. The question now is, how ready are the children for primary school? To help with the transition, the kindergarten arranged for them to visit the adjoining Mayflower Primary, where they were paired up with buddies and got to sit in on a class. But for most if not all the children, the highlight of the day was visiting the canteen and buying food, with help from their buddies. Azza and Thea, now best friends and never far away from each other, beamed from ear to ear as they sat at a table eating their food. They signed to each other furtively as Pung, who was sitting nearby, observed them. “They don’t want me to see what they’re signing,” she said with a smile. Her smile broadened when she saw Thea signing to her Primary 6 buddy, who also has hearing loss. “She’s saying that she wants to come back to the canteen again,” said Pung. It was clear to Pung that the first batch of children with hearing loss to graduate from the kindergarten were brimming with confidence — and ready for their next stage of life, at Mayflower Primary, where they can benefit from the same teaching model as the kindergarten. “I’ll definitely miss them,” she said. “But I hope they’ll continue to be brave and confident as they go on to Primary 1.” When asked if the programme will be extended to other MOE Kindergartens (MKs), the ministry said the number of children in Singapore diagnosed with moderate to severe hearing loss who require signing is expected to remain low. “MOE considers factors such as demand for the programme and the availability of MK teachers with signing competencies,” said a spokesperson. “Similar factors are also taken into consideration when deciding whether to implement specialised programmes for children with other special educational needs.” The ministry added that children with mild hearing loss can be supported in other MKs with assistive technology like hearing aids. Back at the Mayflower kindergarten, two children with hearing loss have started K1 in the new school year. As Pung sees it, there is plenty of work to be done to equip them with the skills and language they need to do well, not only at primary school but in life. It is their perseverance and willingness to learn that “really keeps me going”, she said. “I definitely have to be there to support and teach them.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider What if your parent is your classmate? The programme On The Red Dot documents the stories of four parents who join their teenage children in school to understand what it is like being a secondary school student in Singapore nowadays. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: She is the chairperson of her secondary school’s Chinese Dance co-curricular activity (CCA) and sits on her student council’s executive committee as a level co-ordinator for her cohort. Wong Shan Ni also likes taking part in competitions such as the annual National Text Recital Competition for pupils studying Chinese language. Among her subjects, mathematics gives her “the most trouble”. So last year in Secondary Three, she started attending maths consultations with her teacher. Her father, Steven Wong, knows she has a hectic schedule. “When she’s home, she’d say she’s very tired,” he said. But until recently, he could not get his mind around what keeps her so busy. WATCH: Dad doesn’t get why school stresses me out — so he’s coming to classes with me (7:03) “I don’t really tell my dad so much about my secondary school life because he doesn’t really understand what happens in our school,” said Shan Ni, a student at Riverside Secondary School. Another parent of a teenage student is Janice Soh, who believes she has a “pretty close” relationship with her son, Apelles Yeo. “I know quite a bit of Apelles’ school life,” she said — at least, she thought so. Her son, a student at Bowen Secondary School, said: “I don’t go into details, so it’s mostly surface-level stuff. … My mum only knows about 40 per cent of my school life.” To gain first-hand insight into contemporary student life and reconnect with their teenage children, Wong, Soh and two other parents went back to secondary school for six weeks during the second semester last year. It meant adapting to an educational system that some of the parents found to be vastly different from their school days. Could they even survive the first week? The programme On The Red Dot followed them and their children in the four-part series My Parent, My Classmate — in the end finding out whether going through academic and co-curricular pressure together strengthened or strained their relationships. For Secondary One student Dian Hannani, the journey that she and her mother, Mazni Senain, were embarking on seemed “quite weird”, she said at the start. “She’s older than most of my teachers,” said the Kranji Secondary School student. “Then suddenly she becomes a classmate.” It had been 35 years since Mazni was in Secondary One herself, and she was “very nervous” during the first week. Her daughter, however, was “not helping”. WATCH: Part 1 — Singaporean parents attend secondary school with their kids (22:57) “She’s so quiet. When I ask her questions, she’s like, ‘Mm, okay. Mm,’” Mazni complained half in jest. “I feel a bit offended because she’s not welcoming me as a classmate.” That was something one of the On The Red Dot producers noticed too. Dian was talking to her friends more than her mother. Asked about this, she said: “Because they’re my friends and they’re not my mum. That’s why. When her mother wanted to go to the canteen at recess, she did not want to. But that did not stop Mazni, who “found a friend” — her daughter’s classmate Jovianne — to accompany her to the canteen. For Dian, this was “a turn of events” because she and Jovianne were “two different characters”. “I don’t really talk loudly. I’m not a playful person,” she said, describing her classmate. “My mum said that Jovianne was a very nice girl. I’m not sure how to think of it, but I’ll give her a chance.” It turned out to be the start of a blossoming friendship between Jovianne and Dian together with Mazni — one of the highlights of the series. WATCH: Caught in a friendship triangle with my mum — are we all still friends now? (10:15) Another highlight was Apelles’ mother joining his CCA: Military band. The Secondary Three student was “quite excited” about it, but his mother was “worried about the PT (physical training)” she would have to do with his band. It included planking exercises, star jumps and the sight of band leader Apelles commanding the band members, “Go! Go!” as his mother stood around, tired out. At one point, he shouted: “Janice, why (didn’t you) jump? Everyone else jumped.” “I had to call her by her name because I didn’t want my mother to be treated like … my mother,” he said. “Instead, I want to let her experience what it’s like being a student.” Soh concluded: “He’s quite scary when he’s a leader. He’s very firm.” WATCH: Part 2 — Mum joins band practice, trains under her son (22:46) Usually, parents are the ones telling their children what they should do or telling them things like, they could have scored higher on their tests. But when parents must take the tests too, the boot is on the other foot. That was among the experiences of the parents that the series explored. Diana Raja, for example, thinks her daughter, Arradana, could pay more attention to her mother tongue subject, Tamil, and put more effort into speaking it. But when Diana had to take a Secondary Two test, alongside her daughter at Christ Church Secondary School, she had “1,000 butterflies” in her stomach. “I can speak Tamil well,” she said. “But if you ask me about writing, I’m not good at it.” The written test was a weighted assessment, which students take throughout the year. These evaluations contribute to their grades at the end of the year. Before the test results were out, Diana had one “main concern” as a mother. “If I (score) lower than (Arradana), she’s going to tell me, ‘Mum, firstly, … you didn’t even score well, so don’t come and tell me to study or do this,’” Diana said. So how did she score? And how did she handle it? All is revealed in the series; her daughter, for one, passed. WATCH: Part 3 — Mums take difficult exams with their children (22:58) So far, the four episodes have chalked up more than 300,000 views on YouTube. Viewer @sanmikim felt the series was “pretty good”. “Now parents can understand how students struggle in daily life,” she wrote, citing the early mornings and late nights. With her busy schedule, which included dance lessons outside school, Shan Ni was one who was filmed burning the midnight oil of homework. Viewer @goguma2830 was “very impressed” by her. “This girl is self-directed, hard-working and humble,” the viewer wrote on YouTube. WATCH: Part 4 — Parents experience teenage stress with their kids (22:29) Wong also gained a deeper appreciation of his daughter’s workload as he immersed himself in her routine and witnessed her emotional roller-coaster as she prepared for last year’s Chinese text recital competition. He also grappled with the complexities of Secondary Three mathematics during classes and consultations with her teacher. “I find many aspects of what Shan Ni is studying quite challenging,” he said. With the experience of having her father in school, Shan Ni has more topics to talk about with him, she said. “He’s able to empathise with me … and think (from) my perspective,” she added. “I hope that throughout the future, … we can talk about my school life a little bit more.” Watch the On The Red Dot series My Parent, My Classmate here .

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider They respond to various 995 calls and are always in a race against time to save lives. But non-emergencies can take precious resources away from critical patients who rely on SCDF responders, depriving them of an earlier ambulance response. CNA Insider gets unprecedented access to the Singapore Civil Defence Force’s medical emergency services team. In partnership with the Singapore Civil Defence Force SINGAPORE: The 995 call came in on a Monday morning. An epileptic patient at a residential care home had gone into convulsions. Within 15 minutes of being assigned to the case, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance crew from Central Fire Station were by the patient’s side and checking his vital signs. It was a Priority 1+ emergency — the most time-sensitive and highest level of urgency. As paramedic Sergeant 2 (SGT2) Andrea Ang called out to the patient and checked his eyes, he moaned. He was having another fit. The ambulance crew quickly turned him onto his side for Ang to administer the emergency drug diazepam. But the first dose did not stop the seizure. “That’s when we knew that it was very important to rush him to the hospital as soon as possible,” recounted Ang. “Because if we didn’t stop the seizure, he may have eventually stopped breathing or gone into cardiac arrest.” In the ambulance, she hooked the patient up to a pulse oximeter to monitor his blood oxygen level – then had to dispense more diazepam as he suffered another epileptic seizure. Without such interventions, continuous fits may lead to permanent brain damage or death. She also took a moment to pat the distressed man on the shoulder, assuring him: “We go to the hospital, okay?” Ang keyed the man’s vital signs and other critical medical information into a tablet. These were instantly fed to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) where emergency medical staff — alerted by SCDF’s operations centre — prepared a resuscitation room ahead of the patient’s arrival. SGH consultant in emergency medicine Joanna Chan noted the timeliness of the ambulance crew’s intervention and updates on the patient. “This helps us to decide what to do next: whether we can give the next dose of medication immediately or delay it for a while to make sure that we don’t cause treatment side-effects,” she said. This was just one of the 670 medical emergency calls a day that are made to the 995 line. And each time, a well-oiled emergency response system kicks into action — from dozens of call-takers and ambulance despatchers at the SCDF operations centre, to ambulance crews at fire stations and fire posts around the island, and the medical teams at hospital emergency wards. In many cases, such as trauma, strokes and heart attacks, minutes can make the difference between life and death, between an eventual full recovery and a futile one. But some calls — 46 a day, on average — turn out to be non-emergencies or false alarms. Last year, there were a total of 17,009 such calls. Tending to such cases can come at a cost to a patient in a genuine crisis. “Consider a scenario where an individual who experiences wrist pain calls 995. This takes vital resources away from life-threatening emergencies such as a cardiac arrest,” said Colonel (COL) Hong Dehan, SCDF’s chief medical officer. WATCH: On call with Singapore’s emergency medical services — When minutes can mean life or death (20:27) The nerve centre of this emergency response system sits in an underground facility in the heart of Ubi, at SCDF headquarters. The lines are manned 24-7 by staff working 12-hour shifts; they include nurses, civilians and full-time national servicemen. They work alongside ambulance despatchers and monitoring officers who liaise with the ambulance crews and hospitals. The staff have eyes on the fire stations through the closed-circuit television cameras; and on expressways and road conditions, displayed on a bank of screens in the front of the room. The call-takers, seated in front of curved computer monitors showing details of each case, answer each call in calm, measured tones. One instructed a caller whose father was unconscious: “I need you to put your hand on his stomach and feel whether there’s any rise and fall.” On another line, a frantic caller sobbed: “There’s an uncle, my neighbour, he’s not moving. I don’t know what to do.” The call-taker calmed her down and asked for details. Each call-taker asks a methodical series of questions, with the caller’s replies entered into the computer network. An Advanced Medical Protocol System helps triage the cases according to the level of urgency. “The most urgent questions that we ask right at the beginning of most calls is whether the person is conscious (and) is breathing normally,” said National University Hospital senior consultant Benjamin Leong, a member of the SCDF’s medical advisory committee. “If they’re not conscious and not breathing, that would identify cardiac arrest, and I’d immediately despatch the ambulance.” In such cases, while the ambulance is en route, the call-taker guides the caller through the steps of administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). It is critical to keep blood flowing to the brain. An alert is also sent out to community first-responders through the myResponder app. “Every minute that nothing’s done, the chance of survival actually drops by 10 per cent,” said Warrant Officer 2 (WO2) Kenneth Foong, an advanced paramedic from Marina Bay Fire Station. Operations centre personnel are aided by an emergency video system, rolled out by SCDF and the Singapore Police Force last year to enable a live-view of the scene — such as at fires and accidents — through the caller’s phone. In the case of medical emergencies, the nurses on duty at the operations centre can, for instance, use it to assess whether an unconscious patient might be in cardiac arrest, or to guide callers. “Turn him onto his right side so (that) his breathing is easier,” senior staff nurse Geraldine Goh instructed a caller, watching as they put the patient in a recovery position. Over at the fire stations, each ambulance crew typically responds to five to seven calls over a 12-hour shift. The day shift starts at 8 a.m. and the night shift at 8 p.m. The day shift typically sees more medical emergency cases, ranging from seizures to chest pains to road accidents. The weekends, including Fridays and eves of public holidays, bring more cases at public entertainment outlets — often involving intoxicated revellers or fights. The crews do not only treat and convey patients, but also are in communication with the operations centre and the hospital while on the move, feeding information to the hospitals’ Emergency Department via the Electronic Patient Management System. At the hospital, they ensure a smooth transition of patient care to the emergency physicians or even help reassure patients if need be. Some days, there is little respite from this whirlwind of activity. Returning to Central Fire Station after attending to one call, advanced paramedic SGT3 Muhammad Zuhaili had barely time to put down a takeaway bag of dinner when a new call came in — and his crew headed out again. Interrupted meals are not uncommon for emergency responders; they sometimes return to cold dinners or lunches, or missed meals altogether. But this time, the caller was someone familiar. It was a 40-year-old man who had dialled 995 many times in recent months with similar medical complaints about “suffocating” and breathing difficulties. Just recently, he had rung for an ambulance three days in a row. As they set out, Zuhaili called the man to check in with him. “I feel breathless,” the man said. Because breathing difficulties are typically triaged as P1+ cases, the ambulance crew decided to beat a red light, with sirens blaring. Zuhaili does not take these calls lightly — no matter the caller. “When we go to the scene, we don’t judge, we don’t form assumptions immediately. We make our checks, and then we come to a diagnosis,” he said. Zuhaili examined the man and assessed that the matter was not life-threatening. But as the patient had complained of chest pain, he was conveyed to hospital, where he was triaged as a P2 or moderate emergency. Explaining how chest pain can cover a wide spectrum of conditions, SGH senior consultant and clinician scientist Marcus Ong, who is also a member of the SCDF’s medical advisory committee, said: “You can have something as serious as a heart attack, but 80 to 90 per cent of patients aren’t having one. They could be having, for example, musculoskeletal pain (or) heart burn.” In such cases it may be better to play it safe — but other calls are more obviously of a non-emergency nature. Some people may call 995 even when they have a toothache, according to COL Dennis Quah, commander of the SCDF’s operations centre. Other minor complaints have included an elderly man who had calf pain and did not want to walk to the clinic; and a caller who cut her finger on broken glass. Last year, SCDF ambulances responded to 6,285 false alarm calls. The biggest group of callers for minor emergencies (P3) and non-emergencies (P4) are aged 30 to 49. Callers 29 and under make up a third of P4 cases. One caller felt dizzy after being in the sun. As his blood sugar and blood pressure were normal, the paramedic who checked him filled in a treat-and-discharged form that he could take to a polyclinic if he felt unwell again. “When our paramedics arrive at the scene, and they assess the patient and deem that it’s a non-emergency, they won’t convey (the patient) to the nearest hospital,” said Quah. The list includes: Traffic and worksite accidents, uncontrollable bleeding, broken bones, sudden severe chest pain or breathlessness, drug overdose or poisoning, choking with difficulty in breathing, sudden abdominal pain that doesn’t subside, loss of consciousness, and head injuries with bleeding, drowsiness or vomiting. Non-emergency cases include: Mild fever, coughs and colds, small bruises or cuts, localised rash or insect bites, chronic aches, superficial burns, and mild diarrhoea or vomiting. Besides seeing a GP or polyclinic, non-emergency patients can access telemedicine providers or go to an urgent care centre, like the one at Admiralty operated by Woodlands Health or at Alexandra Hospital. They can also call the NurseFirst helpline (6262-6262). “If any of these services direct you to call 995, please don’t hesitate — just to make sure that everything is safe for you,” advised National University Hospital senior consultant Benjamin Leong, a member of the SCDF’s medical advisory committee. As part of the SCDF’s non-conveyance policy, on-site treatment is provided where needed, and callers will be advised to see a general practitioner (GP) or visit a polyclinic. They can also call 1777 for a private ambulance. But sometimes, even when it is not an emergency, patients insist on being transported to hospital. It may be that some expect a free ride or to be given priority once they arrive. In truth, non-emergency patients conveyed to hospital by the SCDF are subject to a S$274 fee. By comparison, most private ambulance services charge between S$90 and S$260 for a trip to the emergency department. And while genuine emergency patients conveyed by SCDF ambulances do bypass the usual hospital triage process and “go straight to the resuscitation room”, said Ong, non-emergency patients may face a long wait to see a specialist after being triaged. “We prioritise whom we see first and whom we treat first based on the limited resources that we have,” said Ong. “Minutes are important.” In trauma, for instance, there is the concept of the “golden hour”, he noted. “What happens in the first 60 minutes after you sustain an injury has the biggest impact on whether you live or you die.” If patients come in with a non-emergency, they divert “resources, time and attention away from other patients who might be having a true emergency”, he added. Achieving better health outcomes is precisely what brings operations centre rota commander, Captain Sasi Kumar, professional fulfilment. “We want to ensure that the patients have been given the best medical attention,” he said. “We really hope that the patients are able to survive. … It gives us a sense of happiness.” For Ang, she finds meaning in how her role in the SCDF “really makes a difference in people’s lives”. “You see that your efforts (haven’t) gone to waste. They smile at you at the end of the day, and they say thank you.” Zuhaili enjoys the camaraderie that is part of the job. “There’s nothing quite like going out together with a single purpose — to help someone.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider How are the papers marked? How fair or strict are the markers? What should pupils do for a good result? PSLE science chief marker Jay Mahardale tackles these issues and more. More than four in 10 primary school teachers are mobilised for PSLE marking, which is done online after scripts are scanned and uploaded to an on-screen marking system. (Image: MOE/SEAB) SINGAPORE: As the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) science chief marker for the past five years, Jay Mahardale has noticed something rather encouraging about the way the exam papers are marked. There is acknowledgement on the markers’ part that there are alternative answers to different kinds of questions, he said. Take, for example, a question involving spectacles and water: When the wearer comes out of a cold environment, the glasses will mist — but why do the water droplets disappear after some time? “We’re looking out for … the key concept, which is about water evaporating,” said Mahardale, who is also the principal of Northland Primary School. “But if a student is able to show that water gains heat and turns into water vapour, they don’t need to use the term ‘evaporate’. They can just show the understanding (of) the concept. “We now honour a lot more of our students’ responses. … That’s really a plus point.” The word “honour” often cropped up when he sat down with CNA Insider to share marking insights and exam tips as well as tackle the issue of how fair PSLE markers are. The interview is part of a series of digital-exclusive clips under the programme Regardless of Grades . And it is not only science markers who accept alternative responses, he said. This is also the case in mathematics, which is taught in Singapore’s primary schools using the model method. “Some of our students are able to express their solution through a different method, such as using algebra. And I think we want to honour our students’ responses,” he said. So long as the methods are mathematically sound, “we’re able to give them the marks for that”. WATCH: How to score in PSLE? Chief marker shares marking insights, exam preparation tips for students (15:02) As he lifted the veil on the marking process, Mahardale answered these 10 questions that may be on the minds of parents and pupils alike: The preliminary marking scheme is conceptualised by the chief exam setter. There is then a standardisation meeting at the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) with key personnel such as chief markers at the PSLE marking centres, which will cover the “possible, acceptable and non-acceptable answers as well”. “We also take a look at students’ sample scripts, just to have a sense about how students may respond to the questions,” said Mahardale. “Then we’ll decide on (how to update) the marking scheme.” While the sample scripts are chosen randomly, “we have a good spread of responses from different schools”, he added. Once the marking scheme is finalised, the key personnel will go through it with markers at the marking centres. And all the marking is done online now; the scripts are scanned and uploaded to an on-screen marking system. To help ensure consistent, accurate and fair assessment, PSLE markers are given a practice session with scripts pre-marked by the chief marker. “Once the teachers try out the questions, it helps them to … have a good understanding (of) how to be consistent in their approaches in awarding the marks,” said Mahardale. If certain markers need more assistance before marking the actual papers, then more guidance is provided, he added. “Because of that, we’re able to ensure a very rigorous, very thoughtful process that allows for students’ responses to be accepted.” To ensure good subject knowledge, the markers deployed would be the respective subject teachers, nominated by the schools and the SEAB. Beyond proficiency, Mahardale said it was important that markers are “flexible in their marking” so that they are “sensitive” to whether pupils show good conceptual understanding, which may not always be clear from the written answers. Markers also specialise in “just a few” of the open-ended questions, based on the number of markers and the complexity of the question. “Because we narrow (down) the questions that they’re marking, we don’t usually see markers who are more stringent than the others,” he added. During the actual marking, markers will also find that some answers were not covered during the initial standardisation. “If we find that these are possible answers that we should use to update our marking scheme, … we’ll update SEAB,” said Mahardale. “That’s how we evolve the marking scheme.” This process can take place “very fast” because SEAB personnel will be on hand. “They know that during … the first day of marking, there may be the possibility of a lot of queries from the key personnel as well as markers,” he said. “They’re there to respond and to make a decision quickly about … applying any updates to the marking scheme across all the centres.” As a control measure, random checks are done on 5 to 10 per cent of scripts using the on-screen marking system. If there are answers not marked accurately, “we’ll go to the markers, and we’ll have a conversation”, he said. Those markers could have applied the marking scheme inaccurately. “But we also want to hear from the markers (about) how they applied their understanding of that particular marking point to that question and that response,” said Mahardale. By and large, he added, “we do reach a consensus”. The focus on conceptual understanding means the marking scheme focuses less on keywords in answers. The question on evaporation is an example. But external tuition — or, in his words, “additional lessons outside of school” — might account for some parents’ “fixation” on keywords. “They aren’t privy to the context of the learning environment in the school,” said Mahardale. “So when they’re helping the students to answer questions better, they tend to focus a lot on the keywords.” But even as answers can be varied, “we’ve also got to strike a bit of a balance in terms of the level of scientific literacy”, he added. He gave another example: For an exam question on the temperature of hot water in a cup, the expected answer would include the temperature unit. “These are scientific literacy skills that I think our students mustn’t forego in the pursuit of allowing (them) to use their own terms in explaining scientific concepts,” he said. WATCH: Diana gets real with Education Minister Chan Chun Sing about the PSLE (12:31) When it comes to open-ended questions, there are two main types. The first tests pupils on basic knowledge. The second tests them on the application of that knowledge to different science scenarios. Mahardale has realised that “many students may (find) the open-ended questions challenging” because some scenarios, to them, “might be very unique”. “But what I always assure my teachers and my students as well is that … everything that you’re tested (on) is within the syllabus,” he said. “Ask yourself: What concepts am I being tested (on) in this particular scenario?” He encouraged pupils (and parents) to see science as a subject they can get better at when they are more curious about how things around them work. “That’s when they’ll learn how to connect the concepts that they learn in the classroom to the scenarios that are presented to them in the open-ended questions,” he said. Pupils are not marked down for poor spelling and grammar. “What’s important is that our students are able to express themselves and … show clarity in the conceptual understanding that they’re trying to convey,” said Mahardale. If it is clear enough for the markers, “we’ll allocate marks to our students”. In terms of marking maths papers, teachers do not only look at the final answer. Marks may be awarded for method even if the final answers are wrong. “We do take a look at the whole response and see whether students have shown understanding in the method,” said Mahardale. This includes methods such as algebra and trigonometry, which would have been possible responses covered during the standardisation process. If markers are unsure about certain solutions, they can discuss them with the key personnel. “If the students are able to show very good mathematical reasoning, … then I think we’re able to give the marks for that response,” he said. He acknowledged that not all markers may be familiar with certain maths concepts — such as the Sakamoto method, an alternative to the model method for solving word problems. “What I can assure everyone is that there is that conversation, and (teachers) will be able to lean on each other’s expertise to ensure that we have a good understanding about how to allocate those marks,” he said. Mahardale also gave assurances that the PSLE is not getting more difficult. “A lot of the papers that we set … are very fair,” he said. “The demands are pegged (to) what we’d see in our primary school students.” He described science questions that may stump some pupils as “interesting”, “creative” and “maybe out of the box”. “The onus is on us to ensure that we give our students a breadth of knowledge (and) grow their curiosity,” he said, adding that there is also a need to build thinking skills. “Once we’re able to do that, then our students will be (better) prepared (to) tackle such questions.” In the case of maths, the overall standard of the question paper has been “kept consistent” over the years, according to the SEAB, as determined by “the mix of easy, average and challenging questions” in the paper. Exam questions are set by a team of experienced teachers, plus specialists from the education ministry and the SEAB, who are “very familiar” with the primary school syllabuses and exam candidates’ “range of abilities”. The exam will “comprehensively cover” the topics taught in school, with a “good spread of questions across the different topics of the syllabus over six years”, a spokesperson said. Among the maths topics are fractions, decimals, ratios, statistics and geometry. What is important, said Mahardale, is to get pupils to “understand the expectations and … the standards of a formal examination”. For him, a good rule of thumb is that “we should spend 80 per cent of our time making sure that our kids understand the concepts”, with the remaining time spent on teaching them the skills to tackle exam papers. In his experience, pupils sometimes “try to cram (in) a lot of responses” to a given question. This could be due to pupils “memorising information without applying it to the context of the question” and “hoping that we’ll pick up on some of these things”, said Mahardale. But markers must ensure that “whatever that’s conveyed by the students doesn’t show any misconceptions as well”, he added. “And if the students do show misconception, … we’d have to penalise the misconception.” Instead of pupils regurgitating concepts, he would like them to answer to the question. They should also note that the marks allocated to the question are not necessarily indicative of how much to write. “We need to teach our kids skills such as being able to discern the depth of questions and their responses,” he said. “If a question asks you for a definition, then it’s very straightforward. He thinks it is important for pupils to analyse and better understand the scenarios in the questions. “For example, you have a picture of an experimental set-up. They need to … see how this set-up is related to a concept that they’ve learnt,” he cited. The way to do this — in any exam paper — is to take time to understand what kind of answer is expected, rather than “jump into responding too quickly”, he said. “Looking at the demands of the paper that we have, I think there’s enough time for our students … to do that well.” WATCH: Ask me anything with Singapore Education Minister Chan Chun Sing (7:27) Practically speaking, if pupils find a certain question challenging and are stuck, they should move on to more familiar questions, which can serve as a confidence booster, Mahardale advised. Conversely, if they “spend too much time trying to tackle a question”, it may sap their morale, “and they might not be confident in tackling the rest of the questions”. “(Exam) planning and time management is definitely something that we teach our kids,” he said. If pupils are stuck on maths questions in particular, his advice is to try their best to “show some form of understanding”, since marks may be awarded for method. WATCH: Students get real with Education Minister Chan Chun Sing (11:42) He noted that the PSLE is an “important milestone” for pupils and “high stakes” for the parents who see it as “an opportunity to (give their children) good secondary school choices”. But his view is that the PSLE “isn’t an end point” but a “checkpoint”. “It’s an opportunity for us to apply the things we’ve learnt in primary school (as) best we can,” he said. Directing this point to pupils, he added: “Use your PSLE as an opportunity to express yourself, to grow, and see it as just the first phase of your life being completed. “The results don’t define you as a person.” Watch the four digital exclusive clips on CNA Insider’s YouTube channel , which include interviews and a kids’ chat with Education Minister Chan Chun Sing.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Even amid record urban youth unemployment, official data may not paint a full picture. Employers are increasingly asking for a master’s degree, even when roles do not justify it. The programme Insight finds out how Chinese youths are coping. Lingshan lives in an 8 sq m apartment and relies on livestreaming to eke out a living. NANJING: In 2015, when Lingshan was deciding what to study in university, China’s property market was booming and civil engineering seemed a lucrative choice. Fast forward seven years and Lingshan, who graduated with a master’s degree last year, is in an awkward situation. She has been unemployed for a year and is living in an apartment merely 8 square metres in size in the eastern city of Nanjing. “Why did I study civil engineering? Oh my, that was stupid,” said Lingshan, who asked to be identified by her online alias. “I’d wanted to work for a real estate developer, but by the time I graduated, they were going bust one after another,” she recalled. “I was hit in the face by the downturn.” China’s property crisis unfolded when developer Evergrande, which had over US$300 billion (S$410 billion) in liabilities, defaulted in 2021. Since then, c ompanies accounting for 40 per cent of Chinese home sales have defaulted, reported Reuters, and the crisis has now engulfed another major developer, Country Garden. According to Chinese media reports, the country’s top 50 property developers cut 200,000 jobs last year. With many homes unfinished and property prices continuing to decline, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Lingshan recently received another reality check from an employment consultant. “If you still want to stay in civil engineering, your resume is a bit awkward,” the consultant, Xu Hongfei, told her. “First, you’re a woman, so you can’t work at construction sites. Normally they hire men to do that,” he continued. “Also, most companies would only recruit from the graduating class. Right now, that’s the Class of 2024, and you graduated in 2022.” China’s unemployment data and social media chatter show Lingshan is not alone in her predicament. Urban unemployment of those aged 16 to 24 rose to a record high of 21.3 per cent in June, and a cohort of 11.6 million students finished tertiary education this summer to enter what’s possibly the toughest job market in recent history. According to an analysis by news provider CNBC of Chinese state media reports, a record 7.7 million people took the civil service exam in this year’s application round, vying for over 200,000 government jobs at the national and provincial level. The official statistics may also not paint a full picture. For one, there are people originally from rural areas who, when unable to find employment in cities, would return to their hometowns, said Bert Hofman, director of the National University of Singapore’s East Asian Institute. “As such, they aren’t measured as unemployed in urban areas,” he said. Last month, the Chinese government said it would temporarily stop releasing data on youth unemployment, citing the need to “ further improve and optimise labour force survey statistics ”. WATCH: China’s youth unemployment at record highs — Meet the jobless graduates (46:08) The cut-throat competition for jobs has led to Xu receiving new enquiries weekly. He helps fresh graduates navigate the job market and is currently working with 200 paying clients. When he left school in 2009, China was producing about half the number of graduates each year than now, he told the programme Insight. “It keeps getting more competitive,” he said. Employers are increasingly demanding at least a master’s degree for office jobs, even when the position hardly justifies it. “To an employer, hiring is costly,” said Xu. An employer may have this perspective: “I don’t have a lot of time to spend on hiring, I’m busy. So I’ll only pick among the master’s (degree holders),” Xu explained. “Of course, I know some bachelor’s (degree holders) are also outstanding, but employers have no time to discover (them).” Besides China’s zero-COVID policy and weaker-than-expected post-COVID recovery, Zhang Yifan, a professor from the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s (CUHK) department of economics, pointed to “questionable economic policies” that have made the job market tougher for youths. These include the regulatory crackdown on property developers’ accumulation of debt, which led to the implosion of the housing market, as well as curbs on the after-school tuition industry in a bid to reduce academic stress. The authorities also clamped down on influential tech companies like Tencent and Alibaba. “These industries all used to be very vibrant, and absorbed a lot of young workers,” said Zhang. Large private education company New Oriental Education Group, for instance, laid off more than 60,000 workers in 2021, he cited. Young jobseekers’ frustrations have been laid bare on social media. They have generated internet memes likening themselves to a fictional failed scholar named Kong Yiji, spawning the term “Kong Yiji literature” as well as a rap song that was swiftly censored by the government. Earlier this year, graduating master’s student Xiami posted an online video about his fruitless hunt. “I went to a job fair today, and it destroyed my last shred of confidence. Just look at the enormous amount of people there. The last time I saw this many people was when I went to do a COVID-19 test,” he said. It went viral, garnering close to half a million views on video site Bilibili. “I don’t think it was me (who) went viral, it was the difficulties of finding a job,” he told Insight. Xiami, who asked to be known by an alias, is the son of farmers in Shandong who moved to Shanghai for his studies — one of the few in his village to do so. He started his job search in February and sent “at least 200” resumes to potential employers. “I was initially optimistic,” said Xiami, who studied Chinese literature. “I thought I could find a job in three months. But six months later, I still couldn’t land anything. “I remember thinking — it’s time to wake up, there’s no future for me.” Xiami eventually landed a job as a management trainee with a parcel delivery company. He earns less than 10,000 yuan (S$1,860) a month and, as a start, will work as a rider. “I’ve taken it in stride,” he said simply. “At least I have a way forward.” Beyond the venting of unhappiness online, rising youth unemployment could pose a risk to China’s social and political stability. Observers note that at 21.3 per cent, China’s youth unemployment rate is just below the 23.4 per cent in the Arab region in 2010. High youth unemployment was “one of the factors contributing to the Arab Spring”, noted Zhang, the professor from CUHK, referring to the series of uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa in 2010 and 2011. There are also “strong links” between youth unemployment and social issues like drug abuse and crime. “It goes beyond the young people themselves and is very costly to society,” he said. There are also ramifications on China’s economy. There is a “scarring effect” from being out of employment for an extended spell. “(Their) skills may be obsolete after a long period of unemployment,” Zhang said. “It’ll have a long-lasting effect on the future. “Their income won’t be able to recover to the normal level, even with 10 or 15 years of work experience.” The youth account for about 20 per cent of consumption in China, said Louise Loo, China economist with Oxford Economics. “A big (source) of consumption is out of the workforce,” she said. “So that does affect the extent to which consumption can be a driver for growth in the long term.” The authorities have rolled out various measures to boost youth employment. Anhui and Guizhou provinces have asked state-owned enterprises to ensure at least half of their new hires are fresh graduates, news outlet South China Morning Post reported last month. In Hunan province, graduate recruitment has been added to the annual performance appraisals for executives in state companies, it reported. Henan province came up with a 100-day plan from May to August to “dynamically clear” youth unemployment. Measures included promoting jobs in public institutions and state-owned enterprises, second degrees, and grassroots or rural employment projects, Reuters reported. China’s youth unemployment situation highlights mismatches in skills and between the expectations of youths and employers. Qiang, who is from China’s southwest, recently graduated in eldercare — a relevant skill in a rapidly ageing country. But he is no longer keen on putting his degree to use. “It pays too little, and the hours are long,” he said. “You need to be on standby 24 hours a day and do night shifts. When on probation, the salary is only 1,500 to 2,000 yuan,” he said. “Even when you’re confirmed, you get paid 3,000 yuan at most.” Bantering with friends over a meal, one of them quipped: “Become a care worker? Who’s going to marry you? You want to be single forever? With the salary of a care worker, you can’t even afford to have a cat.” Another friend piped up: “Can’t even support yourself, forget about the cat.” Qiang’s parents, who own two restaurants, had hoped to help him open his own care centre after he graduated. But after three years of COVID-19 lockdowns, they no longer have the financial ability to do so. “As countries grow into becoming a middle-income economy, and aspire to be a high-income economy, the expectations of people also change,” said Maria Ana Lugo, a senior economist at the World Bank. Youths have higher expectations than their parents did back in the day and expect a certain level of income and type of work. People entering the labour force now are far better educated than those leaving the labour force, added Hofman. “(Those) leaving the labour force now, they’ve got about six to seven years of education. (Those) entering the labour force, they have about 12 years of education.” This will be good for China’s growth in the medium term, he said. But in the shorter term, there might be some issues of frictional unemployment and temporary “over-education”. If graduates are feeling demoralised, their peers with associate degrees or less are even more daunted. After speaking to some recruiters at a job fair in Ningxia, Ma Youhu, who has a three-year associate degree from a tertiary vocational training institution and past experience working in electronics factories, lamented: “Even bachelor’s (degree holders) can’t find jobs, let alone me. … That’s the reality. There’s nothing I can do.” His younger brother, Cunjun, graduated from high school in July and ventured to Xiamen in search of a job. He had done a previous stint at a factory in Xiamen that made cameras for iPhones. “In the first month, I got paid 4,000 yuan. Then it went up to 5,000 yuan. I gave 10,000 yuan to my family and bought myself a phone,” he recounted. “When I went back this year, the factory didn’t need more workers.” As some Western economies teeter on a recession and more countries seek to “de-risk” their economic dependence on China, the country’s exports have taken a hit and fallen year on year every month since May. Cunjun has tried farming, but his home in Xihaigu, on the Loess Plateau, is one of the driest places in China. With China’s Ministry of Education forecasting a shortage of nearly 30 million manufacturing workers by 2025, Cunjun may well find his way back to a factory in future. For now, he has a job at a construction site in Yinchuan, Ningxia’s capital, and was paid 300 yuan on his first day. The search continues for his brother Youhu, as it does for Lingshan. She has turned to livestreaming to pay the bills, putting her life on display for tips. A recent session bagged her over 20 yuan. “Thank you for feeding me,” she told her audience. “I want to buy a bowl of instant noodles. I can even afford to add some meat.” While she waits for online superstardom, she hunts for discounts and uses coupons on the online shopping platform Taobao, doing what she can to stretch her money. “I try to lower consumption in every possible way,” she said. “I don’t socialise or eat out. I don’t want an apartment or to get married. I just need some food to subsist.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider With the country’s marriage rate at an all-time low, the programme Insight explores the factors in play, from the changing attitudes of young Chinese to the cost of housing, and how authorities and parents are trying to reverse the trend. As women in China move up in society, fewer of them are getting married. Finance executive Zhao Miaomiao is one of them, but not for lack of trying. SHANGHAI: Last year, as her career took off following her move to Shanghai, China’s financial capital, finance executive Zhao Miaomiao felt it was time to look for a significant other. So she went on a series of blind dates. Using a dating app, she met “quite a lot” of guys in person — more than 100 — within three to four months. After they all struck out with her, she “realised that finding a partner is a really difficult task”. “The first thing (guys) look at is whether the woman is attractive. And then they proceed to understand her personality and family background,” said the 28-year-old. “However, … (women) prioritise the sincerity of the man. For example, they hope that the man who pursues them demonstrates effort and sincerity.” Over in Beijing, media executive Liu Shutong has a boyfriend, but “it doesn’t matter” to her whether she gets married or not in future. “First of all, what I want is to live in the present,” she declared. And that is a general attitude she sees among her peers. “Nowadays, young people prioritise their current happiness, embracing a hedonistic lifestyle,” said the 24-year-old, who herself takes pleasure in ballet, yoga and shopping with friends. “We feel that … whether you choose marriage or not, you’re still happy.” Whether by choice or otherwise, more young Chinese clearly are not getting married. In the past decade, the number of marriages has halved. Last year, 6.83 million couples tied the knot — an all-time low since records began in 1986. Compared with Singapore, where 6.5 marriages per 1,000 residents were registered in 2021, the corresponding figure in China was 5.4 marriages per 1,000 people. Among the urban youth, 44 per cent of Chinese women do not plan to marry, compared with nearly a quarter of the men, according to a 2021 survey conducted by the Communist Youth League. While a decline in marriage has become a global phenomenon — almost 90 per cent of the world’s population live in countries with falling marriage rates — and the reasons can be complex, there are also particular factors in play in China. The programme Insight finds out what is getting in the way of young Chinese finding love, and the different ways the authorities — and parents — are trying to reverse the trend. One person who can offer an insight into why young Chinese are not coupling up is professional matchmaker Qian Lei, 27. WATCH: Love(less) in China — Why aren’t young Chinese getting married? (45:53) “In general, if a man tries to find a partner in the matchmaking market, he may say he doesn’t need a rich or beautiful woman, but he’s actually picky,” she said. “He’s looking for someone who gives him a good first impression, and this is when he becomes more selective.” As to why girls may reject a guy, it may be “because he doesn’t meet their height requirements”, said Qian. “Girls tend to value height a lot, and they often prefer guys who are at least 1.7 metres tall.” Such eligibility “criteria” may seem superficial but are one aspect of the changing views on love and marriage in China. The country’s rapid development has also created a mismatch between what men and women want in marriage, with China’s social conservatism at odds with decades of female empowerment. “China’s transition from traditional to modern values has been very short. Other countries and regions may have taken 50 or 100 years, but we’ve experienced this phenomenon in just 20 to 30 years,” said sociologist Zhu Hong at Nanjing University. Prior to 1999, when the government decided to expand the higher education system, women made up as little as 20 per cent of university admissions. Female enrolment has since overtaken male enrolment at universities, hovering at 52 per cent for some years now. Accordingly, women’s economic independence has increased, and Mao Zedong’s famous phrase, “women hold up half the sky”, has become a reality. But gender roles have not kept up with women’s socio-economic status — “all the housework” and the responsibility for child-rearing will fall mainly to them after marriage, said Jean Yeung, a Provost-Chair Professor of sociology at the National University of Singapore. “The opportunity cost of getting married is really, really high for a woman these days. And so, since marriage is no longer a necessity, a lot of women hesitate to go in (on it).” The difference between what men and women want is especially clear in the cities, added Hang Seng Bank (China) chief economist Wang Dan. “Most women are looking for love, and most men are looking for a wife. “The difference in their purpose also causes a very different attitude. And we’ve seen a lot of frustration when it comes to closing the deal, on both sides, on whether they want to get married.” More time spent at school and the focus on careers also mean a delay in marriage, which is common as countries develop. But in China, this has led to the term “sheng nu” (leftover women), used to describe single women in their late 20s and 30s. They are deemed undesirable owing to fertility concerns over their age. China’s falling marriage rate could also be partly due to the one-child policy, which was implemented nationwide in 1980 and ended on Jan 1, 2016. A whole generation of only children “grew up on their own”, noted Wang. “Naturally, they’re more individualistic than the previous generations.” And according to one study by the Ohio State University, only children are less likely to get married, compared to those with siblings. Each additional sibling is associated with a 3 per cent increase in the odds of getting married. The argument is that siblings provide children with opportunities to negotiate conflict at home, which could help in navigating friendships and romantic relationships later in life. Only children are also likely to be more independent and value their alone time. “To establish a marriage, they have to give up a bit of their individuality, a bit of their freedom. They also need to pay attention to the needs of their partner,” said Zhu. But she doubts their ability to do so. “Being an only child is truly special. … Grandparents and other relatives revolve around the child. That’s why we call them ‘little sun,’” she said. “In this generation, when it comes to responsibility, selflessness and compromise, they may lack these social skills.” They may find a partner “too bothersome” instead. “That’s why there are so many young people nowadays who have cats and dogs as pets,” she added. As they chase individual desires, a growing number of Chinese youths are now calling themselves the “Moonlight clan”, or “yue guang zu”. “It usually refers to young people (who’ll) spend everything they earn every month,” said Wang. “Some of them are also deeply in debt because they now have access to online borrowing, (with) platforms like Alipay (and) JD Finance.” One of the youths who identify as part of the Moonlight clan is Liu. She told Insight: “People who spend all their money each month consider it normal not to have savings. And they don’t save.” Their live-for-today attitude leaves them ambivalent about the future. And as they delay financial security, they end up delaying marriage. “If you’re someone who lives a ‘pay cheque to pay cheque’ lifestyle, your potential partner might realise it isn’t a good fit,” said Qian. “In a way, it can be (a challenge) for a Moonlight clan person to find a partner. After all, building a life together involves managing finances.” According to a China Central Television report in 2021, two in five singles in China’s first-tier cities belong to the Moonlight clan. In fourth- and fifth-tier cities, 76 per cent of single young people blow their pay cheque every month. This adds up to a sizeable number, given that China had 220 million singles that year. China’s economic slowdown, coming hard on the heels of the pandemic, has compounded the situation. “Every time there are financial difficulties, the marriage rates are going to go down because people will usually delay these major life events,” said Yeung. Unemployment among Chinese urbanites aged 16 to 24 stands at more than 20 per cent, which is a record and higher than in most European countries. With the gloomy economic outlook, some men may be especially pessimistic about their marriage prospects. “They may think, as a man, they need to take responsibility for their wife and … their children. Suddenly, they realise they don’t have the budget,” said Yeung. In this regard, the cost of housing is “a big issue these days”. Studies have shown that when home prices go up, the number of marriages falls. Even for Chinese youths who are “serious about their financial stability” and still thinking of marriage, “the ability to save up for a house, for their children’s education and all of that … isn’t there”, added Yeung. China’s hustle culture known as “996” — which refers to working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week — has left young working adults, meanwhile, with hardly any time for themselves, much less the energy for a relationship. “You do have to feel a bit more sympathetic (about) their status now,” said Wang. “The economic cost and the pressure to maintain a balanced life are just so high.” Still, most Chinese youths have not given up on love. And many who are time-starved hope to get hitched with the help of dating apps. The three most popular platforms, Momo, Soul and Tantan, have over 150 million monthly active users in total as at last year. In a 2021 survey conducted by a Chinese research institute, 89 per cent of respondents said they had used a dating app before. “You’ll see and hear examples of success. People do find long-term partners or even husbands and wives,” said Wang. “But most of the time, it’s more like a social app. People get together, become friends or establish some short-term relationships.” There is also an argument that dating apps promote a hook-up culture, where users are interested in flings rather than something long-term. This has been Zhao’s experience, which led her to lament that guys “primarily consider” the sexual aspect. She had thought using a dating app would be an efficient process because of the “large user base”. But the platform is not quite a godsend to the loveless in China. “Dating apps give … the illusion that you’ll always have the next choice. Just swipe left, swipe right, then you’ll always have more choices down the line,” said Wang. “It doesn’t necessarily create more happiness among couples or among the young generation. But I guess it’s one of these new realities that China as a whole has to (become) accustomed to.” Even as dating apps have increased in popularity, there is a reason that traditional methods remain important in China. “When you look at different surveys, the ways people meet a potential mate isn’t that different from 20 years ago. They still meet new people at work, through friends (and) through family,” cited Wang. Parental matchmaking in particular has seen a revival since the mid-2000s, when worried parents with dreams of becoming grandparents began organising matchmaking corners in city parks. Just like in a flea market, they advertised their children’s virtues, hoping to attract prospective takers. “This trend still continues … because for many of the urban young generation, they don’t have enough time to really get into the dating market (through) trial and error, basically,” said Wang. Matchmaking corners can be found in major Chinese cities, such as Guangzhou and Shanghai. In Beijing, one famous spot is Zhongshan Park, which artist Hao Wenxi, 35, knows well because his father used to frequent its matchmaking corner. Hao shared that he had been looking for Miss Right since his early 20s but was unlucky in love for almost eight years. “I met a lot of different people, but the chances of success were relatively low,” he said. “I didn’t know how to date. I didn’t know how to (be) charming and be emotionally present. I might’ve only known that I earn more than you. I own property. “It was really no different to dating 100 years ago — saying that you have cows and land.” But he wanted to find love, so he was game to try different dating options. He met around 20 to 30 people over a period of two to three years. Dating apps yielded a mixed bag of results. Eventually, it was his father’s efforts in Zhongshan Park that paid off, and he met his current wife, a doctor. They dated for a year before tying the knot. They now have a four-year-old son and are thinking of having another child, perhaps in the next three or four years. Hao’s happy ever after highlights one particular dimension to China’s concern over its falling marriage rate: If people do not get married, they do not have children. “The correlation between marriage and birth rates isn’t as strong (in Western society),” noted Wang. “People can still have children even if they aren’t married. … But in China, the correlation is almost 100 per cent.” Besides conservatism, the Hukou system — the household registration system that allows citizens to access healthcare and education — is one big reason why. Until recently, only married women were allowed to register their children. But last year, China’s population declined for the first time in six decades. And the falling marriage rate combined with an ageing population has the government fretting even more. So authorities are trying various means to encourage marriage and childbirth, including efforts to control house prices. By May last year, at least 13 Chinese cities were providing housing subsidies for families with multiple children. Local governments have also given one-time coupons to families for home purchases. More subsidies and incentives, said Yeung, would help young people to think they could settle down. Zhu has some ideas, such as “marriage housing” specifically for young people, which she believes the government may introduce “in the near future”. “If you’re willing to get married, then this house will be rented to you at a very low cost. If you’re willing to have children, perhaps this house will be sold to you at a very affordable price,” Zhu elaborated. As for falling in love in the first place, some schools have given students extra vacation time to socialise, while some companies have offered single female employees extra days of annual leave, for them to “go home and date”. Still, employees of enterprises in China are working, on average, 48.7 hours a week this year, even with the “996” work culture officially outlawed. While China’s labour laws now require companies to pay extra for hours worked beyond an eight-hour working day, “when it comes to the execution stage, … the 996 culture is still quite prevalent”, said Wang. “As a result, I think we’re now in this sort of … stalemate when it comes to the reality in dating.” Many other Asian countries have tried ways to improve marriage rates, with more failures than successes. It remains to be seen whether China will buck the trend. Zhao thinks it is “worth encouraging” youths who still believe in love. But for her part, she is having a break from the dating scene after using a matchmaker’s services on top of her use of dating apps. “I want a high-quality marriage. But the people I currently know can’t meet my expectations. So even though they want to be with me, I still reject them,” she said. “Being single is a good state for me right now. I enjoy my current single status, and I feel happy.” Watch this episode of Insight here . The programme airs on Thursdays at 9pm.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Most Singaporeans hardly need to think twice about going out for leisure, but for carers of people with autism, the thought of it can instil ‘dread’. Can retailers make it easier for them? Some are starting to do so now. All smiles as Dzakir (left), who has global developmental delay, steps out of a fitting room for the first time. (Photo: Abel Khoo/CNA) • Uniqlo’s 51 @ Ang Mo Kio outlet offers a private shopping service for those who require a calm environment. • By next month, some shops in Frasers Property Singapore’s malls will roll out a “calm hour” twice weekly. • Parents welcome these moves but wonder about the timings and lack of publicity. • One expert calls for mandatory disability awareness training for companies; another says voluntary initiatives “work better”. SINGAPORE: With their school graduation a week away, twins Amirizdzakir and Amirizdzakwan were choosing outfits for the ceremony. As the teenagers stepped out of the fitting rooms in dress shirts they had picked, their father, Izwar Mohamed, broke into a smile. “It’s really a milestone,” he said, referring not to their graduation but the event unfolding before his eyes. At age 18, his sons were trying on clothes in a shop for the first time. The boys, who go by the names Dzakir and Dzakwan, have global developmental delay as well as traits associated with autism spectrum disorder. Going out can be a stressful event for them and their family; the boys find crowded areas, with the cacophony of voices and music from shops, along with the bright lights and all sorts of smells, overstimulating. On bad days, they could have a meltdown and crumple to the floor the moment they reach their destination, said their mother, Norhayati Johari. But this time, the family got to visit Uniqlo’s 51 @ Ang Mo Kio outlet an hour before opening time for a private shopping session — at no extra charge — as part of a new initiative the fashion retailer launched last year. The lights were dimmed and the music turned off at the family’s request. In recent times, more initiatives like this have come about to help make shopping a pleasanter experience for families with special needs. For example, by next month, 17 shops across six shopping centres — Causeway Point, Hougang Mall, Northpoint City, Tiong Bahru Plaza, Waterway Point and White Sands — run by Frasers Property Singapore will roll out “calm hour” in the first hour of operations once or twice a week. During this hour, there will be dim lights, no music, no digital screens and no cleaning so that there will not be strong detergent smells or the sound of vacuum cleaners. Other shoppers can still visit at this time. Brands that have come on board this Inclusion Champions programme include haircut service provider EC House and toy store Toys “R” Us. Experts and parents of special needs children hail these moves as a good first step, but in practice, how far does it address their needs? And does it bring Singapore closer to being an autism-friendly society? For the twins, the fact that Dzakwan made it to Uniqlo without throwing a fit was the first sign that their shopping trip might turn out fine. Of the two, he is more sensitive to noise and unfamiliar places. With the shop’s music turned off, both boys appeared comfortable, Norhayati told the staff on duty. Otherwise, Dzakir would be pulling her along to get to the source of the music. And whereas she would normally feel “pressure” to make sure they do not affect other customers, Dzakir and Dzakwan could now dart across the aisles and touch whatever they wanted to satisfy their curiosity. That helps to calm them, especially in a new environment, said their sister, Nur Laiyinah Najihah Noor Izwar, 22. “I was a bit afraid just now because Dzakwan was getting a bit agitated. But because he had some time for himself and the opportunity to explore a bit, that let him calm down on his own,” she said. Izwar, 56, was also pleasantly surprised to discover the twins had their own fashion sense: Between plaid and plain, Dzakwan pointed to the latter. Usually, Norhayati buys clothes for them. Here, “at least they get to make their own choice”, said the 52-year-old. The boys themselves, who are non-verbal, appeared to enjoy their time out. “You don’t really see it in the facial features but from their movements, their body language. They’re very proud (of themselves),” said Izwar. While it would be helpful if more Uniqlo outlets were to offer this private shopping service , said Izwar, his family are happy to drive from their home in Pasir Ris to Ang Mo Kio. After all, they have even gone to a specific — and very patient — hairdresser in Johor Bahru for the boys to receive haircuts. “When we actually go to some stores, it’s a touch-and-go kind of thing,” said Norhayati. “We don’t really have very high expectations because we come from literally zero (experience), so this is so good for us. “At least I know that I have a place (where) I don’t have to worry (about whether the twins are) like this or like that. Don’t have to prepare so much; just come.” The usual time allocated for Uniqlo’s private sessions is on Thursdays before the shop opens at 11 a.m. Similarly, Frasers Property’s calm hour is on Monday and Tuesday mornings. But mother-of-three Christine, who asked to go by her first name, questioned whether these weekday timings were feasible for working parents like herself. Her second child, 4, has special needs. EC House said it chose the first hour of operation as traffic is usually lower, which would allow the company to “approach the event with greater confidence”. In future, EC House may consider extending the duration of the calm hour or hosting it more frequently than once a week, after “observing its effectiveness and assessing any potential operational conflicts”. “If everything proceeds smoothly, we’ll consider expanding this event to other EC House outlets throughout Singapore,” said a spokesperson. Likewise, Uniqlo Singapore chief executive officer Yuki Yamada said its current initiative, called Uniqlo Access, is “a starting point”, and the retailer will consider expanding the service to include weekends. It also hopes to expand the service to new and existing outlets in Singapore. “It’d be great for us to receive more feedback, positive or negative, then we’ll see … how we can adjust our business,” he said. “That’s the way we can go to the next stage.” WATCH: We try Uniqlo’s private shopping services, for customers with special needs (12:55) While a quiet hour may be helpful for some, parent Rajendran K Sethuraj, 57, pointed out that those on the autism spectrum have diverse needs. His son, for example, has moderate autism and can be all right in loud places but is triggered by a faint smell of bananas. This is more important to Rajendran: staff who are ready to render support when things go south. “When there’s a meltdown, (we’re) just focusing (on our child),” he said. If the staff could direct them to the nearest quiet area in the shop or the shopping centre or just ask how they could help, he would find that “very helpful”. He also hopes these support services can be made more visible, whether with a uniform or a tag the staff can wear or signs showing which shop is autism-friendly. “(The shopping centre) is very huge, right? If you say, ‘we’re autism-friendly’, how’d I know? Where’s what?” he said. “This kind of outright publicity will (give parents) confidence. … At least they’d know, if something happens, that they aren’t going to be alone or be judged.” To this end, tenants who are part of Frasers Property’s initiative, as well as front-line and corporate staff, will go through first responder training for autism-related incidents, conducted by St Andrew’s Autism Centre. Uniqlo, meanwhile, has engaged SPD, a charity that supports people with physical, sensory and learning disabilities, to train their staff in disability awareness. To date, close to 80 staff have gone through the training session. The Autism Resource Centre (ARC) said it has seen an increase in requests for autism awareness training from various organisations over the years, said principal autism consultant Alina Chua. These organisations include major attractions, community organisations and transport providers. Commendable as these efforts are, said Dino Trakakis, the founder of early intervention therapy provider Autism Recovery Network, he is worried that they will not take off. “It’ll take just a couple of instances where things go wrong for them to stop,” said Trakakis. If a child throwing a tantrum happens to chase other customers away, businesses would be losing potential sales, he cited. “Whether you have ‘quiet hour’ or ‘noisy hour’, the rent is still the same. … How much can they afford to lose?” he wondered. Yamada said cost is “of course important for us to survive as a business here” but is “not much of a consideration” for the Uniqlo initiative as it is part of the company’s ‘Made for All’ brand concept and mission. By thinking about the company’s values “rather than from a profit point of view”, Uniqlo can develop more initiatives that have the community in mind, said Uniqlo Singapore senior sustainability director Hwee Lee. “The profit is for us to give back to the community, right?” On disruptions, she said: “It’s about bringing our customers on board this journey. “An ultimate goal we have is that in our stores, our customers will be able to also embrace people with disabilities shopping alongside them. If they see someone needing help and being served by our staff, they could have a little bit of patience.” Given its prior experience with customers with autism, EC House said they “aren’t as challenging to work with as one might assume”. “The key is to communicate with their caregivers and inquire about how we can make the haircut process more comfortable for them,” said its spokesperson. “It often takes us more time to provide care, but our team is patient and compassionate.” As for Frasers Property Singapore and why it has invested in its Inclusion Champions programme, CEO Soon Su Lin said shopping centres “are where people from all walks of lives meet and share experiences”. “It’s therefore imperative for us to embrace and enhance inclusivity. … We believe that we can make a difference by facilitating a more supportive and caring environment at our malls.” Besides people with autism, the company aims to also support people with dementia. Some shops as well as all customer service counters — totalling 29 points throughout 10 shopping centres — will serve as go-to points for the latter group. Another concern Trakakis raised is that the provision of these services is patchy in Singapore. “We need to understand (inclusiveness) as a society, not just … as one or two companies,” he said. “Then anywhere customers go, it’d be the same (treatment).” CNA Insider checked with two other real estate groups, covering more than 20 shopping centres across the heartlands and the city, and neither have similar initiatives. Trakakis suggested regulation, whereby there should be mandatory disability awareness training for companies, especially in the service industry. However, Ivan Tan from the SPD believes voluntary initiatives “work better” to create a more inclusive society. “To influence retailers that can make that change and are willing to make that change — that’s even more impactful, even more powerful than forcing them by law,” said Tan, who is from the SPD’s assistive technology centre and leads a team providing training for corporates. “(Companies should) do things because (they) want to make the space accessible. … When that happens, the change is real and is deep.” Retailers should also realise their bottom line loses out if they do not embrace inclusiveness, Tan said. “There’s this whole untapped market of persons with disabilities, and possibly even their caregivers, who aren’t going to places because it isn’t comfortable,” he said, referring to disabilities beyond autism spectrum disorder. “If you write that segment off, you’re writing off possibly 25 per cent of your pie.” Showing “more success stories”, he thinks, will help in motivating businesses to make this investment of time and resources. “We need to talk more,” he added. “(We must) be able to engage with retailers, organisations, to say that this … also will help their own staff, their own organisation be a lot more open and more empathetic to the community.” Ultimately, what worries parents the most when they go out with their special needs children is that their children will be judged. Rajendran recalled the stares his family would be greeted with whenever his son had a public meltdown. Then there could be remarks like, “You’re such a big boy — don’t even know how to behave in public?” or “Why do you want to (take) this kind of (person) out?” But he and his wife learnt to take it in their stride. Their son is now 24 years old and can take the train on his own. “We told ourselves we’d bring him up like a normal family (would). We’d just go out; we’d have the meltdown,” he said. “It’s important that my son has a (good) quality of life. And going out is part of that.” For Christine, however, the prospect of going out fills her with “dread”. Her 4-year-old has Williams syndrome, a rare genetic condition characterised by feeding problems, heart disease and developmental delay. She is sensitive to sudden loud noises — though the exact trigger can be random — and is non-verbal, said Christine. The constant threat of a meltdown and the attention they get when it happens can be “very stressful”. And the guilt keeps gnawing at Christine. The last time she and her husband took their three children — the oldest is 7 years old, the youngest is 1 year old — out for a leisure activity together was to the S.E.A. Aquarium last year. These days, apart from having quick family meals, she sometimes takes her eldest child out separately. Notwithstanding her reservation about the current timings, she hopes more shops could “openly announce” that they are more accepting of people with special needs. “If … my child has a meltdown, I (wouldn’t) need to rush off. And I (wouldn’t) need to force her to just stop crying,” she said. What Trakakis hopes to see is a national campaign — like the war on diabetes — to raise public awareness of autism by, for example, explaining the way people with autism act and what is needed when a meltdown happens. Understanding of autism in general is growing, said the ARC’s Chua. “As a society, we can now level up to the next step: how we respond to autism. “We need greater acceptance of different ways of thinking, acting and communicating.” And that is where businesses can play a part, said Tan. The larger effect of having more retailers welcoming people with autism would be greater empathy — a change in attitude from “I’m aware” to “I’m including them” — as more Singaporeans come into contact with persons with disability, he cited.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Young South Koreans have been dubbed the ‘N-Po generation’, forced to give up marriage, having children and more, thanks to job insecurity and high living costs. While they can only hope their sacrifices pay off, the future isn’t totally bleak. Kim Jaram, 32, working the graveyard shift at a convenience store, one of two jobs she does out of “necessity”. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SEOUL: She is a web designer by day and works at two convenience stores by night, including weekends. Since March, Kim Jaram has been clocking over 100 hours of work a week, more than double the hours in a 9-to-6 job. “In (South) Korea these days, if you want to survive on a monthly salary, it has to be with a large corporation (or you must be in) specific jobs,” said the 32-year-old, who lives in Seongnam, a satellite city south-east of Seoul. “For normal people, if you want to save up for the future, having two jobs is a necessity.” The punishing schedule, however, is taking its toll on Kim, who holds an associate degree in food and nutrition but made a career switch after taking a web design course. She has made errors in her work and forgotten to log on for Zoom meetings, raising her boss’s ire. She has also gained weight from the lack of exercise. But she has a dream: to save enough money to start her own convenience store in a year’s time. “I’m not planning to live like this for the rest of my life,” she said about her current schedule, which allows only about three hours’ sleep on weekdays. “My goal is to achieve some kind of financial freedom between the ages of 40 and 45. … Why not work as hard as I can now?” South Korea is a fast-growing developed country. Yet, there is a trend — as with some other parts of Asia — for the younger generation to find it harder than their parents to make headway despite higher education. The country’s youths have been called the “N-Po generation”, who must give up an ever-growing list of things owing to job insecurity and high housing and living costs. (The term started out as “Sampo generation”, referring to youths having to give up dating, marriage and having children owing to economic insecurity amplified by the 2008 global financial crisis.) “Hell Joseon” is another term, coined about eight years ago, casting modern Korean society as a hellish version of the Joseon dynasty and its unequal class system. Kim’s story, and that of other youths CNA Insider recently met in South Korea, highlights the cost of an unforgiving and hyper-competitive system that begins at school and extends well into adulthood. The factors behind the country’s youths getting stuck are deeply rooted in culture. But we found out how some individuals are trying to break free from narrow pathways and what more can be done to empower their generation. The weight of expectation for South Koreans builds from a young age, youths and experts say. Parents “force” their expectations and unfulfilled dreams on their children, wanting them to get into the best schools and secure stable jobs, said Ko Gang-seob, youth policy researcher turned lawmaker. WATCH: No sleep, 2 jobs: Can young South Koreans escape Hell Joseon rat race? (25:43) This stems from changes after the Korean War, as South Korea’s economy developed and achieved rapid growth up until the 1990s. The idea of being successful and “quickly earning money” has since been ingrained, Ko said. The son of a bus driver and a factory seamstress, Ko was previously at the Young Professionals Institute of Korea and is now a member of the Jungnang District Council. His parents allowed him to pursue anything he wanted after he made it to university. “Today’s youth are in a slightly different family environment,” he observed. Kim, for instance, wanted to pursue criminal psychology when she was in high school. When her grades were not good enough for early acceptance into university, her second choice was fashion design. But the prospect of an unstable career worried her parents. She settled for food and nutrition and got a two-year associate degree. As a nutritionist, she earned enough to save up but felt it was not something she wanted to do for life. After she quit and learnt web design through a government-funded programme called the Tomorrow Learning Card, her parents switched from telling their friends, “Our daughter is a nutritionist”, to merely “Our daughter is working”, she recalled. Another youth, Kim Myung-jun, 27, wanted to be an actor when he was a child and had many other interests, including football. His parents did not like such distractions from his studies, which led to conflict. His middle and high school years were the “darkest and most depressing period” of his life. His mother, a teacher, knew the importance of education. She moved the family to Mok-dong, a neighbourhood in the west of Seoul known for its private education institutions and good schools. Her efforts paid off when he gained early acceptance into one of the country’s most prestigious universities, Yonsei, to study business administration. Her son, meanwhile, was excited about moving away for college as part of a “new beginning”. The fierce competition to get into elite schools is a well-known phenomenon in South Korea, and observers say it favours the wealthy. All high school seniors take a standardised college entrance exam, with the stakes so high that aeroplanes are grounded or re-routed to prevent students from being distracted by the noise. Many students spend years preparing for the biggest test of their lives, including shelling out hundreds or thousands of dollars each month at cram schools called “hagwon”. Last year, South Koreans spent 26 trillion won (S$26.3 billion) on private education, 10.8 per cent more than the previous year, according to Statistics Korea. Students each spent, on average, 410,000 won a month on private education last year, up 11.8 per cent from 2021, Yonhap news agency reported. Their goal is a place in the country’s top schools: Seoul National University, Korea University and Yonsei University, collectively known by their acronym, SKY. Many students who do not do well enough are known to retake the exam, some more than once, to get into a higher-ranked school. Around a fifth of applicants sit out formal education for a year to prepare for the exam a second time, according to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) working paper published last year, titled “Policies to Increase Youth Employment in Korea”. The competition continues at university: Students must “not only excel in their courses but also sign up for additional classes, such as English and other extra-curricular classes”, to boost their curriculum vitae and employability, said associate research fellow Kwak Yoon-kyung at the government-funded Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. They often require financial support from their parents, whose networks may also help their children get into certain jobs or industries later on, she added. Students who cannot afford extra classes, by contrast, “may not even dare to dream about applying for a particular job or industry they’ve been dreaming of their entire life”, she said. There are multiple reasons why many young people go all out to get into a prestigious school and burnish their CVs, which in turn has far-reaching impact on South Korea’s labour market and society. One reason is to gain access to social networks that could help them get ahead in future, said Eun Suk, an assistant professor in the social welfare department at Duksung Women’s University. Another reason is that South Korea is “not a country for second chances”, he said. “It’s really harsh that one’s life path is determined by a single college entrance exam.” An elite school will boost chances of employment in a large corporation or the civil service. Few youths want to work in small and medium enterprises (SMEs): 4 per cent of people aged 13 to 34, according to a 2021 government survey. Firms with at least 300 employees pay young workers 50 per cent higher wages than firms with fewer than 10 employees, and the gap widens with age, the OECD paper noted. And the chances of being a non-regular worker with less social and employment protection are higher. In addition, “it’s very rare for young people who start a career in a small business to move to a large company,” Eun said. But with more people gunning for large firms than there are vacancies, “competition is getting more intense”. Two-thirds of respondents in the government survey hoped to work in large firms, government agencies or public companies. Tertiary graduates would rather queue for jobs in such organisations than fill labour shortages in SMEs, the OECD paper stated. This is one reason that South Korea’s youth employment rate is lower than the average in the OECD’s 38 member countries: nearly 9 percentage points lower in 2021, at 44.2 per cent. Over 1.26 million young South Koreans (aged 15 to 29) are unemployed. More than half, numbering about 678,000, hold a bachelor’s degree or higher, according to government data as at this May. For the 25 to 29 age group, unemployment stood at 6.1 per cent, more than double the overall unemployment rate of 2.7 per cent. The share of youths who are non-regular workers (part-time, fixed-term and atypical employees) is also relatively high, at 42.1 per cent in 2021, according to Statistics Korea. The narrow pathways to success have an impact on youths’ mental health. This is something Yoo Seung-gyu, 30, has not only seen but experienced. When he was 19, he withdrew from the world and holed up in his room for over two years. He emerged to do mandatory military service, then went back to being a recluse for about two more years. Yoo said he felt oppressed by his father, and seeing his parents fight did not help. He felt “a sense of helplessness — that no matter how much I say, they won’t listen to me”, he said. His time as a recluse, or “hikikomori”, ended only when he looked up resources online, realised he belonged to such a category of people and found a now defunct Japanese organisation called K2 International that helped such individuals. It ran a shared house for recluses and, more importantly, offered patience and encouragement, teaching them that “it’s okay to fail”, he said. The factors that lead young adults to become recluses vary, from failure to get a job or into a school to a failed relationship, he cited. “Most of them are a bit discouraged when they feel they’re not as good as others in a competitive society.” Today, he runs a social enterprise called Not Scary to serve recluses, generally a group of people who have spent almost all their time at home for six months or more and have no social relationships. The commonest age group is people in their 20s and 30s, he said. About 3.1 per cent of South Koreans aged 19 to 39 are recluses, and the government has announced more help for them. In April, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family said it would provide a monthly allowance of up to 650,000 won to these individuals aged 9 to 24 in households earning below the median national income. The allowance, along with eligibility for other subsidies, aims to help them “recover their daily lives and reintegrate into society”, the ministry said. Not Scary currently runs a shared house with nine occupants including Yoo. The occupants’ families pay a monthly fee of 1.55 million won. Group activities at the house include exercise sessions and preparing for a play or comedy. A shared living space is the “most effective” method of helping recluses restore social relationships, as there is a “limit to going to counselling centres and hospitals”, he believes. “It’s essential to have a physical space where they can meet their peers, just like when they go to school.” The rehabilitation process takes 18 months on average, and Not Scary offers continuous support and invites former residents back for get-togethers, he said. The organisation does not receive government funding and derives other income from presenting workshops and lectures, content production and funding from private foundations, he added. What can boost the hopes and social mobility of South Korean youths, then? Experts suggest greater openness to failure and visibility of diverse ways of life, improvements to the educational system, changes to the winner-take-all culture as well as increased political participation by youths. “Korean society is very homogeneous, not only ethnically but also culturally,” said Kwak, who researches youth and social policies, migration, gender and social integration. “At the same time, people feel that they’re running pretty much towards the same goal.” It is thus important to “intentionally show” diversity of life paths through campaigns, social and mass media, she said, and to “tell people that going to university or getting a white-collar job isn’t the only way to be successful”. She welcomes the presence of YouTube influencers who are, say, high school graduates from ordinary backgrounds and/or have blue-collar jobs but who have millions of subscribers and are making good money. One such YouTuber is Park Min-ji, 27, who has never aspired to work for a big corporation. She had attended a vocational school that was training her to be a zookeeper, but she dropped out later. She did a six-month web development course, discovered she was good at it and gained confidence. Over a year ago, she quit her full-time job to make YouTube content, mostly personal finance issues. She also organises real-life meetings and talks on personal finance for young people. She has appeared on a television talk show to speak about financial independence and recently published an e-book about being a digital nomad. Drawing cartoons and teaching people how to do the same on Instagram, however, is her main income source. It nets her about 2 million to 3 million won a month. When she first quit her full-time job, she was “really nervous”. “Most people quit to join another company, whereas I didn’t have such a plan,” she recounted. Then she got so busy making YouTube videos that she hardly slept. After launching her content and gaining followers, she felt more stable. And since striking out on her own — she rents a flat near her parents in Namyangju city in Gyeonggi province — “life has definitely improved”, she said. “I’m in a very happy state.” Where the country can also do better is to improve the prospects of youths who attend non-SKY universities or vocational institutes, said the experts. Youths who graduate from non-SKY universities should “have a path to realising their dreams … even though they didn’t get the results they wanted in the college entrance exam”, said Eun. Not enough South Korean youths aim to start their own businesses, and this is where the government could do more to help incubate small businesses and ensure access to credit, he suggested. The OECD paper encouraged universities to get rid of student enrolment limits by major, to improve relevance to the labour market. Another recommendation was that Meister schools — vocational high schools that follow the German model of combining education with work experience — be expanded. And the gap between regular and non-regular workers could be narrowed by relaxing employment protection for regular workers and expanding social insurance enrolment and training for non-regular workers, the paper’s authors proposed. Having respect for different professions is also key, Kwak stressed. There are vocational high school graduates who choose to pursue a degree because of discrimination, a lack of respect for people in jobs such as plumbing and cleaning as well as limited opportunities for career advancement, she said. “Some parents walk past the cleaners and tell their children that if (they) don’t study hard, (they’re) going to be like that,” she said. “Nobody should be treated in that way.” Youths can drive change by making their voices heard in the political arena, said Ko and Eun. They pointed out that the country’s legislative body, the National Assembly, is mostly made up of people above the age of 50. According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which provides data on parliaments round the world, the average age of National Assembly members is 54.9. Less than one in five are women. With greater sociopolitical participation, “the policies that young people need are created”, Eun said. In the meantime, the youths CNA Insider spoke to are tapping existing government resources and digging deep. Seoul resident Park Jong-min, 30, wants to create a better future through web programming, after enduring a tough childhood and overcoming a gaming addiction. His mother left when he was a year old, and he and his father moved when the latter had new partners. His father also had a drinking problem, and Park Jong-min left home at age 16, taking shelter in a temporary youth care centre, then his cousin’s house. He tried to further his education at a state-funded university, but his addiction to gaming dragged him into debts of 50 million won. He thought of taking his own life at one point and set up a YouTube channel beforehand to talk about his life. Sympathy from others prompted him to change his mind and soldier on. For the last five years, he has lived in a “goshiwon”, a cramped dormitory-style facility that caters mainly for low-income tenants and those studying for exam retakes. He has also worked out a plan to repay his debt over eight years and has six years to go. He is living on state benefits totalling about 1.5 million won each month, and in return he works at a government facility that makes shopping bags. He hopes to enrol at a government-funded web programming academy next year. When asked how he envisages his future, he said living in a flat may not be within reach. (Data indicates that the average household, if it saves 100 per cent of its salary, would take 14 years to buy a home in Seoul.) But a villa — which, in South Korea, refers to a small dwelling in a building usually no more than five storeys high — may be attainable. “As a web programmer, I believe I’ll not only focus on studying and making a living but also show (via YouTube) how I’m continuing to develop myself,” he said. Kim Myung-jun, meanwhile, might be the envy of those vying for SKY university places. But not content with going with the flow, he has worked to pay his living expenses, while his parents paid his school fees. This has involved sacrifices. In his final year of university in 2020, he took leave from school because money was tight. Also, lessons were being held online owing to the pandemic, and he did not see the point of it. He found himself having two jobs: one as an infrastructure manager in an information technology firm; the other with his own private security venture. The idea for the latter came from having previously worked as a part-time security guard, and it has taken off. He now has six regular workers and hires multiple freelancers, possibly around 100 in a busy month. His days are hectic. When he is not putting in 12-hour shifts at the IT firm, he is attending to matters in his company, Guardius. On the day he met CNA Insider, he checked his smartwatch and found he had slept three hours and 13 minutes the night before. “I’m feeling my health getting a little worse, and I’m trying to exercise and sleep as much as possible. I’m also eating nutritional supplements,” he said. “I’m too busy right now.” He is taking on so much to support himself, but he also has an eye on the future. He knows housing prices are high and thinks young South Koreans may not be able to rely on a state pension for their retirement, given that the country is rapidly ageing. In the near term, however, he plans to complete his degree after a three-year break and looks forward to hitting the books again. “It’s my last chance to take the classes I want and learn things I’ve felt I’ve lacked while working,” he said. He is grateful to his parents. “I am who I am today because my parents were strict and spared no (expense on) me,” he said. “I’m a very lucky person.” As for Kim Jaram, who lives alone in an “officetel” — a studio apartment housed in a multi-purpose building — the dream is to have free time to exercise, meet friends and travel, perhaps even go on honeymoon round the world with a partner. She earns 5 million to 6 million won a month from her multiple jobs and aims to increase the amount after she starts her own business. To save on food, she takes free unsold items that are near their expiry date from the convenience stores where she works. Life has not turned out as she had imagined when she was 20. Back then, she thought she would work hard as her parents had done and get married by her late 20s or early 30s. “It’s (turned out to be) different, but I’ve no regrets,” she said. “I want (readers and viewers) to know there are people in Korea who are passionate about and enjoy their work.” And if she does not have enough saved up in a year’s time, she will not be too worried. “If, after trying everything for a year, I still can’t reach my financial goal, or if things don’t go as planned, I might think, ‘Oh well, I’m still young compared to my friends’, and will decide to try again.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Can the families of passengers and crew on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 find closure? Will the missing plane ever be found? The documentary MH370: A Decade On delves into one of the world’s most baffling, and painful, mysteries. Despite the sadness, and acceptance of the victims’ fate, there remains hope that the plane will be found one day. This audio is generated by an AI tool. KUALA LUMPUR: He had been working in Beijing for just under a year when his wife planned to visit him. V P R Nathan, a Malaysian air traffic controller and instructor, was on secondment to the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s Asia-Pacific regional sub-office in the Chinese capital. And he had not seen his wife, Anne Daisy, 56, for two months. “I’d come back for Christmas,” recounted the 67-year-old. “Then she wanted to come and spend a week in Beijing to be with me.” She booked a seat on flight MH370 for March 8, 2014. “I had a WhatsApp message from my wife before she departed. She was already in the airport, texting and all that,” recalled Nathan. “Because it was a 1 a.m. flight, I think I went to sleep before the plane departed.” He woke up in the morning and headed for the airport. When he arrived, her flight information was not displayed. The Malaysia Airlines staff there “didn’t have any information on … what time the flight was coming in” either. “I was already feeling a bit apprehensive that something had gone wrong. Then I sat there, by which time I was already very emotional because …,” he trailed off. It has been 10 years since MH370 vanished into thin air. It is still one of the world’s most baffling mysteries after the largest, most expensive search in aviation history. On board the aircraft were 227 passengers and 12 crew members, from 14 countries. For their family members, the pain of loss persists. Can they find closure? Will the missing plane ever be found? These questions, and more, are covered in the CNA documentary, MH370: A Decade On . WATCH: Will missing Malaysia Airlines plane ever be found? Experts review clues (46:24) One of the earliest theories about the missing plane was that it was the work of terrorists, as two Iranian passengers were found to be travelling on stolen European passports. While this theory was debunked, more conspiracies emerged. One conspiracy suggested the plane had flown towards a restricted American military base on the island of Diego Garcia and was shot down. Others believe hostile parties had targeted the plane, intent on preventing a cargo of sensitive electronic equipment from reaching its destination. Aerospace expert Jean-Luc Marchand and pilot Patrick Blelly have since combined their technical and operational backgrounds to try to make sense of the disappearance from the facts available and more accurately depict the events that led up to it. The lack of debris leads them to believe the plane went down in a controlled manner. Had it crashed at, say, 200 knots (370 kilometres per hour), “hundreds of thousands of pieces of debris would’ve been created”, said Marchand. They conclude that a capable, experienced pilot was in control until the end, navigating the aircraft outside Malaysian radar coverage and along the airspace borders of other countries, avoiding detection before ditching the jet in the Indian Ocean. “Without formally accusing the pilot, we can’t exclude (him) because he had the experience, and he was an instructor,” said Marchand. “Until we find the wreckage, we (will) not know.” The various theories have only added to the frustration felt by Jacquita Gonzales, 61, and to the trauma of losing her husband, Patrick Gomes, who was the in-flight supervisor. “Everybody comes and (says), ‘Maybe it’s this, maybe it’s that.’ I said, ‘There are a lot of maybes, … there’s no confirmation,’” she said. “We don’t have a pirate’s ‘X marks the spot’ (where) you … dig (for) the treasure.” Many people, including her and Nathan, feel the search should continue. “Whatever anybody says is either a theory or speculation. ... Find the black box, and you decipher the information there,” said Nathan. “A lot of us have accepted that nobody’s coming back. But the important thing is we want to know what happened. ... Was it due to somebody’s nefarious activities, or was it an accident? “If it was an accident, it’s easier to accept. If there was a catastrophic failure on the plane, you can’t help it. Accidents happen. But if somebody hijacked the plane, that’s different.” But the Malaysian government has made no efforts to find the plane since January 2018, when it signed an agreement to pay marine robotics company Ocean Infinity up to US$70 million (S$93 million) if it found MH370 in 90 days. A fleet of eight autonomous underwater drones were deployed, using acoustic signals to create digital maps of the undersea terrain so experts could scour those maps for the wreckage of the Boeing 777 plane. But the company came away empty-handed. “During the first search, (there) was a lot of anxiety and hope. When the second search came ... we were a little bit more confident because of (the) equipment that they had. It was supposed to be the best,” said Gonzales. “When the search ended ... I don’t want to say that we lost hope. Because we were always praying and saying that, ‘okay, once, twice, (third) time is the charm’, so hoping for the next search to come along. “Then maybe there might be some closure for us. Because as of today, it’s still lingering, it’s still up in the air, and it’s ... constantly in our mind.” Over in China, where more than half of the 227 passengers were from, a Beijing court began hearing claims for compensation in November, seven years after some of the next of kin had filed the lawsuit. As more time passes, many of the families are becoming increasingly unhappy. They also believe the search should continue. “With the search technology available today, the funds needed are already far less than the tens of millions of dollars that were needed for this kind of (search),” said Jiang Hui, whose 71-year-old mother, Jiang Cuiyun, was a passenger. More than US$150 million was spent on the search for MH370. And the Malaysian government has left open the possibility of mounting another one. It would still cost millions, but as the technology to map the sea floor has improved over the past decade, it would take less time to map uncharted sections than before. Even so, nothing is guaranteed for now. Charitha Pattiaratchi, a professor at the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute, pointed to history and the Titanic, which was found 73 years after it sank. “And that, knowing where it went down,” he said. He also cited Air France flight 447, which crashed off the coast of Brazil in 2009. “They knew where (the debris) was. It still took another two years to find it,” said the oceanographer. In the case of MH370, experts believed its final resting place was in an area of the southern Indian Ocean called the Seventh Arc. But 120,000 sq km was searched without success. Then and even now, Pattiaratchi thinks the plane will be found, whether in a “dedicated search” or “by accident”, for example by a science research ship that might “suddenly find evidence”. “But if you’re not looking for it, you’re not going to find it,” added Pattiaratchi, whose computer simulations of ocean currents correctly predicted that fragments from MH370 would wash up on the east coast of Madagascar and the African continent. Where could the plane be, though? Near the Seventh Arc satellite band, in the vicinity of a deep trench about 1.5 km wide, known as Broken Ridge, he believes. “It’s huge. It’s very rugged terrain.” He drew an analogy with Australian state Tasmania, whose main island covers almost 25,000 square miles (64,700 sq km). “Imagine you’re looking for a plane (on) that island, which is full of forest and a whole lot of stuff. And imagine you’re in a helicopter, 4 km in the air. But you’re blindfolded,” he said. “You’re basically sensing through sound by acoustic signals. That’s all you have.” For the families who lost their loved ones, all they have are memories of happier times, along with their pain. “I don’t think any of the family members ever forget the first day and days after that — what we did, what we went through,” said Gonzales. “Until today, it’s fresh in our minds when we hear about MH370. “Every March 8 is a replay button for all of us. But now that it’s … 10 years, I think we’re coping a lot better, and we’re not hoping for them to come back to us, although it’d be great.” The hope she clings to is that MH370 “doesn’t remain a mystery” — if not in her lifetime, then her children’s — so that they “get answers (as) to what happened to their dad and to all those people on board”. “We can’t just forget about them and ... not have any closure. Until today, I’ve not had a memorial for Patrick at all because I don’t know anything,” she said. “I’ve not walked down the church aisle with his photo to say ... that’s it. I haven’t done that. I haven’t put him anywhere. I don’t have a grave to go to; I don’t have a niche to go to.” A decade on, not much has changed for the families. “From the beginning till today, it’s all about finding the passengers and finding the plane. This has always been our aim. ... We’ve been working hard,” said Jiang, 51. “(But) if it weren’t for the fact that it’s the 10th anniversary, probably no one would pay any attention to this.” Today, Nathan should have been enjoying his retirement. Instead, the disappearance of MH370 has left a void in his life. “The plan was to travel,” he said. “The children would’ve finished their studies. They’d be on their own, then we’d be alone. “My wife, who liked gardening, (also) had all these plants all over the house (with plans for) better fountains and things like that. ... After this thing happened, the house (has been) very empty.” Somewhere out there is his wife, one of 239 souls waiting to be found and brought home.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Have Singapore’s views on academic results shifted, even a bit, since a change of the PSLE scoring system in 2021? The programme Regardless of Grades looks at how parents are approaching the exam and what it is doing to children. Caleb Chen, 12, is one of the students featured in Regardless of Grades. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: When her son Caleb Chen was in Primary Six last year, Angela Ong began making intense preparations for his Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) during the June school holidays. If there was no schoolwork planned, there would be tuition work. And if not the latter, then there were assessment books to complete, said Caleb, 12, about his holiday schedule. He was not the only one at home doing revision. “To help Caleb with science, I tried to memorise the science notes that were given to him,” said Ong, who began taking half-day leave by the time it was the September term break. Some parents are going one step further. They are attending tuition workshops to be better prepared for their children’s PSLE. For parent Karen Law, attending a workshop this January made her “feel more confident” about covering her son’s science topics. “When I go through his papers or his homework, maybe I’ll have a better understanding of whether he’s doing it right,” she said. “I just want to make sure that everything’s on track.” Another workshop participant, Denise Chow, said the key takeaways from their session were the “common pitfalls” of PSLE science and “answering techniques”. “I can’t go (into) battle for (my son). But I can prepare with him for the battle,” she said. “I always give (my children) the (freedom) to choose what they want in life. But there are bases of life choices that I have to be part of, and grades and education are a very important thing to me.” Indeed, according to a survey of 1,000 parents of Primary Five and Six pupils, 99 per cent said good PSLE scores were important. This is the first such nationwide survey — commissioned by CNA — since the change of scoring system in 2021 from the T-score to Achievement Levels (ALs). In the survey, 85 per cent of parents also said their children were stressed out about the PSLE, while 64 per cent of parents themselves were stressed out. Parents are in fact “more stressed” since the change of scoring system, observed science tutor Jayce Or, who started PSLE prep workshops for parents in 2017. What is driving the obsession with grades, and what is it doing to Singapore’s children? The programme Regardless of Grades finds out how much has changed since the recent moves to reduce the overemphasis on academic results. WATCH: PSLE and grades — Why are Singaporeans so obsessed with them? (47:02) Under the current PSLE scoring system, which spans eight ALs, the total scores range from four to 32, which are “less finely differentiated” — as intended by the Ministry of Education (MOE) — than the previous range of more than 200 aggregate scores. For example, the previous grade A, which was 75 to 90 marks, is now split into AL2 (85 to 89), AL3 (80 to 84) and AL4 (75 to 79), with AL1 for 90 marks and above. But in the past, pupils could “drop two to four marks” and still get an A, said Or, the founder of enrichment centre Germinate Learning. Parents of children scoring within this range are now more stressed because “any careless mistake”, he said — citing PSLE science multiple-choice questions, which carry two marks each — could mean the difference between, say, AL2 and AL3. That difference in grade could have an impact on a child’s admission to a particular secondary school, if they do not achieve the cut-off score. And getting into a secondary school of their choice is what lies behind most parents’ views on PSLE scores. According to CNA’s survey, 69 per cent listed this as a reason why grades were important. And 64 per cent said a good score was a stepping stone to a good future or career. For one Primary Six pupil last year, Adyant Chandrasekar, his careless mistakes “here and there” were the reason why his father sent him to a mathematics boot camp. “My dad’s trying to make me get full marks,” the 12-year-old told CNA on the second day. These kinds of boot camps are typically held during school holidays, and many of them focus on helping Primary Five and Six pupils prepare for the PSLE. Fees can go up to S$500 for a five-day camp, but it could still be oversubscribed. Caleb, too, was at a boot camp during the September term break, which led him to express tiredness and question why his mum had enrolled him in the camp. “But I know that it’s for my own good,” he said. Nowadays, regular tuition is not enough for some parents. Besides boot camps, there are academic enrichment centres offering unconventional teaching methods, from memory practices that stimulate the right brain — or so it is claimed — to speed calculations. CNA’s survey found that 28 per cent of parents have enrolled their child for such enrichment classes in preparation for the PSLE. Most parents (60 per cent), however, send their children to tuition classes. Among them, 65 per cent send their children to three or four classes, and for another 6 per cent, it is five or more classes. To hear from the children themselves, CNA conducted a social experiment with 20 Primary Five and Six pupils — from schools across Singapore — to find out the biggest contributor to stress for them. It happened that for all 20 pupils, their parents have sent or would be sending them to tuition classes to prepare for the PSLE. And it is one of the ways parents have put pressure on children. “If I don’t do that well, then (my parents) will be kind of disappointed because they’ve already put a lot of money into tuition,” said Zavier Pay. The 12-year-old was not surprised to find that he was also one of 11 pupils whose parents have compared their grades with their friends’ grades. “A lot of parents also like to compare (grades),” he said. Among the minority who believed that good grades were not important to their parents was Claire Cher. But the 11-year-old’s parents still send her for tuition and compare her results with her friends’ results. “They want me to do better than average at least,” she said. While the best she has scored is AL1 in science, she did not think her parents “really put a lot of focus on it”. “They’re more focused on my other subjects, (where) I didn’t do so well.” Sometimes educators are a source of stress too. For example, 15 of the 20 pupils agreed their teachers often emphasise the importance of the PSLE, while 11 pupils have teachers who announce the top scorers in tests or exams. “My Chinese teacher was reading out (scores) from highest to lowest, and then I was one of the last 10 people,” recounted Tan Le En, 12, who was “kind of sad” when her name and score was read out. “It’s like — the class (is) split into four, (and) that bottom left-hand corner is all the people who score quite low.” There is also self-imposed stress, but parents remain the biggest stressor. From the pupils’ responses, it also seemed that the children’s self-imposed stress has inadvertently come from their parents. Kuah Ming You, 11, thinks he sometimes places stress on grades because he wants to get into “a good secondary school of (his) choice so it can help (him) further in life”. Who told him that? “My parents,” he replied. Regardless of the source, stress does accompany the PSLE. Ayra Qirin Mohammad Shahrizal, 12, one of three Primary Six pupils CNA followed over eight months — along with Caleb and Adyant — shared how things were seven days before her exam began. “I have difficulty sleeping at night,” she said. “When I’m studying also, my mind would drift off to thinking what questions will come up in the PSLE.” Do parents know how exactly the stress is affecting their children? Zavier’s mother, Amy Eng, said there are times when his results are “not so good” and he would say, “Mummy, I’m sorry. I’ll try harder.” While that makes her feel guilty, she believes every parent has expectations when it comes to grades, since they determine school admissions. Claire’s father, Dean Cher, thinks “it’s very clear” that children pick up on their parents’ reaction to their grades. “I tell them it’s my job to work, it’s your job to study,” he said. “We also tell them that they’re actually not competing with anyone but themselves.” When he asks Claire how well she thinks she has done, he may find out how others have done, to give her a “sense of benchmark”. He presumed this was why her impression is that her parents compare grades. He cited a lack of class ranking — part of changes in the education system in recent years, which include the removal of mid-year exams and schools conducting no more than one weighted assessment per subject per school term. “Perhaps it’s this lack of information that’s then creating a need (for) parents to get more information,” he said. As for Eng, the education reforms did not help with the peer pressure she felt among friends who are like, “Oh, your son’s (taking the) PSLE this year? What have you done?” What she then did was to send her son to a tuition centre that a friend suggested. If her story has a familiar ring, it is because Asian parents “put a lot of stock” in how their children do in education, noted Cher. “That kind of mentality is … insidious, whether you like it or not.” This could also explain why 56 per cent of parents in CNA’s survey have taken or are considering taking paid leave to prepare for the PSLE — as Ong had done to revise with Caleb. When there were seven days to the exam, she asked him if he was upset with her for pushing him to study. He said yes and no. “I should have some playtime,” said Caleb, who was allowed “zero games”. Yet, now that it is over and he has started at secondary school, he told CNA: “If we (hadn’t had) the preparations before PSLE, we’d be struggling … because there’s much more work that we need to do in secondary school.” And at the secondary school level, “grades still matter”, said Ayra. “Your future is dependent on your grades.” Imagining their own future as parents, she, Caleb and Adyant all agreed their children should sit the PSLE. “It’s a learning point for everybody,” said Adyant. “But then, I really want the PSLE to be postponed to (age) 14 to 16.” Agreeing, Caleb said the children would be “more mature”, and then parents “won’t be so stressed”. To make the exam less stressful today, he suggested this: “Less nagging and probably (being) more encouraging would do the trick.” Watch the programme Regardless of Grades here , and find out if Caleb, Ayra and Adyant got into the school of their choice.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider After the currency hit a 26-year low, is the only way up? The programme Insight finds optimism and doubt in equal measure as it looks at factors behind the ringgit’s fall and the ripple effects. This audio is generated by an AI tool. KUALA LUMPUR: As food prices rise, freelance cameraman Shunmugam Karuppannan is one of many Malaysians feeling the pinch. These days, the 50-year-old thinks twice about taking his family to a restaurant, even if they ate out only once a month previously. The ringgit has fallen, and as Malaysia imports around 60 per cent of its food, this has translated into imported inflation, to the extent that it has affected his nine-year-old daughter at school. “Every day I’d give her RM2. And she didn’t tell me anything about (prices being) hiked up in the canteen,” he recounted. After a few days of her skipping meals, he “got to know that the price, RM2, of mee hoon or whatever … had gone to RM3”. The impact of the depreciating ringgit extends across income brackets. Elliza Abdul Rahim, 54, who belongs to the M40 group, or the middle 40 per cent of income earners, has also become more cost-conscious. The communications practitioner now prefers using public transport over driving, as it helps save on car maintenance costs and petrol. The latter, for example, costs her “around RM56 (to) RM60 each go”. Both Shunmugam and Elliza also stretch their budgets by opting for local goods instead of foreign brands. In a similar vein, local suppliers such as clothing manufacturer Domain and Range have encountered increased expenses when purchasing intermediate inputs from abroad. The company produces sportswear and babywear at its factory in China before distributing them to the Malaysian market. However, the ringgit has depreciated against the renminbi, from RM1 to 1.6 yuan in 2022 to RM1 to 1.49 yuan this February. Chief executive officer Chua Hunt disclosed that he had to fork out an additional RM1 million (S$290,000) to cover production costs. Expressing concern over the ringgit’s decline, he said: “If it goes down more, I’m afraid that we’d incur a loss.” At the start of the fourth quarter last year, the ringgit was among Asia’s worst-performing currencies, plunging 6.9 per cent against the United States dollar over the year. This trend persisted into the new year, ringing alarm bells with a 26-year low of RM4.8 against the greenback in February. The ailing currency has left many individuals and businesses grappling with soaring costs, while also fuelling brain drain and eroding faith in the government. Is there hope for a ringgit recovery? The programme Insight looks at the factors driving its decline, the impacts felt among Malaysians and the question of whether a comeback is on the cards. WATCH: Why Malaysia’s currency has been falling — Can the ringgit recover? (46:49) While a struggling currency typically indicates a drop in exports or foreign investment, the Malaysian government contends that the weak ringgit does not signify a weak economy. The experts tend to agree. “If you look at our balance of payments, we’re still experiencing a current account surplus,” said Bank Muamalat Malaysia chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid. “And I think the government is quite committed to reducing the budget gap.” In January, Malaysian exports grew by 8.7 per cent year on year, halting a 10-month decline. Total trade surged 13.3 per cent to RM234.7 billion in the same month. Likewise, in February, the Malaysian government reported that approved investments last year had reached RM329.5 billion, the highest in the country’s history. With these signs pointing to a rosy economy, what accounts for the ringgit’s downturn, then? Experts pin the blame on monetary policy. More specifically, the increase in interest rates in the US is a “major factor” driving the ringgit’s depreciation against the US dollar, cited Teo Wing Leong, who heads the University of Nottingham Malaysia’s School of Economics. The US Federal Reserve has held its benchmark rate at 5.25 to 5.5 per cent since last July, whereas Malaysia has a 3 per cent interest rate. “As a result, capital will flow out (of) Malaysia to the US, … causing the ringgit to depreciate,” said Teo. Indeed, the Fed has hiked interest rates 11 times since 2022 to curb US inflation, which has been slow to recede from a peak of 9.1 per cent in 2022. With high interest rates, investors get better returns from instruments such as US treasury bonds. This boosts demand for the greenback, thereby increasing its relative value. Malaysia’s central bank, meanwhile, has resisted adopting such a strategy as it fears consumers and businesses could be overly burdened by borrowing costs, which could lead to lower consumption and investment demand. The central bank holds that inflation is manageable without further interest rate hikes. Malaysia’s headline inflation rate last year was 2.5 per cent, lower than the global average of 6.8 per cent and Singapore’s 4.8 per cent. Furthermore, the bank has proposed an inflation range of 2 to 3.5 per cent this year, with first-quarter inflation — at 1.7 per cent — already falling below that. That is not to say, however, that none have felt the pinch. As for the ringgit’s decline against the Singapore dollar, one of the reasons is the difference in currency management between the two countries, cited Mohd Afzanizam. Singapore’s monetary policy, using a managed float system, allows its dollar to fluctuate within a band pegged to a basket of currencies. The Monetary Authority of Singapore manages undulations using its foreign reserves, keeping the dollar’s value within the band. Malaysia also adopts a managed float but without any currency peg; for one thing, it lacks the forex reserves that would be needed. “I’d say the Malaysian government can’t do the same as Singapore because our economic structures are different,” added Teo. Singapore operates primarily in higher value-added sectors, while Malaysia’s export sectors are mostly at the “low- to medium-skill level”, he cited. “If you allow (Malaysia’s) exchange rate to become too strong, … the low to medium value-added segment may lose competitiveness.” But maintaining export competitiveness comes at a cost. There are worries that a declining ringgit could speed up Malaysia’s brain drain as workers seek better pay in stronger currencies. Out of 1.86 million Malaysians who have migrated as at 2022, there are 1.13 million living in Singapore. And recently, Singapore’s recruitment agencies have seen 30 to 50 per cent more enquiries from Malaysian workers. Today, the exchange rate is S$1 to about RM3.48, after the dollar gained 6 per cent against the ringgit last year, when the average rate was S$1 to RM3.396. “The foreign exchange (rate) between Malaysian ringgit and Singapore dollar … is one of the main motivations for (Malaysians) to come over,” said information technology project manager Calvin Ong, 37, a Malaysian working in Singapore. He also raised concerns over Malaysia’s race-based politics permeating into the workplace back home in favour of the Malay majority. In that regard, however, Margarita Peredaryenko of Emir Research suggested the race-based push factor may be waning. She cited a Department of Statistics Malaysia study in 2022, which found that Malays were not too far behind the Chinese in emigrating. Among the attractions of working abroad for them were “equal opportunity, better career prospects in terms of promotion as well as breadth and depth of job market, better pay, perks … and so on”, she said. At the same time, a weak currency could deter immigration, especially if expatriate salaries are denominated in ringgit. In the case of technologist Pedro Custodio, he came to Malaysia two and a half years ago to tap the growing Asian markets, “before the ringgit went into this downward cycle”. “If the currency continues to decrease, although you negotiated a certain salary, in the end you start receiving less and less,” said the 47-year-old. “If I’d known, I’d have made … different provisions regarding my salary. While the ringgit has fallen to its lowest since the Asian financial crisis, the government is sanguine. “Far from what we’ve experienced during the Asian financial crisis, the banking system is very healthy,” said Lee Chean Chung, the communications director of Parti Keadilan Rakyat, which is part of the ruling coalition. In fact, the finance ministry expects the ringgit to recover this year . The central bank — Bank Negara Malaysia — had already called on government-linked companies and investment companies to repatriate their foreign earnings to arrest the currency’s decline. And the move appears to have borne fruit. It was reported that between Feb 26 and April 8, the ringgit was the only regional currency that strengthened against the greenback. “It’ll take some time, but we do see signs of some recovery,” Lee maintained. “At the same time, some businesses are also attracted by Malaysia and continue investing, for instance, in Penang’s semiconductor (sector).” There is, however, scepticism on the ground. According to pollster Merdeka Centre, 60 per cent of 1,220 respondents in an October poll felt that the country was heading in the wrong direction, with economic concerns driving their response. Nearly 80 per cent of all respondents cited the economy — including the weak ringgit — as the country’s biggest problem. The lack of confidence in the government, said Bersatu Youth chief Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal, “doesn’t help” to bolster the ringgit’s value. A soft ringgit is not without its advantages, however. For instance, it can appeal to those expats paid in their home country’s currency, as their salary and savings stretch further when converted into ringgit. In global expat community InterNations’ survey last year, Malaysia was even ranked as the best Asian country for expats. Affordability also helped propel Malaysia into the top ranking among South-East Asian travel destinations last year. The country recorded almost 29 million visitor arrivals — a 100 per cent increase from 2022 — with an expectation that the upward trend will continue. Moreover, with the ringgit’s lower value, Malaysian products have become more cost-competitive on international markets. Still, Teo urged the country to “work harder to gain efficiency” for a more competitive edge. Malaysia must move away from an over-dependence on low-cost labour, said Lee, and strive for an economy geared towards high-income and robust growth. Watch this episode of Insight here .

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Fire, electrocution or an explosion might happen in time, if your electric water heater has been wrongly installed. The programme Talking Point finds out what you can do to keep safe. An instant water heater, one of two main types of electric water heaters. (File photo: iStock) SINGAPORE: When Thakshnamurthy’s family moved into a seven-year-old resale flat in 2021, he did minor renovations but left the electrical system and water heater in place as everything looked “brand new”. Then last November, fire broke out in the bathroom when his son was showering. His wife immediately went out to switch off the electricity at the mains while he got everyone else to leave the flat. No one was hurt. The fire was due to improper installation of the connecting wires between the water heater and the circuit breaker, which eventually melted the wire insulation. After that, Thakshnamurthy spent more than S$2,000 getting a licensed electrician to rewire his entire home and install a new water heater. “It was very scary,” he told Talking Point as he showed programme host Steven Chia photos of the charred bathroom. Besides fire, water heaters have been involved in explosions and even deaths from electrocution. How does one prevent such accidents? Chia spoke to four experts and found out seven things of note. There are two main types of electric water heaters. Instant, or tankless, water heaters, as the name implies, supply hot water instantly because the water flows through a heating element powered by electricity. They are mostly installed in Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats as they take up little space. Storage water heaters, on the other hand, take up more space but provide a steady flow of hot water at higher pressures — ideal for rain showers. Water is heated and stored in these water heaters and reheated when needed. No matter which one you buy, look out for the safety mark, advised service engineer Peck Choon Heng from Homeone Water Heater. To be registered and sold in Singapore, all water heaters — as controlled goods — must have the mark. “Those without (the) safety mark aren’t allowed to be installed,” he warned. Since 1985, all new homes must have a residual current circuit breaker ( RCCB) installed. This device can cut off the power supply when it detects a leakage of electricity from an appliance or from wiring. It is estimated — from a sample survey of about 1,800 HDB flats built before 1985 — that fewer than one per cent of such flats do not have an RCCB protecting the entire unit. But the mere presence of the RCCB does not necessarily mean a water heater is safe to use. For example, the RCCB could be faulty or improperly installed. “Test (to see) if the RCCB is working, then … test (to see) if the heater’s circuit is linked to this RCCB,” Peck advised. To ensure safety at any residential premises, electrical work should be done by licensed electrical workers, while water service and sanitary plumbing should be done by licensed plumbers. But nine times out of 10, believes Peck, this does not happen. “Simply google ‘water heater Singapore’. Most of the advertisements are (placed by) unlicensed (workers),” he charged, adding that shops selling heaters may also recommend unlicensed workers for installation work. To obtain his licence, said Confucius Teo from Competent Electrician, he had to complete a course provided by the training arm of Singapore Power, go for an interview and sit a test given by the Energy Market Authority (EMA). Including his time at polytechnic and on-the-job learning, it took about seven years. “Some can’t even get it after 16 years,” he said. “It’s very stringent. “(The EMA is) handing you a licence (whereby) you could kill someone easily if you make a mistake.” Customers can verify a licence on the EMA website , as with a plumber’s licence by using national water agency PUB’s search tool . The installation of storage water heaters, for instance, must be carried out or supervised by a licensed plumber, who must submit a pre-installation plan to the PUB for approval. This paperwork is the reason plumber Steven Tang charges about 10 per cent more than his unlicensed counterparts. Teo, meanwhile, may charge double the amount quoted by unlicensed electricians for the same job, depending on how the water heater was wired previously. “We have a lot of things to check,” he said. He lamented that many people choose unlicensed workers owing to the perception that “it’s a simple job — it just (involves) connecting wires”. WATCH: What makes water heaters explode, catch fire or electrocute you (3:51) When it comes to instant water heaters, the most common way in which electricity leaks is through use of a three-pin plug, said electrical engineer Wang Gucheng. “In the recent deaths related to water heaters,” he cited, “the users used a three-pin plug.” In December 2020, three family members in a Jurong flat died from electrocution after the cables in the three-pin plug that supplied power to their instant water heater had fused together. A three-pin plug carries electric currents of 13 amperes, while “most of the water heaters (draw) about 14 to 20 amperes”, said Wang, the head of Temasek Polytechnic’s Clean Energy Research Centre. He ran a test to demonstrate what would happen when there is an overload: When the temperature increased to 180 degrees Celsius, the insulator melted and the cables fused. “If the earth (wire) melts with the live wire, then potentially the whole casing of the water heater will become live. That’s quite dangerous,” he said. With normal usage, it typically takes a few years before overheating occurs, he added. But just a leakage of around 0.1 ampere — sufficient to light a bulb — passing through a human body can be deadly. “It’s enough to kill one person,” he said. “The problem is, while you’re using a water heater, you’re wet. … Water is a good conductor of electricity.” As Peck stated: “For instant heaters, the only contact point is (between) your hand and the heater, so there’s no other way for the current to flow in any direction other than your hand.” Between 2014 and 2021, all five electrocution deaths in HDB flats were linked to water heaters. Users should connect their water heaters to a double-pole switch instead, Wang advised. “This (switch) can take currents of up to 20 amperes, which is enough for a water heater.” Also, wires in a three-pin plug “are very close to each other”, but a double-pole switch allows for “some distance” between cables, which is safer. Compared to an instant heater, a storage heater’s pipework is joined to a mixer, so the chance of being electrocuted is very small, Peck said. “It’s already connected to the ground, so if something happens, it’s very likely to just trip the (circuit breaker).” But storage heaters are not without risk. In 2017, a storage heater in a Marine Parade condominium ruptured. The explosion was so strong that it shattered glass doors and windows. WATCH: Hidden dangers of water heater — how to install it safely? (23:45) Storage heaters are more elaborate because they are linked to multiple points, such as the shower areas and basins, unlike typical single-point instant heaters, said Tang, who is also secretary of the Singapore Plumbing Society. A storage heater has safety features such as a pressure relief valve, which releases pressure when the water tank is overheated. “(But) if this doesn’t function, the water tank will be very dangerous,” he said. “It’ll cause (an) explosion.” Few unlicensed plumbers understand the importance of the valve, he added, so some of them may not even install it. Another important component is a drainpipe. “When a drainpipe in a wall is obstructed, it doesn’t allow the pressure to be released,” said Peck. “The pressure will continue to build up … and (the heater) will explode when it’s too high.” As with the relief valve, he said unqualified workers may not even install a drainpipe. Both types of water heaters can be a fire risk owing to their high electric current draw, which is about 3,000 watts, or 25 amperes, Peck said. In 2021, there were 17 cases of fires involving water heaters in homes. When Chia had his storage heater checked, Peck found that the wires connected to it were too thin. Instead of measuring 2.5 millimetres square, the existing wires were 1.5 mm thick. “When the current is high, (the wires) will overheat and will start to burn,” said Peck, who considered it a “fire hazard”. On a day-to-day basis, users — especially those who have a storage heater — should switch on their heater 10 minutes before use, advised Peck. After use, they should switch it off to save electricity. He also advised having heaters checked by someone qualified once every three years. And now that Chia can do his own basic checks, he plans to “take a sniff around”. He said: “If you smell burning plastic, it might mean the wiring is overheating. And that’s not good.” Watch this episode of Talking Point here . The programme airs on Channel 5 every Thursday at 9.30pm.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider After incidents where consumers found worms in their sashimi, the programme Talking Point did a small experiment on the safety of sushi sold in Singapore. A veteran chef also shares tips on checking for parasites before indulging in raw fish. Talking Point host Steven Chia will keep eating sushi but pay more attention to each slice before tucking in. SINGAPORE: He was in the mood for sushi, so TikTok user Jeff Koh bought some from a popular take-out store in Woodlands two months ago. “The store is always crowded, with a long queue, and I trusted their hygiene (standards),” he said. But when he arrived home, he discovered what looked like “a few” white worms on the raw fish slices, or sashimi. He posted a clip of his discovery on TikTok and tagged the sushi retailer and media outlets, asking what consumers who find parasites in their take-out sushi should do. While the incident hasn’t put Koh off sashimi, he has changed his eating habits. He now goes to “a proper Japanese restaurant” to have his fill of the dish. “And I usually will take a closer look at the raw salmon to see if there (are) any parasites or worms on it. I would just flip … the sushi,” he said. There’s more that consumers can do. Experts and industry players share tips on the CNA programme Talking Point, which also conducted a small experiment to look into how safe it is to eat raw fish in Singapore. Raw fish may be commonly eaten here, but the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) considers it a “high-risk food” as it does not go through a cooking process. “Besides microbiological contamination, the consumption of ready-to-eat raw fish also carries a risk of contracting parasitic diseases,\" the agency told CNA in February, after another consumer found a parasitic worm in her sashimi rice set from a Japanese discount chain store. WATCH: We test salmon sashimi from 15 stores for food safety (4:28) Two of the more common parasitic worms are roundworms — such as the Anisakis — and tapeworms. An adult parasitic worm first lays eggs in the intestine of a host such as a dolphin. Its eggs are passed out in the faeces of the host and hatch into free-swimming larvae, said Republic Polytechnic environmental and marine science lecturer Marie Tan. The larvae swim around looking for their next host. They could be eaten by a prawn, which is in turn eaten by a fish. And if the fish gets eaten by a human, the human would become “an accidental host to the parasite”, said Tan. Parasitic worms are “quite common” in fish, especially wild-caught ones, she said. They are less likely to occur in farmed fish, which grow in more controlled conditions. Consumers who have inadvertently eaten Anasakis worms could experience a range of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and loose stools, said infectious disease specialist Ling Li Min of Rophi Clinic. Some may pass out blood in their stools but, most of the time, these symptoms are hard to tell apart from regular food poisoning, she said. Another fish parasite that consumers of raw fish could ingest is tapeworm, which can grow to lengths of a whopping two or three metres. People may be unaware they have ingested tapeworms, said Ling, who treated three tapeworm infections last year. They may show no symptoms such as diarrhoea or nausea until they “find something … crawling in (their) stools”, she said. Tapeworms do not immediately cause life-threatening diseases, but could cause problems should they remain in humans, she added. “Remember — it latches on to the intestine, so it’s going to interfere with nutritional absorption. All of this is going to give rise to general poor health.” This is why individuals should seek medical help, she added. As scary as paras itic worms can be, they are “thankfully, not at all common” among patients Ling sees. Food poisoning caused by bacteria such as Sal monella, Escherichia Coli (E. Coli), Vibrio and Listeria monocytogenes is “much more common”. To test the safety of sushi sold in Singapore, Talking Point sent 15 samples of salmon sashimi from various sources — online grocers, supermarkets and budget to high-end eateries — to a laboratory. The samples were tested for parasites as well as Salmonella, E. Coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes. In healthy people, these bacteria may cause minor illness, said Ling. But in people with compromised immunity, the consequences could be severe or life-threatening. Ling singled out Listeria for its potential to cause severe illness and even miscarriage in pregnant women. No parasite was found in the 15 samples. The tests revealed contamination in two of the samples. But only one sample, purchased from a budget-friendly joint, was unfit for consumption due to the presence of Listeria. According to Singapore food regulations, the bacterium must not be detected in ready-to-eat food. The other sample, from an online grocer, contained an acceptable level of E. Coli. At 20 colony forming units per gram, this was lower than the 100 colony forming units per gram limit for solid food set by the authorities, explained Agnes Ye, senior manager and head of the microbiology department at test and inspection company Setsco Services. E. Coli can end up in food due to food handlers not washing their hands properly, said Ye. Listeria, a cold-loving bacteria that can survive even in a refrigerator, can find its way into food at any point along the supply chain, she said. “For example, if the table is dirty and you put your fish on it. … Subsequently, when you package the fish, the bacteria can still remain in it.” The SFA recommends buying ready-to-eat raw fish from licensed establishments only. Consumers can make raw fish the final item they put in their shopping basket and keep it in an insulated bag, according to guidelines issued in 2021 by the agency Enterprise Singapore and the Singapore Standards Council. They should place the fish in a chiller at temperatures between zero and four degrees Celsius as soon as possible after purchase, and follow instructions on the package on how to handle and store the item. Before and after handling the fish, they should wash their hands and utensils thoroughly. They should not refreeze items that have thawed. WATCH: The full episode — Are my sashimi and raw fish safe to eat? (21:30) For people dining out, chef Koezuka Yoshihiko, the general manager of Kuriya Dining, has some tips on reducing the chances of eating sashimi that contains worms. Demonstrating with a kampachi, or yellowtail flown in from an Osaka fish market, Yoshihiko told Talking Point host Steven Chia that “transparent” eyes on a fish indicate freshness. Worms tend to be found in the intestines of fish, so Kuriya Dining's imports have already had their guts removed in Japan. Diners should check the surface of the fish they are going to eat, as well as check between the sliced fillets. They should also ensure there are no holes in the flesh and, finally, check for firmness, said Yoshihiko. “If there are worms inside or if the fish is not fresh, the flesh may be a little bit soft.” Although the SFA recommends entities importing and processing ready-to-eat raw fish do deep-freezing, many do not because deep-freezing affects its texture. But licensed importers have traceability measures and various practices in place. They apply for a cargo clearance permit each time they import fish, said Kenny Ng, vice-president of the central kitchen of food services company RE&S Enterprises. This ensures should food incidents occur, companies know “exactly which batch it came from”. Throughout the transportation process, the fish is kept at temperatures below four degrees Celsius, Ng added. Carton boxes that arrive at RE&S’ headquarters are inspected to ensure they aren’t broken. As part of the company’s procedures, samples are taken from the processing line and sent to the company’s quality assurance laboratory to undergo tests to ensure that any bacteria found are below thresholds set by the authorities. Fish that pass the inspections are cleaned and sliced, then packed and sent to restaurants. Labels indicate expiry dates, and any leftovers will be discarded by the restaurants, Ng said.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider They make cooking convenient, but what are the potential health risks? The programme Talking Point speaks to experts, including one involved in a study in Singapore that could make people sit up and take notice. Several viewers of Talking Point wanted to know more about non-stick pans. SINGAPORE: For as long as non-stick frying pans have been a mainstay in many home kitchens, there has been a debate about how safe these pans are. Man-made chemicals are needed to make the pans’ non-stick coating: Widely known as “forever chemicals”, they are not easily broken down in the human body and take a long time to break down, if at all, in the environment too. And now a study of more than 1,000 Singaporean women — which followed them as they attempted to get pregnant and through their pregnancy — has found that these chemicals can reduce fertility. Women with a higher level of the chemicals in their bloodstream were 40 per cent less likely to fall pregnant within a year and 34 per cent less likely to have a live birth within the year. The researchers considered a higher level of chemicals to be two to three nanograms per millilitre of blood. A nanogram is a billionth of a gram, not visible to the naked eye. “That’s not a very high level,” said clinician scientist Jerry Chan at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, one of the researchers. “It’s just about a tenth of that compared to, let’s say, the United States, Norway or even China, and yet we’re able to determine a negative impact on fertility.” His advice to women who are trying to get pregnant or are pregnant is to “try to avoid potentially dangerous chemicals”. “One of the ways to reduce the risk could be the avoidance of … non-stick cookware or even non-stick wrappers for your food,” he said. But is this the only group who should worry about non-stick pans? The programme Talking Point finds out what makes these pans work their cooking magic and what precautions everyone can take. One particular type of non-stick pan dominates the market - those coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), better known by its trade name, Teflon. As with all products, however, other chemicals are added during the manufacturing process. In the noughties, one of these chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), was linked to cancer and other health issues. By 2015, most major manufacturers had phased it out. And these days, non-stick pans are likely to come with PFOA-free labels. WATCH: Non-stick pans — could they be toxic to you? (22:58) But it has been replaced by GenX, which belongs to the same family of chemicals and performs the same job as PFOA: To prevent the non-stick coating from clumping together in clusters and give the pan its smooth surface. Unpacking the science of non-stick pans, Tong Yen Wah, a National University of Singapore (NUS) associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering, said that because GenX and PFOA have a similar chemical structure, “theoretically, they’d have the same health effects”. Non-stick cookware chemicals pose a risk if they seep into the food, which he said happens at around 250 degrees Celsius. “In normal cooking, that won’t happen because we normally cook between 150 to 200 degrees. But it could happen (in) very small amounts,” he said. It also matters if a Teflon pan has scratches. “Once you have a big, deep scratch, what happens is you create all these grooves,” he said. “Then you have more contact with these ‘forever chemicals’ — so more contact points mean more of the (chemical) release can happen.” Manufacturers have sought to reassure consumers, quoting studies that say PTFE has no health effects even when ingested. But they have also advised against overheating food when cooking, to avoid damaging the pans. Non-stick cookware, however, only scratches the surface of the problem. In recent years, cosmetics including foundation, fast food wrappers and even baby bibs have tested positive for these chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Products that can resist water and grease would likely contain PFAS. And consumers love these products for their non-stick, stain-resistant and waterproof abilities. The process of making these products, however, causes these chemicals to leak into the environment. They are emitted from factories into the air, go into land and sea when it rains and find their way into food and water supplies. Researchers have found them even in remote areas: in rainwater on the Tibetan Plateau and, as reported last year, in the snows of Antarctica. Increasingly, these chemicals are linked to a host of health problems such as liver damage and thyroid disease. “In some countries, the ‘forever chemicals’ can be found in drinking water,” said pharmaceutical scientist Eric Chan from NUS’ department of pharmacy. “I’d regard this as the highest risk.” In Singapore, which has included PFAS in the PUB’s routine testing and monitoring regime since 2016, “these compounds have not been detected in our drinking water”, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment said last year in a parliamentary reply . Still, there are other sources of exposure: Chemicals may leak from grease-proof food packaging, some sunscreens contain PFAS — which can enter through the skin and circulate via the bloodstream — while the risk of leakage from wearables like raincoats is lower. Non-stick frying pans are in the middle of the risk spectrum, according to Eric Chan, who echoed his NUS colleague’s views as he advised consumers to “really consider purchasing a new one” once their pan’s surface is scratched or corroded. “What we’re concerned (about) is the chronic exposure. When the exposure is low, … yet the chemicals stay in our body for such a long time, the chemicals now get accumulated gradually,” he said. “When they reach a minimum toxic level, they can cause damage to organs. In some cases, they can lead to even cancer.” Researchers are still trying to figure out the impact of day-to-day, low-level exposure to these chemicals. “It’s an endemic problem, and it’s not going to go away soon,” said Jerry Chan. “It’ll probably take the next few decades for us to understand the impact fully, as we’re now really studying the impacts on the children, on their puberty, their hormonal changes as they grow older.” To reduce exposure, it is easiest for consumers to focus on two categories: Grease-proof food packaging and non-stick cookware. When it comes to frying pans, one option is stainless steel. It is durable, resistant to damage and relatively easy to maintain. But can food fried on these pans slide off nicely? Anthony Yeoh, chef-owner of French bistro Summer Hill, has some tips on cooking better with stainless steel. First, preheat the pan on medium heat. “This is something that a lot of cooks make a mistake, at home, of (not) doing. And then … everything kind of gets mashed up and stuck to the pan,” he said. “When the stainless steel is properly heated up, the metal expands, and it closes up all the little gaps — because the metal is actually porous.” The way to test the pan’s temperature is to add drops of water. Normally, when the pan is not hot enough, the water will “stay in one spot and bubble like a little puddle”, instead of skating across the pan. For another layer of non-stick properties, add oil to the pan, Yeoh advised. One of the benefits of stainless steel is the food caramelises in minutes, “and that’s where all your flavour’s going to come from”, he said, whereas with non-stick pans, “it’ll take a long, long time to get that nice brown”. Stainless steel is “easy to clean”, he added. “Unlike a non-stick pan, which they tell you, ‘Don't damage, don’t scratch, always use rubber tools’, you can just use a stainless steel sponge … go at it and scrub it all out.” In a heavy-usage environment, he would use non-stick pans for “something like scrambled eggs”, otherwise the pans would not last long, while stainless steel pans are a “great all-rounder”. The “workhorse of the professional kitchen” is the carbon steel pan, which is a bit heavier and great for cooking steaks, for example. “But unlike a stainless steel pan, you can’t really cook anything too acidic in this,” said Yeoh. “If you’re cooking a tomato sauce, this will give it … a metallic taste.” Cast iron pans, meanwhile, are the ones “everybody kind of loves because they look pretty” and are “very traditional”. But “these are the ones that probably, out of all four, require the most maintenance”, he said. These pans must be seasoned — rubbed with salt, oiled and put in a preheated oven — to develop a non-stick coating. “Then make sure you don’t damage the non-stick coating,” he added. Then there is ceramic-coated non-stick cookware, which is made of silica, or essentially sand, and other inorganic materials. They are perceived to be a safer non-stick cookware choice but do not last long — a year on average or “maybe three years or so” for the good ones, Yeoh reckoned — compared to common non-stick pans.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Lots of Singaporeans carry water bottles, but how many are aware of the bacteria and mould we gulp down with every use? The programme Talking Point examines common hygiene habits and how to avoid potential health risks. Many water bottles to choose from, but did you know the bottle’s material can affect the bacteria build-up? This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: As temperatures soar and Singaporeans swelter , venturing outside often necessitates a water bottle at hand. Experts warn, however, that our reusable bottles might be dirtier than we realise. Infrequent and insufficient cleaning can turn trusty bottles into Trojan horses for bacteria and mould. Even the top hydration brands — like Owala , Hydroflask and Stanley — are not exempt from the multitude of germs. A consumer study in the United States has suggested that reusable water bottles could gather more bacteria than a kitchen sink, computer mouse or even a toilet seat. “When we consume food, we have food particles in our mouth. And once we bring this water bottle to our mouth to drink, … some of them can get stuck within the water bottle,” said water quality expert Kwok Chen Ko. WATCH: Is your reusable water bottle a hotbed of harmful bacteria and mould? (21:58) Bacteria and mould are then free to feast on these deposits, especially in the absence of “a thorough washing”. So what qualifies as “thorough”, and how many of us are truly safeguarding our sips? The programme Talking Point investigates misconceptions about bottle hygiene and the stark realities that follow. Some users of reusable water bottles had theirs tested in a lab to find out for themselves. Ang Teck Kuan, for one, did not expect his bottle to have the most bacteria and mould. “I only drink plain water from it,” he countered. At first glance, there seems to be some truth to his theory. Sugars and fats found in common beverages, such as tea, coffee, and syrups, accumulate in water bottles more easily, creating conditions conducive to bacterial and mould growth. But the absence of such substances does not inherently prevent germ cultivation. A bottle that was used simply to store water in the fridge, for example, had the highest mould count — because mould thrives in moist environments, and the bottle was rarely washed. More than one Talking Point viewer, however, had put their faith in plain water. Trixie Ong and Joshua Sim, who occasionally added other drinks to their bottles, were rinsing them with water daily and washing with soap once a week or less. Their bottles tallied bacteria-cum-mould scores of 90,303 and 71,801 respectively, beyond the recommended limit of 55,000. Wennie Chia, on the other hand, removes the various parts of her bottle for a soapy scrub every other day. She had a bacteria-cum-mould score of 11,338, the lowest among the 10 water bottles that were tested. At a broader level, a Talking Point poll showed that 52 per cent of 1,100-plus respondents on Instagram washed their bottles daily, 19 per cent did so twice or thrice weekly and 18 per cent said once a week. And 11 per cent said once a month. Bottles should be washed daily, said Kwok. But even that might not suffice if only rinsed with water or done ineffectively. He recommends “using a brush with detergent” to scrub the water bottle inside and outside, paying “special attention” to areas with lip contact, like bottle rims and caps. It could be a challenge cleaning straws and narrow-mouthed bottles, and he does not recommend using the latter. What is important is to get a brush of the right size, such as a wire brush for straws. Adison Wong, a Singapore Institute of Technology associate professor, emphasised that certain bacteria, like pseudomonas and cyanobacteria, are cause for wariness. When ingested, the latter “can lead to abdominal pain, nausea (and) diarrhoea”, while the former can cause a respiratory tract infection if they reach the lungs through the oral cavity. While these health hazards are largely invisible, you can look out for a gooey coating that often emits an unpleasant odour, for signs of microbial colonisation. Known as a biofilm, “it’s a sort of shelter for the microbes to thrive in and grow freely”, Wong said. According to Nanyang Technological University associate professor Sierin Lim, the material of your water bottle also affects the extent of bacterial and mould cultivation. The bioengineer illustrated with an experiment that glass has the slowest colony-forming rate, followed by polypropylene, stainless steel and finally polycarbonate, which is a strong, transparent type of plastic. As to why polypropylene and polycarbonate ranked differently even though both are plastics, she referred to the distinct properties of each surface. “Polypropylene has lower wettability compared to polycarbonate, which means that polypropylene will repel more water, while polycarbonate will attract water,” she said. Besides wettability, what will attract microbes are textured surfaces and porous material, as “bacteria like to hide in the crevices of the surface”. Therefore, a less porous and less textured surface like glass is more impervious to the growth of bacteria and mould. Still, Lim said other factors can come into play in the likelihood of bacterial and mould growth. A bottle that is easy to clean, and an owner who is willing to clean it sufficiently, is a good place to start. Watch this episode of Talking Point here .

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider With rising temperatures outdoors, the programme Talking Point meets experts and experimenters to find out what makes 25 degrees Celsius a recommended temperature for air conditioning. Talking Point host Diana Ser finds out the difference that even one degree Celsius makes. SINGAPORE: When Lee Kuan Yew became Singapore’s prime minister in 1959, the first thing he did was to install air conditioners in government buildings. In his mind, air conditioning was the key to working efficiently. But how cold is cool enough to be more productive? Something like 21 degrees Celsius or warmer instead? Researchers at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) now have the answer. They got participants in an experiment to solve visual puzzles at two different room temperatures. And at 25 deg C, people performed cognitively faster than when it was cooler. This is one of the ways in which turning the air-con up has an impact. The programme Talking Point finds out what difference a few degrees can make — to productivity, electricity bills and the climate — and how to keep cool even amid the rising temperature outdoors. What science tells us about air-con settings and our bodies is that the body regulates its internal temperature, keeping it to around 37 deg C ideally. In a colder room, the body uses more energy to generate heat, possibly leaving less energy for mental tasks. And in the SUSS experiment, where accuracy and reaction times were a proxy for productivity, while participants all performed the tests at similar levels of accuracy, reaction times were 10 per cent faster when the temperature was set at 25 deg C instead of 21 deg C. That was not the only result. “It was really interesting, physiologically,” said experimenter and SUSS associate professor Emily Ortega. “With skin temperature, it was quite clear that it kept going down in the slightly warmer condition.” The convergence of lower skin temperatures and faster reaction times points to 25 deg C as more conducive to working, even though many of the participants, before the experiment, thought the colder the room, the higher their productivity. “Now we have some kind of evidence to suggest that what you think isn’t what you get,” said experimenter Ooi Seok Hui. The National Environment Agency advises setting the air-con at 25 deg C as an energy-saving tip. And there is also research behind this. Air-conditioning and Refrigeration Association president Leong Cheng Wee, citing the famed thermal engineer Povl Ole Fanger, said comfortable temperatures can range between 22 and 27 deg C. WATCH: What is the best temperature to set my air conditioner? (22:25) “We normally tend to select right in the middle,” said Leong. “This is normally the sweet spot: At least 80 per cent of the target audience is satisfied.” So why are buildings in Singapore so cold? Because “it’s easier to over-cool than to under-cool”, he said, since people who are cold can wear a jacket, whereas those who are warm cannot really be removing their clothes. How much savings, then, can turning the air-con up deliver? In a test done by Giridharan Karunagaran, the director of the Singapore Berkeley Building Efficiency and Sustainability in the Tropics research programme, the air-con in two rooms covering 50 square metres was set at three temperatures. The first setting was at 22 deg C, then 23 deg C, followed by 25 deg C, and the power consumption was measured. The energy savings from going from 22 deg C to 23 deg C amounted to nine per cent, or S$72 yearly if the air-con is used for eight hours per day, 20 days per month, with the tariff rate unchanged. Going from 22 deg C to 25 deg C delivered savings of 34 per cent, or about S$278 per year. But it need not stop there. “You’ll indeed save a lot more energy for every (one-)degree increase,” said Giridharan. Besides cutting down on power bills, turning the air-con up can also help to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Air-con systems remove heat from homes in a process called the refrigeration cycle, the same process that cools refrigerators. This process is driven by the compressor outside the home: It moves a chemical called a refrigerant between the coils connecting the outdoor and indoor units and requires the most energy in the air-con system. Meanwhile, the refrigerant — made up of hydrofluorocarbons, which are much more potent greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide — absorbs heat from the rooms and expels it outside. One kilogramme of refrigerant has the same greenhouse impact as driving a small car from Changi to Jurong 500 times. Cooling emissions, caused by energy consumption and refrigerants, account for about 11 per cent of Singapore’s greenhouse gas emissions. By increasing the temperature from 22 deg C to 25 deg C, households can lower their carbon emissions by 30 per cent. Every increase of 1 deg C reduces carbon emissions by 10 per cent and electricity costs even further. In fact, some Singaporeans may not be keeping cool efficiently. Aaron Wu of Amyth Aircon Services, who shares air-con tips with his company’s 16,000 followers on TikTok, visited some homes to see if people were inadvertently working their air-con units harder than they needed to. In one home, he found an air-con unit blasting cold air while a window was slightly open. A thermal camera provided by Talking Point showed heat entering the room. This also caused cool air to escape, said Wu, and the air-con had to work “very hard” to maintain the room temperature according to the setting. Besides closing windows and doors, one could increase the unit’s fan speed to cool a room down instead of setting a lower temperature, he advised. “Let the cold air disperse,” he said, “and you’ll enjoy the cooling facility faster\". Using a ceiling or standing fan to circulate cool air from the air-con also helps to bring the temperature down, he added. This is called hybrid cooling. With hybrid cooling, the air-con could be set as high as 27 deg C without compromising comfort — or productivity. And this concurrent use of cooling devices consumes less energy than lowering the air-con temperature. Watch this episode of Talking Point here .

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Over 400,000 people in Singapore have diabetes. Most of them do not manage their blood sugar levels well, which can lead to kidney failure or limb amputation. The programme Talking Point finds out the difference good diabetes control can make. Talking Point host Diana Ser meets Brandem Liew to find out if there’s a fighting chance of beating diabetes. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: He was a triathlete for about two years. But when Brandem Liew started his own business, life got too busy, and taking care of his health fell by the wayside. Over five years, he piled on 15 to 16 kilogrammes. Early last year, he began to get active again, cycling and running more. Then, while having blood tests done at a clinic earlier this year, Liew found out that he had diabetes, a week shy of his 41st birthday. Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not respond to a hormone called insulin or is unable to produce it to control blood sugar levels. When there is an insulin shortage or when one’s body cannot effectively use what it produces, elevated blood sugar levels result and can severely damage the body. “I felt that it shouldn’t be happening to me,” said Liew. WATCH: Part 1 — Diabetes: I’m young and healthy. Why should I care? (21:39) His doctor put him on medication to lower his blood glucose levels, and he worked on his diet with a nutritionist. After a month, there was promising news: Liew had a good chance of remission if he kept his efforts up. He made the “big shift” from a “typical Asian diet” to something more customised. For instance, he switched all simple carbohydrates for complex ones, which include whole grains and brown rice. “I had to be educated (on) the way I eat, and this involves food sequencing,” he told the programme Talking Point . “We line our stomach with fibre first — that means (eating) vegetables first, followed by protein. “(Lastly), we take our carbohydrates, and this will help to reduce … the spike in blood sugar.” Diabetes is on the rise worldwide. Singapore in particular has one of the fastest-growing rates of diabetes: More than 400,000 people here have the disease today, and the number could hit one million by 2050. About one in 12 Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 had diabetes during the period from 2021 to last year, according to the National Population Health Survey 2022. There are two main types of diabetes. Type 1 is an autoimmune condition affecting the pancreas’s ability to produce insulin. Its exact cause is unknown. Type 2 diabetes is the commonest form of diabetes. Most of its risk factors can be managed through lifestyle choices. Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as Type 2. But there are ways to fight back against this silent killer. Diabetes is a “silent condition” as diabetics may not feel unwell, said Chia Kee Seng, professor and founding dean of the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. But in its silent phase, it continues to do damage. High blood sugar, a characteristic of diabetes, damages the kidneys’ blood vessels and tiny tubes called nephrons, which filter the blood, return needed substances to it and remove additional waste. This can lead to long-term complications, said Chia. Kidney failure is one: Two in three cases in Singapore are due to diabetes. In fact, Singapore ranks first in the world for incidence of diabetes-induced kidney failure. Even the young can be at risk. Kidney dialysis patient Lin Guo Qiang, for example, was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes at age 14. He was prescribed oral medication but “didn’t really follow” his doctor’s instructions. “Sometimes I forgot, sometimes I just missed (taking it),” said Lin, who continued gulping down soft drinks, for example drinking 1.5 litres of Coca-Cola at one go, “just for the thrill”, and eating fatty foods. During his National Service, a food poisoning episode landed him in the emergency department. Doctors again told him his blood sugar levels were “quite high”, Lin, now 38, recalled. They prescribed oral medication and insulin, but he did not stick to the regimen because of financial difficulties. “The medication was quite expensive back then, (inclusive of) insulin and the syringes. It was a bit hard for me to pay for all these things,” he said. He continued with his high-sugar diet “because (he) was still very young and still quite strong”. In his late 20s, his vision began failing. He went to see his diabetes doctor, who suspected he had “very early stage” kidney failure. Besides the blood vessels in his eyes becoming damaged, what started as a “small pimple” on his left shin became “very red” and infected, with pus coming out. His leg swelled so much he could not put his shoe on. He also had a fever and vomited. Today, he needs dialysis thrice a week and must inject himself with insulin as well as take six pills before each meal. While his dialysis sessions do not incur out-of-pocket expenses — the money is deducted or claimed from his Medisave savings and MediShield Life plan — Lin stressed that he “can’t stop working”. “If I were to lose my job right now, it’d be very hard to (keep funds flowing into) my Medisave (account) because there (would be) no source of income,” he said. “And then it’d be hard for me to (get a job) as a dialysis patient. A lot of employers don’t like to hire those (with) chronic diseases.” Another complication of diabetes is lower limb amputation. The reduced blood flow and nerve damage from poorly managed diabetes mean small wounds in the lower limbs cannot heal, and infections could set in and spread. Singapore has one of the world’s highest diabetes-related lower limb amputation rates, at an average of four such amputations daily. WATCH: Part 2 — Diabetes: How can I manage it, and what happens if I don’t? (21:58) Diabetes exacts direct and indirect costs from society, said Kavita Venkataraman, an associate professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. Medicine, dialysis and consultations are examples of direct costs, while indirect costs include time off work, early retirement and premature death. The indirect cost of diabetes accounted for 58 per cent of the total cost of S$1 billion in 2010. By 2050, the total could balloon to S$2.5 billion. Chia said that not only must patients be educated to comply with diabetes control, but also systems should be in place to “ensure that a large proportion of the diabetics are managed well”. Diabetes self-management in Singapore has been ineffective. About six in 10 known diabetics aged 40 and above had poor control of their blood glucose level, the National Population Health Survey 2022 showed. The figure was almost eight in 10 for younger diabetics aged 30 to 39. Business owner Liew belongs to the minority and has pushed himself to do even better. In addition to his eating habits, his lifestyle shift has included sleeping and waking early to get his workouts in. From a blood sugar level of 10.8 per cent when he was diagnosed, he managed to achieve about 6.5 per cent within four months. Diabetes is in remission when a patient’s blood sugar level returns to less than 6.5 per cent for at least three months after stopping medication. The effort is worthwhile, Liew said. “When I achieve remission, I lower the risk of heart disease, I get away from possibly having dialysis. Living longer — I think it’s worth it.” Watch Talking Point’s two-part special here and here . The programme airs on Channel 5 every Thursday at 9.30pm.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Around 34,000 children have lost one or both parents to COVID-19. Countless more have dropped out of school. Dreams have been upended. The programme Insight looks at how the future of Indonesia’s young generation is at stake. Brothers Dona and Beni, aged 17 and 11, lost their mother to COVID-19 in July. Their father abandoned them, and they now live with their mother's aunt. EAST JAVA: In August, 17-year-old Tasya Aprilia Agatha lost her father to COVID-19. It left the family struggling to survive. As a delivery driver and sole breadwinner, he used to earn just enough for the family every month. With his death, an alternative source of income was needed, and Tasya had to step up. Six days a week, she wakes at 4am to help her mother run a makeshift food stall, while juggling school and working in a cafe. She gets about four hours’ sleep a day. “I’m working because I want to help my mother and to pay my school fees,” she said. “I can use my income … to pay my own expenses. I don’t have to ask my mother (for money).” The high school senior in Kediri city in East Java dreams of going to university and becoming a businesswoman. But with her punishing schedule, her school grades have slipped. Many other students in Indonesia have dropped out amid the pandemic. According to a September 2021 World Bank report, about 2 per cent of children aged five to 18 who had been enrolled in school up to March 2020 were no longer enrolled in November 2020. That is about 1.3 million students. The most cited reason for dropping out was lack of money to pay school fees. “It may be that some of these children are re-enrolling now … But it’s also likely that many dropped out permanently and have been joined by other student drop-outs during 2021,” noted World Bank senior education specialist Noah Yarrow. The pandemic has had far-reaching implications for Indonesia’s children, their education and future, which the programme Insight explores . Even for those in school, the long periods of lockdown posed a challenge when classes had to move online. “When we had questions, it was so difficult to ask, even if we tried to explain (them) on WhatsApp,” said Tasya. “Direct interaction is much better.” Her teacher, Yurni, agreed, adding that most of the parents — who are in the medium- and low-income brackets — may also be unable to provide what the students need most: Adequate internet connection. “Sometimes when we reached out (to the children), they said they were unable to join the online class. We asked them why, and they said they were running out of internet quota,” said the teacher, who goes by one name. Although more schools have reopened, catching up on what students have missed is another challenge. According to the World Bank report, only 30 per cent of Indonesian children achieved minimum scores in reading on the Programme for International Student Assessment before the pandemic. The report estimates that school closures precipitated by the pandemic could result in a loss of between 25 and 35 points, on average, on students’ reading scores. A Unicef report also noted that an increased drop-out rate from school closures puts children at risk of child marriage and exploitative activities. Minister of Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection Bintang Puspayoga acknowledged that child marriage and child labour are “on the rise” owing to the unavoidable “economic pressure” from the pandemic. “We need to build a support system together in the form of a safe and comfortable environment for them,” she said. But once the children drop out, they are left with no option but to join the workforce. After earning money, some do not turn back. Take, for example, 10-year-old Rizki: He has been working as a street clown in Depok city in West Java for a year. The money he earns — around two million rupiah (S$190) a month — helps to pay the rent on the house he shares with his 24-year-old brother Iksan and his brother’s wife, Endah. Endah has tried to persuade Rizki to get an education so he can apply for better jobs in future. But when asked if he wanted to return to school, he said: “No, I don’t. We need money to pay the house rent.” The odds are stacked even higher against children who are left with no one to care for them. An estimated 34,000 Indonesian children have lost one or both parents to COVID-19. To protect orphans, the Indonesian government has legislation in place when it comes to finding substitute carers, with immediate family members called upon first. According to Bintang, a team headed by the local office of the Social Affairs Ministry will make sure that “the right substitute carers” are found. “We need to make sure the children are protected and … won’t be neglected later,” she said. “We have to make sure they won’t be exploited and trafficked.” But even if a suitable carer is found, financial help is also often necessary. Brothers Dona and Beni, aged 17 and 11 respectively, lost their mother to COVID-19 in July. After she died, their father abandoned them to the care of their mother’s 72-year-old aunt, Suparti, whom they refer to affectionately as Grandma. She loves the boys and takes care of them willingly, but it means she must shoulder extra costs. “Sometimes the little boy asks me what I’m cooking … If he wants me to cook beef soup, for example, I’d say that we should cook something else. Otherwise, the money won’t last for the whole month,” she said. To ease her financial burden and pay his school fees, Dona, a high school senior in Kediri, helps to sell satay in the evening. Beni, meanwhile, receives support from the local government, which covers his fees. According to Kediri mayor Abdullah Abu Bakar, around 300 children in the city have lost their parents during the pandemic. To help them and their carers, the local government is working on a programme called “Hope for Family”, to be launched this year with the help of the private sector. The programme includes an initiative to create a bank account for each beneficiary, which the local government will transfer funds to “either monthly or annually”, the mayor cited. Save the Children Indonesia is working on a similar project. In the province of West Java, the non-governmental organisation works with the local office of the Social Affairs Ministry to help children who have lost their main carers. WATCH: Asia’s lost generation: Indonesia’s children orphaned by COVID-19 (46:38) Read this story in Bahasa Indonesia here. Today, with close to half the population fully vaccinated, COVID-19 cases have dropped significantly since July, when Indonesia battled a second wave of infections driven by the Delta variant. The country’s daily count dropped to below 100 new cases at one point in December, but it has since started to increase again , with the prevalence of the Omicron variant. Last month, Indonesia also started vaccinating children aged six to 11, to further contain the spread of the virus. Their education is of equal concern, however, with Yarrow noting that there are “lots of different actors and different levels of government trying to provide support”. “Recovering from the learning loss during COVID and improving beyond it are major challenges,” he said. This is something Indonesian authorities must grapple with even as they prepare for a new wave of infections. “We pray that it won’t happen and that things will return to normal,” said Abdullah. “The number of school drop-outs has actually decreased. But because of COVID-19, it’s increasing again. We have to keep the number in check because the best investment is education for our children.” For now, Tasya is persevering, hoping that she will have the stamina to continue with her studies. Indeed, there is some hope: Her mother, Sumini, is likely to be one of the beneficiaries of Kediri’s new assistance scheme. The 47-year-old is a high school drop-out herself. All she wants is that Tasya does better than she did and continues to chase her dreams despite the challenges. “Don’t be like your mother … Education is important,” said the widow. “My wish for her is that she becomes someone who’s responsible for herself and cares about others.” Watch this episode of Insight here .

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider The mental health of healthcare workers has recently been a topic of concern. Are things changing for the better? (File photo: iStock) *Names have been changed. SINGAPORE: It was early 2021. Lisa*, then a senior staff nurse at a public hospital in Singapore, received news that her father had contracted COVID-19 in Malaysia amid the Delta wave. She would have gone home straight away, but her nurse manager’s response to her leave request shocked her. “She told me that with the manpower shortage, I shouldn’t be so selfish and (should consider) my other colleagues,” said the Malaysian in her 30s who had worked here for 12 years at that point. The hospital relented only when she said she would quit. She considers herself “very lucky” that she was granted a month’s no-pay leave: Eventually, her father’s condition deteriorated, and he needed intensive care. “The saddest part about being in healthcare is when you spend so much time taking care of patients and their families, but you end up neglecting your own,” she said. CNA Insider could not get the hospital to verify her account without identifying her. But she said it was the last straw in a series of events that had “drained” her. She realised that the long shift hours and lack of rest was taking a physical and mental toll. She left the hospital last August but is still in public healthcare: At a polyclinic, where she works more regular hours. She is only the tip of the iceberg. In November, the Ministry of Health (MOH) released statistics showing that about 1,500 healthcare workers resigned in the first half of last year, compared with 2,000 annually before the pandemic. Last month, Senior Minister of State (Health) Koh Poh Koon elaborated on these numbers in Parliament: In 2019, the overall attrition in the healthcare workforce was 9.6 per cent. It dipped to 6.8 per cent in 2020, but then the two-year average attrition reached 9.8 per cent last year. Two of the public healthcare clusters approached by CNA Insider did not share their attrition rate. The third, the National Healthcare Group (NHG), said last year’s rate was “higher than pre-COVID periods (2018 and 2019)” but “manageable”. But even as the Omicron wave wanes, healthcare workers CNA Insider spoke to say manpower shortage remains a concern. More than 20 nurses, doctors and allied healthcare workers were interviewed and spoke on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorised to speak to the media. About half of them had left their jobs in public and private acute hospitals or have tendered their resignation. When James*, a mid-career nurse in a public hospital, tendered his resignation in January, he realised that at least five colleagues from his renal ward had done the same that month. Another nurse from the ward, whom CNA Insider spoke to, corroborated this. The departures this year were “more pronounced” than last year, he felt. “(With) the third year of the pandemic, I guess most of them had enough. There was uncertainty over when their next break would come.” A speech therapist in another public hospital said she has not seen this number of resignations in her 10 years there: This year alone, seven people in her department left, though not all owing to burnout or stress, she noted. “Usually, about three, maximum four, people leave in a year,” she said. Senior pharmacist Dean*, who has been in a public hospital setting for four years, said that in his section of about 150 staff, the resignations are most notable among pharmacy technicians. They number more than pharmacists and assist with pharmacy operations such as dispensing of medication and inventory-related matters. About 30 to 40 per cent of them, mostly foreigners, left between the end of last year and early this year during the height of the Omicron wave, when the impact of departures was most acute, he said. Pharmacists like himself had to fill the gaps. “Pre-COVID, if people left, (the hospital) would just hire people from overseas to replace them, so nobody really felt the pain. But with COVID and the borders closed, it wasn’t so easy to plug the holes,” he added. For David*, a nurse in the emergency department with 10 years’ experience, the fact that experienced workers are quitting is a deeper concern than the numbers alone. His colleague, Yvette*, agreed. “The need to retrain new nurses — which takes time — will increase the burden on the experienced ones, which gives these remaining experienced nurses even more of a push factor for leaving, like a vicious circle,” said the emergency doctor. The mental health of healthcare workers has recently been a topic of concern across different platforms, from social media posts to authored studies. In late February, an Instagram post from @thehonesthealthcareworker on how nurses were “not coping well” did the rounds. It said that the healthcare system was on a “slow road to collapse”, that working conditions have “worsened significantly” with no increase in practical support and that many workers were leaving. The nurse-patient ratio has also increased “from 1:6 to 1:12 or more”, wrote the author, who later told CNA Insider he saw this happening in his hospital — although this could not be verified officially. A post shared by thehonesthealthcareworker (@thehonesthealthcareworker) A study published in the same month by the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases highlighted the burnout brought on by overwork, emotional exhaustion and inability to take adequate leave as a “morale breaker” among healthcare workers. There may also be pull factors at work, particularly among foreign nurses who may be attracted to other countries. According to MOH figures in Dr Koh’s parliamentary speech, last year’s attrition rate among foreign nurses was 14.8 per cent, double the 7.4 per cent among local nurses. As the Omicron wave wanes and Singapore regains a semblance of normality, is there respite in sight to stem the flow, particularly for healthcare workers in acute hospitals? It may not be a given. “It was never only about the pandemic,” said Tina*, a former senior staff nurse in her 30s who left her post in a renal ward at a public hospital. “This pandemic only brought more attention to healthcare workers and the issues we face at work.” Sunlight. That was the first thing that came to mind for Lisa when asked what marks her polyclinic job out from her previous one in an acute stroke unit. “You’re always in the building throughout the day. You don’t get to see the little, simple things that tell you it’s going to be a good day,” she said, tears welling in her eyes at the memories. She also worked night shifts (9pm to 8am). For every three of these shifts, she used to get a “sleeping day” to readjust her body clock, on top of her regular days off. But this was removed even before COVID-19. “You didn’t get to rest and recharge before your next shift starts,” she said. She often worked overtime. As a senior staff nurse, she oversaw 12 to 14 patients and had to manage complaints. She was also a clinical instructor mentoring nursing students. Today, she often leaves work at 5.30pm. Her mood is “much better”, and she is “energised” for the day, she said. Besides polyclinics, other job options for nurses include dialysis centres, nursing agencies, community nursing in long-term care settings like hospices, and lecturing in polytechnics or the Institute of Technical Education. While facilities like HCA Hospice and the National Kidney Foundation Singapore said the number of nurses joining them has been “stable” over the past few years, three nursing agencies that recruit on a freelance basis cited an increase in applications. Carelink Home Nursing Services estimated the increase at 40 per cent, compared with before the pandemic. Common reasons include flexible working schedules and more balanced pace of work, as well as higher compensation and recognition, said agency director Vikki Tan. At caregiving start-up Homage, nurses can take up stints in various settings, whether in a home, community hospital or a facility. This is what James the mid-career nurse has done, citing the ability to have “more control” over his work. “I try to achieve a bit more work-life balance … If I need more money, I’ll take on more jobs,” said James, who now also works at a private clinic. This contrasts with his experience in a COVID-19 ward, where he was deployed in the early days of the pandemic and during the Delta and Omicron surges. At one point, he was taking care of eight to 10 patients — his previous “worst-case scenario” was six to seven patients. After months of “repetitive” work and “this vicious cycle of non-stop working”, he reached “breaking point”, he said. If this trend for nurses going to nursing agencies continues, there is cause for concern, said Associate Professor Jeremy Lim of the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. “Staffing becomes more difficult and expensive, which cascades into higher costs for patients and, potentially, safety issues due to staff turnover and unfamiliarity,” he said. Higher pay outside public hospitals was a strong pull factor for some. Farez*, a staff nurse who left a general ward last August for a private dialysis clinic, said he is earning more while the workload is less. “(People who quit) don’t feel like they were paid for the amount that they worked,” he said. Occupational therapist Ryan*, who left public healthcare last month after six and a half years of service, was offered a 20 per cent pay increase in the private sector. He was also told he would be “chased home at 5.45pm”. “I now see about 10 patients a day. I get to spend quality time with them. I’m able to relate better, understand their needs more thoroughly and assist them throughout the recovery process so much more,” he added. Before he made the switch, his daily case numbers during the pandemic had risen to about “19 to 20”, as there were more elderly patients whose physical function “fell quite a bit” after they contracted COVID-19. There are others who have quit just to rest. One of them is Tina, who has eight years’ experience. She said her patients’ growing demands, especially during the pandemic, had drained her. For example, when visits were not allowed, her ward provided video calls as an “extra service” — which, in turn, patients “demanded”. “If we were busy, you had to wait a while. But there’d be people … shouting at us just to get the video-call phone to call their family,” she said. She also felt recognition for nurses was lacking. Pandemic notwithstanding, Tina said she had patients asking her, “Do you even earn S$2,000 a month? You’re just a missy. You’re just wiping buttocks. Why do you need a degree for that?” Some healthcare workers are drawn to opportunities overseas, and even private hospitals are not immune. Filipino nurse Chris*, for example, left his private employer for the United States in April last year. “It’s raining green cards for nurses,” he said, referring to the card that allows holders to live and work permanently in the US. It would have taken years to obtain before the pandemic, but it landed in his lap in less than a year, he added. Two other Filipino nurses CNA Insider spoke to made similar points. Chris loved his job here and Singapore too. He lived with his sister and had “a lot of opportunities” at the hospital he worked at — he said he was promoted every two years and was offered a scholarship. But his application in 2013 for permanent residency was rejected — twice in his sister’s case. In the US, Chris is paid thrice his salary in Singapore, has an apartment to himself and owns a car. When applying for a car loan, he noticed how different things were as a nurse in the US vis-a-vis Singapore. “People here really appreciate nurses. They have high respect and high trust,” he said. According to him, even though he had no credit history, the moment he said he was a nurse, his loan was approved, no questions asked. According to a Singapore Nursing Board report in 2019, Filipino nurses number about 7,600, or 18 per cent of Singapore’s nursing workforce. Citing these figures in Parliament last July, Dr Koh said the MOH was working with healthcare employers to ensure the adequacy and sustainability of the nursing workforce. “Healthcare employers should also diversify their recruitment sources,” he added. With greater competition for nurses worldwide, however, Assoc Prof Lim said Singapore would “remain uncompetitive” if it does not “unlock” the permanent residency and citizenship lever for foreign staff. “If we don’t change, we then become the training stop for nurses,” he said. “(They) come here for a couple of years, get trained and then head to Australia or the United Kingdom.” Last month, Dr Koh said the MOH is working on retaining foreign nurses by “keeping their remuneration competitive”. It has also worked with other agencies on “factors that are important for their retention”. Despite the overall challenges, many healthcare workers have soldiered on — together. In her two and a half years in the oncology department of a public hospital, staff nurse Kelly* has had her share of bad days, but what has kept her going is her colleagues. “That motivates me to come to work every time, knowing that I’m well supported by others working on a shift with me, regardless of the situation and demands of the day,” she said. Sometimes they help to answer call bells from her patients on her behalf or start medications that doctors have ordered for her patients. When manpower is lacking, especially with nurses coming down with COVID-19, her supervisors step out of their offices and work with them on the ground — helping with dressings and even feeding or showering the patients, she added. This is a view echoed by Alex*, a medical officer in the emergency department of another public hospital. “Sometimes when I’m unable to (fill in) a certain form or talk to a patient’s family, my nurses will say, ‘Don’t worry, I’ll help you.’ Or sometimes when nurses are busy and can’t check (patients’) blood pressure, I’ll tell them, ‘Don’t worry … I’ll do it,’” he said. “Everybody is in one team helping to solve the problem … It’s a far nicer feeling than feeling isolated … facing all this shit yourself.” Indeed, in the recent study on burnout cited above, many healthcare workers had mentioned being “motivated and inspired by strong leadership and supportive colleagues”. Other morale boosters included having pride in being healthcare workers, and those on the front line expressed their appreciation for being thanked and supported at work. This included kind words and tokens of appreciation distributed to all healthcare workers, as well as more tangible support such as the provision of interim staff housing and the ability to take consecutive days of leave once again. The aim of the study was to explore the effects of Singapore’s pandemic response on healthcare workers’ morale and commitment, and to identify ways of enabling operational safety and functioning. To this end, the researchers identified workers’ “stoic acceptance to fight, adjust and hold the line”, characterised mostly by a sense of devotion to service — “we have to work under such conditions” — and the expression or inference that “fear is for the weak”. But the researchers concluded that this attitude, though necessary in the eye of the storm and indeed the biggest morale booster at the height of Singapore’s first COVID-19 wave, can last only so long before causing chronic and systemic problems, such as entrenched burnout. Both Alex and Kelly attest that the latest wave has taken a toll. Kelly, for example, is “more burnt out than ever”. “Imagine working tirelessly for five months and finally (taking) a week of leave, only to be called back four times during the week,” she said. In response to CNA Insider’s queries about the attrition rate, manpower shortage and nurse-patient ratio, the MOH pointed to Dr Koh’s parliamentary speech last month. The three public healthcare clusters, meanwhile, outlined efforts on the ground to retain staff and ensure their well-being. The NHG said it aims to help staff achieve higher job satisfaction by automating manual tasks and empowering them to make decisions when redesigning roles. It added that it has stepped up efforts to monitor the well-being of staff, including their psychological health. Staff at SingHealth have access to experienced medical social workers, counsellors and psychologists, coordinated by the SingHealth Staff Care Centre, “whenever they may feel distressed or simply want someone to talk to”, highlighted group chief human resource officer Esther Tan. The cluster also has about 500 peer supporters who are “trained to extend emotional support to their fellow colleagues in times of need”. The National University Health System (NUHS) has rolled out meetings in certain specialities whereby senior and junior staff can have “frank discussions about their emotions and feelings of vulnerability” in the clinical environment. On the issue of leave, the NHG said staffing needs are managed through “advance planning and staggered rostering of leave”. “This ensures that staff are able to go on leave by turns to rest and recharge or to return to their home country,” said Olivia Tay, its group chief human resource officer. SingHealth, meanwhile, said the prevailing guidelines on overseas leave applications are largely “no different” from usual leave applications. “As the Omicron situation in Singapore eases further, more staff will be able to resume some pattern of time away from work to rest and recharge, and for our foreign staff, the opportunity to return home to spend time with their families,” said Ms Tan. As for recruitment, the NUHS is stepping up efforts locally and internationally, to “combat exhaustion”, and has introduced flexitime opportunities and part-time nursing schemes “where appropriate”. Returning staff are also valued, said its group chief human resource officer, Priscilla Teo. For example, some locum nurses who worked at its Community Care Facilities have joined the cluster full-time. There is also an “alternative workforce” comprising basic care assistants and student nurses who support its nurses in patient care. At SingHealth, while recruitment efforts are in place, the cluster devotes “much more attention” to staff development, especially with the “insatiable global demand” for healthcare manpower. Now with the Omicron wave waning, some healthcare workers said their working conditions have improved. Janine*, a senior staff nurse in her 30s, told CNA Insider earlier this month that morale in her department, an intensive care unit, was “rather low”. But since then, things have started to look up — the lifting of restrictions has helped “in a big way”. Some of her colleagues have taken leave and even travelled, including foreign colleagues off to see their families. “We have sufficient manpower now, so that means … no one’s getting a call back on their days off,” she said. She had also been hoping that training opportunities would resume — in particular, courses to help her specialise in trauma. And she got her wish: Training sessions that were on hold for months have recently resumed. In senior pharmacist Dean’s case, while the COVID-19 workload is decreasing, there is little respite. Manpower has yet to be replaced, and patient cases and projects that were postponed over the past two years are coming back “fast and furious”. Since January, he has been able to take up to two consecutive days off. Anything longer than that, he said, is subject to balloting. And overseas travel requires approval from his head of department. Still, he remains hopeful and looks forward to a time when the manpower issues can be resolved. As for doctors, those CNA Insider spoke to welcomed the recent news about a national wellness committee for junior doctors , which will review and recommend changes to existing healthcare practices and guidelines to improve the well-being of junior doctors. Singapore Medical Council guidelines stipulate that junior doctors may work up to 80 hours a week. But surveys showed that 20 per cent of them exceeded this stipulation, possibly owing to “the nature of clinical work in certain departments or exigencies of service”, Dr Koh said last month. Now that the ministry is involved, Terry*, a medical officer in the general medicine department of a public hospital, is “hopeful that the committee will make a difference”. “But with regard to whether (the recommendations) will be adopted and whether they’ll be enforced properly … only time will tell,” he said. He listed two things that would help significantly: Mandated rest days that are strictly enforced and a “nationwide effort to move away from 30-hour calls”. This refers to doctors having to stay through the night at the hospital after their shift and continue the next working day. Those who have left acute hospitals, however, said it is unlikely that they will return. “It’s a fulfilling job, but the amount of recognition doesn’t reciprocate the amount of hard work,” said Tina. With plans in the pipeline to start a family, Lisa, too, is unwilling to endure irregular hours and shift work once again. “The hours aren’t friendly to working mothers,” she said, adding that as her husband is also a nurse, it would mean days when they barely see each other. Farez is another who is contented where he is, at the private dialysis clinic. “I might go back only if the hospital has a better staff to patient ratio and more protection for nurses,” he said, highlighting multiple occasions of “verbal abuse” from patients as one of the triggers for his departure. Some allied healthcare workers CNA Insider spoke to echoed this view. Indeed, the NUHS said that besides the workload and working hours, a “significant part of staff burnout” is due to abuse, in person and online, and that it has “increased measures to mitigate risks”, without elaborating on these protective measures. One way to take this forward, suggested Assoc Prof Lim, is to “very publicly punish” the people who abuse healthcare professionals. “Yes, you’re under emotional stress,” he said. “But so are the nurses, and so are the doctors. I think people can take a lot more when they feel that their bosses have their backs.” Another way to improve matters is to raise wages, he added. “We agree that nursing, physiotherapy and so on create a lot of societal value — then society should be prepared to pay.” Last year, the MOH announced a salary increase of up to 14 per cent for nurses in the public healthcare sector, phased over two years. For allied health professionals, pharmacists and administrative and ancillary staff, the increase was 3 to 7 per cent of their monthly base salaries last year. What is important, stressed Assoc Prof Lim, is that nurses’ salaries be benchmarked to their peers in other essential public services. “For new recruits to any profession, it’s not what you’re paid relative to three or five years ago if you’d been (in that profession),” he said. “It’s the opportunity cost: If I wasn’t in nursing, would I be a teacher? “Is a nurse with 10 years’ experience similar to a police officer with 10 years’ experience? A Singapore Armed Forces officer? That’s the sort of equilibration we should be looking at. “And if the pay goes up, respect goes up.” In the meantime, he sees one other way to retain staff or entice those who have left to return: To increase public awareness of the “nobility of the profession”. “It’s not that people don’t want to be nurses. People want to save lives (and) do good,” he said. “How do we, as a society, make it easy for people to do the right thing and sign up for the caring professions? Because, trust me, we and our families will need to use the health system.” For folks like Kelly, there is still job satisfaction. “Nursing is my passion, and I’ve never regretted joining the industry,” she said. “As cliched as it sounds, I chose this profession with the intention of helping others in need. And by doing so, it helps me keep … my humanity and humility.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider It is likely that some children have come down with long COVID, which could affect their development. The coming study will determine how prevalent it is, among other important aims, the programme Talking Point learns. Siblings receiving their COVID-19 vaccinations at the Queenstown Community Club vaccination centre. (Photo: MOE) SINGAPORE: Some studies overseas have put the prevalence of long COVID in children at anywhere from 4 to nearly 60 per cent of those who became infected with the virus. But in Singapore, such a study — which would help to better manage children here who have had COVID-19 — has not been done yet. That is about to change. KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) is planning to embark on a study to determine whether long COVID is indeed a problem in young children and teenagers in Singapore. Long COVID is the experience of lingering symptoms. And it can affect a child’s development if he or she has it. “We do know that long COVID might potentially be a problem in children,” said KKH consultant Li Jiahui, who specialises in paediatric infectious disease. Hence the coming study will be “important”, she noted. KKH intends to roll it out in the second half of this year, over a period of three to six months, she told the programme Talking Point . Results are expected by year end. The study comes in the wake of the Omicron wave having seen children contract COVID-19 at the highest rate among all age groups in Singapore. For example, between December and February, around 27,000 children aged five to 11 were infected with the virus. So far, KKH has not seen any cases of children with long COVID. But there are “several possibilities” as to why this is so, said Li. One that she cited might be the way the hospital defines long COVID: As typically lasting for more than two months after the initial infection. “And (children) might very well have symptoms that are really mild,” she added. “But they might otherwise be well enough to be attending school and not seek medical attention (for) these persistent symptoms.” This means it is likely that some children have come down with long COVID, she noted. The main aims of the KKH study are to determine how common it actually is and what “some of the risk factors are that can predispose a child or teenager to develop long COVID”, she said. “(The study) will help us define the natural cause of long COVID in children. It will identify … how to better follow up on children who’ve had COVID-19.” Persistent symptoms, such as sleep difficulties and disturbances in concentration and memory, can potentially affect children’s development and learning, she said. “We do need more studies to characterise these difficulties and symptoms. Right now we don’t know the … trajectory of long COVID.” Most of the studies of long COVID in children are from the West, she noted. And their findings “may not be entirely applicable to our context” and may not give an “accurate representation” of long COVID in children in Singapore. For one thing, Asian children may show particular symptoms differently. “Secondly, the symptoms may be partly attributable to various factors such as lockdowns, social restrictions, safe management measures, which differ from country to country,” she cited. Nonetheless, some symptoms are “red flags” that should alert parents to seek further attention for their children. “In very young kids, if they’re unusually sleepy, lethargic, if they have a great disturbance in their appetite and their energy levels, all these would be warning signs,” she advised. In older children, the symptoms include a persistent cough, headaches and disturbed sleep cycles. The children may not necessarily have long COVID, but “they’d need further evaluation and possibly further tests to see why they’re having these symptoms”. Among adults, classic symptoms of long COVID include a persistent cough, breathlessness, chest tightness, heart palpitations and loss of stamina. “In many ways, it’s complex … It’s a big mixture of different symptoms,” said Barnaby Young, who heads the Singapore Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). “Sometimes people say that they didn’t have them initially, and they came on a couple of weeks later and can often be going through a waxing and waning pattern.” Then there is brain fog, which is also common but is an area he highlighted as important and needing further research, “to really understand whether this is going to be a long-term problem”. A recent United Kingdom study found that persistent brain fog from severe COVID-19 can cause cognitive impairment that is equivalent to losing 10 IQ points — and studies like this have been “very worrying for people to hear”, he noted. At the NCID’s long COVID clinic, which he runs and was started in November, he has heard people describe brain fog as a loss of concentration and having difficulty focusing throughout the day. Hor Chor Kiat, for one, has “difficulty choosing certain words to describe certain things” at times. He was among Talking Point viewers who replied to the programme’s call for questions and stories from people suffering from COVID-19 symptoms two months after they tested negative for the disease. Some of them had what they thought were lesser known symptoms, such as ringing in the ears and a headache that lingered on from time to time. Joanne Thum had a back pain that she already recovered from, but after her COVID-19 infection, it “came back stronger” and became “even more painful”. CNA executive producer Pearl Forss complained that her stomach “has just not been the same” following her infection. “I’ve had constant bloating and discomfort. And I’ve had several rounds of food poisoning when my friends and family would be eating the same food and they’ll be okay,” she recounted. It may be difficult to be sure, but all these symptoms can be attributed to long COVID, said Young. More than 200 different symptoms have been reported internationally. There are also studies showing that long COVID affects women more than men. Paradoxically, the immune system in women is “often better”, which probably means a higher risk of long COVID “because the immune system’s reactivity is continuing after the infection has resolved”, said Young. But why do some people have such bad symptoms while others feel fine? And why do some people with mild initial symptoms also end up getting long COVID? “We don’t really know what the exact trigger is,” he replied. “Something going wonky with the immune system is the most likely explanation.” WATCH: Do you have long COVID? When COVID-19 symptoms linger (21:57) What the data show, however, is that the elderly aged above 70 — a high-risk group for severe COVID-19 compared to younger patients — will also have more long COVID symptoms, pointed out Steve Yang, a consultant in The Respiratory Practice. “If you’ve been in the ICU, if you’ve been on the ventilator … with a lot of scarring in your lungs, you’ll have a lot of long COVID symptoms,” he continued. People can develop long COVID even if they are vaccinated. But vaccination helps: The evidence points to “around a 50 per cent reduction in the rates of long COVID”, noted Young. According to the NCID, in findings published last year, one in 10 unvaccinated adult patients in Singapore had persistent symptoms six months after their initial infection. For good management of long COVID’s symptoms, the general advice of Tan Tock Seng Hospital rehabilitation medicine consultant Wong Chin Jung is to “do light intensity exercises and not to over-exert”. “For example, instead of jogging or running, maybe start with walks first and gradually increase them in intensity or even duration,” he suggested. The question of exercise was on the mind of Talking Point viewer Alif Adam, who felt that his muscles were taking longer to recover than before. That experience is a typical one, observed Wong. “Even without COVID, just (by) resting at home for one month, most people will undergo deconditioning. There’ll be an element of the heart rate not being so good, muscles deteriorating,” he said. “What long COVID does is it hinders the ability to tackle the deconditioning aspect.” As for antiviral options such as Pfizer’s oral medicine Paxlovid, “don’t expect there to be a good treatment soon”, said Young. Paxlovid is now approved only for adult patients with early-onset COVID-19 who are at high risk of severe illness. A few reports suggest that it may also help those who already have long COVID, but Young thinks the chances are slim because their symptoms are “probably being driven by the immune system” and not the virus any more. “Finding something that can modulate the immune system without suppressing it, without overstimulating it … is going to be very challenging,” he said. In the United Kingdom, trials are being done to determine whether statins such as cholesterol medication and blood thinning agents can be used against long COVID. So there may be “some options” within the next year or so, he reckoned. “But I don’t think we’ll get anything before then, and it may be that these agents turn out to not be effective.” For Stephen Lim, who started to develop new symptoms a week or two after his initial recovery around mid-February, it took many specialist tests before he was put on medication for his lungs, heart and gastrointestinal tract. Previously, he had been to accident and emergency four times; at one stage, he thought he was having a heart attack. His treatment plan gives him “a sort of assurance”, but he is still suffering from symptoms. “I don’t go out as much any more. If I do go out, it’s best that I have someone with me,” he said. Most people, according to Young, will be “back to where they were” within three months of infection. But some will continue to struggle after that. “I’ve seen a few patients in the long COVID clinic who’ve had symptoms that have gone on for more than a year,” he said. “We could be talking about this … in two years’ time. It could be something that drags on for that long for a small number of people.” Watch this episode of Talking Point here . The programme airs on Channel 5 every Thursday at 9.30pm.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider The programme Insight looks at China’s transition from COVID-19, the political and economic impact and what lies ahead for the rest of the world after the most populous country has resumed international travel. BEIJING: Restaurateur Wang has seen brisk business in his eatery in Xi’an, Shaanxi province, since China lifted its zero-COVID policies in December. It is a welcome change for the 60-year-old. His business has been battered after three years of strict measures, which included showing a negative COVID-19 test result to enter most places and being quarantined in centralised facilities after testing positive. “With a brick-and-mortar shop, the impact’s been huge,” he said. “(When) you have a shop that no one’s visiting, you can’t sustain a business.” But he contracted the disease soon after the relaxation of restrictions. He suffered body aches, fever and was coughing up phlegm. “It’s definitely a lot more severe than a cold,” he said. “Some of my older friends … with underlying conditions or with weaker immunity have passed away.” He felt that the severity of the illness was downplayed as the government downgraded COVID-19 from a “devil” virus to one resembling the flu. “That’s my feeling — that the experts didn’t pay enough attention or weren’t rigorous,” he said. Wang’s view reflects the general sentiment of the Chinese, whose initial relief and even joy at China’s COVID-19 flip-flop dissipated with the surge in cases and deaths. The programme Insight looks at China’s transition from the pandemic, the political and economic impact and the path ahead for the rest of the world as the most populous country reopens and resumes international travel. It was inevitable that China would eventually open up, yet the speed at which it abandoned its zero-COVID policies caught many people off guard and overwhelmed its healthcare infrastructure, leaving funeral homes inundated with the dead in weeks. WATCH: China ends zero-COVID policy — Is the pandemic over? (47:43) “That lack of planning is a surprise to many people,” said Benjamin Cowling, who heads the epidemiology and biostatistics division at The University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health. “Why wasn’t there a plan for this transition … (with) two months or three months of proper mitigation, with mask mandate, with hospitals ready for a surge in cases, with social distancing as much as possible to slow down the peak?” Chinese officials estimated that almost 250 million people contracted the virus in the first 20 days of December, and the death toll since its policy U-turn at more than 83,000 up until Feb 9, excluding deaths outside of hospitals. But experts have disagreed with the data presented by China. Airfinity, a United Kingdom-based predictive health analytics company, puts the cumulative number of deaths since Dec 1 at 1.51 million based on its Feb 17 data. Chinese citizens have also questioned the government’s reporting of the situation as “controllable”. “We’re all confused — confusion from getting COVID-19 to dealing with it,” said media producer Yang Xiao, who has seen in various media that people have fought over medicine as supplies ran out. “We’re lacking resources, lacking medicine.” The lockdown protests prior to China’s policy change have morphed into angry comments on Chinese social media Weibo after the U-turn. “There’s a sense among the Chinese public that they’re not as confident in the regime and how it handles COVID-19. They’re questioning a lot of the leadership’s choices, decisions,” said National University of Singapore (NUS) political scientist Chong Ja Ian. The spike in cases and deaths can also be attributed to low vaccination rates and quality of vaccines. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), full vaccination using Chinese-made vaccines requires three doses. But only 58 per cent of the population had been fully vaccinated as at Dec 13. The two most widely used vaccines in China are developed by Chinese pharmaceutical firms Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm. Both use an inactivated virus to trigger an immune response and are considered less effective than messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines. A study by Yale and other researchers showed that the Sinovac vaccine did not produce enough antibodies to neutralise the Omicron variant. Although China has been “asking more and more (of the) elderly” to get their doses since the autumn, said Chen Gang, assistant director and senior research fellow of NUS’ East Asian Institute, “the process has been quite slow because many elderly people don’t really trust the quality of the vaccination”. When the European Union offered to donate mRNA vaccines to China early last month, it was rejected by Beijing — a decision that demonstrated the “self-reliance strategy” under President Xi Jinping’s leadership. For “national security reasons”, Chen added, Chinese authorities “don’t really trust the quality of the foreign-made vaccines”. Another reason for the lack of urgency was the low number of infections prior to the policy U-turn. “Because COVID-19 wasn’t in the community, (older people) didn’t think it was going to be imminent,” Cowling said. “They ended up getting COVID-19 in December or January before having a chance to get vaccinated. And that was a missed opportunity to save many lives.” Last year also marked the first time in 60 years that the number of deaths in China exceeded the number of births. With the demographic decline, coupled with the effects of the lockdown of large cities, Chinese leaders recognise the need to boost a maturing economy, said Chong. China’s economy grew by 3 per cent last year - its second-lowest level in more than 40 years. But the streets have become crowded since the reopening, a sign of economic recovery after years of zero-COVID-19 restrictions. “Restaurants, cinemas, stadiums are packed already; people are already less fearful,” said Wang Huiyao, the founder and president of the Beijing-based Centre for China and Globalisation. “Everybody’s embracing the new life.” Since the start of the year, the Shanghai Composite Index has been on an upward trend. And he is confident that China’s gross domestic product will grow 6 per cent this year, double the rate last year. At the recent G20 summit in Indonesia and the Apec meeting in Thailand, Xi was “the one leader that everyone was queueing up to see”, noted Joseph Liow, dean of Nanyang Technological University’s College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. The Chinese president had been absent from the international arena for nearly three years, and “there’s a reason why everyone wanted to reconnect with (him)”, said Liow. “It was to position themselves and their economies for the eventual reopening of China for business.” With China’s travel restrictions lifted last month, the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute estimates that Chinese travellers will make 110 million international trips this year. But some countries are hesitant to welcome them for fear of renewed outbreaks. “If the vulnerable people in any given population are still not adequately protected, and you’re going to let in a surge of people who have got as yet unclear vaccination or infection status, then that’s going to expose these groups of people,” said infectious disease physician Asok Kurup. There is also concern that a new variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus could emerge in China and proliferate via travellers from the country. With the recent Kraken subvariant, for example, some estimates put the efficacy of mRNA vaccines at about 30 per cent. But are travel restrictions the answer? “If there was a new strain emerging in one part of the world, travel measures won’t stop that strain from getting to other parts of the world,” Cowling said. “I don’t think travel measures really have many rationales.” Nevertheless, countries like the United States, South Korea , Canada, Britain and Australia are still enforcing rules for travellers from China, such as pre-arrival COVID-19 tests. All visitors to China, too, must produce a negative pre-departure test result. Morocco, however, went so far as to ban all arrivals from China. “For the rest of the world, it’s a matter of sort of striking their own balance,” Liow said. “How to gradually open the door to Chinese tourists, Chinese business visitors … is going to be one of the definitive issues of this year.” At the start of this month, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the numbers of severe cases and deaths had fallen almost 90 per cent from their peaks. Already, on the eve of the Lunar New Year — the first since 2019 where the Chinese could return freely to their home towns — the centre’s chief epidemiologist said around 80 per cent of the population had been infected. Chen believes it was part of the “government’s plan” to leverage the festival to help achieve herd immunity sooner, although Beijing naturally “wouldn’t openly announce that”. And if the worst is over, there is cause for optimism not only for China but the world. “The pandemic risk has passed because the virus is now circulating globally. … Now that China has moved to living with the virus, I think that’ll be the trigger for the WHO to declare the pandemic is finally over,” said Cowling. For Wang the restaurateur, the end of zero COVID-19 in China has marked a crucial juncture in time. “This pandemic has made me realise that many things simply can’t be predicted,” he said. “The road ahead is long. It’s more important that we don’t look back. We should march forward.” Watch this episode of Insight here . The programme airs on Thursdays at 9pm.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Coffee producers are facing many challenges now, and the programme Talking Point heads to Indonesia, the source of Singapore’s traditional ‘kopi’, to find out what these are, what can be done and whether prices will continue to rise. Many things may affect the price of a cup of coffee. SINGAPORE: It does not seem much: a 0.6 per cent fall in Indonesia’s coffee production this year, according to estimates released last December by the country’s Ministry of Agriculture. But it is the first such fall since 2019. And as supplies of Indonesian robusta coffee — the kind that is largely found in Singapore’s hawker centres and coffee shops — come down, prices are shooting up. “In the last four, five months, we’ve seen the robusta prices in Indonesia move very drastically. It’s now around S$240 for a 60-kilogramme bag,” said Singapore Coffee Association president Victor Mah. About a year ago, traders were paying S$180. Singapore’s consumer price index shows that the average price of a cup of “kopi” (traditional coffee with milk) was S$1.35 in August, which is 7 per cent more than last year’s average price of S$1.26. And it could yet get more expensive. The United States Department of Agriculture forecast in June that Indonesia’s 2023/24 coffee output will fall 18 per cent from a year ago to its lowest level since 2011/12. In a two-part special, the programme Talking Point explores the factors behind the drop and what else is driving the price rises. More than 90 per cent of coffee plantations in Indonesia are smallholdings, such as the one owned by second-generation coffee farmer Kerno in Lampung, Sumatra’s southernmost province and one of the country’s biggest robusta-producing regions. The 50-year-old, who goes by one name, has around 5,000 trees on his farm about the size of two and a half football fields. Last year, he harvested three tonnes of coffee cherries, the fruit produced by coffee trees inside of which are the coffee beans. This year, he hopes his harvest will be around one tonne. “It may not even reach that amount. We’d be lucky if we get 800kg,” he said. Sumatra has been subject to frequent rain and occasional freak weather since last year, which has disturbed coffee trees at a crucial period of the production process. “After the flowering stage, the flowers turn into small cherries. (But) the heavy rain causes them to fall off. They’ll rot and won’t turn into coffee. Therefore, it isn’t possible to get a big harvest,” said Kerno. “We lose out to the weather. It’s very sad.” Other areas in Indonesia have even been hit by hailstorms, which have also affected coffee production. WATCH: Part 1 — Why is my coffee getting so expensive? (22:28) It is not only the weather that can be volatile, but also fertiliser prices, which hit a peak last year because the pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and other supply chain issues tightened global supply. Prices remain at historically elevated levels: 50kg of fertiliser that cost Kerno around 200,000 rupiah (S$18) in the past is now priced at 260,000 rupiah. “When we farmers are hit with the skyrocketing cost of fertiliser, we won’t use as much,” he said. “That leads to lower coffee production too.” The threats to coffee supplies are not confined to Indonesia. Temperature increases around the world have led to the proliferation of a pest called the coffee berry borer. These borers are not only becoming more fertile, but also drilling deeper into the coffee cherries. As they eat their way in, the fruit’s weight reduces. Severely infected cherries drop from the trees, which means they do not ripen and cannot be sold. Climate change — and its impact on weather conditions — is also causing a rise in diseases such as coffee leaf rust, a fungal disease that reduces coffee yield. Globally, coffee production decreased by 1.4 per cent in 2021/22. Although a rebound is projected this year, consumption is also set to increase. For the second year running, coffee producers cannot keep up. In August, the International Coffee Organisation estimated a shortfall of 7.3 million bags this year. More coffee is being consumed in Indonesia too. “Every year, the rate of consumption is getting higher and higher,” said Leo Wiriadjaja, co-founder of Lisa and Leo’s Organic Coffee, a farm in North Sumatra. “That takes away the amount of coffee we can export.” Then there is El Niño this year. With its hot and dry weather conditions likely to be prolonged, industry players expect a further strain on coffee production and a shortage in supply going into next year. Despite the challenges faced by Indonesia’s coffee farmers, Wiriadjaja’s plantation — which he owns with his wife, Lisa Matthews — is thriving. One of the reasons they have kept their coffee yields consistent is they use organic fertiliser, that is material they have composted, such as cut grass and by-products of coffee production. The coffee cherry and the skin of coffee beans, for example, have macronutrient and mineral content for the crops, such as potassium, copper and zinc. The cut grass contains nutrients including carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. “By having all of the elements in the compost provided by us from our farm, we know what’s in it. And we can control the microbiology in it,” said Matthews. “When you buy synthetic fertiliser, you’re relying on what’s printed on the outside of the bag to be what’s on the inside. “But a lot of farmers have found out that sometimes the fillers (added to) these fertiliser bags can be detrimental to the crop. They can introduce the wrong kind of bacteria.” The use of compost, rather than synthetic fertiliser, also results in an annual cost saving of 30 per cent for the farm, reckoned the soil expert. The couple have another natural type of fertiliser growing all over their farm - yellow clover. “It creates a healthy biology within the soil by producing nodules on the end. That contains the nitrogen. And that’s released into the microbes. The microbes change it into an absorbable form for the trees, and it keeps the leaves healthy,” said Matthews. Masses of clover also prevent high temperatures from baking the topsoil. They grow “just on top of the ground”, which creates shade and prevents the soil from “drying out”. “The roots that they have absorb lots of moisture. And then they release it later into the soil,” she added. Besides the clover on her farm, there are shade trees towering over the coffee trees. Their function is to lower the temperature, break up the wind and, through their root system, feed the soil with the nitrogen that coffee needs. “Because the temperature’s lowered, … (the coffee trees) have less stress. They can put their energy into developing the flowers,” said Matthews. The cherries that grow will be heavier — thus yielding more coffee — than those grown by trees in full sun. She also grows flowering plants (lantanas for instance) to attract pollinators such as bees to her farm. These insects will carry pollen that fertilises the coffee flowers. “Severe rains will affect the natural pollination of the coffee tree. Not all of those flowers will become a coffee cherry if they’re not properly pollinated,” she said. The lantana she plants has another useful function: It attracts what is called a predator wasp, which eats coffee berry borers. To further reduce losses from borer infestation, there is a method that can be employed when processing the cherries to get the coffee beans: Instead of using jute bags or gunnysacks, farmers can use drums for “controlled fermentation”, cited Wiriadjaja. “This is better because you can reduce the available oxygen,” he said. “The lack of oxygen … will suffocate (any borers in the cherries).” Instead of losing up to 30 per cent of their harvests to the pests, farmers could reduce their losses to under 4 per cent, he added. His farm produces arabica, which is considered a superior quality coffee and is commonly served in Singapore’s cafes and restaurants. A 60kg bag of arabica beans averages about thrice the import price of the Indonesian robusta. Around 27 per cent of the coffee produced by Indonesia’s smallholders is of the arabica variety. But Wiriadjaja and Matthews run free workshops teaching their farming methods, hoping these can inspire other coffee farmers. WATCH: Part 2 — Will this new breed of coffee plant mean cheaper coffee? (23:25) Other experts and non-governmental organisations, too, have helped farmers improve their agricultural techniques over the years. The rise in the price of Singapore’s “kopi” does not all come down to coffee bean prices, however. Last year, Ya Kun Kaya Toast, which has more than 70 outlets in Singapore, increased the price of its coffee with condensed milk from S$1.80 to S$2. Contributing to that were “many little things coming together”, such as rental, labour costs, medical benefits for the staff and electricity bills. “These things will also continue to creep (up),” said Ya Kun International’s director of branding and market development, Jesher Loi. “You’ve got to deconstruct the various ingredients involved as well: coffee beans, water, milk, sugar. “The profit margin (on) each little cup of coffee has to be put together … to prop the business up.” Overall manpower costs in post-pandemic Singapore have “increased significantly”, agreed Kang Yi Yang, the sales director of Santino, a supplier of roasted coffee beans to local coffee shops. The roasting process, which is what turns the green coffee beans that arrive in Singapore into dark brown beans, presents a challenge too. “It uses a lot of electricity and also gas,” said Kang. And the cost of some of the raw ingredients that go through the roasting process has increased. Sugar costs about 55 per cent more than in 2021, while margarine costs 20 per cent more. “Sugar gives (coffee) more caramelised flavours. It gives (coffee) its body and sweetness. As for the margarine, it makes the whole coffee more aromatic, … the roasting process a lot smoother,” said Kang. “We have no choice (but) to add in all these ingredients to … maintain the flavours of … our traditional coffee.” Very likely it all points to a more expensive cup of coffee going forward, he concluded.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Between January and August, at least S$20 million has been lost in malware scams in Singapore. The programme Talking Point explores the inner workings of this scam tactic — and why both Android and iPhone users should take heed. Scammers can use malware to see whatever you are doing on your phone. SINGAPORE: All that Junia Tan wanted was a good deal: a fried chicken dinner with free delivery, as promised by the advertisement she saw on Facebook. What was the catch? She eventually had to download an app to complete payment. Little did she know that she was about to install malicious software, or malware, on her phone. Malware is designed to gain unauthorised access to a device’s operating system. Luckily for Tan, she caught on to the scam just in time. After downloading the app, she noticed her Facebook app flickering. Then her banking apps flashed up on the screen. “I’m like, OMG. And then it hit me. (The scammer) is controlling my phone remotely,” said Tan. She managed to shut down her phone, then called one bank after another and even ran down to a branch to get help. In the end, she did not lose any money from her four accounts. WATCH: A scammer hijacked my phone — How to tell if you’ve got malware and what to do (4:15) “It shocked me because I’m educated. … I always (thought) maybe the older folks (would be scammed),” she said. “I’d never think someone ‘young’, smart like me, would fall for a chicken ad! “It wasn’t a get-rich-(quick) scheme.” The fact is the authorities are seeing an increase in the prevalence of malware scams affecting Android phones. Between January and August, more than 1,400 victims lost at least S$20.6 million in total, police said. This means some individual losses could have been huge. And there is no let-up in these scams. As many as half a million new malware apps are being generated daily, the programme Talking Point discovered in a two-part special — along with what you need to know to keep up. Malware can enter your phone if you click on a link or, as in Tan’s case, download a random app. Attackers plant malicious features that can eavesdrop or extract information from your phone, said Verity Lim from NUS Greyhats, an information security interest group based in the National University of Singapore. For example, a keylogger will monitor what you tap on your device’s keyboard, then it can extract your username and password as you enter them into, say, a banking app. Some malware programs can also capture screenshots of your phone. “So whatever you’re doing on your phone … can actually be (seen), as long as it’s coded into the malware,” said Lim. Some apps can be designed in a friendly, non-threatening manner, said Shane Chiang, chief executive officer of cybersecurity consultancy Momentum Z. The app that Talking Point got hold of, for example, offered S$5 items such as durian, mooncake and seafood. On the payment page, users are prompted to choose their bank and log in to their account. As the user presses enter, a loading sign appears. “What’s happening is that the scammer probably has access to your username and password right now. … He’s probably keying (them) in (on) the DBS Bank website,” said Chiang. “This (loading sign) will just keep spinning, … you’ll think that something is wrong (with the transaction), you’ll turn (the phone) off, you’ll go about your (business).” With malware that can give scammers access to the phone, they could force a factory reset on the device and delay the discovery of the unauthorised transaction. To date, all the malware scams in Singapore have involved Android phones. This could be because they are more popular than iPhones and therefore “may be an easier target”, said Chiang. What makes Android riskier is it allows sideloading, that is, third-party apps — from outside official app stores like Google Play — can be installed, said Willis Lim, the director of the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore’s (CSA)’s National Cyber Threat Analysis Centre. “This is … in contrast to Apple’s ecosystem, which is a closed one (where) you can only strictly ever download apps from the official Apple store.” WATCH: The full episode — How do scammers take over your phone and steal your money? (23:19) When downloading third-party apps, users will see an Android Package Kit (APK) file, which is a file format for all Android apps. This file cannot be opened by the iPhone operating system (iOS). A spokesperson for Google said a “community-based, open-source platform” has always been the concept behind Android. “We don’t try to restrict users to … one single source of downloads or one single type of app that they can use,” said lead threat intelligence adviser Lim Yihao in Google’s subsidiary cybersecurity firm, Mandiant Intelligence. “You can be vulnerable if you make the wrong choice or if you’re being tricked into downloading something that’s malicious. But we also give users more options (for) the kind of applications they want.” To try to keep users safe, Google scans apps before they are allowed in its app store, he said. But some scammers have found a loophole: app updates. Something as benign as a torchlight app can appear legitimate at first, he cited. But when the user updates the app, that is when threat actors can insert malicious functions. And there are “billions” of apps in Google Play. “We have to play the game of catch-up,” he said. “There’s no silver bullet, unfortunately. Of course, we do our best to … protect our users.” To this end, Google has a Play Protect malware protection system. Like antivirus software, it scans apps for malicious behaviour before they are downloaded from the Play Store. It can also scan apps that are from other sources and have already been downloaded to the phone. This function is found in the phone’s Play Store app. In an update this week, Google said it is strengthening Play Protect “with real-time scanning at the code level” when an app is about to be installed. What is “more difficult” to control are app downloads outside the official store with users granting access permissions because they fell prey to “social engineering”, said Mandiant’s Lim. “It looks (as if it reflects badly) on Android itself, but actually the (malicious) app (didn’t come) from Play Store. The users themselves clicked on it, downloaded it, accepted the permissions that it was (asking), without much review,” he added. “It’s difficult for us as a company to say, ‘You can’t download all these applications.’ … It becomes a privacy issue — users will be like, ‘Hey, why are you trying to stop me from downloading my favourite application?’” Even as scammers continue to target Android users, Lim from the CSA warned that there have been “several well-known instances” of malicious apps slipping into Apple’s App Store. And there will be “a lot more” attacks on iOS in the near future, said Vu Ngoc Son, the technical director of the Vietnam National Cyber Security Technology Corporation. Vietnam is among the world’s top 10 cybercrime hotspots, according to the Global Tech Council. Like in Singapore, cyber attacks in Vietnam mostly take place on Android. “(But) on a global scale, the number of cyber attacks on iOS is catching up to that of Android,” said Son. “It won’t take long because hackers are determined to steal money from victims. “Hackers are now equipped with better skills and tools.” These attacks on iOS look to be more insidious. There are zero-click attacks, whereby victims do not need to click on any links, yet scammers would be able to attack and take over the phone remotely, cited Son. Zero-click hacks enter devices via emails, text messages and phone calls. For example, even a missed WhatsApp call has been known to trigger a spyware injection. More recently, Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky discovered a new zero-click hack unleashing malware in iPhones simply when users receive an iMessage. Users did not even need to open the message to trigger the spyware. One telltale sign of malware infection can be a slow-running device or a fast-draining battery, said Bach Trong Duc, an executive manager in Vietnamese cybersecurity software company Bkav. These are signs that your device is transmitting data. Other unusual signs would be apps asking for irrelevant permissions, for example when an app that logs your jogging time requests access to your messages, Duc added. Experts offer these tips for ways to protect against malware: • Take warning signs seriously. Before Tan downloaded the malicious app to order fried chicken, there was a pop-up warning on her phone. She sensed a “small red flag” but did not think too much before proceeding. “We normally do see (these warnings) on a website, and we go ahead still, and it’s fine,” she said. But Mandiant’s Lim advised caution before clicking that download button. “On your phone, we’ll tell you if you’re about to download something that isn’t from … a trustworthy source,” he said. • Use the Play Protect scan function. Doing so daily is a good “cyber hygiene” practice for Android users, he said. • Do due diligence before downloading an app. If what should be a popular app, such as Google Maps, has very few downloads, that should be a sign that it is a masquerade attempt. • Have two mobile devices. One of them could be dedicated to banking activities and the other to social activities, suggested Association of Banks in Singapore director Ong-Ang Ai Boon. If you accidentally download malware to the second phone, the malware will not have access to your banking data. • Keep abreast of the latest scam tactics. But if you inadvertently unleash malware in your phone, it is best to factory-reset your phone immediately. Watch the first episode of this Talking Point special here .

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Scam apps can be surprisingly easy to create. The programme Talking Point heads for Vietnam, one of the world’s top 10 cybercrime hotspots, and discovers that the person behind that malware app could be a teen with a computer. Talking Point host Steven Chia with Nguyen Quang Dong (right), one of Vietnam’s leading experts on digital safety. This audio is generated by an AI tool. HANOI: One hour. That is all the time it takes to build malicious software that can access the camera, messages, calls, storage, microphone, location, contacts — nearly everything — on a victim’s phone. And cyber threat hunter Ngo Minh Hieu finds more than half a million of such malware apps created every day, in his work for Vietnam’s National Cyber Security Centre. Vietnam saw a 64 per cent rise in online fraud in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, according to the country’s Authority of Information Security. A growing number of incidents in the last five years are related to malware, said Nguyen Quang Dong, the director of the Institute for Policy Studies and Media Development. The flurry of fraudulent activity has landed Vietnam among the world’s top 10 cybercrime hotspots according to the Global Tech Council , the programme Talking Point found as it investigated who might be behind the malware scams that have emerged in Singapore this year. Between January and August, more than 1,400 victims in Singapore lost at least S$20.6 million in total, police said. The perpetrators linked to malware scams have mostly played the role of money mules, said Ang Hua Huang, assistant superintendent at the newly operationalised anti-scam command centre run by the Singapore Police Force. There have been teenagers arrested for suspected involvement. WATCH: Who are the people behind malware scams? (21:58) “These are people who relinquish their bank accounts or even sell their Singpass credentials over job offers on Telegram,” said Ang. This allows scammers to transfer money from the victim’s bank account to a local bank account. “They’re facilitating the scam syndicates in laundering money overseas.” The syndicates themselves are usually from neighbouring countries, Ang said. Over in Vietnam, young people make up the majority of the malware scammers, said Dong, and they mostly operate as individuals. “Young people here are good at technology. They’re tech-savvy. And some people self-study too. They learn about (hacking) skills,” he said. Indeed, there is no shortage of tech-savvy individuals in Vietnam — computer science is compulsory in most public schools in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, starting from third grade. When students reach high school, coding is compulsory in IT classes. Today, Vietnam is known to have one of the best high-tech talent pools in Asia. Hieu himself knows a thing or two about how malware scammers work. He got into hacking “just for fun” when he was 14 years old. When he was 16, he started making money from stealing credit card details, which helped to fund his college education in New Zealand. By age 23, he was chasing big money: stealing the personal data of 200 million United States citizens from his base in Vietnam. He was caught in 2013 and sentenced to 13 years’ jail. He was released for good behaviour in 2019 and joined the government to hunt down cyber criminals. Building malware is so commonplace that there are publicly available tools, known as open source software, that scammers can use to automatically build their app. This is usually the “first step” for most hackers nowadays, said Hieu. Much like a build-your-own salad bowl, hackers can choose what features they want for their app, such as access to a victim’s messages, and get their end product within an hour. Hacking and scamming resources are also easily found on messaging app Telegram, where developers share tips and tricks. For those without technical experience, getting their hands on malware apps is as simple as shopping on e-commerce platform eBay, said Hieu. Scammers can use Telegram to subscribe to “malware as a service” or “phishing as a service”, which means for US$300 (S$410) to US$500, they can access the malware of their choice for a month. There is new malware that can be invisible to antivirus software, said Vu Ngoc Son, technical director at the Vietnam National Cyber Security Technology Corporation. This could mean warning messages will not pop up before a user proceeds to download a piece of malware. There have also been “high-profile incidents” targeting politicians or certain journalists to steal information, Hieu said. “It costs a lot of money and time to invest or research into these vulnerabilities (on the phone).” And it could affect Android, Windows or iOS. A nything could be possible with time, he warned. “The phone (security features will) never catch up 100 per cent with the rate of building malware. Each day, I find more than half a million new malware.” Vietnam, like Singapore, recently set up a department that focuses on tackling cybercrime. “We’ve kept ourselves well informed with news alerts sent by either cybersecurity firms or businesses alerting us of hacker groups from Vietnam spreading malware,” said Lieutenant Colonel Trieu Manh Tung, the deputy director of the cybersecurity and high-tech crime prevention department under Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security. “There have been a few cases where we managed to … identify the culprits who created and disseminated malware and exchange such information with foreign law enforcement agencies for concerted countermeasures.” The department has also run cybersecurity surveillance campaigns to “promptly uncover behaviours dangerous to society” and make regular recommendations to the government and civil society organisations on how to raise awareness of cyber safety among the population, added Tung. “Especially among young people — that the act of using malware to corrupt information systems is a violation of the law.” In Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) proposed this week a way in which companies and consumers could s hare losses arising from scams. If they are found to have breached their responsibilities, financial institutions and telecommunication companies (telcos) may have to compensate their customers who fall prey to scams. These responsibilities may include the failure of banks to send outgoing transaction alerts to consumers and the failure of telcos to implement a scam filter for SMSes. The framework will focus on phishing scams for a start. The framework does not include malware scams for now. They are relatively new, and with risk-mitigation measures still being rolled out, it would be “premature” to set out specific responsibilities for the different stakeholders, the MAS and IMDA said. For example, major retail banks here have rolled out new anti-malware security updates and are looking to introduce a “money lock” feature, which would allow customers to set aside a certain amount in their accounts that cannot be digitally transferred out without strict authentication measures.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Some patients have waited hours, even days, for a hospital bed. The programme Talking Point hears their stories and finds out that things have got worse since last year as it explores what can be done to ease the problem. Talking Point host Steven Chia takes a deep dive into Singapore’s public healthcare system. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: For one senior citizen who suffered a seizure, the waiting time for a hospital bed was 38 hours, recounted her daughter. Another member of the public had a similar story to tell: Her father, having had a fever on and off for three months, went to a public hospital’s accident and emergency (A&E) department. He was admitted after close to 46 hours. “My dad sat in a chair in A&E for almost two days! (It) was a horrible experience,” said the daughter. Someone else’s father — who has Parkinson’s disease — was brought to A&E a few times owing to low sodium levels. He was also unable to walk. He had to wait one or two days for a bed. These are some of the stories Talking Point viewers shared when asked about a problem that has got worse. A post shared by CNA INSIDER (@cnainsider) Between January and September last year, the median waiting time for a bed in Singapore’s public hospitals was about seven hours. In the same period this year, the waiting time was around seven and a half hours. Waiting times are calculated based on emergency admissions. The clock starts the moment a decision is made to admit a patient and stops when the patient leaves A&E for the ward. With the median being 7.5 hours, half of the patients waited longer than that and the other half waited a shorter time. But with people waiting as long as two days, “we have to use more than just the median” for a more accurate picture of waiting times, said Jason Yap, Vice Dean (Practice) at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore (NUS). He proposed looking at the 90th percentile of patients. “If the 90th percentile is reasonable, then it’s (just) the last 10 per cent who have great difficulties,” he said. While they may be “outliers”, long waits are “not ideal”, he added. “It’s an area that needs to be addressed, and I’m sure more can be done.” There is no publicly available data, however, on the target waiting time in Singapore’s public hospitals or on how long those 10 per cent of patients are waiting for a bed. What is known is that the benchmark used in the United Kingdom and the United States is four hours. In England, 23.1 to 32.9 per cent of patients each month between last November and this April waited more than four hours after the decision to admit was made. In the US, a study by Yale researchers found that the median waiting time across a national sample of hospitals ranged from around two to 3.4 hours between March and December 2021. When queried, Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) said the waiting time for beds is dependent on several factors, such as the patient’s condition and the existing patient load in A&E departments. The public hospitals will triage patients upon their arrival and activate inpatient teams to ensure that patients receive timely care regardless, said a spokesperson. WATCH: Why some hospital patients wait hours for a bed — What can be done? (22:44) Expanding on the current situation, David Matchar, a professor in Duke-NUS Medical School’s health services and systems research programme, said Singapore’s hospitals are “very much crowded”, so patients must be discharged “before we can fill a very full hospital”. With a younger population, “inflow equals outflow” and the situation would be “relatively stable”. But as the population ages, older people are “two or three times more likely” to need hospitalisation than younger people. “We can’t discharge as many (older patients) because … they stay maybe an extra week compared to a younger person,” said Matchar. “We’ve got a much bigger inflow and a smaller outflow, so we get an even worse situation.” The MOH cited the lingering effects of the pandemic as among the factors that have increased the use of acute hospital beds and “reduced the flow of patients” from A&E departments to the wards. “Patients who had to defer their elective surgeries during the pandemic are now getting their conditions treated. Planned developments of healthcare infrastructure were also delayed over the last few years,” said its spokesperson. “In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic increased social isolation among our seniors, which impacted their health. Hence, they tended to require longer periods of inpatient stays.” Discharging a patient is not necessarily a straightforward process either. Even when someone is medically fit for discharge, there may be circumstances — often beyond the hospital’s control — resulting in prolonged stays, which play a part in the overall waiting time. “We take (great) pains, actually, to pre-strategise with the patients and their caregivers … to ensure that they’re ready to take the patient home when (he or she is) medically fit,” said National University Hospital (NUH) senior consultant in neurology Jonathan Ong. But some patients “seem to like to stay in a hospital” longer than they are supposed to. He estimated that there are discharge issues facing around three in 10 NUH patients and/or their family members, “despite a clearly articulated plan”. “Therefore, sometimes we may have to institute what’s known as an overstayer policy,” he said. This means a patient who is considered to have overstayed is to pay the full hospital rates upon the policy taking effect. As for medically stable long-stay patients — who are ready for discharge but remain in acute hospitals for more than 21 days — the number has fallen from 230 a week last year to 190 this year on average, stated the MOH. Yet another challenge in managing beds remains: In Singapore’s public healthcare setting, where 80 to 85 per cent of beds are in heavily subsidised wards, female A&E patients cannot be admitted to open-plan male cubicles and vice versa. “When you have to segregate by gender, there’ll be some element of sub-optimisation of resources,” said NUH assistant chief operating officer Jeremy Lee. When the situation calls for more beds, what happens is “we’ll have to park extra trolley beds within the cubicle”, said NUH advanced practice nurse Lucinda Tay. “So, instead of a nurse (taking) six patients, our nurse will then have to take seven patients.” The pressure on healthcare workers extends to housekeepers. In NUH, which has more than 1,200 beds and admitted around 67,000 patients last year — one of the highest numbers in the country — its housekeepers must clean 10 to 12 beds daily. WATCH: I clean a hospital bed for the next patient (and why the long wait times) (7:31) The hospital considers 30 minutes a reasonable time to turn each bed around without compromising cleaning standards. Once a bed is fully disinfected, a new patient may arrive within 10 minutes. “We have a lot of patients waiting for a bed, so a swift (turnaround) is very vital … to make sure that our patients get timely care and also reduce their waiting time,” said NUH housekeeping operations manager Sai Aung Lin. While NUH is one of Singapore’s largest public hospitals, its patients’ average length of stay hovers around 5.5 days, compared with the national average of seven days, said Lee. One reason is that it “actively” moves A&E patients to its sister hospitals that are “a little” less crowded. “On average, we move about 10 to 12 patients to Alexandra Hospital, for example,” he cited. “This helps us decongest (our hospital) and also better manage (the) demands for beds. … This keeps our waiting time more manageable.” This is just one piece of the puzzle. To ease the bed crunch, more beds can be added — which the MOH is doing, with a target of more than 1,000 additional beds by year end. For example, the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Integrated Care Hub, which was originally scheduled to open last year, was opened last month. Transitional care facilities for medically stable patients who are finalising their discharge plans have also been set up. These are part of a five-year plan to add 1,900 public hospital beds to Singapore’s healthcare capacity. In public acute hospitals, there were 9,820 beds as at last year, with close to 3,600 beds added since 2006 as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital opened over the years. But is adding more beds really the solution? According to Matchar, who has spent more than 35 years working in hospitals and researching how to make them better, “the answer is yes and no”. To solve the problem of waiting times entirely, possibly up to seven times more beds would be needed over the next 20 years, based on current population projections, he said. “We could potentially keep building more and more hospitals. So long as a new hospital has more people being admitted than being discharged, “it’s going to experience the same problem”. Capacity increases must be “balanced with another set of solutions” dealing with the inflows and outflows, he said. “If we don’t achieve that balance, then we have a mess.” One alternative model of care that could help is to treat hospital patients at home instead. The MOH will increase the number of beds in this Mobile Inpatient Care @ Home (MIC@Home) model to between 100 and 200 by year end. “These (new models of care) will leverage telemedicine and other technologies to right-site patients, while ensuring they receive appropriate care,” said the MOH spokesperson. As part of MIC@Home, the National University Health System (NUHS) runs NUHS@Home, and up to a third of the patients come directly from A&E without admission to a ward, said Stephanie Ko, the lead clinician for NUHS@Home. They receive “hospital-level care”: For example, vital signs and oxygen levels are checked, a drip may be set up — procedures in hospital that will be done by nurses. “And that’d be the same in the home setting,” said Ko. “From a medical perspective, patients will receive exactly the same care at home.” The medical team visits patients as frequently as their conditions require, usually one to three times a day. This is done in tandem with virtual consultations in the morning. And patients “pay the same or even less than what they’d pay for staying in a hospital ward”. Based on studies done by her team, Ko thinks one to two patients out of every 10 in hospital could conceivably receive care at home. In the three years NUHS@Home has been run, it has cared for more than 3,200 patients, with a cumulative saving of over 23,000 bed-days — the number of days the patients would have had to spend in hospital otherwise — she added. Travel time to patients’ homes may put some strain on resources, but the NUHS said these visits are part of the medical team’s existing caseload. Health authorities are also assessing how much this service could cost patients going forward. Can hospitals at home be taken further? Public health specialist Jeremy Lim thinks so and has some ideas for how to do it, chiefly by rethinking the current healthcare business model. He cited a procedure that more than 1,000 Singaporeans undergo every year: Gall bladder removal by keyhole surgery. Government and private insurers cover both inpatient stays and day surgeries such as this, but many patients choose to be admitted because of convenience and access to healthcare professionals. Cost is also a factor. Whether the surgery is done on an inpatient or outpatient basis, the professional fees, such as for the surgeon and the anaesthetist, the facility fee for the operating theatre and the price of the medicines are the same, said Lim. But when patients have outpatient surgeries, “they and their families will incur some of the costs of food, of basic nursing — someone needs to be with the patient during at least the first 12, 18 hours”. Hospitals and insurers, meanwhile, save “substantial monies” when there is no inpatient stay. This is why Lim thinks insurers and the state-administered MediShield Life should channel these savings to cover essentials such as food. “Family leave could be extended,” he added. “First-degree relatives, or even beyond that, can be given time off, mandated under the law, to take care of their family members. “We have to make it easy for patients and their families to do the right thing.” He also suggested a “radical” disincentive: “If the standard operating protocol calls for an outpatient procedure, and if patients insist on being retained in the hospital, … perhaps insurance should be tweaked so that some aspect of this isn’t covered.” While these ideas may require “a whole mindset shift”, as Talking Point host Steven Chia put it, Lim believes the alternatives are unpalatable. “Do we build hospital after hospital? Do we struggle then with the fiscal tightening, the staffing shortages? Do we want the Goods and Services Tax to move up to 12, 15, 20 per cent?” questioned Lim. “Every bed-day that we can save allows a more critically ill patient to be in hospital. “Singapore has to be much more proactive in driving this shift from hospital to home. Because home is the only … ‘infinite resource’ that we have, that can grow with the number of patients.” Watch this episode of Talking Point here .

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Reusable plastic bottles and food containers may carry a BPA-free label but are they as safe as claimed? The programme Talking Point investigates whether they still leach chemicals that affect our bodies and looks at some alternatives. Bottles labelled “BPA-free” have flooded the market in recent years. But how safe are they really? This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Look at the bottom of any reusable plastic container or bottle you have bought in recent years, and it is likely you will see a label declaring it “BPA-free”. Indeed, BPA has developed a bad reputation over the years. It is known as an endocrine disruptor, and many scientists believe it can cause cancer and reproductive harm. “Simply put, (it’s a chemical) that can mimic certain hormones or block certain hormones,” said Ben Ng, an endocrinologist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre. There is a worry, he added, that long-term exposure can affect children’s growth. BPA (short for bisphenol A) can be found in many household items. It is used to make polycarbonate, a hard plastic that looks and feels like glass but is light and nearly unbreakable. While it is found in items like clothes, toys and even thermal paper receipts, Ng said “more than 90 per cent of our exposure to BPA comes from ingestion”, that is, from plastic food containers and bottles that could leach chemicals into food and drinks. While Singapore’s food regulations stipulate that all food packaging imported for use in Singapore do not migrate any harmful substances to the food, there is no specific ban on BPA. Canada, however, banned BPA from baby bottles in 2008. The European Union followed suit in 2011. The United States Food and Drug Administration prohibited BPA in baby bottles and sippy cups in 2012 and infant formula packaging in 2013. In the years since, BPA-free products have flooded the market. But how are these bottles made? Are they really safe? As the programme Talking Point discovered , the replacement chemicals in some BPA-free bottles may also get leached out — and affect human health in a similar way to BPA. WATCH: Are BPA-free plastic water bottles really safer for your health? (22:11) BPA-free bottles often replace BPA with other bisphenol compounds that are structurally similar, such as bisphenol F (BPF) and S (BPS). But these bottles are not necessarily safer than BPA bottles, said Tong Yen Wah, a National University of Singapore (NUS) associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering. “Some of these bisphenol-type compounds could still leach into the drinking water. And we could be drinking (them).” To find out if this is the case, Talking Point sent 11 reusable bottles from a variety of brands for a laboratory test. The bottles were made from different materials, including three types of plastic, stainless steel and glass. Nine of the bottles had a BPA-free label. The remaining two were labelled “food-grade”, which meant they were safe for food storage. The bottles were filled with water at room temperature for two hours to test for leaching of bisphenols into the water. The results showed that four of the bottles leached small amounts of replacement BPA chemicals. Three of the four bottles — including the two labelled “food-grade” — were made of polycarbonate. The fourth bottle was made of polypropylene, another type of plastic. There was no leaching of any bisphenols from the remaining bottles, which were made of stainless steel, glass and a plastic called Tritan. The amounts of leached chemicals, however, ranged from around 10 to 20 nanograms per litre to about 70 to 80 nanograms per litre. These are “really minute” concentrations, said research assistant Mauricius Marques Dos Santos from the Nanyang Technological University’s Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute. A nanogram per litre, he said, is equivalent to one drop in 16 Olympic-size swimming pools. But when the test was repeated with hot water, more bisphenol chemicals leached into the water — three to four times more, depending on the brand of bottle. To further understand the safety of these replacement chemicals, the leached chemicals were tested on human cells. While the test revealed nothing toxic enough to kill the cells, it showed that the chemicals had a similar effect to BPA. “Inside the human cell, we can see that there’s enough of the chemicals present to begin to activate (the) estrogen receptor system,” said Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute executive director Shane Snyder, who led the lab investigation. “In other words, the cells are responding to the estrogens from the chemicals that leach from the bottles.” The chemical concentrations are still “quite low”, he added. “You’d have to drink from a lot of bottles to have an effect based on what we see so far.” For example, one would have to drink eight times the amount of water from the bottle that had the most leaching — at 80 nanograms of BPS per litre — to see a significant estrogenic effect. Nonetheless, US-based journalist Abigail Davidson said research in the past 25 years has shown that endocrine-disrupting chemicals “don’t always follow that typical belief system of ‘the dose makes the poison’”. Davidson, editor of The Filtery, a website aimed at helping consumers reduce environmental toxins at home, added that while there is less research done on other bisphenol compounds such as BPS and BPF, “most of the information is consistent with the results from BPA”. “The chemical structures are so similar that they’re going to have similar effects in the body.” In response to queries from Talking Point, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said that currently, “no harmonised international standards on bisphenols in foodstuffs” have been established. There is also “no conclusive evidence” that BPA alternatives are unsafe. “Nevertheless, the SFA is closely monitoring international scientific discussions on the safety of bisphenols and periodically reviews our safety requirement while keeping abreast of the latest developments,” stated the agency. There is, however, some good news for consumers, said Davidson, who highlighted bisphenol’s “pretty short” half-life: about six hours. This refers to the time taken for a substance to halve its original dose in the body. “If you do start trying to reduce your exposure, you can really make a difference pretty quickly,” she said. One way of doing this is to look for safer alternative plastics, such as Tritan, which did not leach any bisphenols in the Talking Point lab test. This plastic is a co-polyester “developed as a safe alternative to polycarbonate”, according to Seager Inc retail merchandising manager Liew Yue Ci, whose company is the exclusive distributor of Nalgene bottles in Singapore — bottles made from Tritan. Tritan shares similar characteristics with polycarbonate, such as clarity, durability and resistance to impact, said Liew. But it is BPA-free; and it costs more. While some Tritan bottles are labelled as such, Nalgene bottles carry only the “BPA-free” label, Liew added. “Consumers should be aware of what they’re buying and also do their own due diligence.” In a consumer advisory shared with Talking Point, the SFA said consumers should use reusable bottles or food containers according to instructions. For example, only containers labelled microwave-safe should be used for reheating food in the microwave. A product should be replaced when its integrity has been compromised, such as when it is cloudy, discoloured or cracked. When choosing reusable products, consumers can also opt for other materials, such as glass, porcelain or stainless steel, especially for hot foods and liquids.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Health-conscious consumers are increasingly going for calorie-free products. The programme Talking Point puts some of these items, from sauces to carbonated drinks to jellies, to the test. The nutrition information panels say these products, sriracha chilli sauce and a honey substitute, have zero calories. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: How much more would you pay for sugar substitutes with no calories? For events operations co-ordinator Janice Neo, her spending on these products comes to “quite a bit”. “Two kilogrammes of sugar will probably cost you S$5, but I’m willing to spend up to S$50 on the monk fruit sweeteners,” she said. She is not alone in that. Spark Chen, a tertiary student on a weight-loss journey, spends “30 to 40 per cent” of his monthly food budget on zero-calorie products. But do these foods and drinks live up to their name and contain no calories at all? The programme Talking Point put some of the more popular products to the test — zero-calorie sriracha, konjac jelly, olive oil cooking spray, zero-calorie isotonic and carbonated drinks and a honey substitute — and the results surprised some users. WATCH: Zero-calorie food — What am I eating? Is it healthier? (22:10) Of the six foodstuffs sent to testing, inspection and certification company SGS Singapore, only one had truly no calories. The other five contained two to six calories per serving. According to Health Promotion Board (HPB) guidelines, products with up to five calories per serving can be packaged for sale as calorie-free. Responding to Talking Point’s queries about the product found to have six calories per serving — the konjac jelly — the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and the Health Promotion Board said there is “an allowance of 20 per cent variance during lab testing”. Still, the SFA is “looking into the matter”. Products like the olive oil spray, however, can be labelled “zero-calorie” despite containing two calories per serving and the whole bottle containing 1,074 calories. A serving here, as defined on its Nutrition Information Panel, is a third of one second of spray. This means a “zero-calorie” count results only when consumers use the recommended portion control. “People are just going to pick up (this product), saying: ‘This is zero calories — let me just use this,’” said Carolyn Stephen, lead nutritionist at the Singapore Polytechnic’s Food Innovation and Resource Centre. The one product that was tested and really had zero calories was the honey substitute, made with monk fruit syrup. Many zero-calorie products, however, contain artificial sweeteners, which evidence suggests is not as good for you as you might think. So how is a product like zero-calorie “honey” made? The key ingredient is monk fruit, “more commonly known in Singapore as luo han guo ”, said Dominic Li, director of local company Zest Foods, which distributes the product. “It’s a citrus fruit … that (has) an extract called mogrosides, which is a sugar compound … that’s similar to honey without having any of the calories,” he said. “(The extraction process) involves the monk fruit being boiled, and then there’s a few steps of dehydration and drying until it becomes a powder. … After that, it’s caramelised.” These sweeteners are known as intensive sweeteners, since they provide “100 or 200 times” more sweetness intensity than sugar, said Stephen. “So you … use very, very little, as compared to table sugar. “(Along with) the fact that your body doesn’t metabolise it — you taste it, but you don’t absorb it, you don’t get energy out of it — that’s why they’re calorie-free.” With ingredients containing virtually no calories, is it then possible to eat a negative-calorie meal? The concept is increasingly popular among people who are trying, for example, to adopt a healthy lifestyle or lose weight, observed consultant gastroenterologist Andrea Rajnakova. They believe that certain foods require more energy to digest than the caloric content of the food itself, she said and cited celery, lettuce, tomato and watermelon as examples. But there are some misconceptions about this weight-loss method, cautioned Rajnakova, who detailed how the energy required to metabolise food — the “thermic effect” of food — accounts for a very small portion of the body’s energy expenditure. “If we’re (taking) these sorts of foods as a part of our diet, the contribution of the thermic effect of the meals is so negligible that we won’t be able to expect any weight changes,” she said. So, as food substitutes, zero- or low-calorie products might reduce calorie intake but on their own will not be enough to push the body into a negative-calorie state. Opting for sugar substitutes may not be the best idea either. Rajnakova cited recent studies on some digestive side effects of artificial sweeteners, such as bloating, flatulence, and loose stools. “(This is) because (the sweeteners) aren’t absorbed by our digestive system,” she said. She also mentioned recent studies showing that some artificial sweeteners may increase blood clotting and the risk of cardiovascular disease. And despite the natural, plant-based origins of sweeteners such as stevia and monk fruit, she said these zero-calorie options fall into the category of “artificial sweeteners with the possibility of side effects” on the digestive system. “If they give you zero calories, the value of the nutrient is also zero,” she added. But even if the calorie count is not really zero — a tablespoon of zero-calorie sriracha sauce is 12 calories, compared to four calories in a teaspoon — some users think these products are worth the price. In the case of the monk fruit honey, the price difference is close to three times, but it remains one of Neo’s favourite products. “It still makes a big (caloric) difference compared to the real version,” she said. “It’s still going to be the healthier alternative,” said Hakim Rahim, a senior designer who consumes zero-calorie products on an almost daily basis. For fitness coach Leon Tan, however, the number of calories in the plant-based konjac jelly came as a surprise. “Six calories is probably on the high side,” he said. “If some of my trainees or my followers ask me whether this is a great zero-calorie product, I’ll probably tell them that this has a little bit more calories, so just be mindful of how many you eat.” Watch this episode of Talking Point here .

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider There are several Katong Laksa brands across the island that have a claim to be the original gold standard. Which is serving up the real deal? The programme On The Red Dot digs into the stories of rival hawkers. Rival hawkers behind some of Singapore’s famous Katong laksa brands. From left: Lucy Koh, Tong May Fong and George Ng. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Celebrity photographer Russel Wong was growing up in East Coast Road, a boy of about six years old, when he first tasted the original Katong Laksa. The memory has stuck in his mind even now. “It didn’t have hum (cockles). It was just fish cake and shrimp and a great gravy with daun kesum , the laksa leaf,” said Wong, 62. “(It was) eaten with a spoon, which is important. “When you say Katong Laksa, it’s like the gold standard.” It is one of Singapore’s famed food names, no less. And a stretch of East Coast Road, near the block of flats where Wong lived, became the site of the Katong Laksa war in the late 1990s as noodle sellers came up with their own variations. “Because of the strong brand and the success of the dish, everyone jumped on (the bandwagon) and started calling themselves Katong Laksa,” he recalled. “People got really confused when all the outlets started sprouting around Singapore. They’d go, ‘Hey, is this a franchise? Is this from the real one?’” These stalls throughout Singapore are not all from the same franchise. But one of the brands — 328 Katong Laksa — is now the “most famous”, according to Wong and Gavin Chan, 39, a founding member of community group Katong Culture. The reason for this, cited Chan, was the showdown with Gordon Ramsay in 2013, when Singtel invited the international chef to compete in its Hawker Heroes Challenge. In the laksa category, the public voted for 328 Katong Laksa, whose owner Lucy Koh (or Nancy to her regulars) remembers that Ramsay’s laksa “wasn’t as authentic, as it had more of a Western flavour”. It was not the first time, however, that her laksa had generated publicity. The first celebrity to visit her after she started selling laksa in a Katong coffee shop was Hong Kong star Tony Leung — 25 years ago. Notwithstanding her claim to fame, the 60-year-old acknowledged that she was not the originator of Katong Laksa. So who is serving the original Katong Laksa? The programme On The Red Dot digs into the stories of rival hawkers in the series Food Feud — and also finds out whether original means better. WATCH: Singapore laksa war — Which stall has the original Katong laksa recipe? (22:52) Koh started selling laksa at 49 East Coast Road, at the junction with Ceylon Road, in 1998. Before that, there was already a “very famous” laksa stall there, set up by a hawker whose laksa she had eaten twice. “I didn’t ask him about his secret recipe,” said Koh. “My current secret recipe is my own.” The previous stall was named Marine Parade Laksa. “But all of us (Katong residents) called it Janggut Laksa,” recalled Wong. “Of course, there was no sign that said Janggut Laksa, because that was his nickname.” In Malay, “janggut” means beard. And the hawker, Ng Juat Swee, had hairs coming out of a mole on his chin. His Peranakan neighbours were the ones who taught him how to cook laksa, said Tong May Fong, current co-owner of Janggut Laksa. “He was very innovative. He made it his own. He improvised it, which became his secret recipe.” He started out as an illegal hawker in 1952, walking around the Marine Parade area with metal pots hanging from a pole on his shoulders. “To avoid the teh gu (public health inspector) catching him, … he (snipped) his noodles so that customers could eat quickly in the event (that) the enforcement officer came (along),” narrated Tong. “It became the trademark of our Katong Laksa.” As Singapore developed and illegal street hawking was further discouraged, he set up his stall in 49 East Coast Road in 1963. “It became popular,” said Tong. “So people started calling (it) the shortcut way, ‘Katong Laksa, Katong Laksa.’ And this was how Katong Laksa was born.” After Janggut died in 1986 at the age of 85, his younger brother’s family continued the business. Janggut’s children “weren’t interested in selling laksa”, said Tong’s mother and co-owner of Janggut Laksa, Tan Siew Suan, who came to join the business because she was “very good friends” with his niece, Ng Sway Hong. “At that time, I was selling roasted meats in Toa Payoh,” recounted Tan. “Sway Hong asked me to join her, so I stopped selling roasted meats and (we) sold laksa together. “She’s retired, after working for more than 30 years. Working in this line is very tiring.” Competition between stalls was especially intense from 1998 to the early 2000s. Koh was selling laksa for almost a year when the boss of the 49 East Coast Road coffee shop “wanted it back for herself”, she recounted. Koh moved to number 51, while the coffee shop had its own laksa stall. That was the “trigger point” for the Katong Laksa war, said Chan. Marine Parade Laksa had also reopened at 57 East Coast Road, this time as Janggut Laksa. And there was another laksa stall at number 47. “Because there were four stalls, … people were curious as to why there was so much competition,” Koh recalled. Such was Katong Laksa’s popularity, “coupled with the media coverage on TV and radio”, that it seemed to Chan as if “the entire Singapore” was in Katong to grab a bite. “(It was) a sight to behold,” he said. The conclusion to the battle for bragging rights came when Koh’s laksa “became the most prevalent … not just in Katong but (in) Singapore”, he opined. “She’s widely recognised as the one who has the most popular Katong Laksa stall — with Janggut coming in a close second, being recognised as the stall that (is linked) to the originator of that taste of Katong Laksa.” Today, Janggut Laksa is also known as The Original Katong Laksa, with a new flagship location in Roxy Square, where its Katong Laksa signage takes up a “huge portion of the food court”, observed Wong. And as far as Tan is concerned, “there’s never been such a laksa before”. “We’re the most authentic,” she said. “We still use Janggut’s original laksa recipe … (and the) original ingredients according to what he’d instructed.” The few changes made since the 1950s include the switch from charcoal to gas stoves, plus the addition of cockles, which “customers wanted … and we accommodated”, cited Tong. Customer feedback is “the most valuable” because they have been eating “the same bowl of laksa” for generations, she added. “The taste is still the same. “This secret recipe can’t be found anywhere else. … The rempah (spice paste) is unique. If you taste it, you’ll know it.” WATCH: The story of Janggut, creator of The Original Katong Laksa (5:11) Some other stalls, however, have claimed to have the original Katong Laksa recipe. Wong knew of one: Roxy Laksa. “The owner was a friend of Janggut. I think Janggut gave him the recipe to help him out, and he was selling (from) a pushcart,” said Wong. “The base of Roxy Laksa, just from tasting it, obviously came from Janggut. It had that similar flavour.” The owner, Lim Kok Seng, started his business in 1952 at Roxy Theatre. In the 1970s, his son, Lim Eng Hock, started selling his own laksa from a pushcart. “He called it Roxy Laksa too, but he changed the recipe because he wanted to be completely different from his father,” narrated chef Willin Low, 52, who now shoulders “the responsibility of carrying on Roxy Laksa”. In 1978, Roxy Theatre closed, and the elder Lim ceased plying his laksa. His son carried on but “upgraded” to a stall at the East Coast Lagoon food centre. Then in 1981, Lim Eng Hock’s son, Mike, started working with him before taking over. Low had been a Roxy Laksa customer for more than 20 years, and was friends with the third-generation owner, when he took over the helm. “In 2015, I was chatting with Mike while eating laksa,” recalled Low. By this time, however, it did not taste like Janggut’s laksa any more. “Mike’s recipe was also different (from his father’s) because he didn’t make the laksa out of a rempah . He pulled different things together, and he never cut his noodles. You always ate the laksa with chopsticks,” said Low. Another stall with Janggut roots is Katong Laksa in Changi Road. Its owner, George Ng, 71, has been cooking the dish for about half a century and registered the Katong Laksa name around 1982. “My father wanted the name,” he said. His father, a provision merchant with a shop in Jalan Eunos, had a “very friendly” relationship with Janggut, who would come by the shop when he had a day off, recounted Ng. In 1955, “because of financial difficulties”, his father asked Janggut for help. “Janggut taught the recipe to my father. Then … my father sold laksa (from a pushcart) around Telok Kurau,” said Ng, who learnt the recipe from his father. “Until now, I’ve never changed anything (in the recipe) because my father was very strict (about this).” Since his stall and Janggut Laksa were “the only ones” following the original recipe — as was apparent to Chan — a taste test was done to find out which was closer to the original Katong Laksa. Four Katong residents in their 60s and 70s who have tasted the original were invited to be taste testers. And all of them had ways of describing what it should be like. “Not too pasty, more fragrant and slightly watery,” cited Jessy Tan, while Lilian Chua said: “The colour of the kuah (gravy) has to be a bit more orangey, not yellow.” “The gravy … shouldn’t be thick,” said Fong Siew Hock. “The prawns they use must be sua lor (sea-caught sand prawns) because they have a sweeter taste.” And for Tan Wu Cheng, the original Katong Laksa is all about the lemak (creaminess of the coconut milk). When all was said and done, the majority went for Janggut Laksa. “George has also carved his own niche. There are elements … that bring back memories of the original Katong Laksa,” said Chan, referring to the flavour and fragrance. “But there are also elements that have deviated from the original, such as the use of chilli with vinegar, which isn’t what the original Katong Laksa would’ve (had). “Although not unanimous, you could say that Janggut Laksa has defended its claim to be the original Katong Laksa.” Watch this episode of the Food Feud series here .

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider The search for cheaper medication — and easier access to prescription drugs — has taken some Singaporeans across the Causeway. The programme Talking Point finds out the risks involved and whether buyers are really getting what they need. Talking Point host Steven Chia bringing medicines from Malaysia to a laboratory to be tested for drug potency. This audio is generated by an AI tool. JOHOR BAHRU: For almost a decade, estate agent and content creator Ryan Khoo has made videos comparing life on both sides of the Causeway, such as videos about all things cheaper in Malaysia. Indeed, many Singaporeans travel to Johor for cheap groceries and fuel. For some, however, it is something else that is driving them there: prescription drugs. “Lots of people don’t know that … prescription medicines are a lot cheaper as well,” said Khoo, who cited cholesterol medicine, blood pressure medication and “even the humble Panadol” as examples. “And you can buy up to three months’ worth of medicines. … The pharmacists don’t require you to provide any form of prescription.” He found this out after being asked to buy medicine in Johor Bahru for a friend’s father. “Later on, I realised quite a lot of people do it. Either they buy it for themselves or for their parents,” said Khoo. Talking Point viewers, too, wrote in saying they not only get cheaper medicines in Malaysia, but also can buy those that require a prescription without proffering a doctor’s note. There are risks, however, as host Steven Chia discovers. In Singapore, medicines that require a prescription or a pharmacist consultation include Lipitor for high cholesterol and Ozempic, a diabetic medicine that people also use to lose weight. Most of the pharmacies Chia went to in Johor — from independent ones to large chains — were willing to sell him these and other medications, including painkillers, with no questions asked. In Singapore, a steroid cream such as Elomet would ordinarily be sold one tube at a time to prevent side effects from overuse. But in Johor, there was no limit. It was harder to get antibiotics without a prescription — for example Augmentin — but Chia got some in the end. One pharmacist said most of the Singaporeans who come to her pharmacy are “searching for sleeping pills”, which would include Valium. And one Singaporean whom Chia ran into at a pharmacy was stocking up on Twynsta, which is for hypertension. Back home, a box costs more than S$100, compared to RM66 (S$19) in Johor, said the customer. “When I realised it, I was so agitated because that’s (a big) difference,” he added. “I stopped buying (the drug) from my clinic.” WATCH: Is it safe to buy cheap medicine from Malaysia — without a prescription? (22:02) There is a chance that some common drugs are still cheaper in Malaysia than their subsidised prices in Singapore’s hospitals, according to Nikki Ng, managing editor of MIMS Healthcare Data, which publishes medical and drug-related reports. A box of 40-milligramme Micardis tablets, for high blood pressure, costs RM62 in Johor and about S$53 in Singapore, she cited. A box of 10-mg Lipitor tablets, meanwhile, costs RM108 and about S$76 respectively. Asthma puffer Ventolin costs RM24 compared to S$21, while Elomet sells at RM29 compared to S$18. Essentially, the medications Ng cited were more than 50 per cent cheaper in Johor than in Singapore. One of the main reasons for the lower prices, besides the exchange rate, is “stiff competition”. “Sometimes in the same street, you’ll have at least three to four pharmacies,” said Ng. “They can be from the large chains (or) could be individual pharmacies. “When there’s so much competition, the pharmacies would … drop the price just to make sure the customers come back.” Also, in a smaller market like Singapore, “pharma companies sometimes might decide to price (medication) higher”, she added, whereas selling to Malaysia’s larger population means economies of scale and thus lower prices. Medicines can be even cheaper if they are generic drugs, which are produced after the patent on the original drug has expired. The brand Rotaqor, cited Ng, is equivalent to Lipitor but sells at RM13 per box, instead of RM108. While medicines are often referred to by their brand name, what defines a drug is its active ingredient — the substance with an effect on the body. And generics are supposed to have the same active ingredients as branded drugs. Paracetamol is an example of a generic medicine referred to by its active ingredient, instead of the famous brand name, Panadol. It is among hundreds of drugs produced by YSP Southeast Asia Holding, one of Malaysia’s largest manufacturers of generics. “We’re local, … so certainly, (our products are) much cheaper than other imported items,” said company president Lee Fang Hsin. And they are effective because of the “testing rules and regulations”, he added, which “everybody must follow”. Chia sent some of the generics he bought in Johor, such as flu, cholesterol and blood pressure medicines, to a laboratory for tests to see if they were as effective and safe as medicines in Singapore. And they passed the test, with potency ranging from 101 per cent to 136.4 per cent. “That means these generic ones are safe to use,” said principal clinical pharmacist Golda Wang at Alexandra Hospital. Potency refers to the amount of medication needed to produce an effect, and “minimally you do expect a 90 per cent potency”, she added. WATCH: We test how effective cheaper and generic medicines from Malaysia are (3:44) Efficacy aside, the ease with which Singaporeans can get prescription drugs and medication controlled by dispensing pharmacists in Johor is “very bad practice”, said professor of health economics Kenneth Lee at Taylor’s University. “Every single prescription medicine that a pharmacist dispenses will need to have an entry,” he said, showing Chia a prescription book containing the quantities supplied, the dates and patients’ details, countersigned by the pharmacist. The laws in Malaysia and Singapore are similar, he said. But he was not surprised to see that Chia could buy medicines in Johor without a prescription or without leaving his particulars. “These so-called illegal sales are very common,” Lee noted. “Because if you don’t sell the medicine to the patients, they’d simply (go) next door. So you lose business — you may not be able to survive.” Talking Point reached out to Malaysian health authorities to find out about their enforcement efforts but did not get a response. Even without crossing the Causeway, however, Singaporeans can get medication from Malaysia through websites that promise home delivery anywhere in Singapore. Chia ordered the steroid cream Tri-Luma — used for treating skin discoloration, itching and swelling — from an online store at almost half the price in Singapore. It is a prescription medication, but he still managed to have it delivered. When he sent it to the laboratory for analysis, however, it failed the potency test: The results showed 63.3 per cent. One reason that it was less potent than expected and thus “less useful”, said Wang, might have been that it was not kept cool — between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius — “to maintain the stability of the medication”. “This extends to other medications that require cold storage,” she added, citing insulin as another example of medication that would be less effective if not stored properly. “And that’s one of the risks with online shopping.” Chia’s item arrived in a normal box, and it turned out that the website he found did have this disclaimer: “We do not offer cold chain delivery for this item.” But even with physical purchases in stores in Malaysia, buyers from Singapore bear some risks, Wang cautioned. “These are prescription medicines for a good reason. You do require a doctor to follow up … to make sure that the medicines are appropriate for you,” she said. “Bypassing the doctor’s follow-up, you’d miss … the monitoring that’s usually required for prescription medicine for its safe use. “When you get a refill (of) cholesterol-lowering medication, for instance, you don’t really sense whether your cholesterol is high or low. And it’s not possible for you to sort of tell on your own whether it’s working or not.” Watch this episode of Talking Point here . The programme airs on Channel 5 every Thursday at 9.30pm.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Between 2022 and this March, there were at least 32 reports of express bus accidents in Malaysia. The programme Talking Point digs into the safety issues and finds out what travellers should do if they meet with an accident. Flames engulfing an express bus that was heading for Kuala Lumpur on Jan 13. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE and KUALA LUMPUR: Singaporean Vincent Ong was asleep on a bus heading for Kuala Lumpur (KL) when he was awakened by a “loud bang” at about 3:50 a.m. on the North-South Expressway. The bus had collided with a motorcycle, which went under the front of the bus and burst into flames. When Ong opened his eyes, he saw “sparks at the front of the windscreen”. “A lot of the passengers were still fast asleep,” he recounted. “I shouted out … ‘Get out of the bus!’” The driver had to kick open the front door “because it’d malfunctioned, because of the collision or the fire”. Then the passengers “started walking out”, continued Ong, who was seated “somewhere in the middle”. “There was no instruction for us to use the emergency exit door at the back,” he said. “I would’ve gone that way instead of towards a fire.” Seated next to the emergency exit was an Indian family, who were the last to exit and were “badly burnt”, he recalled. A 17-year-old girl died in the incident in January, and two of her family members were seriously injured. The bus had a crew of three — a driver, a co-driver and a conductor — but Ong felt that they were “unclear (about) the safety procedure in emergencies such as this, where there’s a fire”. “A 17-year-old girl could’ve been saved,” he said. “She would’ve easily exited from (the rear) and be alive today.” Buses like the one he took, which offer long-haul services between Singapore and cities in Malaysia, are commonly known as express buses. Between 2022 and this March, there were at least 32 reports of express bus accidents. Nine of these cases involved passengers from Singapore. The programme Talking Point finds out just how safe these rides are, what more can be done and what travellers should do if they meet with an accident in Malaysia. For popular routes such as Singapore to KL, checks on ticketing platforms such as BusOnlineTicket, Easybook and redBus found that about 20 per cent of the buses depart between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. But about two-thirds of the accidents reported between 2022 and this year happened during these hours. As part of her investigation into the issue, Talking Point host Diana Ser took an overnight bus to KL. And the first thing she had to do was change seats thrice to find a seat belt that worked. Wearing seat belts on express buses is compulsory, so she “didn’t expect it to be so difficult to find functional ones”. WATCH: Behind bus accidents in Malaysia — should you take an express bus? (23:12) There was no co-driver on her bus either, even though it is legally required for distances exceeding 300 kilometres. (The distance from Singapore to KL is about 350 kilometres.) Another safety lapse she spotted — using a speed tracker — was that the driver’s speed reached “as high as 125 kilometres per hour”, when the speed limit for buses on the highway is 90 km/h. His speed hovered between 100 and 110 km/h “most of the time”, and Ser reached KL in “just under four and a half hours”. There, she spoke to several express bus drivers on why the bulk of the reported accidents happened at night. “Krish”, who has been driving for more than two decades and who requested anonymity, cited speeding. “We can’t speed (in the daytime),” he said. “(At) night, we speed. … Traffic is (light).” The fastest he said he has gone is 120 km/h, driving from Johor Bahru to KL in a time of two hours and 45 minutes. But he himself has never caused an accident, he claimed, as he is “a professional”. “When I’m driving, my eyes, my nose, … my body, everything’s working,” he said. “Even when I speed, … customers say, ‘You’re a good driver. … Some buses (take) five hours; you (take) three hours.’” Keeping to the speed limit for the entire trip would make him feel “sleepy” and is “impossible” to do, he added. Another driver, Burhan Abdharu, said the reason accidents happen in the early hours is the drivers are tired and “haven’t had enough sleep”. The longest he has driven is from KL to Singapore and back and then to Singapore again. That is 15 to 17 hours of driving, not including break time, he reckoned. He does this “only during certain times, such as festive periods”, although he will do so without a co-driver, despite the regulations. The bus operator pays him about RM210 (S$60) for a two-way trip between KL and Singapore, he shared. “If you get a co-driver, … (the pay) will be halved,” he said. “If we must split the pay, then it won’t be enough.” He is among a group of contract workers in the industry who are paid solely per trip. Other drivers said it was common practice to be paid a basic monthly salary, with additional pay offered per trip. There were also drivers who were paid monthly at a flat rate. But this appears to be the practice only in some bigger companies. For many workers, whether they are on a contract or earn a basic pay, the more they drive, the more they earn. So some drivers speed to chase more trips and may get tired from multiple long drives. Most of the bus operators are based in Malaysia. One of them, SuperNice Express, is headquartered in Penang, and Talking Point gained access to its global positioning system (GPS) room to find out what operators can do on their part. SuperNice has more than 200 drivers and a fleet of about 100 buses, all tracked by its 24-hour operations team. If a bus speeds at more than 100 km/h continuously for two minutes, an alarm will sound in the room, and the team will warn the driver to slow down, said Roy Chew, chairman of Unimax Group, which owns SuperNice. Drivers are given a tolerance of 10 km/h for overtaking other vehicles, after which they must slow down to 90 km/h, he elaborated. GPS trackers that record location and speed are mandatory on express buses in Malaysia, and SuperNice installed its system about 10 years ago, he said. Last year, because the size of its fleet was increasing, he invested around RM200,000 in a “proper GPS room”. He said: “We’ve decreased (our accident rate by) about 10 per cent because our team is monitoring (drivers) day and night.” But he doubts that all the bus companies monitor their entire fleet 24/7. Besides that, SuperNice has introduced buses with added safety features, such as a warning system that is triggered when drivers do not wear their seat belt. There are sensors that detect vehicles at close range and activate the brakes when necessary to avoid a collision. There is also a live camera to monitor drivers — and not the usual closed-circuit television camera. “When the driver feels sleepy or rubs his eyes too frequently, (the camera) will (set off an) alarm,” said Chew. “Then our GPS team … will call the driver to (tell him to) take a break (for) 15 to 20 minutes.” If the driver is ill-suited to continue at the wheel, “then we’ll change (to) the second driver”, Chew added. The cameras — imported from Taiwan — were installed last year. Since 2022, SuperNice has spent about RM1 million on safety upgrades for its new buses, he disclosed. Wan Md Hazlin Agyl Wan Hassan, who worked for Malaysia’s land public transport agency — which oversees the implementation of express bus policies — for close to seven years, does think operators are “struggling to make their business financially viable”. “There are so many players in the industry,” he cited as one of the reasons. Even as they vie to fulfil demand during popular time slots, “there’ll be buses running (with a load factor of) below 30 per cent; in fact, maybe lower than 20 per cent”. With operators “running at cost” because of these inefficiencies, or perhaps making a loss, investment in safety takes a back seat. The express bus industry is also facing a manpower shortage, said Agyl, who is now managing partner of advisory company Agyl and Partners. He believes some operators are “forced to just hire inexperienced drivers” or even “bad apples”. “If I’m driving for bus company A and then I (was) involved in an accident (and) got fired, for example, I (can) go to express company B,” he said. “Company B will … hire this driver because the shortage is real.” As for new drivers, “most of the time (they) aren’t well trained” to deal with emergencies, he added. To improve services, the government — which regulates fares on economy express buses — should “work with the terminal operators and bus operators to manage our supply and design proper services”, said Agyl. “You need to make sure that the operators will be able to fill up their seats,” he said. “You need to diversify the services, allowing people to have more options, while … allowing the operators to make more money.” There are executive-class buses. And some companies provide premium services that include on-board entertainment and meals. These can cost up to 60 per cent more, and Singaporeans tend to pay for them. While he cannot guarantee that these buses are safer, Agyl said: “In the case of premium services, (operators can) definitely … make money, therefore there’s no reason for them to cut corners when (it comes) to safety compliance.” There may be no way, however, to check the safety record of the bus companies. For all his industry knowledge, Agyl “couldn’t find it anywhere” — another change he would like to see. So what can travellers do? When they buy their bus tickets on the booking platform, they could include insurance. Ser, for example, had the option of paying S$1.60 for up to S$25,000 worth of cover. But some Singaporean passengers who had bought insurance have had trouble claiming compensation from bus operators after their buses were involved in accidents. According to a report on an accident last June, a passenger who wanted to file a claim was told by the bus company to appoint a lawyer first. In another case last year, passengers were told to make a claim on their personal travel insurance instead of the insurance bought with the bus ticket. Liew Teck Huat, a lawyer in Niru and Co — a firm that has represented several Singaporeans involved in traffic accidents in Malaysia — said passengers typically approach the bus company to make a claim when they suffer a loss. The “proper way” to do it is to approach the insurers, make the claim directly under the policy and “not waste time” going to the bus companies, he advised. “They’re not the insurer, so they have no obligation to pay the claim or to even process the claim.” In his view, a lawyer is required only when there is an accident “involving serious injuries to the passenger”, not to mention death. Ticket insurance or a personal accident policy will not cover the “extensive medical expenses” in these cases. The bus company will be covered on third-party liability insurance for claims made by passengers, for example, against the company for negligence on the part of the driver. Even passengers without insurance can file a claim. “The insurance company covering the bus company and the driver would have to respond to this claim,” he said.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider The Chinese are the fastest-growing migrant group at the US’ southern border. The CNA documentary Walk The Line tells their stories as they attempt one of the world’s most dangerous migration routes, starting in South America. United States Border Patrol preparing to search migrants at the country’s southern border. This audio is generated by an AI tool. NECOCLI, Colombia and SAN DIEGO: When Lucy was living in the city of Chengdu, she was studying at a church school. In China, that is illegal, so the school operated underground. But the church got banned, and the school was shut down. For a couple of months, classes were taught in her home. That, too, was discovered, and the authorities put a stop to it. “Our landlord in Chengdu later came to us and said he couldn’t renew our lease,” recounted Dad. After that, he and his wife came to a decision. “We wanted to take our daughter out of China,” said Mum. Dad did the research, trawling through YouTube and Telegram. And in December, they and their 13-year-old daughter were in South America, following in the footsteps of thousands of Chinese citizens who have tried entering the United States illegally. Last year, over 37,400 Chinese migrants entered the US illegally via its southern border, more than 50 times the number in 2021, according to data from the US Customs and Border Protection. While Central and South Americans formed the bulk of the 2.54 million migrants who entered illegally via the southern border last year, the Chinese are the fastest-growing migrant group encountered by the US Border Patrol. There is a newly coined expression on the Chinese internet referring to what they are doing: Walking the line. It is a line that starts as far south as Ecuador — the closest country to the US that allows Chinese passport holders to enter visa-free — which means taking a long, arduous detour to reach the US. It means trekking through dense jungle in drug-cartel territory as well as enduring robberies and police extortion along the way. Their journey along one of the world’s most dangerous migration routes is observed in the coming CNA series, Walk The Line, which followed some of the Chinese migrants for seven weeks. They were willing to be filmed on condition that their real names were not used. They were, for the most part, unprepared for the travails ahead. The US has had almost 1,250 kilometres of primary and secondary barriers along its 3,140-km border with Mexico since 2021. It is not enough to keep illegal migrants from coming in. Coming soon: Following Chinese migrants’ journey to US border (3:13) One of the openings in the border wall is near 75-year-old Jerry Shuster’s land in Jacumba, California. And migrants including the Chinese are camping out on his property while waiting for the US Border Patrol to process them. “Can I take them out of there? I took my gun, and I shot in the air four bullets. The police arrested me. … Even Border Patrol tells me, ‘Leave them alone, you can’t move them out of there,’” he said. “I think Chinese have more rights than we do over here. … But I don’t understand why they come over here. I really would like to know that myself.” One of those migrants camping out put it succinctly to CNA correspondent Wei Du: “We couldn’t make ends meet in China. Who’d come here otherwise?” Another Chinese migrant, who had to sell his apartment and car and ran up “huge debts”, complained: “The government can make you do PCR tests or shut down your business whenever it wants to.” With the surge in illegal border crossings from Mexico in recent months, the US Border Patrol has prioritised the processing of families while other migrants can wait for days before being taken into custody. CNA was there late last November as one group of Chinese migrants were getting ready for night in the Californian desert not too far from San Diego. “It’s only 6 pm,” muttered one of them. “The cold is unbearable.” There are volunteers feeding migrants awaiting Border Patrol processing, and team leader Sam Schultz, a local resident, estimated that on most days, “upwards of 50 per cent” of the migrants were Chinese. He had been helping to provide food and water supplies for about 10 weeks by then. And one thing he noticed was how hard it was “to get a bunch of Chinese people to line up in a queue”. “I think people are really worried that there might not be enough food for everybody, so they just want to be in the front,” he said. “And they’re right. There might not be enough food for everyone, sad to say.” It is “not a particularly orderly situation” on the border, and most of the Chinese migrants, he observed, “aren’t really familiar with camping out, … dealing with the kind of harsh situation that we have here”. Or as one Border Patrol officer told Du, expressing his surprise to see more Chinese migrants of late: “Not our normal customer.” Viewers of Walk The Line will have a ringside seat for the border crisis unfolding in the US. They will also have an up-close look at the personal crises of Chinese migrants as they struggle to reach the country. Lucy’s family met Du in Colombia, before they were to make their way to the Darien Gap, a jungle separating the country from Panama. Until today, the Darien Gap has no roads; crossing it can take up to a week. A worried Mum said: “My daughter isn’t an athletic child. She gets headaches if she walks too much. I don’t know if she can handle it.” Smugglers take groups of migrants through the jungle to reach Panama. But the trek itself is not as great a peril as the drug cartel controlling the area. Asked if there was no turning back, a teary Dad replied: “No. I want to be free — free from fear — (and to) say and do whatever you want as long as it doesn’t hurt others. I want to experience that.” His wife may not have “big dreams as he does”, but she does want Lucy to have “an easier life”. She said: “My life’s been too tiring.” But as they inched towards the Promised Land for many immigrant families, she acknowledged that their initial ideas of the US may not square with reality. “We were naive. We thought the streets in America were paved with gold,” she said. “All we had to do was to pick it up.” Walk The Line premieres on May 18, at 9 pm SG/HK, with more episodes on May 19 and 20 in the same time slot.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Late last year, a CNA crew travelled to North and South America to document the journeys of Chinese citizens crossing borders as illegal immigrants. The team behind Walk The Line now shares how the series was made. Miles and miles of wall on the United States’ southern border but not enough to keep out illegal migrants, including from China. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: In Ecuador’s capital city, Quito, there can be found a guest house catering almost exclusively for Chinese travellers. Last December, when it also accommodated a film crew from CNA, the usual suspects were rather concerned. “As soon as we checked in and the people in the guest house knew that we were journalists, … people were tense. They’re like, ‘Why are there journalists here?’” recalled senior producer Jonathan Chia. The Chinese guests were on edge because of what they were doing: migrating to the United States illegally. It was not long before shouting ensued. “Don’t sabotage us! Please understand our concerns,” implored one migrant, who did not want his face to be filmed. CNA correspondent Wei Du assured him of that. Unflustered, she had an ace up her sleeve: She had told Chia, on his trip from Singapore to Quito, to get barbecued sliced pork, or bak kwa , as gifts. “As soon as I brought out the bak kwa , … it was like we were their long-lost family and friends,” recounted Chia. “Immediately, people opened up.” On the first night, Du got four people on board as profiles for the three-part series, Walk The Line. “It’s not (that) people are easy to ‘buy off’. But people appreciate a little bit of warmth and generosity from a stranger,” she said. For the Chinese migrants, warmth and generosity were rare commodities on their journey. And for the CNA crew, finding profiles for their documentary was not the biggest challenge. “I never experienced danger in any of my previous … productions,” said Chia. But never before had he followed migrants crossing borders illegally, hoping to find a better life in the US. And now it is the CNA crew who open up on what it took to make Walk The Line in the face of all the challenges. The idea for the documentary came to Du when she started seeing videos — on Chinese video app platforms — of Chinese people crossing “what appears to be a dense tropical jungle”, alongside a “vast number” of South Americans. Today, the Chinese are the fastest-growing group of illegal migrants at the US’ southern border. And they start off as far south as Ecuador because it is the closest country to the US with visa-free entry for Chinese passport holders. “When I thought about South America, … Narcos from Netflix came to mind,” said Chia, referring to the drama series on the continent’s drug cartels. Owing to the risks involved in following the Chinese migrants, CNA engaged a security firm. Accompanying the crew on the whole trip was Adnan Nazar, a medic in the British Army for 11 years who completed four tours of duty, in Bosnia and Kosovo and twice in Iraq as a platoon commander. “The decision was made that I’d come in at the very beginning, starting with pre-deployment training (in Singapore), teaching the team a little bit about jungle survival, how to manage yourself, what kit … to take,” he said. Chia found the training “a bit overwhelming” at first. “He was talking about things like, what to do if you get kidnapped,” Chia recounted. “I’m just like, ‘What am I getting myself into?’” WATCH: Behind the scenes of Walk The Line — Into Narcos territory to film Chinese migrants (7:51) The crew included director of photography N Shanmuga Sundaram and sound recordist Muhammad Faddly, both of whom could not resist going on, in Shanmuga’s words, “an adventure of a lifetime”. Or as Du said: “There are people who run towards the fire and the people who run away from it. … All of us chose to do what we do. We’re the type of people who’d run towards it.” The team’s first stop, however, was not Ecuador but San Diego in the US, near the Mexican border. The first time Shanmuga saw the border wall, he found it “really intimidating”. “It was about 20, 30 feet high,” he described. “You’ll see miles and miles of wall — then there’ll be a small gap.” People were squeezing through the gap right in front of the crew. “To our surprise, it was pretty easy for them,” said Faddly. “Just walk through it, and you’ve made it, you’re in the US now.” WATCH: The full behind-the-scenes episode — The team who filmed Chinese asylum seekers’ journey to US (45:41) The border was where the crew first heard the Chinese migrants tell their stories before they were processed by the US Border Patrol. The sight of the migrants being searched, photographed and handcuffed got Du, who comes from Chongqing, feeling “very emotional” afterwards. “Was this humiliation really worth it?” she wondered. “That goes to challenge … what I thought I’d know about my country and my people. What has to happen for these people to be here, to be willing to go through this?” She had a similar kind of feeling in Quito when talking to one of the migrant profiles, dubbed Chubby Chef, who used to have his own business in China but lost 200,000 yuan (S$37,000) in two years. WATCH PART 1: From China to US — The illegal trek Chinese migrants are making to America (46:05) He told her he could cook or drive trucks in the US and would be happy earning US$10,000 (S$13,500) a month. “That was why he was making the trip,” said Du. “It does give you this unsettling feeling that a lot of them were getting into something they didn’t understand (and) would later come to regret.” Her team followed the profiles by car from Quito to Pasto, one of Colombia’s oldest cities, where they prepared to fly north to the city of Monteria. While transiting through Bogota airport, the crew met a family of three from Chengdu, who were called Mum, Dad and Lucy in the series. “They’re quite different from the other migrants,” said Du. \"They’re extremely warm, chatty, outgoing people. You don’t get a lot of these people in China. And … they have this beautiful relationship between the two parents. “Gradually, they took over the show — they became our main profiles, and they really just carried it all the way.” After the flight, the crew took a bus to the town of Necocli, the jumping-off point for the migrants’ entry to the Darien Gap. The Darien Gap, a dense, paramilitary-controlled jungle separating Colombia from Panama, is one of the world’s most dangerous migration routes. And before crossing the jungle, the migrants needed to buy things like portable stoves, tents, tarpaulin, hiking boots and sulphur powder to put around their tents to ward off snakes. The crew were “constantly on the move” as the migrants did their shopping. “For me, I had to carry my boom,” said Faddly. “And we were definitely attracting attention.” With smugglers taking groups of migrants through the jungle, Necocli’s economy was being “built on the trafficking of migrants”, said Nazar. “It’s a lot of money brought into that area. And they’re very sensitive (about) having their operations exposed. “We’d be walking through an area. You’d see (men) … looking at us, pointing, sending feedback (by phone) to whoever their bosses are.” The crew stopped at one point. “We had a little chat and said, ‘We’ve got to lower our profile. We’re standing out,’” he recounted. “We had to distance ourselves from the families as well, in the sense that we were jeopardising their opportunity to get transport.” Already, the crew’s chances of following the migrants were slim. WATCH PART 2: Cross the wall or die trying — Chinese migrants inch towards American dream (46:16) Their fixer, who had access to the Darien Gap, said his contact had told him that “the guy who (ran) the area … (didn’t) want to see any journalist” in the jungle. “It was a bit of a shock,” recalled Du. Nonetheless, she got the fixer to meet the jungle commander to see if her team would “stand a chance” of crossing the jungle. After three days waiting for permission, they were told the paramilitary had turned them away. The team made plans to fly to Panama City instead, then drive down to Panama’s south-east Darien province, hoping to catch the migrants exiting the Darien Gap. Having lost touch with the migrants, however, Du was about to give up hope when Dad phoned her. His family would be arriving by boat in Puerto Limon, a village up-river from the Darien Gap, the next day. So the team were prepared. Chia was in a boat on the river to film them, and he remembered it being “one of the most surreal experiences”. “Suddenly, I heard ‘Xie Feng Hong! Xie Feng Hong!’ — which is my Chinese name. And the last time I heard that name was in secondary school,” he said. “I zoomed in, and it was the profile (family).” Looking back, Du said the reunion with the family and seeing that they were all safe was an “exhilarating moment”. “That was the first time we saw them after about a week. And I was worried about how they were coping, whether they were healthy,” she said. “But the first thing they said … was, ‘Wei, we brought your sunglasses.’ “It just speaks volumes about the type of people they are. … They radiate kindness and love and try to really take care of other people.” The sunglasses now sit on a shelf in her home, with a little tag: “Survivor of the Darien Gap”. But much as she was amazed by the migrants’ resilience, she found herself in a “slightly odd” situation. “We didn’t want them to either die in an accident or get mugged … or worse,” she said. It was “emotionally difficult”, she added, to keep those aspects in balance. The migrants were taken to Panama’s border with Costa Rica. From there, they took buses across four Central American states. The crew flew to the south of Mexico to wait for them. WATCH PART 3: Can these Chinese asylum seekers reach their ‘American Dream’? (46:59) Meantime, Du had an interview in the city of Tapachula with a smuggler who “would take you from southern Mexico to wherever you want to be in the United States for US$9,000”. Before the meeting at a hotel, Nazar gave the team advice on security. For starters, he told Du to “try and stick to the script and questions to discuss”. Then there was the matter of what code word to use “if we need to go — which means stop what you’re doing, we’re leaving, no more questions”. They agreed on “guacamole” but, ultimately, did not have to use the word. From Tapachula, the crew flew to the Mexican border town of Tijuana. “It was a domestic flight, but there was passport control. And (the officers) were just pulling everybody with a Chinese passport (aside),” recounted Du, who has got a Hong Kong passport, with the Chinese national emblem on it. “Then, of course, they looked at our passports with the visa stamps. They had to let us go. … As we were making our way across the room, everybody’s like, ‘Which smuggler did you use? How much money did you pay?’” Earlier on their journey, Faddly and Shanmuga had also been held up, for nearly two hours, at the border crossing between Ecuador and Colombia. “Firstly, (the border guards) had issues with our names. Then they brought (in) superiors and other immigration officers,” recounted Shanmuga. Both men’s thumbprints were taken, and irises were scanned, before they could cross the border. “Pretty intense,” remarked Faddly, for whom this project was an “eye-opening” experience. “Despite a lack of … rest, we still managed to do our thing as a team.” Shanmuga, too, was full of praise for their “fantastic” crew, who were “team players”. As for Chia, he shares Du’s sentiments on the migrants’ resilience as they made their journey. “It made a lot of my problems that I face in my everyday life feel so insignificant,” he said.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Toa Payoh, Tampines and Hougang are the areas with the most rat sightings, according to reports CNA Insider and the programme Talking Point received from readers and viewers across the island. Viewers across Singapore reported rat sightings in their estates — and even their homes for some. (Image: WhatsApp/Eng Jeng Hwee, YB, Wubi Goh) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Twice recently, as Shantel Lim was jogging near her home, she got quite a shock when a rat scuttled past in front of her. Besides the shock, she felt a little anxious about being bitten. “I’d have to go to hospital immediately, as (rats) carry many pathogens, viruses … and bacteria,” said the 24-year-old. It is not just the solitary rat or two, however, that she has chanced upon in her Tampines Street 33 estate. She sees them in the void deck, “always at rubbish chutes” and in drains too. Recalling an instance where she saw five rats, she said: “They were really big and making loud squeaking sounds.” She has even seen up to eight rats in a pack, creating a situation she described as “unsanitary, dangerous and disgusting”. “It’s a big problem in Tampines because it’s not only me who’s experienced this. My friend who lives nearby said rats are a common sighting around her block as well,” she said. Now, more than ever, she is convinced that the rodent issue needs addressing — after CNA Insider and Talking Point asked readers and viewers across Singapore to report their rat sightings to us via Instagram , WhatsApp, email and TikTok . Within 10 days, we received 320 reports, including photos and videos. The places shown included playgrounds, lift lobbies and even supermarkets. These were collated to create a rat map , showing which areas may be having it worse than others. Tampines was indeed one of the top three hotspots, with 42 sightings out of 503 map entries in total. First on the list, however, was Toa Payoh, with 54 sightings. The third town was Hougang, with 25 sightings. Talking Point investigates just how pervasive Singapore’s rat problem is, plus what is being done about it. The town councils managing the three abovementioned estates all said they were monitoring rat activities or had surveillance operations in place. And they highlighted that they are working with various parties including the National Environment Agency (NEA) to address the issue. “We also take a holistic approach, enlisting co-operation from food outlets, supermarket operators, members of the community, and authorities managing construction sites for infrastructure projects to keep our estate and public spaces clean,” said Tampines Town Council. “To tackle the rat issue effectively, there must be consistent efforts by all parties.” Arising from these efforts, along with a “comprehensive and sustained rat surveillance and control programme” it has implemented with the NEA, there have been “positive results in the reduction of rats’ activities”, added the town council. Over in Toa Payoh, where Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council (BTPTC) has engaged professional pest control services, surveillance and culling operations have been stepped up since January. “At places where rodent burrows are detected persistently, ground treatment is done almost daily, and culling operations are conducted at least every fortnight,” said BTPTC chairperson Chong Kee Hiong in reply to our queries. “Ground treatment” refers to the process of putting baits into the burrows continuously to “eradicate the rats”, before sealing inactive burrows. The same process is repeated for active or new burrows. Culling exercises are also conducted at night. This includes placing cage traps at strategic locations, such as bin chutes, central refuse chutes and bin centres. “Concurrently, the town council is seeking the co-operation of nearby coffee shops and hawker centres on proper food waste management so as to curb potential food sources for the rodents,” said Chong. Inspection and enforcement operations at Toa Payoh’s food outlets are done in collaboration with the NEA and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), and BTPTC will “seek out new or improved methods to address the rodent issue” going forward. “We also intend to assist residential units on the ground floor to keep rodents out,” said Chong. “The town council is committed to keeping our estate clean and safe for our residents.” Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) echoed the other town councils in its reply and said that “in the light of the current trend of rodent sightings across Singapore”, it conducts “thorough site investigations to identify the underlying causes”. “Our investigative process includes … identifying potential sources of portable food, assessing the storage of bulky waste that may create conducive environments for harbouring rodents and determining the species of rodents present to implement effective trapping strategies tailored to their habitats,” it said. “There’s added vigilance in localities where there are major construction works going on, such as the Cross Island Line tunnelling works in Hougang, as rats are forced out of their harbouring areas.” AHTC also “undertakes educational outreach” to encourage proper disposal of food waste, such as “securely bagging leftover food and disposing of it into and not beside rubbish bins”; not leaving behind food consumed in common areas or leaving food unattended; and not feeding birds. “Such indiscriminate disposal of food waste could potentially cause rats to multiply rapidly,” said the town council. AHTC cautioned, however, against use of the term “rat infestation” as it “implies a surge in rat population, which may not necessarily be the case in every instance of (rats being sighted) but which causes undue public alarm”. Yet, some Singaporeans, such as Toa Payoh resident Eugenia Tan, suspect that there may indeed be “a problem of rat infestation” in their estates. The fresh graduate said “the rate of seeing those rats” has gone up as the years have gone by. “It might be too big a problem, especially because they reproduce quite fast,” the 23-year-old added. According to Martha Lee, her father — having observed rats in a community garden near Toa Payoh Polyclinic — took matters into his own hands and once caught 15 rats in one day. He caught more than 80 rats altogether, she said. WATCH: Rat infestations in Singapore — Where are they hiding? (22:58) Some members of the public have even spotted rats among supermarket shelves, and not just lurking outside the premises. CNA’s rat map includes images of the rodents in Giant, for example, and parent company DFI Retail Group responded by saying the health and safety of its customers was “a top priority”. “Upon being alerted about the pest sightings, we immediately initiated thorough sanitisation of the area and increased the frequency of inspections by the pest control team,” said a spokesperson. “In vicinities experiencing frequent pest sightings, we’ve intensified our co-operation with the local town council. For instance, our team at Giant Ubi Avenue 1, along with other neighbouring shop owners, have been working very closely with the Marine Parade Town Council as a united front to address this environmental concern.” CNA’s rat map also included sightings at Jurong West Stadium and Clementi Sport Centre, which led Sport Singapore (SportSG) to ramp up pest control efforts at both ActiveSG facilities. “ActiveSG Sport Champions have also been reminded to stay vigilant and practise preventive measures as part of day-to-day operations,” said SportSG. “These include ensuring cleanliness, minimising the presence of food on site and sealing any gaps or cracks that may be present in walls, doors, windows or the ground.” For the NEA, keeping the incidence of vector-borne diseases low “remains a priority”, it said in March when the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment designated 2024 as the year of public hygiene. This year, the NEA will “focus on tackling rat issues at source” by, for example, stepping up enforcement — with the SFA — of waste management at food premises and bin centres. In addition, the NEA and Enterprise Singapore are working with the Singapore Pest Management Association to develop a new Singapore Standard for performance measurement in the pest management sector. More recently, a trial of thermal imaging cameras to detect rats began in April. It will enable better rat surveillance at outdoor and back-lane areas, the NEA said. The trial will last four months. Based on figures from NEA surveillance, rats are a bigger problem than before. In the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, there were, on average, 4,300 and 3,900 rat burrows detected in public areas, respectively, in each two-month surveillance cycle. In 2022, an average of 4,163 rat burrows were detected in public areas per two-monthly cycle. Last year, the figure rose to 5,203, which is higher than the pre-pandemic number of 4,740 in 2019. What disappoints 34-year-old Jordan Poh is that his Build-To-Order project, Tampines GreenFoliage, was completed two years ago, yet he has spotted rats on “multiple” occasions, including in the multi-storey car park’s rooftop garden. Over in 376C Hougang Street 32, local resident Sue, who declined to give her full name, has recently been seeing “a large population of rats” almost daily. But she is sanguine about it. “I don’t know enough about rat management to … know if this is a big problem,” she said. “I do find it amusing that there are so many rats in the estate when we also have quite a population of cats. Clearly, these cats aren’t hunters.” The programme Talking Point airs on Channel 5 every Thursday at 9:30 p.m. Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider With the streets swarming with ‘petextrians’, concern over road safety looms ever larger. The programme Talking Point explores what happens when phone users walk distractedly and how Singapore can change this habit. Talking Point host Steven Chia following a distracted walker in the central business district. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Zombies may be fictional, but distracted walkers are all too real. With necks bent, eyes lowered and ears plugged, they navigate our streets with devices in hand — you’ve either seen them or are them. As early as 2015, a survey conducted by Nanyang Technological University students found that 93 per cent of 419 youths admitted to “multi-tasking while walking”, which led to 598 reported accidents among them. These included minor falls, collisions with other pedestrians and traffic accidents. Ironically, 84 per cent confessed that they were precognisant of the dangers of distracted walking. There are various reasons why distracted walkers are seemingly going against their better judgement. Some pedestrians caught on camera recently, on the programme Talking Point , were scrolling through social media pages like Instagram and TikTok, text-messaging or playing mobile games. These activities were not urgent, one of the passers-by acknowledged. “Sometimes you feel so bored with stuff around you, so it just becomes a natural instinct.” Normalising such instincts, however, can lead to tragic consequences. In 2022, Mohamad Yusman Sahadan, 52, died after being struck by a car while jaywalking at the junction of Sims Avenue and Aljunied Road. A coroner’s inquiry found that he was distracted by his phone and unable to react to oncoming traffic. But distracted walking not only reduces the awareness of our surroundings. Experts say the habit can also affect our body and brain, from pace and posture to cognitive capacity. The hallmark of distracted walkers is evident in the way they walk — specifically their slower pace than normal. WATCH: How dangerous is distracted walking while looking at your phone? (22:08) The moment our eyes lock on our smartphone screens, our vision narrows, and the brain compensates by shortening our steps, said Navdeep Vij Singh, chief digital neuroscientist at neuroscience clinic Neurowyzr. This slows us down and, in many cases, creates a human traffic jam. Over time, distracted walkers may also experience “text neck”, a condition that affects neck posture due to frequently bending the neck forward. Research has found that neck muscle activation is approximately 21 to 42 per cent higher when using a phone while walking, compared to sitting or standing. This can lead to neck pain, headaches and other issues affecting our shoulder muscles. Furthermore, a 2022 study on text neck syndrome suggested that prolonged mechanical strain on the cervical spine — the neck region of our backbone — may lead to a sense of imbalance, impaired movement co-ordination and disrupted functionality in the respiratory, circulatory, digestive and nervous systems. There is also “a big drop-off” in brain function as the brain can become overburdened with distractions and reach its cognitive limit, warned neurosurgeon Prem Pillay, For instance, when you walk and text simultaneously, the brain’s motor cortex must double down on both activities. “That’s a lot of load on the motor cortex,” he said. And when brain performance drops, “(it’s) very likely, if you’re doing something dangerous like walking across a road with busy traffic, that you might have an accident”. Singapore is not alone in finding distracted walking a hard nut to crack. Worldwide, “petextrians” have taken over the streets, prompting new laws to curb the habit. In 2017, Honolulu became the first major city in the United States to fine pedestrians — up to US$99 (S$133) — for crossing a street or highway while looking at their electronic devices. Smaller cities in Idaho and California have also outlawed texting while crossing the street and even banned pedestrians from being on the phone while crossing. Closer to home, Baguio City in the Philippines revised its laws against distracted walking last September; offenders now face warnings or 10 days of community service. Singapore has no laws against such behaviour. But should authorities consider the possibility? Singapore University of Social Sciences senior lecturer Maria Cecilia Rojas Lopez, whose research interests include transport planning and urban management, pointed out the potential challenge of defining the criteria for distracted walking within a legal framework. For example, questions regarding the amount of phone use deemed distracting, and which exemptions should be permitted, may arise. Additionally, such a law would require “a lot of manpower” to enforce, with many pedestrians already accustomed to walking while using their phones. Legislation aside, efforts to curb distracted walking have been explored before. In 2017, LED strips were installed on pavements at four pedestrian crossings along Orchard Road, Victoria Street, St Andrew’s Road and Bencoolen Road. These coloured light strips, synchronised with the traffic signals, were aimed at helping pedestrians, particularly those looking at their smartphones, cross the road safely. This initiative did not yield significant results, however, and concluded once the trial period was over. Similarly, in 2019, large yellow stickers bearing the words “Look Up” and a crossed-out mobile phone symbol were affixed on pavements at the junction near Ang Mo Kio MRT station and at its entrance. Initially, residents were puzzled as some considered it common sense, while others praised the effort. Former Member of Parliament (Ang Mo Kio GRC) Ang Hin Kee said that while the move did raise road safety awareness, people became less attentive over time as they became used to the presence of the stickers. Once the two-year campaign wrapped up, the Land Transport Authority removed the stickers. Despite the short-term nature of these initiatives, hope endures. Some Talking Point viewers have offered their own suggestions on how to address the prevalence of distracted walking. One proposal was to implement audio signals at busy crossings, similar to the announcement system used in MRT stations, instead of relying solely on visual cues. Another idea involved developing an app capable of detecting when individuals are walking and alerting them to refrain from using their phones. Drawing inspiration from anti-theft shopping trolleys in the US that automatically lock when leaving the store’s car park, one viewer suggested implementing a software-lock feature at road junctions. Another suggestion was to create “mobile phone rest stops” in busy streets and shopping centres, where pedestrians who must use their phones can do so safely and considerately. According to Lopez, the most reliable solution still lies in education — in encouraging people to be mindful of their actions in the street and consider how their behaviour may impact others.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider The kingdom’s population may halve before the turn of the century. The programme Insight delves into the reasons, and the possible solutions to a fertility decline that poses unique challenges. The Thai government is changing laws to encourage more births. This audio is generated by an AI tool. BANGKOK: It has been four years since Sira Kitpinyochai and Boontarika Namsena exchanged wedding vows, and they are happier having 11 cats than they would a child. The couple agreed to forgo parenthood before getting married. As they saw it, “children (were) more like a burden because of all the expenses involved”, plus a needless appendage to their already uncertain financial plans for old age. Then there is their lack of time. “It’s mostly 10 to 12 hours at the office (a day),” said procurement manager Boontarika, speaking for herself and her equity trader husband. “How (would) we find time to care for our children?” In another corner of Thailand’s corporate world, Anchalee Chaichanavijit, executive director of the Marketing Association of Thailand, thought about the same opportunity costs. With the demands of her professional life weighing heavily, raising a child seemed a task that would demand additional energy, money, resources and time that Anchalee did not have. “I don’t want to have children because … my own life is already tough enough,” she told the programme Insight , reflecting a sentiment increasingly common among many Thais. According to a National Institute of Development Administration survey last September, 44 per cent of respondents expressed a lack of desire to have children. The top reasons cited were child-rearing expenses, concerns about societal conditions’ impact on children and not wanting the burden of childcare. These aversions are reflected in Thailand’s fertility rate, which stood at 1.08 last year, the second lowest in Southeast Asia after Singapore’s 0.97 last year. Deputy Prime Minister Somsak Thepsutin warned that if the kingdom persisted on this trajectory, its population could be halved, from its current 66 million to 33 million, within 60 years. While declining fertility rates are a global phenomenon, Thailand is set to face unprecedented challenges ahead. Thailand already stands out from its neighbours at similar levels of development. Countries such as Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia have fertility rates close to or hovering around the replacement level of 2.1 births per woman. Ironically, what laid the foundations for Thailand’s economic growth could have precipitated its current problems. WATCH: “Kids are too expensive!” How Thailand became one of the world’s fastest-ageing countries (47:07) In 1970, Thailand launched its national family planning programme with the aim of moderating population growth and fostering economic progress. By 1976, the programme had not only lowered the population growth rate to 2.55 per cent, but also exceeded its target of 26 per cent contraceptive acceptance. This success endures, with nearly three in four married women today practising contraception. Tiffany Chen, a policy experimentation expert in the United Nations Development Programme’s Thailand Policy Lab suggested that the country’s outperformance could be linked to religion. With up to 95 per cent of the population practising Buddhism, which allows certain forms of birth control, Thailand stands apart from neighbouring countries where religions that often prohibit contraception, such as Islam or Catholicism, hold sway. Compared to some other nations, traditional attitudes about patriarchy have also changed in Thailand, said Sutthida Chuanwan, an associate professor at Mahidol University’s Institute for Population and Social Research. Currently, Thai women outnumber men in the pursuit of higher education, and their labour force participation surpasses that of women in the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. “That actually limits the number of children that women tend to have, compared to those who might be housewives and just stay home,” said Kirida Bhaopichitr, research director for international economics and development policy at the Thailand Development Research Institute. Economic pursuits do not, however, impede marriage prospects here, in contrast to countries such as Japan and South Korea, where declining marriage rates may contribute to dwindling birth rates. Thailand has sustained a consistent level of marriages for over a decade, but married couples are simply choosing to stay child-free, either temporarily or permanently. Nevertheless — again unlike Japan and South Korea — Thailand is considered a developing economy. This means it could be among the first nations to experience “getting old before (getting) rich”. “When population ageing is gradual, it’s easier to adapt to the needs of an ageing society, whether it’d be in terms of healthcare, socio-economic infrastructure or the environment,” said Asean Centre for Active Ageing and Innovation interim executive director Sakarn Bunnag. An ageing population signifies not only a decline in birth rates but also an increase in the elderly demographic. And in Thailand, seniors aged 60 and over constitute a fifth of the population already. Thawatchai Potin in Bangkok is one of them. He has been repairing fans for a living since he was 25. At age 74 now, and 14 years past the retirement age, survival would be uncertain without work, he said. “During COVID-19, for example, I had to share one egg with another person for a meal,” he shared. “If I go home (to Ubon Ratchathani province), I’ll be more like a burden to my children because I can still work.” The National Economic and Social Development Council reported that 41.4 per cent of seniors had savings of less than 50,000 baht (S$1,840) in 2021, and 78.3 per cent earned less than 100,000 baht per year. In comparison, around 4.3 million baht in savings is needed for retirement in the city. To address this, the Thai government allocated almost 78 billion baht last year for the Old-Age Living Allowance, a monthly subsidy programme of up to 1,000 baht for senior citizens who are not pensioners or receiving welfare. As the elderly population continues to rise, however, this initiative increasingly will put a strain on the government’s budget. Projections indicate that Thailand could transition into a super-aged society, with those aged 60 and over constituting at least 28 per cent of the population, by 2033 or earlier. This demographic shift will necessitate another slew of eldercare-related expenses, including for caregivers, quality medication and specialised nurses and physical therapists. Adult children are starting to feel the pinch too. Providing care for their parents and themselves leaves little in the money pot for future offspring. Although Thailand provides 12 years of free education at public schools, its central bank estimates that parents must still pay 1.6 million baht to support a child from kindergarten to university — more than six times the gross domestic product per capita. Furthermore, even if a couple decide to have children, raising one is not easy in Thailand’s increasingly urban setting. More than half of Thailand’s population resides in urban regions, notably the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, whose high population density has translated into challenges such as a high cost of living, social inequality, lack of green space, pollution and overcrowding. “Given the current economic climate, unless the family is well off, both parents often must work. So a lot of people decide to put off having children,” said Bureau of Reproductive Health director Bunyarit Sukrat. Despite this increasing focus on career and income among urbanites, Thailand’s labour force participation rate has declined since the last decade, highlighted Kirida. A reduced pool of workers impacts productivity and income generation necessary for sustaining families and launching ventures in the country. If left unaddressed, Thailand’s declining fertility rate could raise concerns among potential investors, possibly shifting their focus to other countries. To diffuse the demographic time bomb, the Thai government has outlined three main strategies. The first two strategies involve fostering an environment that promotes both childbearing and child-rearing as well as improving public attitudes towards family upbringing. “We aim to reduce the burden on parents as much as possible,” said Bunyarit. This includes providing support such as designated breastfeeding areas, day-care facilities and financial assistance, ranging from subsidies on essential items to tax benefits for parents with multiple children. Flexible working hours for women with young children is another area slated for improvement. In this regard, economist Piyachart Phiromswad emphasised the importance of private sector collaboration in developing policies to support working women in raising children. The third strategy focuses on enhancing access to various reproductive health services. The government plans to expand access to assisted reproductive technology for young singles who aspire to raise children. Furthermore, with the country set to legalise same-sex marriages, access to the same services may be extended to gay and lesbian couples. As for the silver tsunami, projects such as the Chulalongkorn University Platform for Ageing Research Innovation help to promote healthy ageing with urban communities. The platform’s efforts centre on enhancing socio-economic conditions, healthcare services, technology integration and the physical environment. For instance, curated spaces such as a geriatric-friendly garden for the community in Sapsinmai facilitate social interaction among seniors whilst set in an environment tailored to their physical needs. Chersery Home International Hospital chief executive officer Gengpong Tangaroonsanti also advocates a shift away from age-based categorisation to functional age assessment. He proposes that age 60 be considered the new middle age and that retirement be based on functionality rather than age. As traditional ideas about growth centred on labour and consumption also become increasingly irrelevant, what happens in one of the fastest-ageing developing countries could be a sign of things to come. “The clock started (ticking) a long time ago,” Piyachart said. And Thailand’s future may depend on its ability to “transform these (demographic) challenges into opportunities”. Watch this episode of Insight here . The programme airs on Thursdays at 9pm.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Chen Qingyuan's 15-month jail term is the longest among those dealt with so far and is on par with Zhang Ruijin. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The seventh of 10 suspects to be caught up in Singapore's multibillion-dollar money laundering crackdown was on Thursday (May 23) sentenced to 15 months in jail. Chen Qingyuan, a 34-year-old Cambodian national, pleaded guilty to three out of 10 charges. These include conspiring with his girlfriend Wang Qiujiao to submit forged documents to Standard Chartered in response to the bank's queries about payments into her account. Chen's jail term is the longest among those dealt with so far and on par with Zhang Ruijin, who was also sentenced to 15 months' jail in April . The 10 individuals were arrested during a simultaneous raid on Aug 15, 2023 . Police have seized more than S$3 billion (US$2.2 billion) worth of assets so far. In Chen's case, more than S$23 million of his assets were seized. Some were funded by him but held under Wang's name. Chen will forfeit about 90 per cent of his assets, with Wang agreeing to have those held in her name surrendered as well. These include an apartment in the River Valley area worth more than S$10 million and cryptocurrencies with an estimated value of more than S$1.8 million. Authorities also seized S$614,750 in foreign currencies and a white Land Rover worth about S$1 million. These were suspected to be proceeds from remote gambling offences overseas. He was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for how these assets came about. In determining their proposed sentence for Chen, the prosecution and defence referred to the six people before him who were handed jail terms of between 13 and 15 months. The prosecution, represented by Deputy Public Prosecutors Michelle Tay, Foo Shihao and Pavithra Ramkumar, argued for Chen to be jailed for between 15 and 17 months - the highest sentencing range among the accused. Chen's lawyer, Mr Gary Low from Drew and Napier, argued for Chen to be jailed for 14 months, pointing out that the circumstances of his client's case did not call for the stiffest jail term. Chen also paid for false documents from a person via WeChat to submit to Standard Chartered. These documents were in response to the bank's queries on the source of his funds. Chen had transferred US$100,000 to Wang's bank account in September 2019 and arranged for two remittances of around S$3 million to be sent from Indonesia to his account in July 2021. Standard Chartered made two related queries about the source of funds for these transfers. In response, Chen helped to create the false documents. One of these was for an income certificate purportedly issued by a company in China called Sunshine Coast. The certificate alleged that Wang had been hired by Sunshine Coast while she was in China between 2010 and 2012 and was paid 800,000 yuan (US$113,000) during this period. Wang admitted during investigations that she was never employed by Sunshine Coast. When requesting the forged document, Chen provided the details and instructed how they should appear on the document, the court heard. He agreed to pay 200 yuan for the document, which was dated Jul 11, 2021, and submitted it to Standard Chartered. He also instructed for three other forged documents to be created. These were also submitted to the bank. Mr Foo referenced the cases of accused persons Su Haijin , Wang Baosen , Su Baolin , Zhang Ruijin and Vang Shuiming , who had been dealt with previously. He said that the amount seized in Chen's money laundering offences was the second-highest, and that while Chen had kept about 10 per cent of his assets, others, including Wang Baosen, had surrendered everything. The prosecution also raised multiple aggravating factors, such as Chen's \"calculated and intentional\" use of forged documents, the \"substantial\" amount involved in his money laundering offences and its transnational element. \"Money laundering is a serious offence that facilitates international criminals obtaining and enjoying their ill-gotten gains. It is difficult to detect and requires significant resources from law enforcement agencies and financial institutions to trace the proceeds of crime,\" the prosecution said in sentencing documents. Chen's lawyer Mr Low disagreed with the sentence sought by the prosecution, arguing that his client's case did not warrant a jail term at the highest end. Mr Low said that his client had pleaded guilty at an early stage, saving resources that would have been spent on a trial. \"As we all know, money laundering offences with its transnational elements are complex cases which will necessitate a lengthy and complex trial (if he should contest the charges),\" said Mr Low. \"His early (plea of guilt) is a reflection of his sincere and utmost remorse and is a significant mitigating factor.\" Mr Low also listed Chen's economic and social contributions to Singapore since relocating here in 2019. Chen's company employed 25 to 28 employees in Singapore including Singaporeans, and its economic performance here was a positive contribution to the country, Mr Low said. Before his arrest, Chen was also actively engaged in \"charitable deeds\" and contributed more than 80 hours of community service annually, the defence said. While in Singapore, Chen regularly participated in rubbish-picking at beaches or public spaces and food drives to the needy, among other activities. \"Mr Chen's contributions both financially and socially in Singapore are not insignificant. They reflect a genuine desire by Mr Chen to avoid any illegal activities ever since his relocation from China, as well as to be a positive force in society,\" said Mr Low. Mr Low urged the court to place mitigating weight on this factor as it indicated Chen's capacity for reform. In response, the prosecution said that the sentence ought to deter potential offenders from similar crimes and noted that Chen would likely be deported from Singapore after the conclusion of his case. On the jail term, Mr Low pointed out that his client's sentence should be commensurate with the others sentenced before him. \"What we seek is only a fair and appropriate sentence that is appropriate to circumstances. The sentence sought by the prosecution of between 15 and 17 months is, with respect, neither fair nor appropriate,\" Mr Low said, pointing out that it was the highest range of sentence among all the accused persons dealt with to date. Chen did not have the most charges or the highest value of assets seized or returned, with the other accused \"outranking\" his client, Mr Low added. He raised the example of Vang Shuiming, who had been sentenced to 13 months and six weeks' jail. Vang faced more than two times the number of charges, and is getting back much more than Chen, pointed out Mr Low. He said it would be \"completely disproportionate\" if Chen were to be sentenced to a higher jail term. In passing the sentence, Senior District Judge Ong Hian Sun said he had taken all factors into consideration, and backdated the jail term to Chen's arrest on Aug 15, 2023. Forgery carries a jail term of up to four years, a fine, or both. For possessing the benefits of criminal conduct, a person may be fined up to S$150,000, or jailed up to three years, or both. CNA understands that Chen's girlfriend Wang Qiujiao is currently assisting with police investigations.

Lin Baoying, charged over the billion-dollar money laundering case in Singapore. (Illustration: Rafa Estrada) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Lin Baoying , the only woman among 10 suspects in Singapore's multibillion-dollar money laundering crackdown, was sentenced to 15 months in jail on Thursday (May 30). The 44-year-old Chinese national pleaded guilty to three out of 10 charges, with the remainder considered for sentencing. She was convicted on one count of money laundering and two counts of fraudulently using a forged document. Lin was the eighth suspect to be dealt with in the case. The 10 individuals were arrested during a simultaneous raid on Aug 15, 2023. The court ordered the forfeiture of about S$154 million of Lin's seized assets. This makes up around 90 per cent of the S$170.5 million worth of assets in relation to Lin and her companies. The assets included cash from 13 bank accounts, five properties, cryptocurrencies, two cars and memberships at two country clubs in Singapore. When Lin was arrested in August 2023, police seized a range of assets, such as properties, bank accounts and cryptocurrencies. These assets were worth almost S$170.6 million. Some of assets include: Thirteen bank accounts - from Citibank Singapore, DBS Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and RHB Bank. These accounts held a mix of local and other foreign currencies. The largest account held about HK$75.6 million (S$13.1 million). The police also seized about S$13.6 million in physical cash. Five properties were seized: Two houses at Sentosa Cove, apartments at Beach Road and Grange Roa and an Amoy Street shophouse worth almost S$30 million. According to court documents, Lin paid S$13.5 million and S$15.5 million for the two Sentosa Cove houses. Two cars - a green Rolls-Royce Dawn Black Badge worth about $1.6 million and a white Toyota Alphard Elegance MR worth S$215,000 - were also seized. Lin also held a mix of cryptocurrencies: Other seized assets include: In determining the proposed sentence for Lin, the prosecution referred to the four people before her - Su Haijin , Su Wenqiang , Wang Baosen , and Zhang Ruijin - who were handed jail terms of between 12 and 14 months. The prosecution, represented by Deputy Public Prosecutors Nicholas Tan, Ryan Lim and Gan Ee Kiat, argued for Lin to be jailed for between 15 and 17 months. Lin’s partner, Zhang, 45, was sentenced to 15 months’ jail after pleading guilty to three charges in April for his role in the operation. Between April 2020 and October 2020, Lin submitted forged documents to various financial institutions in Singapore, in response to their queries on the source of her funds. This included submitting two forged agreements to CIMB Bank and UOB Kay Hian (UOBKH) to show that Lin's source of funds derived from the sale of two Macao properties allegedly owned by her, even though she never owned such properties. Investigations also revealed that Lin was suspected to have run an unlicensed and unlawful gambling operation overseas between 2015 and 2019, and had transferred the proceeds into Singapore. But she was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for how HK$7.5 million was deposited into her UOBKH account, which she had initially falsely represented to the bank as being proceeds from the sale of the Macao property allegedly owned by her. Lin was unable to substantiate with documentary evidence the claim that the money came from legitimate sources of income such as her businesses. For fraudulently using as genuine a document which Lin knew to be a forged document, she could have been jailed for up to four years, fined, or both. For the offence of money laundering, Lin could have been fined up to S$150,000, jailed a maximum of three years, or both.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Five of the eight people convicted in the case have now been deported from Singapore. From left: Su Baolin, Su Haijin and Vang Shuiming are among the eight to have been convicted in the multibillion-dollar money laundering case in Singapore. (Illustration: CNA/Rafa Estrada) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Three of the men convicted in Singapore's multibillion-dollar money laundering crackdown have been deported, said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) on Sunday (Jun 2). Cambodian national Su Baolin and Cypriot national Su Haijin were respectively deported to Cambodia on May 25 and May 28. Turkish national Vang Shuiming was deported to Japan on Saturday. \"All three men are barred from re-entering Singapore,\" said ICA. ICA did not elaborate on why the men were deported to Cambodia or Japan. However, it previously said that the location of deportation was dependent on the \"admissibility of the foreigner\" based on their valid passport. Vang was listed as a Turkish national in court documents but also had passports from China and Vanuatu. The three men were among 10 people arrested in an islandwide police operation in August 2023 after police were tipped off about possible illicit activities by a group of foreign nationals. Eight of them have since been convicted and including the three deportations confirmed by ICA on Sunday, a total of five of them have been expelled from Singapore. The first two to be deported - Su Wenqiang and Wang Baosen - were sent to Cambodia on May 6. Su Wenqiang is a Cambodian national whose passport states that he is from Fujian, China, while Wang is a Chinese national. Su Baolin, 42, pleaded guilty to three out of 13 charges and was sentenced to 14 months' jail in April. Two charges were related to money laundering while the other was for making false representations to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). More than S$3 billion in assets were seized or frozen in relation to his case, likely making it one of the largest money laundering operations in the world. Around S$100 million worth of assets, consisting of cash, vehicles, properties, luxury items, and alcohol were seized from Su during investigations. This included about S$3 million in proceeds from the sale of vehicles such as a Ferrari 488 Spider, Rolls Royce Phantom and Bentley Flying Spur. Authorities also confiscated jewellery worth about S$2 million and two country club memberships. Su Haijin, 41, was also sentenced to 14 months in jail in April. During the raid last year, he jumped off a second-floor balcony at his residence in Ewart Park in an effort to evade arrest. He fractured both feet and injured his wrist, but managed to hobble down a flight of steps and escape through a side gate. Su then hid in a drain where he was later found and arrested. Su pleaded guilty to three out of 14 charges. These were for resisting lawful arrest and possessing around S$1.4 million in criminal proceeds through a shell company Yihao Cyber Technologies . About S$170 million worth of assets consisting of cash, vehicles and luxury items were seized from Su. These included 21 bank accounts containing about S$45.6 million, 13 properties including two Sentosa houses and three North Bridge Road shophouses, as well as variety of vehicles and luxury items. Vang, who was sentenced to 13 months and six weeks' jail in May, is the suspect with the highest number of charges in the money laundering case. The 43-year-old faced 22 charges and pleaded guilty to three of them. His offences include possessing about S$2.4 million in suspected criminal proceeds, and the use of documents he had reason to believe were forged. Vang voluntarily forfeited about S$180 million in assets to the state. This is the largest amount that any accused person in the money laundering case has forfeited so far. It came out of more than S$198 million in assets seized from him, including assets that he paid for but were held in the name of his wife, Wang Ruiyan.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Su Jianfeng worked for the illegal gambling business aimed at punters in China from Malaysia before moving to the Philippines and eventually Singapore, where he bought millions of dollars worth of property with the criminal funds. Su Jianfeng, charged over the billion-dollar money laundering case in Singapore. (Illustration: Rafa Estrada) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The prosecution is seeking a sentence of 17 to 18 months' jail for Su Jianfeng , the longest term sought so far for an accused person in the S$3 billion money laundering probe that showed criminals with roots in China converting their illegal overseas gains to luxury properties and goods in Singapore. Su, 36, is listed as a Vanuatu national in court documents but was born in Fujian, China, according to his seized passports. He pleaded guilty to one charge each of possessing S$550,903 in criminal benefits and fraudulently using a property sale contract to explain the source of about S$2 million deposited into his Maybank account. Another 12 charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing. The court heard that Su was introduced to an illegal remote gambling business by an \"unknown Taiwanese man\" in 2013. The business involved online gambling websites, which punters from China would access through their phones for betting. Su joined the business, working initially from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, before going to Manila, Philippines. He advertised the websites and managed the workers who operated and maintained the gambling websites. In August 2019, Su's children relocated to Singapore as he wanted them to study there, and Su followed a year later. The Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force began receiving information of possible money laundering and the use of forged documents to mask the source of funds in Singapore bank accounts from 2021. Investigations pointed to a group of foreign nationals, and the police launched islandwide simultaneous raids on Aug 15, 2023, to nab the suspects, including Su. They raided Su's home at Third Avenue, seizing S$550,903 in cash from a safe in his master bedroom. The money was from the illegal gambling business based in the Philippines, aimed at punters in China. In Singapore, Su had a bank account with Maybank. In March 2021, Maybank's Financial Crime Compliance Unit sent an email to Su's relationship manager at Maybank, highlighting two suspicious deposits. Su had received a sum of about S$1 million on Dec 2, 2020, and another sum of S$969,970 on Dec 3, 2020 into his Maybank account from Tuo Xin You Limited. Su's relationship manager was instructed by the financial crime compliance unit to obtain supporting documents for these two deposits. In response, Su said the money came from the purported sale of a property in Dubai to a person who owned Tuo Xin You Limited. He provided a property sale contract to back up his claim, but this was later found to be forged. Su had lied about the origin of the money as he did not want Maybank to discover the real source. About S$187 million worth of assets linked to Su or held under his wife's name have been seized - including cash, properties, vehicles, luxury goods, cryptocurrency and alcohol. The properties are worth S$7.1 million and include apartments in Newton, Tanglin and Beach Road, as well as shophouses in Telok Ayer and Chinatown. As part of his plea deal, Su has agreed to have at least 95 per cent of his seized assets forfeited to the state. Prosecutors on Thursday sought 17 to 18 months' jail for Su, saying he indicated his guilty plea much later than the others, and that his crimes involved higher amounts. Su was represented by two teams of lawyers: Senior Counsel N Sreenivasan, Ms Jerrie Tan and Ms Adorabelle Tan from K&L Gates Straits Law, and Mr Ravindran Ramasamy and Mr Arjun Ravindran from CNPLaw. The defence asked for 14.5 months' jail instead, objecting to the prosecution's contention that Su was one of the last to indicate his plea of guilt. Instead, the defence argued that Su had indicated his plea of guilt on the same day that the prosecution had informed the court they were ready for the plea to be taken. While the prosecution claimed that Su wasted public resources by applying for some seized funds to be released for payment of basic expenses and causing the prosecution to review evidence to determine charges to proceed on for trial, the defence argued that the prosecution was not ready for the plea to be taken for more than nine months since Su's arrest. The lawyers added that Su's agreement to forfeit about 95.5 per cent of his seized assets was among the highest compared with other offenders. Since most of the other eight offenders sentenced so far received between 13 and 15 months' jail, there is \"no reason\" for the court to depart from that, the defence argued. Su will be sentenced on Monday. Of the 10 arrested and charged in the probe, eight have been sentenced to jail terms of between 13 and 15 months. The last accused person , Wang Dehai , is set to plead guilty on Friday.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Around S$54 million in assets, including cash and cryptocurrency, were seized from Wang Dehai, who was involved in a remote gambling business in the Philippines. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The last of 10 individuals prosecuted in the S$3 billion (US$2.2 billion) money laundering case pleaded guilty in court on Friday (Jun 7) and was handed the longest jail term so far at 16 months. Wang Dehai, 35, faced six charges, two of which are related to money laundering, while the rest are employment offences under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. The Cypriot pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing S$2,299,950 in cash that was suspected to be benefits from illicit remote gambling offences. The other money laundering charge was for using around S$23 million in suspected criminal proceeds to buy a condominium unit in Orchard Road. The employment offences were for falsely representing himself as a brand manager and a business consultant for Craft Digital between 2018 and 2022 to obtain employment passes, and for hiring a housekeeper without a valid work pass. These charges were taken into consideration for his sentencing. For the money laundering charge that was proceeded on, Wang could have been jailed up to three years, or fined up to S$150,000, or both. Wang was nabbed with nine other foreigners during simultaneous raids islandwide in August 2023. He is the last one to have pleaded guilty in court. Those that came before Wang have had millions of dollars in assets, including luxury goods and properties , seized and surrendered. For Wang, around S$54 million in assets, including cash, cryptocurrency, luxury items and property were seized or subjected to prohibition of disposal orders. He has agreed to surrender about 90 per cent of these assets. The court heard that Wang was involved in a illicit business based in the Philippines from 2012. The business offered remote gambling services to people in China, which is an offence. He worked in the customer service side of the business before becoming a promoter in 2014. As a promoter, he was given a 3 per cent share in the annual profit of the business. His total income in 2016 amounted to more than S$15 million. Wang left the operation in 2022 and received a final payout of around S$1.38 million. He recruited his cousin Su Wenqiang into the business. The others involved were Wang's brother-in-law Su Yongcan, Wang's cousin Wang Huoqiang, and Su Jianfeng , who is Su Yongcan's brother-in-law. Su Yongcan and Wang Huoqiang, who are both Cambodian nationals, are on the run , while Su Wenqiang and Su Jianfeng have been convicted in Singapore's court. Wang and his family relocated to Singapore in 2018, as he wanted his children to be educated here. Investigations found that he had transferred proceeds from his illicit gambling business into Singapore. On Aug 15, 2023, the day of Wang's arrest, a Rimowa luggage containing S$2,299,950 in cash was found at Wang's home. He initially lied that he did not know the contents of the luggage, which he claimed belonged to his wife. He also provided inconsistent accounts in statements, first claiming that the money came in part from selling off his cryptocurrency in Singapore, and from Su Yongcan, or from winning mahjong games. In another statement, he claimed the money all came from Su Yongcan, who had cash delivered in a suitcase by an unknown person in the Orchard area at the end of October 2022. Wang lied that the money was a loan to him. He was unable to account for the source of the money. The prosecution, represented by Deputy Public Prosecutors David Koh and Louis Ngia, argued for 16 to 17 months' jail for Wang. Mr Ngia cited three aggravating factors: That the offences involved a transnational syndicate, that the amount was substantial, and that Wang's conduct reflected a broader abuse of Singapore’s financial infrastructure. Comparing the sum in Wang's proceeded charge to the accused's cases that came before him, the prosecution said that individual and similar money laundering charges involving S$1 million to S$1.47 million had resulted in 13-month jail terms. \"In this light, it is only fair and just that a higher sentence be imposed on the accused for his offence, given that it involves a significantly higher sum of (around) S$2.3 million,\" the prosecution said. Pointing out that the total amount across Wang's charges exceeded S$25 million, the prosecution said its proposed sentence was \"fair\". Wang's lawyer Megan Chia, however, argued that for a few of the previous convictions, the total amounts involved added up to more than Wang's S$25 million. Unlike the other accused, Wang did not face any forgery charges, and had not transferred money through corporate intermediaries, said Ms Chia. He had voluntarily surrendered most of his seized assets, including his family home in Singapore, which showed his remorse, said the defence lawyer, who added that her client eventually dropped out of the business when he moved to Singapore. \"All he and his wife genuinely wanted to do when moving into Singapore was to provide a good environment for his children to grow up and secure top-notch education for his children,\" said Ms Chia. However District Judge Sharmila Sripathy-Shanaz took issue with this point, arguing that Wang had offended for several years before he was arrested, which went against the defence's portrayal of his life in Singapore as \"uneventful\". She addressed the point further in sentencing remarks. \"The seeming implication that Mr Wang was, by the time of his residence in Singapore, a benign individual who had simply sought to build a home in this country with his family blithely ignores the objective evidence before this court,\" said the judge. \"In reality, the charges as a whole disclose that Mr Wang continued to sustain himself in Singapore with property reasonably suspected of representing the benefits of his criminal conduct.\" Wang had also repeatedly defrauded Singapore authorities in his employment offences, the judge said. On the defence's point that Wang and his family will be expelled from Singapore and are likely to be barred from re-entering, the judge said: \"I can only say that Mr Wang sealed his family’s fate when he deliberately and flagrantly chose to flout the laws of this country. \"Ultimately, it is an established principle of law that the natural collateral consequences that follow when an individual commits an offence do not serve as effective mitigation. I thus place no weight on this in sentencing.\" Of the nine who pleaded guilty before Wang, eight have been sentenced to jail terms of between 13 and 15 months while one has yet to be sentenced. Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, 36, pleaded guilty on Thursday but had his sentencing reserved until Monday. The prosecution argued for 17 to 18 months' jail for Su Jianfeng , the longest term sought so far for an accused person in this case. Su Jianfeng's sentencing will conclude the multi-billion dollar case that has cast the problem of money laundering into the spotlight.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Su Jianfeng, the last of the 10 offenders in Singapore’s S$3 billion money laundering probe, appears in court via Zoom video-call for sentencing on Jun 10, 2024. (Court sketch: CNA/Nathan Magindren) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The last of 10 offenders in the S$3 billion money laundering probe in Singapore that cast a light on foreign nationals buying up luxury properties on the island nation has been sentenced. Su Jianfeng , a 36-year-old Vanuatu national with roots in Fujian, China, was given 17 months’ jail on Monday (Jun 10). His jail term is the longest of the nine men and one woman prosecuted over the billion-dollar money laundering case, where illegal proceeds from Southeast Asian gambling centres aimed at Chinese punters were converted into luxury goods and properties in Singapore’s priciest neighbourhoods. Su had pleaded guilty last week to one charge each of possessing S$550,903 in criminal benefits and fraudulently using a property sale contract to explain the source of about S$2 million deposited into his Maybank account. Another 12 charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. He was roped into the illegal online gambling business by a Taiwanese man over a decade ago in 2013. Su began working from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, before shifting to Manila, Philippines, and finally to Singapore - as he wanted his children to be educated here. The Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force began receiving information of possible money laundering and the use of forged documents to mask the source of funds in Singapore bank accounts from 2021. This culminated in simultaneous islandwide raids on Aug 15, 2023, resulting in the arrests of 10 suspects, including Su. About S$187 million worth of assets linked to Su or held under his wife's name have been seized - including cash, properties, vehicles, luxury goods, cryptocurrency and alcohol. This is among the highest across the 10 offenders in the probe. Su has agreed to have at least 95 per cent of the seized assets forfeited to the state. Prosecutors sought 17 to 18 months’ jail for Su, the highest sought among the 10, while the defence asked for 14.5 months instead. In sentencing, District Judge James Elisha Lee agreed with the prosecution that there was a \"compelling need\" to protect Singapore's reputation as a major financial centre from the impact of transnational money laundering. The aggravating factors in Su's case include the existence of a transnational syndicate, the large amounts involved and his \"persistence\" in offending. However, while Su's proceeds from his money-laundering offences amounted to almost S$17.5 million, he also agreed to forfeit more than S$175 million, Judge Lee said, calling this a \"significant mitigating factor\" demonstrating remorse. The other nine offenders have been sentenced to between 13 and 16 months’ jail. All of them pleaded guilty, despite several hinting at possible trials in the early stages. Those who have finished their jail terms after backdating from the date of remand and time off for good behaviour have been deported to various countries.

SINGAPORE: About S$944 million (US$697 million) in assets seized in relation to the 10 criminals embroiled in one of Singapore's largest money-laundering probes will be forfeited to the state, now that the last offender has been sentenced to jail . The probe, which began in 2021 with tip-offs on a group of foreigners using forged documents to launder money in Singapore, led to the simultaneous arrests of nine men and one woman - with origins in China - in moneyed estates around the island in August 2023. In the months following the arrests, billions of dollars worth of assets linked to the offenders and other suspects on the run have been seized - including hard cash, luxury properties, branded goods, cryptocurrency and alcohol. The offenders all pleaded guilty to various crimes, including money laundering, using forged bank documents and other related offences, such as lying to the Manpower Ministry to obtain work passes to enter Singapore. They were sentenced to between 13 and 17 months' jail. The 10th criminal, 36-year-old Vanuatu national Su Jianfeng, was sentenced to the longest jail term on Monday (Jun 10), bringing the saga to a close. In a statement after the hearing, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said the value of assets linked to the 10 offenders total more than S$1 billion to date. About S$944 million worth of these assets have been ordered by the court to be forfeited to the state. This was after the 10 offenders agreed as part of their plea deals to have at least 90 per cent of their seized assets forfeited. Of the 10, only two - Su Wenqiang and Wang Baosen - agreed to surrender 100 per cent of the estimated S$6 million and S$8 million seized from them respectively. Investigations are ongoing against 17 other suspects who are not currently in Singapore. Assets linked to these suspects make up the rest of the total S$3 billion figure seized. In response to CNA's queries, a police spokesperson said the non-cash assets will be sold via channels such as auctions. Thereafter, the proceeds of the sale, along with the forfeited cash, will be paid into Singapore's consolidated fund - akin to a bank account held by the government. Mr David Chew, the director of the SPF's Commercial Affairs Department, said the \"swift and firm law enforcement efforts\" and the \"successful prosecutions\" are testament to \"our commitment to tackle transnational crime and disrupt the activities of organized crime syndicates\". \"To protect Singapore’s financial system, the police will spare no effort to detect abuse, arrest the criminals and deprive them of their ill-gotten gains. In Singapore, these criminals will not find safe harbour for themselves or their wealth,\" he said. In a separate statement, the Chief Prosecutor from the Attorney-General's Chambers, Mr Tan Kiat Pheng, said the amounts involved across the 10 convicts' cases make this one of the largest money-laundering cases that Singapore has prosecuted. \"The swift prosecution of these ten cases is a strong message to would-be criminals that Singapore will not tolerate attempts to flout our laws,\" he said. \"We will take firm and swift action against those who exploit our system to launder illicit gains or commit white-collar crimes. We will continue to work closely with our law enforcement agencies and regulator to safeguard Singapore’s hard-earned reputation and integrity as a global financial hub.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore With punishment meted out to the 10th and last offender, CNA's Lydia Lam ties together the multiple strands of an episode that has attracted global interest. The 10 people convicted in the billion-dollar money laundering case: (top, from left) Wang Baosen, Zhang Ruijin, Su Haijin, Wang Dehai, Lin Baoying; (bottom, from left) Su Jianfeng, Vang Shuiming, Chen Qingyuan, Su Wenqiang and Su Baolin. (Illustration: CNA/Rafa Estrada) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: On a sleepy Wednesday evening in mid-August 2023, nine men and one woman were charged in Singapore’s State Courts with various, seemingly nondescript financial crimes: Possessing criminal benefits, forging bank statements and laundering money. In the hours that followed, the story came to life via explosive headlines: The 10 suspects were part of an islandwide operation two years in the making ; all hailed from China and with a background of criminal activity, laying roots in Singapore and quietly running illegal gains through the country’s reputable financial system, to gain a veneer of legitimacy. Millions of dollars earned over the years from an illicit gambling ring - with Southeast Asian bases and aimed at punters in China - were turned into luxury cars, extravagant watches, properties in Singapore’s most lavish neighbourhoods, jewellery, designer goods, cryptocurrency and cold, hard cash. On Monday (Jun 10), the last of the 10 offenders was sentenced to jail . But there may yet be further developments involving others linked to the probe - including 17 suspects on the run, the wives or partners of the 10 and other fringe parties such as bank employees or real estate agents who failed to flag suspicious transactions. Here's a breakdown. Cambodian national Pleaded guilty to: 2 counts of money laundering Sentenced to: 13 months' jail Additional info: First to plead guilty, forfeited 100% of his assets (about S$6 million) Cypriot national Pleaded guilty to: 1 count of resisting arrest, 2 counts of money laundering Sentenced to: 14 months' jail Additional info: Former director of No Signboard Holdings, hospitalised for fractures sustained in jumping off balcony. Forfeited 95% in assets (more than S$165 million) Chinese national Pleaded guilty to: 2 counts of money laundering Sentenced to: 13 months' jail Additional info: Forfeited 100% in assets (about S$8 million) Cambodian national Pleaded guilty to: 2 counts of money laundering, 1 count of conspiring to make false representations Sentenced to: 14 months' jail Additional info: Forfeited 90% in assets (about S$65 million) Chinese national Pleaded guilty to: 2 counts of forgery, 1 count of money laundering Sentenced to: 15 months' jail Additional info: Lin Baoying's partner. Forfeited 90% in assets (about S$118 million) Turkish national Pleaded guilty to: 1 count of forgery, 2 counts of money laundering Sentenced to: 13 months and 6 weeks' jail Additional info: Had the highest number of total charges and assets seized, took out the most applications in his bid to get bail. Forfeited 90% in assets (about S$179 million) Cambodian national Pleaded guilty to: 1 count of forgery, 2 counts of money laundering Sentenced to: 15 months' jail Additional info: Forfeited 91% in assets (about S$21.3 million) Chinese national Pleaded guilty to: 2 counts of forgery, 1 count of money laundering Sentenced to: 15 months' jail Additional info: Forfeited 90% in assets (about S$154 million) Cypriot national Pleaded guilty to: 1 count of money laundering Sentenced to: 16 months' jail Additional info: Had among the longest stints working for the gambling syndicate. Forfeited about 90% in assets (about S$49.2 million) Vanuatu national Pleaded guilty to: 1 count of forgery, 1 count of money laundering Sentenced to: 17 months' jail Additional info: Forfeited about 95% in assets (about S$179 million) First hints of the case surfaced in 2021, with the police receiving dribs and drabs of information on forged bank documents. Suspicious transaction alerts were filed by financial institutions, and the police looked into these before building up an intelligence probe. The police also uncovered a web of links between the 10 offenders. For example, Zhang Ruijin and Lin Baoying were lovers and friends with Su Haijin, Su Baolin and the two Sus' wives. They had gone on holiday together as a large group. Even if not directly linked to each other, the offenders could be traced somehow to the criminal syndicate running illegal gambling centres in Southeast Asia. Su Jianfeng advertised the gambling websites and managed workers who ran and maintained them, while Su Baolin started out as a gambler before being roped into operating or supervising the websites. Wang Dehai - who was in the business for 10 years from 2012 - worked in customer service for the remote gambling enterprise before becoming a promoter. He was given a 3 per cent share in annual profits, with his total income in 2016 alone amounting to more than S$15 million. He recruited his cousin and co-accused Su Wenqiang into the business. After consulting with the Attorney-General's Chambers on the strength of its evidence, Singapore police eventually launched an islandwide operation in August last year. Over 400 officers were involved and the 10 offenders were arrested at either condominiums, landed properties or Good Class Bungalows in areas like Sentosa Cove, Tanglin, Orchard, Holland and River Valley. Despite some of the offenders initially stating they would claim trial, all 10 wound up pleading guilty. Their pleas were heard from April to June. They were sentenced to between 13 and 17 months' jail - with the last man Su Jianfeng receiving the heftiest term. Online commenters have suggested that the sentences seemed light for a case involving S$3 billion. But each individual case proceeded on different charges, with different amounts that often were low relative to the billion-dollar figure. For example, Wang Baosen faced eight charges in total but pleaded guilty to only charges of possessing almost S$600,000 in illegal proceeds in his wife's bank account, and for laundering S$1.48 million to buy a luxury apartment in Tomlinson Road. The other six charges were taken into consideration. He was given 13 months' jail, and this must be seen against the maximum penalties provided for the two charges proceeded against him. Under the relevant Section 55(2)a of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, the maximum penalties are a jail term of up to three years, a fine of up to S$150,000 or both. Why then did the prosecution not use charges with more amounts involved? As lawyer Tania Chin previously told CNA , the prosecution has discretion to proceed with appropriate charges based on the strength of the evidence they have obtained - which the public would not be privy to. She also noted that perceptions of the jail terms being inadequate could have arisen from the case being presented as reportedly Singapore's largest money laundering operation. Second Minister for Home Affairs Ms Josephine Teo said in parliament in October 2023 that the case was \"one of the largest anti-money laundering operations not just in Singapore, but likely the world\". All of them were remanded after being charged in August 2023, and were not allowed bail despite repeated attempts by some of them - especially Vang, who went all the way to the High Court in his bid - to be freed temporarily. Half of the group has since been deported after finishing their jail terms, after also taking into account a one-third remission for good behaviour. Su Baolin, Su Haijin, Su Wenqiang, Wang Baosen, Zhang Ruijin, Chen Qingyuan and Lin Baoying were all deported to Cambodia while Vang Shuiming was deported to Japan. They have also been barred from returning to Singapore. Law Minister K Shanmugam previously said in an interview that offenders who complete their sentences can be deported to wherever the passport they hold allows them to go. What about the wives, partners or children who relocated to Singapore with the 10 offenders? Based on affidavits produced in court, the known names of the wives and partners are: CNA sent queries to the relevant authorities that yielded no concrete answers. But CNA understands that some of the wives or partners of the convicts are still helping with investigations. CNA also understands that work pass or visit pass information about foreigners is confidential, and any foreigner in Singapore on a valid pass is free to come and go as they wish, subject to the terms of their passes. About S$1 billion worth of assets linked to the 10 offenders was seized. Of these, the offenders agreed to forfeit between 90 per cent and 100 per cent - totalling about S$944 million. Police have said that non-cash assets will be sold via channels such as auctions. Proceeds, along with forfeited cash, will go into Singapore's consolidated fund - akin to a bank account held by the government. The other S$2 billion or so seized assets that make up the S$3 billion figure comes from the aforementioned 17 suspects on the run and outside of Singapore's jurisdiction. For these seized assets, the police will maintain custody until they are dealt with by Singapore's courts at the close of each case. But what if the 17 manage to evade local authorities? According to a previous parliamentary reply by Mr Shanmugam, an investigation officer must report to the court within a year after criminal proceeds are seized or when the proceeds are no longer relevant for investigation or trial, whichever is earlier. If the seized proceeds are still relevant or if any court proceeding is pending, the court still cannot dispose of them. Scrutiny has turned to shell companies in Singapore as well as how banks here vet high-value clients. This was because several of the offenders gained entry into the country by setting up shell firms - often with their wives involved - to obtain work passes to legitimise their stay. Several of them were also handed charges for forging bank documents to explain away suspicious and large flows of money into their Singapore-based bank accounts. In October 2023, Second Minister For Finance And National Development Indranee Rajah announced a new inter-ministerial committee to review Singapore's anti-money laundering regime and to keep on top of increasingly sophisticated crimes. Separately, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), a statutory board under the Ministry of Finance that regulates business registration and financial reporting, is considering stricter rules linked to directorships and corporate filing. The authority has proposed a new Bill that would, among other moves, require all entities or people providing corporate secretarial services - that help set up a company in Singapore - to register with ACRA. Under this Bill, which was read for the first time in May, corporate service providers can face up to S$100,000 in fines each time they fail to meet anti-money laundering obligations. According to a Bloomberg report in June report, banks like Citi and DBS are also ramping up scrutiny of their wealthy customers and potential clients, to avoid exposure to illicit money flows. Private bankers at some institutions are also getting additional training to help them spot tricks used by criminals to mask the background and sources of funds. Bloomberg said Singapore authorities had recently completed on-site inspections of some banks involved in the S$3 billion money laundering probe. Lenders who had the most dealings with the offenders are expected to face penalties after the review concludes.

Workers' Party secretary-general Pritam Singh at a Committee of Privileges hearing on Dec 15, 2021. (Screengrab: Image/govsg) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The Peoples Action Party (PAP) will not seek the suspension of Pritam Singh as Member of Parliament (MP) while legal proceedings over his charges are ongoing. The Workers’ Party chief was handed two charges on Tuesday (Mar 19) for making false statements before a parliamentary committee that was looking into the conduct of his party’s former lawmaker Raeesah Khan , who lied in the House in 2021. In a media statement, PAP organising secretary Grace Fu said there have been queries about whether the party will, through its MPs, be seeking to suspend Singh given that he has been formally charged. PAP MPs will not be doing so, Ms Fu said, adding that the party will not comment on the merits of the case as it is now before the courts. \"This is in line with parliament’s resolution to defer any sanctions in respect of Mr Singh’s, Ms Sylvia Lim’s and Mr Faisal’s respective roles in the matter of former MP Raeesah Khan’s untruth, until after the conclusion of the investigations and criminal proceedings (if any) against Mr Singh,\" she said. Ms Khan admitted to lying in parliament in 2021 over a rape case that she had alleged was mishandled by the police. She was then referred to the Committee of Privileges for breach of parliamentary privilege. Several witnesses, including Singh and WP vice-chairman Faisal Manap, testified during the hearings that took place in late 2021 and early 2022. In its final report in February 2022, the Committee of Privileges recommended that Singh and Mr Faisal be referred to the public prosecutor for lying while testifying under oath. The public prosecutor later referred both cases to the police . Ms Fu also said that the PAP's decision not to seek Singh's suspension was consistent with its position in relation to a motion filed by Non-Constituency Member of Parliament Hazel Poa from the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) in September 2023. The PSP motion had called for then-Transport Minister S Iswaran to be suspended as MP, following his arrest and investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). This was later rejected , with parliament voting instead to consider the matter when corruption investigations against him concluded. Leader of the House Indranee Rajah said at the time that it would be \"premature\" for parliament to take any action against Iswaran, and that such situations should not be exploited for political ends. Both Singh and Mr Manap were under police investigation when the PSP motion was filed. Ms Indranee pointed out that they had not been suspended as MPs, and questioned if Ms Poa was calling for their suspension as well. Iswaran subsequently resigned from parliament and the PAP in January this year after CPIB gave him formal notice of the criminal charges filed against him . Following Pritam's charging on Tuesday, Ms Fu said: \"Parliament must deal rigorously with any MP who has committed wrongdoing, but suspending an MP is a serious action that must be done in accordance with due process of the law and natural justice. Parliament should not prejudge the outcome of the proceedings.\" In response to a query from CNA on Tuesday on whether PSP intends to file a similar motion calling for Singh's suspension, the party said that the circumstances in his case are different from those in Iswaran's. \"It is the PSP's stance that an MP or minister who is under investigation for corruption and suspended from official duties should be put on no pay leave until the investigation or criminal case is concluded,\" a PSP spokesperson said. \"If the MP or minister subsequently resumes their official duties after being cleared by the investigation or criminal case, they should be entitled to full back pay for the period during which they were on leave of absence. \"(Leader of the Opposition) Pritam Singh has neither been charged with corruption, nor has he been suspended from his official duties by the Workers' Party.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Parliament House in Singapore. (File photo: CNA/Syamil Sapari) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Members of Parliament will debate a law on Tuesday (Apr 2) that would retroactively validate tens of thousands of legal documents missing a statement that left them open to being challenged. A total of 87,000 digital Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) documents - certified between Nov 14, 2022 , and Jan 4, 2024 - did not explicitly state that they are deeds, as required by the current Mental Capacity Act. An LPA allows an appointed person to make medical and financial decisions on behalf of another individual should they lose mental capacity. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), which apologised for the omission on Mar 4, said the affected documents are still legally valid. The omission was discovered in October 2023 after MSF received feedback from a member of the public. Electronic LPAs certified on or after Jan 5, 2024, now include the required statement: “I intend this instrument to be a deed.” Nominated MP Usha Chandradas filed a question asking about the circumstances that led to the omission of that sentence, how MSF discovered the omission, if the ministry had assessed the potential loss or harm suffered by donees and doners, and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence. MP Tan Wu Meng (PAP-Jurong) asked why the omission had not been discovered sooner, if there were process checks such as proofreading or end-user experience validations when such key documentary processes are digitised, and if they were conducted by legally trained or laypersons. According to the parliament order paper released on Monday, questions were also submitted on the Ministry of Education’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons on the Israel-Hamas conflict . Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said in February that his ministry’s CCE lessons are not intended to be history lessons , nor are they meant to ascribe who is right or wrong, but are instead designed to help students reflect on how to safeguard cohesion and harmony in a multiracial society and to empathise with others. Mr Chan’s comments came after concerns arose online about what schools are teaching students about the conflict in Gaza, with some posts claiming that lessons only covered developments from the Hamas attack on Oct 7, without giving a historical context of the wider conflict between Israel and Palestine that dates back several decades. Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai (PSP) asked if and at which levels students are being taught about the Israel-Hamas conflict - either in the CCE curriculum or otherwise. He also wanted to know how the contents are differentiated among the various levels to take into account student maturity levels. Mr Chan had also noted that some teachers may feel conflicted that the CCE lessons may be against their personal beliefs, with some teachers experiencing abuse due to online uproar about the CCE lessons. NCMP Hazel Poa (PSP) submitted a question asking if content and materials of the CCE lessons on the Israel-Hamas conflict could be made public, and whether any teacher has declined to deliver a lesson. MP Sharael Taha (PAP-Pasir Ris-Punggol) asked how, in light of the CCE lessons, the Education Ministry can ensure a safe space for students to share diverse views and arrive at their own conclusions on complex issues. In January, CNA reported that while demand for professional help to quit smoking remains strong, the evasive habit of vaping is tripping up efforts by healthcare personnel to help smokers stub out for good. In March, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said they were monitoring the use of “energy stick” inhalers in Singapore on worries that, like vaping, the sticks could become a gateway to drug abuse. MP Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast) asked for an update on MOH’s anti-vaping efforts, the size of HSA’s vaping enforcement team and the number summons on vaping offences issued by the authorities in the last three years.

A person using a laptop at a desk. (File photo: iStock) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The cybersecurity of internal virtual meetings by foreign militaries that are outside the scope of the overseas events they are attending are typically not covered by the host country, Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How said on Tuesday (Apr 2). The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) take a proactive approach to cybersecurity when involved in high-signature events, such as those involving high-level foreign dignitaries, and work closely with event organisers who are accountable for overall cybersecurity, he said in parliament. MINDEF and SAF, however, do not cover the cybersecurity of foreign militaries’ internal unilateral virtual meetings, which are outside the scope of these events, noted Mr Heng. He was responding to a question by Member of Parliament (MP) Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) on measures to safeguard the security of communications lines in Singapore , after a recent incident where a private military conference call in a Singapore hotel was intercepted. A recording of a German military phone call was leaked in March , after one of the participants, who was attending the Singapore Airshow, dialled in via an \"unauthorised connection\" . Participants at international events and conferences, including those attended by military personnel and Government leaders and officials, do not as a rule expect the host country to provide secured means of communications. Even if a host country is to offer such means, it is questionable whether foreign participants are comfortable using it. Foreign guests who need to transmit sensitive information will typically arrange their own secured means. This is the practice of officials of the Ministry of Defence and Singapore Armed Forces when they attend meetings overseas. Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How said this in reply to an MP’s question in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). Proactive efforts leading up to an event include identifying its digital footprint and cybersecurity risk areas, scanning the vendor websites and checking the commercial systems and applications used for the event, and working out cybersecurity incident escalation and reporting processes, explained Mr Heng. Event organisers are required to resolve any vulnerabilities uncovered through these checks prior to the events, he added. Noting that his reply applied to all such events and does not refer to any particular incident, Mr Heng emphasised the difference between the type of communication lines used. He said that secure measures are implemented for “conferences and meetings that are organised by Singapore that are of a sensitive nature – government meetings, military meetings – where communications are sensitive”, and they differ from the open platforms used by the general public. “Participants to international events and conferences, including those attended by military personnel and government leaders and officials do not, as a rule, expect the host country to provide secured means of communications,” said Mr Heng. “Even if a host country is to offer such means, it is questionable whether foreign participants are comfortable using it.” He said that foreign guests who need to transmit sensitive information will typically arrange their own secured means, such as encryption hardware or software, commercial secured or embassy lines, and other security measures. “This is the practice of MINDEF and SAF officials when attending meetings overseas,” added Mr Heng.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore \"I have never accused anyone in this House of being divisive,\" said the Education Minister in response to PSP MP Leong Mun Wai's claim that he is \"always accused of being divisive\". Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing (left) and Progress Singapore Party's Leong Mun Wai debated in parliament on Apr 2, 2024, about making public the lesson materials on the Israel-Hamas conflict. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Progress Singapore Party's (PSP) Leong Mun Wai debated with Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing in parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2) as he called for the materials used in school lessons on the Israel-Hamas conflict to be made public. Mr Leong also said he and fellow PSP member Hazel Poa were \"always accused of being divisive\". But Mr Chan said he \"never accused anyone\" in the House of being divisive, adding: \"Please do not twist our words.\" The Education Ministry has been \"more than transparent\" on the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons that covered the Israel-Hamas conflict, Mr Chan said. \"We are not only prepared to show the parents the material, we’re prepared to explain to the parents how the materials are used, rather than to just give a deck of slides, which can be taken out of context,\" he said. The slides alone do not fully communicate how the Education Ministry teaches the subject, Mr Chan stressed. \"We welcome parents with concerns to come and see the teachers who will explain to them how the lesson is conducted. This is much better than just looking at a deck of slides without explanation.\" In Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2), Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said he had addressed the questions on the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lesson on the Israel-Hamas conflict during the Committee of Supply debate in March, and his response can be found on the website of the Ministry of Education (MOE). Replying to a supplementary question from NCMP Leong Mun Wai on the need for transparency, Mr Chan said MOE is “being more than transparent” - it is not only prepared to show the parents the material but is also prepared to explain to them how the material is used. He said MOE is going out of its way to assure parents on how the lessons are conducted. Mr Leong and Ms Poa had initially filed parliamentary questions on the Ministry of Education's (MOE) handling of the CCE lessons that covered the Israel-Hamas conflict. Mr Chan asked Mr Leong and Ms Poa to refer to his previous speech on the matter in March when he said that the classes would be further customised for different age groups of students, and that teachers would get more support. The opposition MP responded by questioning if it was \"justifiable\" not to release the slides that were used in the lessons. He also asked the government to commit to making all materials used for CCE lessons public “so that parents would know what has been taught to their children”. “I have actually made an effort to go to the bookstore and got a textbook for CCE for Primary 6 students. From the content of the textbook, you cannot imagine that a complex and controversial current issue like the Israel-Hamas conflict will be taught to our children,” he added. Concerns about what schools are teaching about the conflict in Gaza surfaced in February, with some online posts claiming that students were presented with a narrative that was not neutral or objective. It prompted the Education Minister to address the issue, explaining on Feb 25 that the CCE lessons on the Israel-Hamas conflict are designed to help students reflect on how to safeguard cohesion and harmony in a multiracial society. They are not intended to be history lessons nor are they meant to ascribe who is right or wrong, Mr Chan said, a point he reiterated in parliament on Mar 4. Mr Chan said on Tuesday that it would take Singapore time to reach a stage where it can respond to crises as one united country. \"But to do that, we have to first understand and appreciate that we are very different. We have different backgrounds, we have different perspectives. And while we may be different in our outlook and perspectives, we can all share the same goal to unite and not let others divide us,\" he added. Mr Leong said that the PSP is “not particularly against” any topics raised in CCE lessons, “as long as there is a defined process”. “Every time we raise questions that may not be in line with what the government wants, we are always accused of being divisive. In this case, Minister of Education just said that we are not being united. “But I think what we are trying to do here … from the response the minister has given to us on this issue, does it reflect enough transparency and also clarity on the process of how the materials are being decided?” Mr Chan replied: “Please do not twist our words. I have never accused anyone in this House of being divisive.” Instead, Mr Chan said he meant that there are differing views in Singapore's population, and CCE lessons are meant to help people understand and respect those differences. Ms Poa also asked how many schools have organised dialogue sessions since Mr Chan said in March that MOE would rather meet with parents or members of the public face-to-face and explain how the slides are used. So far, some schools have received such requests, although most schools have not. The ones that received requests have engaged parents on the matter, said the Education Minister. In March, Mr Chan said that the lesson material would be further simplified for younger students, focusing on sensitising them to the plight of innocent victims, while older students will be taught to be more discerning of different sources of information. For the “most mature” students, lesson materials will be updated based on more recent events to help them better understand Singapore’s national interest, Mr Chan said last month.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore The initial list of non-taxable fees will be published in the Gazette in end-April when the Bill comes into force, says Transport Minister and Second Minister for Finance Chee Hong Tat. (Photo: iStock) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The government will prescribe a list of regulatory fees where the Goods and Services Tax (GST) should not be charged after parliament passed a Bill on Tuesday (Apr 2). The GST (Amendment) Bill will provide greater clarity on the tax treatment for government fees and address the issue of GST being wrongly levied on 18 fees paid to six government agencies, said Transport Minister and Second Minister for Finance Chee Hong Tat as he tabled the Bill for a second reading. The erroneous GST charges were first made known in February by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) following an internal review. The government has said it will make at least S$7.5 million (US$5.6 million) in refunds to affected individuals and businesses. GST is generally levied on government services. These include, for example, fees for the use of public sports facilities or the rental of hawker stalls. Doing so ensures parity in tax treatment where services that can potentially be provided by or outsourced to the private or non-government sector are subject to GST, said Mr Chee. However, GST should not be charged for services that are regulatory in nature, or done for the purposes of control and regulation. The Government will centrally prescribe a list of its non-taxable fees to provide greater clarity and certainty to everyone. Fees in the non-taxable list would include those for applications to approve a regulated activity. For example, applications for professional licences and their licence renewal fees will be non-taxable, and would include the 18 regulatory fees that the Government is refunding. All other fees that are not part of this list will be subject to the Goods and Services Tax (GST). As part of this change in legislative approach, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore will work closely with agencies to assess their fees instead of allowing self-assessment by agencies. MOF had reviewed all the regulatory and ancillary fees that currently charged GST and announced in February the refund of GST on 18 fees where GST was wrongly charged. It is now working with agencies on the remaining regulatory and ancillary fees which do not charge GST. There are more than 1,700 such Government fees which MOF is reviewing. If Parliament approves the Bill, the initial list of non-taxable fees will be published in the Gazette in end-April, when the Bill comes into force. MOF will continue to work with agencies to progressively prescribe their regulatory fees in the non-taxable list and aims to complete this by September this year. All fees that are not prescribed in the non-taxable list will be subject to GST. Second Minister for Finance Chee Hong Tat announced this in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). He pointed out that there are three categories of such fees. The first category, which involves the vast majority of fees, relates to services provided by the Government which are clearly and already charged with GST today. The second category comprises fees that are charged with GST today, but where there has been inconsistency in the interpretation of the law by agencies. For example, agencies may charge fees for examinations that an individual must undertake prior to being licensed as a practising professional in a regulated industry. Such examination fees should attract GST. For agencies that have been charging GST on such fees, the Government will validate these past GST collections. The third category is fees that are not charged GST but should be charged with GST. These include more than a hundred examination and inspection-related fees. Mr Chee said the Government will help to minimise the impact on the public by absorbing the GST in the first instance and imposing a freeze on these fees until end-2025. Hence, all affected fees will not increase immediately. Mr Chee said MOF will work closely with the agencies to review whether the fees can be reduced or even removed. If there are unavoidable cost increases, then the agencies would have to raise their fees. But they will do so only after end-2025 and will ensure that any increases are phased in gradually, taking into consideration the impact on affected stakeholders. Mr Chee told the House that the Government is proposing a clearer and more robust approach - one that ensures the correct GST treatment on Government fees by centralising the assessment and making clear the list of non-taxable fees via legislation. The 18 fees that were found to have been wrongly taxed comprised application fees for professional licences like a real estate agent licence, registering a Lasting Power of Attorney and administrative fees for renting out public flats. As most of them are for the processing of applications, rather than licence fees, agencies had wrongly deemed them to be taxable, authorities had said previously. At the moment, government agencies get to assess and determine what constitutes a regulatory fee, based on guidance provided through government circulars. But agencies “may not always be clear where to draw the line”, said Mr Chee. “This is not ideal and can give rise to wrongful charging of GST, as was the case for the 18 fees.” With the Bill, the government will prescribe a list of non-taxable government fees, such as those paid for applications of professional licences and licence renewal fees. The list will also include the 18 regulatory fees that are being refunded. In line with the change in legislative approach, the MOF and the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore will work closely with agencies to assess their fees, instead of allowing self-assessment by the agencies. Mr Chee said the initial list of non-taxable fees will be published in the Gazette in end-April when the Bill comes into force. He added that the MOF had earlier reviewed all the regulatory and ancillary fees that currently charge GST and is now working with agencies to review the remaining “more than 1,700” fees that do not charge GST. “MOF will continue to work with agencies to progressively prescribe their regulatory fees in the non-taxable list, and we aim to complete this by September,” Mr Chee told the House. Mr Chee laid out the categories of government fees that will be subject to GST. The first, which makes up the vast majority, comprises fees paid for services provided by the government. Examples include the rental of public sports facilities, which are already levied with GST currently. “There is no change in the treatment of these fees,” he said. Another category includes fees that are not charged with GST now but should be taxed moving forward based on the government’s “clarified policy intent”. These include fees for examinations that individuals must take before being issued a licence, which some agencies are currently not charging GST. Other examples include inspection fees prior to the licensing and conduct of certain business operations. Overall, it is estimated that there are “more than 100” of such examination and inspection-related fees. Mr Chee said the government will help to “minimise the impact” by absorbing the GST on these fees in the first instance and impose a freeze on these fees until end-2025. MOF has also “separately asked the agencies involved to review their fees and charges, and to consider ways where they can streamline processes or reduce costs”. “We will work closely with agencies on this to review if the above-mentioned fees may be reduced or even removed,” the minister said. “If there are unavoidable cost increases, then agencies would have to raise their fees. But they will do so only after end-2025 and will ensure that any increases are phased in gradually, taking into consideration the impact on affected stakeholders.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

An LPA allows a donee, or an appointed person, to make medical and financial decisions on behalf of a donor, should they lose mental capacity. (Photo: iStock/DragonImages) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) is unaware of any harm arising as a result of a legal lapse involving electronic Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA) forms , which went undetected for nearly a year. The lapse occurred even though the form was approved for deployment by MSF through an “internal proofreading and vetting process”, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua said in parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). A Bill was passed in parliament on Tuesday to retroactively validate these LPAs and remove any uncertainty about their validity. About 87,000 electronic LPA documents were found to be lacking a required statement that could leave them open to a potential legal challenge, MSF announced last month . The affected donors do not need to remake their LPAs, and no action is required by members of public, the ministry said at the time. LPA documents made through the hardcopy process are not affected. An LPA allows an appointed person, or donees, to make medical and financial decisions on behalf of another individual should they lose mental capacity. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Mr Chua said MSF is \"not aware of any actual harm suffered by donees or donors\". Many of those who made LPAs continue to have mental capacity, so their donees do not need to act on their behalf yet, he added. “It is possible that some donees have begun to exercise the powers in some of the affected electronic LPAs, but we are not aware of any challenge to the exercise of those powers by third parties,” he said. The electronic LPA forms were prepared by the staff of the Office of the Public Guardian, which is an agency under MSF that is responsible for safeguarding the interests of individuals who lack the mental capacity to make decisions for themselves. The forms were then vetted by the Public Guardian, as well as by a separate legal unit. “Unfortunately, no system of process checks can be 100 per cent accurate, as this case shows,” said Mr Chua. He added that the electronic LPA forms go through various parties, including certificate issuers who are familiar with the hardcopy forms, such as lawyers or doctors. “Despite this, it took nearly a year before a member of the public noticed the difference and wrote in to enquire.” The Mental Capacity Act lays out that an electronic LPA must clearly state that it is intended to be a deed by the donor. Even though the significance and effect of an LPA are clearly explained in the electronic document, the affected electronic LPA documents – certified from Nov 14, 2022 to Jan 4, 2024 – did not expressly state that it is a deed, said MSF in March. On Tuesday, Mr Chua apologised again for the omission and for any inconvenience caused, noting that the electronic LPAs were revised to include this statement from Jan 5. During the debate on the bill, Members of Parliament (MPs) Don Wee (PAP-Chua Chu Kang) and Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) asked if affected donors would be informed that their LPAs are valid. Since no action is required by the donors with the passing of the Bill, MSF will not be sending individual notices, said Mr Chua in his response. Instead, a note will be affixed to the registration page of affected electronic LPAs to point to the retroactive validating provision when the Bill comes into effect, he said. Mr Wee also asked for an update on the overall LPA take-up rates. Mr Chua said that close to 210,000 Singaporeans aged 50 and above have made an LPA. In Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2), a Bill was moved to provide for retroactive validation of Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs) which were affected by a missing statement. The electronic LPA form, unlike the hardcopy form, did not contain the required statement “signed (or marked) and delivered as a deed by Donor”. For approximately 87,000 electronic LPAs made between 14 November 2022 and 4 January 2024, this raised uncertainty as to whether they were validly made. The Bill assures affected donors that they will not have to remake their LPAs and removes any future potential complications. Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua told the House that to date, his ministry was not aware of any actual harm suffered by donees or donors. Since 5 January 2024, the electronic LPA had been revised to include the necessary statement. Mr Chua also spoke about the process by which the electronic LPA form had been approved. He said the Ministry of Social and Family Development had an internal proofreading and vetting process. The form was prepared by staff of the Office of the Public Guardian and vetted by the Public Guardian as well as a separate Legal Unit. Apologising for the omission, he said that “unfortunately, no system of process checks can be 100 per cent accurate,\" as this case shows.

SINGAPORE: Road safety and penalties under the Road Traffic Act will be discussed at the next parliament sitting following public concern in light of several recent multi-vehicle accidents, including the incident in Tampines that killed two . Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee that oversees transport, Saktiandi Supaat has raised several parliamentary questions to the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). Among them is whether the authorities will consider stricter enforcement measures or legislative changes to “ensure greater accountability” and discourage dangerous driving. Parliament will next sit on May 7. Mr Saktiandi said in a Facebook post on Wednesday (Apr 24) that he has received feedback from residents expressing concerns about road safety, both generally and specifically in the Toa Payoh area. There is also growing concern about the adequacy of existing penalties for reckless driving, said the Member of Parliament of Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC. “There have been a number of multi-vehicle accidents lately but the recent cases in Tampines and on the PIE (Pan Island Expressway) on Apr 22 have deeply affected those involved and the wider Singaporean community.\" Two people, a 17-year-old student at Temasek Junior College and a 57-year-old woman, were killed following the accident in Tampines on Monday morning. The incident involved four cars, a van and a minibus. Six other people were taken to hospital, including a 42-year-old car driver who was eventually arrested . Later that same day, six people were taken to hospital after an accident along the PIE involving six cars and a taxi. Among the injured was a seven-year-old. “My heartfelt condolences go out to the families who have lost loved ones and are injured in these tragic incidents. It is truly saddening to hear of innocent lives being lost and the unnecessary pain and injury caused due to reckless actions by individuals,” wrote Mr Saktiandi. “I strongly believe that meaningful changes must be made to minimise such accidents, whether through revisiting and enhancing current mitigating measures or implementing stricter enforcement to deter dangerous behavior and protect law-abiding motorists and pedestrians alike.” Mr Saktiandi has asked the Minister for Home Affairs about the number of fatal accidents over the past five years and how many were due to reckless driving and speeding. He has also asked about whether there is a need to review the existing penalties under the Road Traffic Act and whether the ministry and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will consider stricter enforcement measures or legislative changes to ensure greater accountability and discourage dangerous driving. He has also filed a question asking whether there are plans to intensify campaigns or programmes in educating drivers on speeding and reckless driving and increase road safety awareness. In his parliamentary questions to the Minister for Transport, in light of the fatal accident in Tampines, Mr Saktiandi asked how can LTA deter the occurrence of similar accidents in high-traffic areas and how can driver awareness and education on road safety be enhanced, particularly on speeding and reckless driving. Mr Saktiandi also asked how can LTA minimise accident risks in future through road design and traffic management and whether there are plans to enhance data collection and analysis to better address current and future road safety challenges.

File photo of Parliament House in Singapore. (Photo: CNA/Syamil Sapari) SINGAPORE: Road safety and penalties for reckless driving will be in focus at the next parliament sitting on Tuesday (May 7), with more than 10 questions filed on the matter. The move to require all employers to have a process for workers to request for flexible work arrangements will also be discussed, ahead of tripartite guidelines coming into effect this December. The parliamentary questions on road safety follow public concern in light of several recent multi-vehicle accidents , including the one in Tampines that killed two people . A 17-year-old Temasek Junior College student and a 57-year-old pest control company employee died in the accident at the junction of Tampines Avenue 1 and Avenue 4 on Apr 22. A 42-year-old Saab driver was charged with four offences related to the incident. Muhammad Syafie Ismail faces one count each of dangerous driving causing death, dangerous driving causing hurt, dangerous driving, and failing to stop after an accident. All fall under the Road Traffic Act. Mr Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa-Payoh) asked how the Land Transport Authority (LTA) can deter the occurrence of similar accidents in high-traffic areas and how accident risks can be minimised in future through road design and traffic management. He also asked how many fatal accidents have occurred due to reckless driving and speeding over the past five years and whether there is a need to review existing penalties under the Road Traffic Act. Mr Saktiandi, who is also chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee that oversees transport, also wanted to know if the Ministry of Home Affairs and LTA will consider stricter enforcement measures or legislative changes to ensure greater accountability and discourage dangerous driving. Mr Desmond Choo (PAP-Tampines) asked if there is a need to raise the relevant penalties under the Road Traffic Act in view of the recent spate of fatal road traffic accidents. On road safety education, Ms Joan Pereira (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) asked if the government will consider requiring all drivers to attend periodic refresher courses while Mr Patrick Tay (PAP-Pioneer) wanted to know what measures are being taken to improve road safety education for both new and experienced drivers. In a question for written answer, Ms He Ting Ru (WP-Sengkang) asked about the number of times that enforcement action was taken in the last five years against drivers who do not slow down sufficiently when approaching a pedestrian crossing. Members of Parliament also wanted to know if companies and workers would be receiving support following the launch of guidelines requiring all employers to have a process in place for workers to formally request for flexible work arrangements. The new tripartite guidelines, which take effect from December, state that employers should communicate their decision within two months of a request for flexible work arrangements. While employers have the right to reject such requests, the decision should be backed up by reasonable business grounds such as cost or productivity considerations. The guidelines also set out what are deemed unreasonable grounds for rejecting requests. Mr Edward Chia (PAP-Holland-Bukit Timah) asked if initiatives are being planned to support small- and medium-sized enterprises in offering this arrangement to their employees. He also asked the Minister for Manpower what additional measures are being considered to support Singaporean workers from potential job displacement, if their employers offer both flexible work arrangements and remote work. This question was asked in view of the increasing trend of companies hiring workers located overseas. Ms Cheryl Chan (PAP-East Coast) asked about the likely impact this move would have on senior professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) aged 45 and above. She also wanted to know which sectors may be more affected by the implementation of the guidelines, as well as the positive impact the adoption of the guidelines will have on the Singapore economy. Other questions raised include queries on embattled cord blood bank Cordlife, youth vaping, the data security breach of Mobile Guardian as well as whether there are any plans to implement additional measures for schools in light of the recent high temperatures and UV index. Two Bills are also scheduled for second reading. The Cybersecurity (Amendment) Bill and the Transport Sector (Critical Firms) Bill .

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore There was a net increase of 64,800 holders of work permits and other work passes in sectors such as construction last year. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The bulk of the increase in foreign employment last year was in jobs that do not \"typically\" fall under the types Singaporeans want to do, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said in parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). Dr Tan also urged against drawing divides as well as viewing resident and foreign employment as a \"zero-sum game\". The minister was responding to a question by MP Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied) on how the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will ensure that the bulk of new jobs created this year will go to Singapore citizens and residents. Last year, employment in Singapore grew by 88,400, with 83,500 of those jobs going to non-residents. The fundamental objective of the Government’s approach is to strike a balance between ensuring that businesses have access to skills and manpower to grow and succeed, while creating opportunities for local workers to grow and progress, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng. Replying to an MP’s question in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2), he said this approach has helped locals to secure good jobs. Between 2013 and 2023, the number of resident Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs) increased by 380,000 and the number of Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass holders increased by 50,000. In growth sectors such as finance, infocomm and professional services, resident PMETs increased by 190,000 and the number of EP and S Pass holders climbed by 20,000. Dr Tan said more importantly, over the decade, resident income also increased - by 21.6 per cent in real terms. He cautioned against viewing residents and foreigners as a “zero-sum game” and continuing to draw divides. Dr Tan said thriving businesses with access to complementary foreign talent will not only lead to more job creation but also improve overall wage outcomes as businesses expand and improve their productivity. “By growing our economic pie, we will be better able to secure positive outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans,” he said. Dr Tan said Mr Giam \"seems to be under the misconception that a net increase in foreign employment means that jobs are not going to Singaporeans\". \"If that is so, then that view is fundamentally misguided.\" Of the 83,500 new jobs that went to non-residents in 2023, the bulk was due to an increase in the number of work permit and other work pass holders in sectors such as construction. That made up 64,800, or more than 77 per cent of the employment growth. \"These are not typically the type of jobs that Singaporeans want to do.\" The rest of the increase in non-resident employment - around 18,700 - was for Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass holders, which are for higher-skilled workers. The increase in resident employment stood at 4,900, although Mr Giam pointed out that Dr Tan did not provide a breakdown of whether these jobs were for professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) or not. \"The growth last year in EP and S Pass holders exceeded growth in resident employment as ... non-resident PMET employment is still recovering from the pandemic,\" the minister said. Resident employment has increased every year since 2019 as the government worked to protect jobs during the pandemic, but the number of EP and S Pass holders at the end of last year had not recovered to the level seen before COVID-19 hit. \"The larger proportion of growth attributed to EP and S Pass holders last year did not affect PMET resident employment at all,\" said Dr Tan. He noted that there is a global shortage of skilled talent, and that cities around the world are competing for investments and for human capital. \"To stay competitive and to nurture a vibrant corporate ecosystem, we need to ensure that our businesses can access talent and they can expand,\" he said. As for jobs for residents, MOM said that Singapore is close to full employment. The resident employment rate was 66.2 per cent in 2023, which is among the highest rates among advanced economies. The resident unemployment rate and long-term unemployment rate were also low, at 2.7 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively. Between 2013 and 2023, the number of resident PMETs grew far more than the number of EP and S Pass holders, the minister said. Specifically, in growth sectors such as finance, infocomm and professional services, resident PMETs increased by 190,000, while the number of EP and S Pass holders grew by 20,000. Dr Tan pointed out that MOM regularly updates the qualifying salaries for EPs and S Passes to ensure that the holders are of high-quality and maintain a level playing field for locals. The ministry's Complementarity Assessment Framework also evaluates EP candidates \"holistically\", including individual and firm-related attributes. \"This ensures that employers bring in the right profile of foreign workers to complement our local workforce.\" When thriving businesses have access to \"complementary foreign talent\", more jobs can be created and wage outcomes can be improved. \"By growing our economic pie, we will be better able to secure positive outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore The intent is not to penalise those who give away SIM cards for legitimate purposes, such as those who register SIM cards in their names for family members' use, says Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo. SIM cards. (File photo: iStock) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A new law was passed in parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2) that will allow authorities to target three groups of people who misuse local SIM cards to facilitate scams. The three categories listed in the Law Enforcement and Other Matters Bill are \"irresponsible subscribers\", middlemen who procure or provide SIM cards to scammers and errant retailers who use stolen or false credentials to register SIM cards which are sold to scammers. Police have faced difficulties in prosecuting the first two groups because they needed to prove knowledge or criminal intent, but the new law means a person could be liable in certain scenarios, without the prosecution having to prove so, said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo. But the intent is not to penalise those who give away SIM cards for legitimate purposes, she said, citing the example of people who register SIM cards in their names for family members' use. Most retailers also do not need to be concerned, said Mrs Teo, who is also Minister for Communications and Information. “Every SIM card in the hands of a scammer is a weapon,” said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). She elaborated on how scammers have pivoted to using local SIM cards to reach prospective victims after being thwarted by measures such as blocking overseas calls that spoof local numbers and introducing the SMS Sender ID Registry. So, new offences are being introduced to target three groups of people who misuse local SIM cards to facilitate scams. The first group is irresponsible subscribers who give away their local SIM cards or provide their particulars to others to be used to sign up for local SIM cards. To address the challenge that the police face in proving knowledge or criminal intent, an irresponsible subscriber will be deemed liable in the following scenarios - they gave away their card for any gain, did not take reasonable steps to find out the identity and physical location of the recipient, or did not take reasonable steps to find out the recipient’s purpose for obtaining the card. The second group is middlemen involved in procuring or providing local SIM cards to scam syndicates. The police have also faced difficulties prosecuting such middlemen as it is hard to prove that they intended to abet an offence. A person who receives, supplies or possesses such local SIM cards may now be deemed liable without the prosecution having to prove knowledge or criminal intent if the cards were used for crime, or 11 or more cards were found in their possession. Criminal intent will also not have to be proven in cases of people buying, selling or renting a local SIM card registered with another person’s particulars. The third group is errant retailers, a small number of whom have used stolen or false credentials to register local SIM cards, which are then sold to scammers. There is currently no offence that specifically deals with such retailers and they might simply lose their contract with the mobile service provider. Making it a criminal offence will allow heavier punishment, including prison sentences, for employees involved in fraudulent registrations. The penalties for the new SIM card offences will be pegged to those for the misuse of Singpass credentials under the Computer Misuse Act. Changes to the law will also be made to allow the transmission of false messages for certain legitimate purposes, such as simulated phishing exercises to enhance awareness and vigilance against scams. Mrs Teo outlined other amendments being proposed. One is to allow the police to apprehend, not arrest, a person with a mental health condition who poses a danger to themselves or others, to take them for medical treatment - even if the timeframe of the danger is unspecified or not imminent. Another enables the police to not take further action for non-arrestable offences if the case is not serious or there are insufficient grounds to proceed. Irresponsible subscribers or registrants are people who give away their SIM cards or let other people use their particulars to sign up for SIM cards. \"Often, they do so to earn a quick buck,\" said Mrs Teo. Current laws require the police to prove that the irresponsible subscribers knowingly gave away their SIM cards for unlawful purposes. With the new law, a person will be liable if they give away a SIM card registered with their particulars or allow their particulars to be used to sign up for one, despite knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that the SIM card would be used for unlawful purposes. Subscribers will also be liable if they give away a SIM card for any gain, did not take reasonable steps to find out the identity and location of the recipient or did not take reasonable steps to find out why the recipient wanted a local SIM card. Offenders can be fined up to S$10,000 (US$7,390), jailed for up to three years or both. The second group targeted by the new law is middlemen who receive or possess local SIM cards with the intent to use or supply them for unlawful purposes. Those who supply SIM cards knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that they would be used for unlawful purposes will also be liable for offences. Prosecutors will not have to prove knowledge or criminal intent if the local SIM cards were used for crime, or if 11 or more local SIM cards were found in the possession of the middleman. They also do not need to prove criminal intent for people who buy, sell or rent a local SIM card registered with another person's particulars. The third group is errant retailers. Mobile service providers are required to implement measures to prevent fraudulent registration of SIM cards. These measures include verifying the identity of subscribers by checking their original IDs and scanning IDs instead of manually keying in the subscribers' particulars. A number of retailers have used stolen or false credentials to register SIM cards, which they then sell to scammers. A study of about 1,400 local SIM cards used in scams in the second half of last year found that 65 per cent of such SIM cards were sold by nine retailers. \"Such errant retailers should be held accountable. Not only do they tarnish the reputation of their peers, their actions cause many victims to suffer losses,\" said Mrs Teo. Offenders who receive, supply and possess local SIM cards or facilitate fraudulent registration of local SIM cards can be fined up to S$10,000, jailed for up to three years, or both, for a first offence. For second or subsequent offences, the penalty may be a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to five years, or both. Corporations and unincorporated associations such as partnerships and societies can be fined up to twice the maximum amount for individuals. Member of Parliament (MP) Desmond Choo (PAP-Tampines) asked whether the Ministry of Home Affairs was working with online platforms, such as Telegram, where local SIM cards are bought and sold. In response, Mrs Teo said the police have been working with such platforms to take down accounts involved in scams and other crimes. However, it is currently not a crime to buy or sell second-hand SIM cards, so there are no legal grounds to request such platforms to take down accounts involved in the sales of SIM cards. \"Once the new offences come into force, and the second-hand sale of local SIM cards becomes illegal, we will consider issuing directions under the Online Criminal Harms Act to the platforms to require them to restrict access to accounts involved,\" she said. In Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2), Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo responded to clarifications sought by Members of the House on the Law Enforcement and Other Matters Bill. The Bill was then passed. MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) raised concerns about a possible scenario where an elderly person's particulars are misused by family members or caregivers. Mrs Teo said the elderly person would not be liable for an offence if the police find that he or she has no reasonable grounds to believe that their particulars would be used to register for SIM cards. \"The police recognise that there are indeed situations where elderly might have been tricked into sharing their particulars,\" she said. \"The police will investigate such cases comprehensively and consider any credible evidence that the elderly person was unaware about how his particulars would be used.\" The minister also spoke about how Yellow Ribbon Singapore's symbols - which are registered trademarks used to galvanise society to support the reintegration of ex-offenders - have been misused by individuals selling merchandise or going door-to-door asking for donations, under the guise of supporting ex-offenders. Under the new law, the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises Act will be amended to give Yellow Ribbon Singapore the exclusive rights to use its symbols. Those who misuse the symbols can be fined up to S$10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both. In the case of a continuing offence, the offender could be fined up to S$250 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore The amendments are \"scoped within a very specific circumstance of a psychiatric emergency and only where there is a patent risk of suicide\", says an NMP who is a psychiatrist. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The police will have more powers to apprehend people with mental disorders who are deemed a safety risk to themselves or others, after amendments to the law were passed in parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). During an almost three-hour long debate, Members of Parliament (MPs) raised several concerns about the proposed changes in the Law Enforcement and Other Matters Bill, such as the stigma towards mental illness being further perpetuated as a result of the amendments. However, Nominated MP Dr Syed Harun Alhabsyi, who is a psychiatrist and honorary secretary of the Singapore Psychiatric Association, noted that the Bill was \"scoped within a very specific circumstance of a psychiatric emergency and only where there is a patent risk of suicide\". Dr Syed shared that he had personally dealt with psychiatric emergencies in his work. “Where suicide risk assessment, even for psychiatrists, is not a perfect science, my view is that it is fair and appropriate for police officers to exercise reasonable judgement without waiting for a suicide to be imminently clear or after such attempt at lethal harm has been actualised,” he said. MPs suggested further measures to strengthen the framework in handling cases involving those who are mentally unwell, including adequately training officers to deal with such situations and engaging mental health professionals in the process. The Law Enforcement and Other Matters Bill gives some latitude for police officers to act with some urgency before a suicide attempt becomes imminent and before rescue could be more risky - both for the person who is under duress and for those who are trying to make a genuine attempt at rescue, said NMP Syed Harun Alhabsyi. Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2), he hopes the Government will look into three areas. Firstly, ensure that there is structured training for police officers in apprehending those who are attempting suicide. Secondly, ensure access to psychiatric evaluation and assessment without delay after the person has been apprehended. Thirdly, work more closely with mental health professionals in crisis work, such as having combined teams of law enforcement and mental health practitioners as collaborative first respondents. One change to the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act (MHCTA) allows police to apprehend those with mental health conditions who pose a danger to themselves or others, and take them for medical treatment. Under the Act, police can apprehend such individuals, as opposed to arresting them, bringing them to seek help and not a lock-up. The High Court had, in a previous ruling, determined that apprehensions are distinct from arrests under the Criminal Procedure Code, said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo in parliament. “This means that police officers do not have certain powers associated with arrest, which are essential when making apprehensions,” she said. “In particular, the High Court determined that the police do not have powers of search and seizure to ensure that the person is not hiding dangerous weapons or items.” This presents a problem as the police would be expected to hand over the person to the staff of the medical facility only after ensuring he or she was not in possession of weapons, said Mrs Teo. Another change amends the Police Force Act to make clear that relevant powers, such as those of search and seizure, are available to the police when making apprehensions, whether under the MHCTA or any other Acts. “This does not mean that the person will be needlessly roughed up. On the contrary, having assessed that the person may be suffering from mental health conditions, police officers are minded to carry out search and seizure with due care and respect,” noted Mrs Teo. “Every SIM card in the hands of a scammer is a weapon,” said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). She elaborated on how scammers have pivoted to using local SIM cards to reach prospective victims after being thwarted by measures such as blocking overseas calls that spoof local numbers and introducing the SMS Sender ID Registry.

A person who receives, supplies or possesses such local SIM cards may now be deemed liable without the prosecution having to prove knowledge or criminal intent if the cards were used for crime, or 11 or more cards were found in their possession. Criminal intent will also not have to be proven in cases of people buying, selling or renting a local SIM card registered with another person’s particulars. The third group is errant retailers, a small number of whom have used stolen or false credentials to register local SIM cards, which are then sold to scammers. There is currently no offence that specifically deals with such retailers and they might simply lose their contract with the mobile service provider. Making it a criminal offence will allow heavier punishment, including prison sentences, for employees involved in fraudulent registrations. The penalties for the new SIM card offences will be pegged to those for the misuse of Singpass credentials under the Computer Misuse Act. Changes to the law will also be made to allow the transmission of false messages for certain legitimate purposes, such as simulated phishing exercises to enhance awareness and vigilance against scams. Mrs Teo outlined other amendments being proposed. One is to allow the police to apprehend, not arrest, a person with a mental health condition who poses a danger to themselves or others, to take them for medical treatment - even if the timeframe of the danger is unspecified or not imminent. Another enables the police to not take further action for non-arrestable offences if the case is not serious or there are insufficient grounds to proceed. Dr Syed noted that when someone is on the brink of suicide and facing immense despair, the police and other Home Team officers remain their \"last hope for rescue\". \"Time is of the essence, and where reasonable grounds are sufficiently present to suggest a potential threat to self or others, my view is that apprehension may be necessary to save a life under such circumstances,\" he added. The authorities need to ensure the individual gets access to psychiatric evaluation and assessment without delay after the apprehension, he added. Dr Syed also called for police officers to undergo structured training in the apprehension of attempted suicide cases, coupled with input from care professionals and specialists in the field. “Such structured training would also be important to ensure that while there is some latitude and range for judgement by police officers on the ground, the exercise of such powers of apprehension continues to be done with propriety, with confidence and with safety in mind,” he said. His calls for training for frontline officers were echoed by MP Yeo Wan Ling (PAP-Pasir Ris-Punggol), who said such training to be made mandatory for \"all enforcers\", including full-time national servicemen. This should be conducted in a \"timely and frequent manner\", she added. MP Edward Chia (PAP-Holland-Bukit Timah) noted that police officers, often the first responders to incidents involving individuals in mental health crises, could also be subject to a significant emotional toll. Acknowledging the role of the Police Psychological Services Department, Mr Chia asked what more can be done for officers’ mental well-being. “It is crucial to provide the police with comprehensive knowledge and training on how to handle individuals with mental health issues,” said NMP Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim. “This includes understanding the signs of a mental health crisis, developing specialised responses and learning how to de-escalate situations effectively.” Some MPs also called for the police to collaborate with mental health professionals when attending to such cases. “While I recognise the importance of this measure in protecting the public, it is essential to consider the potential drawbacks. Police are not mental health professionals, and their interactions with individuals experiencing mental health crises can be complex and challenging,” Associate Professor Razwana said. There are also concerns about an over-reliance on the police in cases of mental health crises, said MP Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon). “One alternative that has been raised is that mental health professionals should lead the emergency response in such cases, where possible. This is already done in several cities,” he said. He cited the example of the city of Eugene, Oregon, where crisis counsellors from a community programme receive hundreds of hours of training, and send responders to 3 per cent to 8 per cent of police cases. What specific challenges have law enforcement officers faced in dealing with people with mental health conditions that warrant a lowering of the threshold for apprehension? MP He Ting Ru asked this question in Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2). She raised several concerns. First, lowering the threshold from “reasonably imminent risk” to “reasonable likelihood that danger to life or personal safety may occur” would lead to different standards being applied to those with mental health conditions or illness, which would be discriminatory under United Nations guidelines. Second, whether any timeframes of “reasonable risk” would be applied and if so, what they are. Third, under what circumstances background checks for a history of mental disorder will be carried out and what records will be referred to. Fourth, what safeguards, guidelines or training will be available to police officers. Finally, what options are available to those who believe they were erroneously detained or subjected to excessive force or trauma. Ms He said she was worried about the amendments unnecessarily perpetuating stigma against people with mental health conditions. She also questioned if the police are best placed to respond to such situations. She noted that in recent years, many countries have taken steps to implement alternative strategies to provide support and de-escalate incidents. She suggested expanding the Crisis Response Team to respond not only to cases involving the risk of suicide but also to people experiencing mental health crises more generally. This could also help reduce the strain on the police, she said. MP He Ting Ru (WP-Sengkang) also brought up overseas examples of professionals working with the police to handle such cases. In 2017, Sweden introduced a psychiatric emergency response team, comprising an ambulance with two mental health nurses and one paramedic, to attend to mental health crises, she shared. Another approach is the United Kingdom’s street triage model, a partnership between the police and approved mental health professionals to advise and support those experiencing mental health crises. Noting that the Institute of Mental Health has partnered with the Singapore Police Force to pilot a Crisis Response Team to care for and support those with suicidal tendencies, Ms He asked if the initiative will be expanded even further. MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) said: “Clear guidelines are critical to prevent potential power abuses and ensure effective collaboration with mental health professionals. “While traditional training methods have value, equipping police with real-world case studies, hands-on experience, and access to mental health experts is vital.” The issue of stigma towards the topic of mental health was also a point of concern for MPs. MP Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah (PAP-Jalan Besar) said that through his dialogues with mental health advocates, they had raised concerns and sought to understand the Bill better. “There is an apprehension that, without careful implementation, these amendments could inadvertently contribute to the stigma surrounding mental health or lead to discrimination,” he said. In her wrap-up speech, Mrs Teo responded to questions about whether the police should be accompanied by mental health professionals or community first responders when responding to cases that involve people with mental health conditions. The minister said that, for such an arrangement to work, there would need to be sufficient numbers of such professionals on standby round-the-clock, and for them to be able to respond immediately with police to all cases across the country. In Parliament on Tuesday (Apr 2), Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo responded to clarifications sought by Members of the House on the Law Enforcement and Other Matters Bill. The Bill was then passed. “Unfortunately, I think this will be very difficult to accomplish,” she said. “The practical approach is for the police, after dealing with the danger, to refer such persons to mental health professionals for treatment.” Training for the police is regularly updated and conducted by qualified professionals, she added. For example, officers undergo a mental health awareness course designed by the Agency for Integrated Care, which helps the officers identify and respond to people observed with indications of mental health conditions. Mrs Teo also confirmed that IMH and the police are already reviewing the suggestion to expand the Crisis Response Team. She agreed with Dr Syed that risk assessment is \"not a perfect science\". “It is not practicable to be too prescriptive. Doing so could bind the police officers’ hands or prevent them from acting quickly when they should,\" said Mrs Teo, who is also Minister for Communications and Information. \"Situations on the ground can be dynamic, and they need to be given the latitude to make quick decisions in difficult situations. \"The safety of the public and family members around such a person, and of the person himself, should be a priority.\" She added that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the police do not condone officers abusing their powers or acting inappropriately. Police ground response force officers wear cameras which ensure accountability and transparency. On the question of resourcing, MHA does not expect a significant increase in the number of referrals as a result of the amendments, because the threshold is \"still quite high\", the minister said. \"It’s not a case where suddenly you’re going to go out to make apprehensions. So there is no anticipated increase in resourcing needs. “The police intervene only when the person poses a danger to himself and others around him. The police do not get involved in cases involving persons with mental health conditions but who do not pose any danger to himself or others.\" She also addressed concerns about social stigma that mental health patients may face. \"We are actively working towards destigmatising mental health conditions, so that people do not hesitate to seek help,\" said Mrs Teo. \"Please be assured that the police do not seek to put more burden on such persons or their families.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

A new outdoor adventure learning centre will be developed on the Mandai Executive Golf Course site. (Photo: Facebook/Mandai Executive Golf Course) SINGAPORE: The public will be able to play at the Mandai Executive Golf Course for two additional years, after the operator was granted a tenancy extension until December 2026. Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth Eric Chua revealed this in parliament on Wednesday (Apr 3), and noted that it was one of the options made available to provide for public access to golfing. \"Golfing is a land intensive sport and there is a need to balance the allocation of land to the sport, vis-à-vis the competing demands for land in Singapore such as for public housing,\" said Mr Chua. \"We recognise that it is important for the public to have continued access to the sport. The government is looking at how we can ensure continued access to golf courses.\" The Government is looking at how to ensure continued public access to golfing. Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth Eric Chua said this on Wednesday (Apr 3) in answer to an MP’s questions about the closure of all three public golf courses by 2024. Mr Chua said the operator of the Mandai Executive Golf Course has been granted a two-year tenancy extension until the end of 2026. The Government has also worked with Keppel Club to set aside slots at the Sime course for public use at an affordable price and is exploring the possibility of introducing night golfing at the course. The Government will also look into the feasibility of public golfing facilities for the longer term, while balancing competing demands for land use, said Mr Chua. He was responding to a parliamentary question from Mr Louis Chua (WP-Sengkang), who had asked that if there are plans to convert any of the 14 private golf courses for public use. Another question raised was whether there are plans to ensure that the sport remains accessible to the general public, especially schools and students, given the impending closure of Singapore's public golf courses. Earlier this year, it was announced that the Mandai golf course will have to make way for a new outdoor adventure learning centre after its tenancy expires on Dec 31. The Mandai golf course, located at Upper Seletar Reservoir, was opened in 1993. Taking into consideration the impending closure of the 18-hole public course at Marina Bay Golf Course, Mr Chua said that the government had earlier worked with Keppel Club to set aside slots at the Sime Golf Course for public use at an \"affordable price range\", comparable to other public courses. Currently, the majority of slots at the Keppel Sime Course – on both weekdays as well as weekends – are set aside for members of the public, he added. \"The government will also look into the feasibility of public golfing facilities for the longer-term, bearing in mind other needs of Singaporeans at the same time,\" Mr Chua said. In a supplementary question, Mr Louis Chua asked if \"a view to public accessibility\" would be a feature in lease extension agreements with private golf clubs. Mr Eric Chua replied that the ministry does take this into account both in the short and long-term. He noted that it is working with Keppel Club to see if more slots could be made available and exploring the possibility of introducing night golfing at the Keppel Sime Course. \"In the longer term, we will explore all other various options to make sure that public accessibility is one of our key considerations in doing this,\" he added.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Singapore has not made any decision on the deployment of nuclear energy and is unable to commit to a timeline on taking a position regarding it, says Second Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Tan See Leng. File photo of nuclear power plants. (Photo: iStock/Ke Zhuang) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Singapore has plans to build a pool of about 100 nuclear energy experts in the medium to long run, said Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng on Wednesday (Apr 3). However, no decision has been made on the deployment of nuclear energy and Singapore is unable to commit to a timeline on taking a position regarding it. Dr Tan was responding to supplementary questions posed by Member of Parliament Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied) who asked how many scientists are currently at the Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Initiative, as well as the number of scholarships awarded each year to help build a pipeline of nuclear scientists and expertise. Mr Giam also asked if the government is building up the necessary regulatory policy frameworks that will be needed to oversee potential nuclear energy programmes such as nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. To this, Dr Tan said the government supports efforts to train scientists and experts in local and overseas universities. Over the last decade, the Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Initiative at the National University of Singapore (NUS) has awarded 30 scholarships for postgraduate studies in areas related to nuclear science and engineering. It has also developed a pipeline of around 40 researchers specialising in radiobiology, radiochemistry and nuclear safety. “We aim to build up a pool of about 100 experts in the medium to long run,” Dr Tan said. On nuclear fusion, the minister acknowledged that there is “a lot of excitement” in the fusion space. “To date, on a sustainable basis, the net energy input needed to create that nuclear fusion reaction far exceeds the output of the energy that we can harness,” he added. The closest system many countries have developed is based on tokamak, which is an experimental device to create a nuclear fusion reaction. This in turn produces energy to heat water and produce steam that drives turbines to generate electricity. But the technology is still in the development stage and the actual project has not come to fruition yet, said Dr Tan. He added that researchers from Singapore also have been sent to the United States to study how the technology will evolve. “For nuclear fusion, to answer the question, I think it's still quite nascent, and we are probably at least a decade away.” Nonetheless, the government is watching the space very closely and “nothing is off the table”, added Dr Tan. “We continue to keep our options open to all kinds of low carbon energy, including, of course, nuclear energy, both fission and fusion.” The Government has not made any decisions regarding the deployment of nuclear energy in Singapore and as such, it has no plans for uranium stockpiling. Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng said this in Parliament on Wednesday (Apr 3). He was replying to an MP’s question on whether Singapore has plans to stockpile uranium to secure energy sources ahead of other countries shifting towards nuclear energy, and what it is doing to prepare a core of local talent for the industry. Dr Tan said any deployment decision will require detailed studies of the safety, reliability, affordability and environmental sustainability of nuclear energy in the local context. So, what the Government is doing is steadily building capabilities to better understand and assess global developments on advanced nuclear energy technologies. It aims to build a pool of about 100 experts in the field, in the medium to long run, said Dr Tan. Mr Giam also asked Dr Tan when is the government going to take a position on whether to use nuclear energy as part of Singapore’s energy mix in the future. “Does the minister agree that it's important to provide some certainty or more certainty to both aspiring scientists and our people with regard to the use of nuclear energy?” he said. In response, Dr Tan said: “I think that the member presupposes that we made a decision on nuclear energy.” Reiterating that the government has not made a decision, Dr Tan said that Singapore has to wait for a small modular reactor or the newer generation of thermal reactors to be deployed commercially, and understand the safety profile before making a decision. This is because the safety buffer zone for conventional nuclear generators like the first and second generations is beyond Singapore's radius. At the same time, the government also recognises that radiological safety, the understanding of the operational capabilities and the engineering science behind it continue to be something that is “important and relevant” to Singapore, he added. Dr Tan pointed out that local talent continue to be trained, and are sent overseas and attached to institutions to learn, adapt to the expertise and absorb the knowledge. “(This is) so that at some point in time when we have finally made a decision, we will then bring them back here,” he said. “I think this as far as we can tell you. We will not be able to commit to a particular timeline. But that doesn't mean that we stop looking at it.” Earlier during parliament on Wednesday, Mr Giam had posed questions on Singapore's plans to stockpile uranium to secure energy sources ahead of other countries shifting towards nuclear energy, as well as what is being done to prepare a core of local talent to enter this industry. In his reply to the parliamentary questions, Dr Tan said that Singapore has no plans for uranium stockpiling. Any deployment decision will require detailed studies of the safety, reliability, affordability, and environmental sustainability of nuclear energy in the local context, he added. “We are therefore steadily building capabilities to better understand and assess global developments on advanced nuclear energy technologies.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore This will allow the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore to be more aware of threats that could potentially cause disruptions to essential services such as water, electricity and banking. Critical information infrastructure are computer systems necessary for the delivery of essential services such as water and electricity. (Photo: iStock/PUGUN SJ) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Owners of critical information infrastructure (CII), such as those providing water, electricity and banking services, will be required to report more types of cybersecurity incidents, including those that happen in their supply chains, under a new proposed law. This way, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) said it can be more aware of the cybersecurity threats that could potentially cause disruptions to Singapore’s essential services and work with owners more proactively to secure them. Tabled in parliament on Wednesday (Apr 3), the Cybersecurity (Amendment) Bill will update existing provisions relating to the cybersecurity of CII as well as expand CSA’s oversight to cover Systems of Temporary Cybersecurity Concern or STCCs. This refers to computer systems that are critical to Singapore and are at a high risk of cyberattacks because of certain events or situations. The Bill seeks to amend the Cybersecurity Act 2018, which establishes a legal framework for the oversight and maintenance of national cybersecurity in Singapore. The objective of the Bill, which would amend the Act for the first time, is to ensure that the law keeps pace with developments in the cyber threat landscape, as well as Singapore’s evolving technological operations, said CSA in a media release on Wednesday. A key aspect of the Bill is also to ensure that CII owners remain responsible for the cybersecurity and cyber resilience of the systems, while embracing new technological and business models such as cloud computing, said CSA. The intention to amend the law was first laid out by Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo last month when she spoke in parliament about her ministry’s spending plan. She said the law needed to change to reflect the increasing importance of ensuring the cybersecurity of the digital infrastructure and services that power Singapore’s digital economy, as well as allow citizens to meet their day-to-day needs. At present, CII owners are only required to report cybersecurity incidents concerning the critical infrastructure, and computer systems under their control that are interconnected or communicate with the infrastructure. If the new law is passed, owners will also have to report incidents targeting systems that are peripheral to CII. Besides critical infrastructure, the Bill will also allow CSA to proactively secure STCCs to ensure the cybersecurity of these systems. An example of an STCC would be the temporary systems used to support the distribution of critical vaccines during a pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine distribution systems deployed by healthcare organisations around the world were targeted by malicious cyber actors. In addition, CSA will create two new classes of regulated entities: Entities of Special Cybersecurity Interest (ESCI) and Foundational Digital Infrastructure (FDI). These two classes will be subjected to “light touch” regulations as they are not critical information infrastructure. ESCI, such as autonomous universities, may hold sensitive information or perform a function of national interest, such that their disruption could cause potential adverse effects on the defence, foreign relations, economy, public health, safety, or order of Singapore. Under the Bill, CSA will be able to designate and regulate ESCI for cybersecurity. The obligations imposed on these entities will not be at the same levels as that for CIIs, Singapore’s cybersecurity agency said. Where disruptions to a regulated system or entity pose less serious risks to Singapore, CSA's regulatory approach is calibrated such that the obligations are \"not so onerous\" that they place an undue compliance burden on the regulated entities, while protecting public interest, the agency said. Hence, ESCI - unlike CII owners - are not required to submit audit reports or risk assessments to CSA. They will also not be required to participate in national cybersecurity exercises. Lastly, the Bill also requires companies such as cloud service providers and data centres to be responsible for the cybersecurity of such digital infrastructure. This includes adhering to cybersecurity codes and standards of practice, as well as reporting prescribed cybersecurity incidents to CSA, which will also not be at the level of a CII, said the agency. CSA added that it had consulted extensively on the Bill, through stakeholder and public consultations. If passed, the agency said it will continue to consult closely with stakeholders to operationalise the Bill.

The control tower of Changi Airport in Singapore as seen on Mar 12, 2019. (File photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman) SINGAPORE: Key air, sea and land transport operators could be subject to more controls over ownership, operations and management appointments, if they become designated entities under a new proposed law that could come into force in the second half of 2024. Under draft amendments tabled in parliament on Wednesday (Apr 3), entities may be designated by the relevant authority – Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) or Land Transport Authority (LTA) – if they are “key entities involved in the provision of essential transport services” in Singapore. They can be designated as a “designated operating entity” if they directly provide essential transport services in Singapore or a “designated equity interest holder” if they hold equity interest in the former. The Bill seeks to strengthen the resilience of \"key firms\" in the air, sea and land transport sectors in Singapore, and safeguard their provision of essential transport services, said the Ministry of Transport (MOT) in a press release on Wednesday. “The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the importance of our air and sea hubs, while mass public transport remains essential to ensuring safe and reliable commutes in Singapore,” said MOT's spokesperson. This review of sector-specific controls for the transport sectors complements the Significant Investments Review Act passed in January, said the spokesperson. The Significant Investments Review Act scrutinises significant investments, whether local or foreign, into entities that are critical to Singapore’s national security interests. It introduced a new investment management regime for specified entities identified as critical to national security. Entities designated under MOT’s sectoral legislation will not be designated under the Significant Investments Review Act at the same time, said MOT in a press release on Wednesday. Under the proposed amendments, designated entities will face three types of controls, said MOT's spokesperson. Ownership controls will ensure oversight of changes in their effective control “to safeguard against adverse influence”. For example, buyers and sellers may need to notify or seek approval from the authorities depending on the amount, and the designated entities must notify the authorities within seven days of becoming aware of these changes in ownership and control. Suggested controls over management appointments will ensure that the people who are “principally responsible” for the management of the designated entities are fit and proper, and not “inimical to national interests”, the spokesperson added. Under the proposed legislation, designated entities will have to obtain approval from the relevant authority when appointing their CEO and the chairperson of their board. This extends to directors of the boards if the designated entity is also a licensed operator, said the spokesperson. Current laws already require licensed public transport operators to seek LTA’s approval for the appointment of their CEOs and boards. If the Bill is passed, designated entities will need to notify the relevant authority of events that could “materially impede or impair” the provision of essential transport services in Singapore, said the MOT spokesperson. These operations or resourcing controls will ensure that designated entities have enough resources and capabilities to provide essential transport services, they added. If the Bill is passed, the Transport Minister, upon application by the relevant authority, can issue a special administration order to ensure the service continues, in the “extreme scenario” where the designated operating entity cannot provide essential transport services safely and reliably. Under the proposed laws, if designated entities breach these controls, including conditions for approval, they could be subject to remedial directions, including the disposal of equity interest and the removal of key appointment holders, said the MOT spokesperson. Breaching the controls and any of the remedial directions will also be considered an offence, and the penalties for these offences will take reference from existing penalties under the relevant Acts. A person may appeal to the Transport Minister within 14 days of being informed of the relevant authority’s decision on designation, and applications for approval for ownership or management appointments.

A dog wearing an electric shock collar. (File photo: iStock) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: New guidelines that will be released by the National Parks Board (NParks) will not impose any restrictions on the use of aversive animal training devices, including electric shock collars. In a written parliamentary answer, Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said on Wednesday (Apr 3) that the guidelines that NParks will be releasing are meant to highlight the risk of using such devices. The guidelines will also recommend good training practices to be adopted by the community. He was responding to a question from Member of Parliament Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) about whether a ban of remote electric shock collars is being considered in the guidelines. \"Following the release of the guidelines, NParks will continue to monitor the situation before deciding if further measures are needed,\" said Mr Lee on Wednesday. \"Notwithstanding this, NParks will continue to investigate and take enforcement action in cases where animal training devices cause unnecessary pain or suffering to animals, and to raise awareness on the least intrusive, minimally aversive approach to animal training.\" The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) has called for a ban on the use of electric shock collars, saying that its use is banned or \"significantly restricted\" in several countries such as the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. This is not the first time the issue of electric shock collars for training animals has been raised in parliament. Last month, Mr Ng asked for an update on a study it had conducted on the use of such collars for training animals. Senior Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How said in parliament on Mar 7 he had personally tested \"a range of electric collars\" on himself. \"On a range of one to 10, in terms of spectrum, I probably got to about seven, and it (was) very painful – marks were shown on the skin. \"But it is not just the pain but also the shock of it because the animal or whoever is wearing the electrical collar won't know when the shock is applied,\" he said. In 2022, the multi-stakeholder Rehoming and Adoption Workgroup (RAWG) - comprising NParks, animal welfare groups, vets and dog trainers - published guidelines to standardise practices in dog rehoming and adoption, as well as training and behaviour rehabilitation. MND said in March that NParks further consulted other stakeholders in the animal community on the use of electric collars and were developing guidelines to highlight the risks of using aversive animal training devices. \"Ultimately, these guidelines recommend good practices to be adopted by the community, and are not meant to be legally enforceable,\" it said then. It added that when \"unnecessary pain or suffering\" is inflicted on animals, it will not hesitate to investigate and take enforcement action under the Animals and Birds Act. Senior Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How said NParks is currently developing guidelines to highlight the risks of using aversive animal training devices such as electric collars. More details will be shared when ready. Mr Tan said he himself tried on some electric collars and experienced the pain and shock. On animal cruelty, Mr Tan said from 2019 to 2023, his ministry received about 1,250 alleged cases each year. Between 2019 and 2022, an average of about 60 cases per year were found to be related to animal cruelty. He said enforcement actions were taken against offenders. These ranged from warnings to prosecution, depending on the severity of the case. Mr Tan was replying to an MP’s questions in Parliament on Thursday (Mar 7).

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore The power to detain without trial is a \"last resort\" used in cases when victims or witnesses refuse to testify out of fear of reprisal, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim. A police officer arresting a suspect in Singapore. (File photo: CNA/Hanidah Amin) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Parliament on Wednesday (Apr 3) voted to extend a law that allows the government to detain without trial people with links to certain criminal activity, especially gangs and secret societies. This is the 15th time that the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act has been extended since it was enacted in 1955. It was last extended in 2018 for five years, until Oct 20 this year. Opposition lawmakers from the Workers’ Party (WP) joined the People’s Action Party in voting for the extension. This was a shift from the WP’s position in 2018 when it voted against the extension and other amendments to the Act. The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) stressed the need for more safeguards against potential abuse of power, but it was not clear how the party voted on Wednesday. “Our objection to the Bill has been conveyed by Mr Leong Mun Wai in his speech. We did not take the additional step to register our dissent again,” said a PSP spokesperson. Minister of State for Home Affairs and National Development Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim said during the debate that the Act was first introduced in the 1950s, when gang activity was rampant in Singapore, and still remains relevant today. Powers to detain those associated with certain criminal activities are \"exercised carefully and sparingly”, said Dr Faishal, describing it as “an instrument of last resort”. “The (Home Affairs) Minister must be satisfied that detaining a person under the Act is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order. The power to detain someone under the Act is used only when prosecution is not viable, for example, because victims and witnesses refuse to testify for fear of reprisal,” he explained. The number of detention and supervision orders issued under the Act has declined over the years. From Oct 21, 2019, to Dec 31, 2023, 123 individuals were dealt with under the Act, with 86 detention orders and 37 police supervision orders issued. “This was fewer than the number of cases in the same period of the previous term of the Act,” noted Dr Faishal. “Even so, the number of orders issued is significant and the Act continues to be necessary and relevant, not only against secret societies but also other criminal activities such as unlicensed moneylending.” There are still active secret societies in Singapore, although not in the numbers and scale in some other countries. “Nevertheless, they are still a menace to law and order, public safety and security,” said Dr Faishal. “They recruit young Singaporeans and engage in illicit activities and violent conduct. That is why we must continue to clamp down on them.” Dr Faishal cited an incident in the wee hours of Nov 9, 2021, when gang members gathered at a rival gang member’s flat with deadly weapons including a machete, a knuckle duster and a karambit knife. As the member was not at home, they attacked his family members instead. In another incident on the evening of Jan 8, 2022, a gang clash took place at Circular Road, with one member stabbing a rival's leg with a knife. In both cases, gang members were dealt with under the Act, Dr Faishal said. The Act has also been used against organised crimes such as unlicensed moneylending, with a number of leaders and financiers of an unlicensed moneylending syndicate detained in 2019. The group was linked to over 1,800 cases of debt harassment in Singapore. “Without the Act, we would not have been able to do much against them. The victims and witnesses feared reprisal and were not willing to testify. The perpetrators would have been able to carry on with their violence and intimidation with impunity,” Dr Faishal noted. He reiterated that the Act is used in cases where prosecution is not viable, as witnesses are unwilling to testify in court for fear of reprisal. “Witness intimidation is a problem in Singapore too. Some countries have witness relocation and protection programmes. However, because Singapore is so small, witness relocation would not be feasible or effective,” he said. Dr Faishal assured MPs that safeguards are in place in the exercise of the powers. For one, the Public Prosecutor’s consent must be obtained for a detention order or supervision order. The official must be satisfied that prosecution is not viable, before allowing executive action to be taken under the Act, explained Dr Faishal. There are also three committees, independent of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), ensuring that detentions are necessary, he said. The first committee scrutinises every detention and supervision order issued by the minister, examining evidence that was considered in issuing the order and submitting its report to the President to recommend the confirmation, variation or cancellation of the order. “A second committee considers every confirmed detention order at least once annually. It will consider whether the detainee continues to pose a threat to public safety, peace and good order, and whether the detainee should continue to be detained or released,” said Dr Faishal. A third committee reviews detention cases which are being considered for extension beyond 10 years, to determine if it is indeed necessary. “The Act requires the committees to have regard to public safety, the protection of individuals, and the safeguarding of sources of information, in their deliberation,” added Dr Faishal. Detainees are required to attend the first committee in person. They can be represented by lawyers and make representations to the various committees, he added. Every decision made under the Act can be subject to judicial review, as was made clear when the Act was last amended in 2018, he said. “I want to emphasise this point as I know that some members have raised their concerns as to whether the Act ‘ousts’ judicial review. It does not,” said Dr Faishal. Opposition lawmakers Dennis Tan (WP-Hougang) and PSP Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai asked MHA to clarify the circumstances under which the ministry was prepared to stop extending the detention powers. Mr Tan said the WP was “in cautious support” of the Bill, but maintained its objections to amendments to the Act made in 2018, when it voted against the extension. He recalled that in 2018, the WP had expressed concerns about amendments giving the Minister for Home Affairs the final say on whether detention is necessary. The WP had also expressed concerns about the insertion of a schedule of criminal activities covered by the Act which “may allow the ministers to bypass” questions about the severity of the cases or the possibility of prosecution in court; and the expansion of the minister’s powers to criminal activities conducted overseas, he said. Mr Tan noted that the present Bill did not seek to amend the Act, that the WP had supported the extension before the 2018 amendments, and that it accepted “the uncomfortable compromise that this law entails on the constitutional right to freedom”. The WP lawmaker also asked for information on the use of the detention provision, such as a breakdown of detention and police supervision orders by criminal activity, and whether any public prosecutor has withheld consent for an order. Dr Faishal replied that MHA generally does not release information about the use of the Act as it must “balance the call for transparency against the need to prevent prejudice to investigations and to keep witnesses safe”. When Mr Tan asked if such information could be provided to MPs confidentially as they debate the Act every five years, Dr Faishal said MHA had to be “very careful” about what it shares given the complexity of organised and transnational crime. PSP's Mr Leong proposed additional safeguards for MHA to require sitting Supreme Court judges to be on the advisory committees that review detainees' cases. This is currently the practice, but is not written into law, he said. He also suggested giving the President discretionary powers in the making or extension of a detention or police supervision order. The President currently acts on the advice of the Cabinet in these matters. Mr Leong also wanted to know if the Public Defender's Office – set up in 2022 – can represent detainees under the Act. Dr Faishal said detainees are not assigned counsel by the state, but can find their own lawyer, including pro bono representation. Dr Faishal said the current safeguards were carefully considered and worked for Singapore. He said it seemed that the PSP was “not able to point to any abuse of the system”, and urged the NCMP to “stop pursuing theory” and focus on whether the law has worked. Dr Faishal also said that the responsibility for law and order lies with the government rather than the President, and MHA therefore disagreed with Mr Leong’s suggestion. Mr Leong later pointed out that the President currently holds discretionary powers under the Internal Security Act (ISA), which also provides for detention without trial. Under the Constitution, if the government disagrees with an advisory board's recommendation that an ISA detainee be released, the President’s concurrence is required for continued detention. In response, Dr Faishal reiterated that the detention provision has worked in its current form. Mr Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) and Nominated MP Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim asked about the rehabilitation of detainees, including whether they have access to programmes for offenders who have gone through the regular court system. Dr Faishal said detainees are housed at institutions in Changi Prison Complex based on their security risk and rehabilitative needs, and placed on programmes targeting “specific behavioural and offending needs”. For example, detainees can receive job opportunities through Yellow Ribbon Singapore. They also have access to vocational training, religious counselling and education. “Where required, detainees undergo the gang renunciation programme or psychological-based correctional programmes to increase their self-awareness and equip them with pro-social skills to change their offending ways,” he added. Mr Murali Pillai (PAP-Bukit Batok) asked if MHA would consider using the detention provision against secret society recruiters who target youths. Young people are the “oxygen or lifeblood” of secret societies, said Mr Murali. Citing a study he was involved in, he said that the entry age for secret societies ranged from as young as 11 to 18. He added that secret societies have evolved methods specifically to target and recruit youths in communities and school settings. These activities start as “innocuous” social gatherings that lead to initiation ceremonies. Noting that recruiting people to join an unlawful society is a criminal offence, he asked whether secret society recruiters could be detained if evidence was not forthcoming. Dr Faishal said detention orders have been, and will continue to be, issued against secret society recruiters. He said MHA views recruitment of youths into gangs as “particularly aggravating as this perpetuates the gangland lawlessness, while corrupting our youths”, and that police pursue both enforcement and prevention measures. Community outreach programmes involve working with the Ministry of Social and Family Development, Ministry of Education and social service agencies. Talks at schools, prison visits for “wayward youths” and their parents and guardians, and the Streetwise Programme for youths are among the police’s educational efforts.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Until the April 2024 accident where two were killed, no accidents with serious injuries or fatalities took place at the Tampines traffic junction in the last five years. Damaged cars at a traffic junction between Tampines Avenue 1 and Tampines Avenue 4 on Apr 22, 2024. (Photo: CNA/Calvin Oh) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The Tampines traffic junction where two people were killed after a multi-vehicle accident was designed in accordance with international safety standards, said Senior Minister of State for Transport Amy Khor on Tuesday (May 7). The junction of Tampines Avenue 1 and Avenue 4 includes sufficient line of sight for road users to see each other clearly, and appropriate road kerbs, lane and arrow markings installed conspicuously, said Dr Khor in parliament. She was responding to questions from Members of Parliament (MPs) about safety at the traffic junction. The road accident on Apr 22 led to the deaths of 17-year-old Temasek Junior College student Afifah Munirah Muhammad Azril and 57-year-old Norzihan Juwahib , a pest control company employee. Six others were injured, including 42-year-old Muhammad Syafie Ismail , who was charged with four offences, including dangerous driving causing death. Mr Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied) asked if there are plans to build more underground walkways so that pedestrians have safer alternatives than to cross busy junctions. Dr Khor said that the ministry has not received feedback on safety issues at the Tampines junction. \"Between 2019 to 2023, there were also no accidents with serious injuries or fatalities at that junction,\" she said. \"We have also reviewed the junction after the accident and we do not think that there is need to further enhance or implement measures to enhance safety at that junction.\" However, she said that pending police investigations into the accident, there will be a review of whether further measures have to be implemented to enhance road safety. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) focuses on safety by ensuring that roads are designed with safety in mind, and that vehicles are safe for use on the roads, said Senior Minister of State for Transport Amy Khor in Parliament on Tuesday (May 7). In her reply to MPs' questions on enhancing road safety following the fatal accident in Tampines in April, she said that the Tampines junction at which the incident occurred is designed in accordance with international safety standards. She also stated that LTA continues to review, develop and implement programmes to enhance road safety, such as installing red-amber-green arrows to replace discretionary right turns at junctions. Dr Khor also said that as of 2023, LTA has implemented 371 School Zones and 40 Silver Zones in areas near schools and where there are higher proportions of senior residents, highlighting that Silver Zones in particular have reduced the accident rate among senior pedestrians within the zones by about 80 per cent. She also said that a critical factor besides safe roads and safe vehicles in enhancing road safety is safe motorists, stating that LTA supports the Ministry of Home Affairs to educate and engage motorists on road safety practices. Dr Khor said that the Land Transport Authority (LTA) continues to review, develop and implement programmes to enhance road safety, which include: Dr Khor added that LTA also uses data from sources such as traffic accident reports from Traffic Police, as well as feedback from the public, to design and implement road safety enhancements. The authority has introduced about 1,000 of these enhancements annually across Singapore, including speed humps and 3D road markings. LTA also conducts checks to ensure that vehicles are roadworthy, and supports the Ministry of Home Affairs to educate and engage motorists on road safety practices. \"Road safety is a shared responsibility, and we urge all road users to play their part, even as we do more to make our infrastructure safer for everyone,\" said Dr Khor.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Members of Parliament raised questions about road safety in Singapore after a recent accident in Tampines killed two people, including a 17-year-old Temasek Junior College student. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Penalties under the Road Traffic Act (RTA) currently are adequate to deter dangerous driving, and will not be increased for now, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim on Tuesday (May 7). The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had last raised penalties significantly in 2019, he said in parliament in response to questions from various MPs . “What the laws provide today are already quite stiff. We do regularly review different aspects of the framework. In this context, we have been studying the adequacy of composition amounts and the demerit points framework,” he said. MPs had raised questions about the road safety landscape in Singapore, after a recent accident in Tampines last month which killed two people, including a 17-year-old Temasek Junior College student. Assoc Prof Faishal noted that the accident shocked and angered many Singaporeans. “I am sure I speak for all of us in saying we were all deeply saddened as well.” Multiple MPs, including the chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport Saktiandi Supaat, had asked if there was a need to review existing penalties under the RTA. Currently, for an offence of dangerous driving causing death, a first-time offender can be jailed for two to eight years, while a repeat offender could face up to 15 years in jail, said Assoc Prof Faishal. An offender could also additionally be disqualified from driving for a minimum of 10 years, starting only from the time that he or she is released from prison, he added. “Thus a first offender in a serious case could be jailed for a maximum of eight years and not drive for 18 years,” explained Assoc Prof Faishal. He said that since last month, the Traffic Police (TP) has progressively activated the speed enforcement function in red-light cameras across the island, especially at more accident-prone or violation-prone locations. More than 800 speeding violations have been detected by these cameras in the three weeks since they were activated. “Whilst enforcement cameras are useful for deterrence, it is not feasible to install them at all traffic junctions and zebra crossings, given terrain limitations and other constraints,” he said. In the last six weeks, the TP has also intensified ad-hoc enforcement, detecting close to 1,400 violations and arresting 29 motorists for traffic-related and other offences. In response to a question by MP Tin Pei Ling (PAP-MacPherson) on simplifying the reporting of traffic violations by the public, Assoc Prof Faishal said violations can be reported online via the Police’s E-Services or Police@SG app, with supporting evidence such as video footage. He also reassured the House that TP has been taking enforcement action based on such evidence. Singapore’s roads have become safer, said Assoc Prof Faishal. The number of accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities has fallen by about 10 per cent in the last five years, from 7,822 in 2019 to 7,075 in 2023, he shared. However, the number of accidents resulting in fatalities has increased by about 12 per cent, from 117 in 2019 to 131 in 2023, he noted. “There were 71 fatal accidents in the first half of 2023, and 60 in the second half of the year,” said Assoc Prof Faishal. He shared that the top causes of the fatal accidents between 2019 and 2023 were failure to keep a proper lookout and to have proper control of one’s vehicle. An average of three fatal accidents per year – or about 2.4 per cent annually – were investigated under the offence of reckless or dangerous driving causing death, while an average of 29 fatal accidents each year – about 27 per cent annually – were speeding-related. He also emphasised efforts to improve road safety in Singapore and incentivise safe driving behaviour here. For instance, eligible motorists may attend the Safe Driving Course, and have four demerit points expunged from their record upon completion. “The course aims to re-educate and correct the poor driving behaviours of motorists who have accumulated a significant number of demerit points,” said Assoc Prof Faishal. Education and engagement efforts have also been ramped up, with TP working alongside partners and stakeholders, such as the Singapore Road Safety Council, SBS Transit and Grab, to organise events and campaigns to promote road safety, he noted. Singapore’s roads have become safer, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim. In the last five years, the number of accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities fell by about 10 per cent - from 7,822 in 2019 to 7,075 in 2023. However, the number of accidents resulting in fatalities increased by about 12 per cent - from 117 in 2019 to 131 in 2023. There were 71 fatal accidents in the first half of 2023 and 60 in the second half of the year. Dr Faishal, who gave this update in reply to MPs’ questions in Parliament on Tuesday (May 7), said the top causes of the fatal accidents between 2019 and 2023 were failure to keep a proper lookout and have proper control of the vehicles. An average of three fatal accidents per year, or about 2.4 per cent of fatal accidents annually, were investigated under the offence of reckless or dangerous driving causing death. An average of 29 fatal accidents per year, or 27 per cent of fatal accidents annually, were speeding-related. Dr Faishal said the Ministry of Home Affairs has raised the penalties significantly and the laws are already quite stiff. It has been studying the adequacy of composition amounts and the demerit points framework. Turning to enforcement efforts, he said in the last six weeks, Traffic Police stepped up ad hoc enforcement, as well as progressively activated the speed enforcement function in red-light cameras across the island. TP will also be publishing a series of road safety videos in the second half of this year, he added. Assoc Prof Faishal added that TP works closely with the Land Transport Authority to modify or improve road infrastructure and enhance safety. Responding to MP Joan Pereira’s (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) question on requiring drivers to attend periodic refresher courses, Assoc Prof Faishal said such courses are optional and cater to drivers who have not driven for several years. “We do not think it is useful to mandate the refresher course for all motorists. Only a minority of motorists are involved in accidents,” he said. He explained that the “very large majority” stay offence-free for many years, if not the entire period of their driving history. Most accidents happen because of poor road behaviour, rather than inexperience, he said. Traffic Police (TP) is intensifying its education and engagement efforts, as well as working with various partners and stakeholders to promote road safety. It will be publishing a series of road safety videos in the second half of this year. Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim announced this in Parliament on Tuesday (May 7), in reply to MPs’ questions. Turning to questions on how the road infrastructure can be modified or improved to enhance safety, he said TP works closely with the Land Transport Authority on this. Dr Faishal told the House that the Government is strongly committed to doing all it can to keep Singapore’s roads safe. He stressed that road safety is a “shared responsibility” and urged all road users to play their part. Ms Pereira also asked if speed limiters should be mandated on all vehicles. “We have to balance the benefits with the costs. For now, we assess that it would suffice to mandate the installation of speed limiters for lorries,” said Assoc Prof Faishal, adding that the initiative is ongoing and will be completed by June 2027. He added that families of accident victims are referred to Social Service Offices or Family Service Centres, depending on their circumstances and support needed. Those requiring mental health support are referred to mental health helplines and counselling services, run by trained professionals or the Institute of Mental Health, he said in response to a question from MP Patrick Tay (PAP-Pioneer). “The government is strongly committed to doing all we can to keep our roads safe. However, I would like to re-emphasise that we cannot succeed alone. Road safety is necessarily a shared responsibility, and we urge all road users to play their part,” he said.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore On concerns that flexi-work would result in more jobs offshoring, the Minister of State for Manpower said it was more important to make sure Singapore's workers stay globally competitive in skills and productivity. Office workers relax by the Singapore River on Jan 12, 2023. (File photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Employers with workers on flexible work arrangements have no basis to cut their pay if their productivity is not affected, Minister of State for Manpower Gan Siow Huang said on Tuesday (May 7). She was responding to a question by Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Raj Thomas on how the tripartite guidelines on flexible work arrangement requests would interact with the progressive wage model. The new guidelines, which come into effect on Dec 1, require all employers to have a process for their employees to request flexible work arrangements. Employers must give fair consideration to the requests and respond within two months. They can reject a request on \"reasonable business grounds\", and must give the employee the reason in writing. The progressive wage model provides a structure for wages to rise along with training and productivity improvements. It covers lower-wage local workers in certain sectors, like cleaning and security. Mr Thomas asked whether an employer would have to reject a worker's request for flexible work arrangements if it meant the worker would work fewer days, bringing his or her gross wage below the prescribed floor of the model. Ms Gan questioned the assumption that pay would be reduced in the first place, saying that employers have to pay competitively to attract and retain good workers. \"For workers who are on flexible work arrangements, if their work output, productivity is not affected, actually there is no basis for employers to reduce their pay,\" she said. Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said that \"the spirit of the PWM (progressive wage model) should really lead the entire thinking\" behind the implementation of any guidelines. He said the guidelines on flexible work arrangements were based on tripartism and collaboration, and represented a \"very nuanced approach\". \"I think we are moving into newer waters, and I would seek an appeal to the understanding, the support and also the patience of all of us together as one united society, to come together to make this work for the betterment of all of our future generations of workers.\" Dr Wan Rizal (PAP-Jalan Besar) raised concerns from workers who may want flexible work arrangements but fear if their personal issues, like mental health, are aired in the process, that this could hurt their career progression. Ms Gan reiterated that employers must assess employees' performance and pay them fairly based on work done, and not discriminate based on health conditions that do not affect their performance. After the guidelines were announced, some employers told CNA that as managing remote teams becomes more common, they may rethink hiring local staff and look overseas for recruitment, particularly given the difference in costs. Members of the tripartite working group that drafted the guidelines, co-chaired by Ms Gan, have said that ensuring the local workforce stays competitive will be key as Singapore normalises flexible work arrangements. On Tuesday, Ms Gan reiterated that remote work and outsourcing are already global trends regardless of Singapore's guidelines. \"Even if foreigners are not working in Singapore ... they will still be competing with us when working in companies overseas,\" she said. It was more important for local workers to continually upskill and stay productive to compete for jobs not just in Singapore, but globally, she added. MP Cheryl Chan (PAP-East Coast) then asked whether Singapore would see more offshoring of jobs as a result of the flexible work arrangement guidelines. She also asked whether middle-aged professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) would be disadvantaged by the guidelines and by the redesign of job roles to accommodate flexible work arrangements. Ms Gan replied that flexible work arrangements were not limited to flexi-place arrangements (like working from home), and did not mean workers will be less productive. She added that businesses were driven by their own bottom lines in assessing talent and costs. \"I think we should not pretend that without flexible work arrangements, there'll be less offshoring,\" she said. \"I would also point out that elsewhere, in the US, for example, we are also seeing some tech companies putting out statements that remote work does not work for them. \"There seems to be some suggestion that actually, for certain sectors and for certain types of work, physical on-site presence, teamwork, all these are still very key.\" She said that some companies in Singapore have shared similar feedback, adding: \"For those, I think offshoring may not be a natural choice, and certainly would not be affected by these guidelines.\" Ms Gan said that the focus for middle-aged PMETs is on making sure they have the right skills and on their \"career health\" to make sure they stay employable. Addressing MPs' questions, she also reiterated that the guidelines do not mandate flexible work arrangements or set hard targets. \"For flexible work arrangements to be successful, it must make businesses sustainable for the employers,\" she said. \"It does not make sense to require businesses to offer flexible work arrangements, even when it negatively impacts business and affects employment prospects for Singaporeans.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

Laying out the “different” payment considerations for those who choose to transfer to a different ward type during hospitalisation, he said: “When patients stay in a higher-class ward and then downgrade to a lower-class ward towards the end of their stay, they will receive subsidies based on the respective ward classes.” “This is fair,” Mr Ong said, adding that public hospitals will find ways to support patients financially if requests to downgrade to a lower-class ward are due to unaffordability issues. However, there is “a different consideration” when it comes to the upgrading of hospital wards, he said in his response to parliamentary questions from Member of Parliament (MP) Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast) and Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai. “We have to discourage patients from selecting lower ward classes to secure more subsidies for more costly treatments, such as surgery and ICU (intensive care unit), at the beginning of their stay and then switch to higher ward classes once these more expensive treatments are completed,” he said. He added that “many of these patients are not of lower income and could have chosen the higher ward class from the outset”. “That is why if a patient upgrades, the level of subsidies will be adjusted retroactively.” When patients stay in a higher class ward and then downgrade to a lower ward class towards the end of their stay, they will receive subsidies based on the respective ward classes. “This is fair,” said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung. Replying to Parliamentary questions on Tuesday (May 7), he pointed out that where the request to downgrade is due to unaffordability because of complications or unexpected additional costs, public hospitals will find ways to support them financially. For upgrading of wards, he stressed the need to discourage patients from selecting lower ward classes to secure more subsidies for more costly treatments and then switching to higher ward classes once these treatments are completed. Mr Ong said many of these patients are not of lower income and could have chosen the higher ward class from the outset. That is why if a patient upgrades, the level of subsidies will be adjusted retroactively, he added. The issue of retroactive charging for patients who opt to transfer to higher-class wards first emerged in a letter published on the Straits Times' Forum page last month. In the letter, Mr David Kong wrote about how his 98-year-old mother was first admitted to the high-dependency ward in the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) as a Class C patient. But the ward, which accommodates five patients, was “consistently noisy” and his mother found it difficult to rest, he wrote. Mr Kong’s mother was transferred to a general ward a week later and the family opted for an A1 ward – a single room for a “quieter environment”. However, the family was told that doing so means that the hospital bill for their mother’s “earlier stay as a Class C patient would be retroactively changed to reflect her new Class A1 status”. The A1 ward is a private and non-subsidised ward type, based on SGH’s website. Describing this retroactive charging as “illogical and unfair”, Mr Kong said: “A patient should be charged Class C rates for the period she stayed in a Class C ward, not Class A1 rates for services and amenities she did not consume.” When CNA contacted the Ministry of Health (MOH) regarding the issue last month, a spokesperson said that it is important to ensure that government subsidies “are targeted at where they are needed most”. “If there are medical reasons why a patient may need to be isolated from other patients after surgery, our public hospitals will provide the necessary facilities subsidised at the patient’s chosen ward class,” the emailed reply said. “Patients are also counselled on the financial implications before upgrading their ward class, so they can decide whether they want to go ahead with the ward change,” it added. In his supplementary questions on Tuesday, Mr Ang, the MP, asked if patients who require an upgrade but are “not financially very strong” can appeal against the retroactive charges. Mr Ang also raised the scenario of patients who are not allowed to downgrade to a cheaper ward after having stayed at a higher-class ward previously at the hospital. “The only time they can escape this is when they are admitted to A&E then they can go to a lower-class (ward),” he said, citing feedback from his residents. Mr Ong replied that “everyone has the right to appeal” but authorities are “trying to stop a certain behaviour which (they) don’t think is right”. He added that patients are counselled financially at the beginning of every hospital stay, and decisions are made by patients “with their eyes open”. In cases where downgrades are not allowed, Mr Ong noted that “a very established process of means testing” is in place currently. “So long as they meet the means testing criteria, they can downgrade,” he said. “So, I think the specific cases the member might have come across might be a case where they didn't manage to meet the means testing criteria.” Mr Ong added that those with affordability issues can tap on MediFund – an endowment fund set up by the government for lower-income Singaporeans – which serves as the “last line of defense” to ensure those who need help can “always afford hospital stay in public health institutions”.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore As tactics of malicious actors evolve to target systems peripheral to owners of critical services, Singapore must also place \"alarms\" at these places, says Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary. The amendments to Singapore's Cybersecurity Act will require owners of critical information infrastructure to report more types of incidents, including those that happen in their supply chains. (Photo: iStock/Nattakorn Maneerat) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A Bill aimed at bolstering Singapore’s cybersecurity defences while accounting for changes in technology was passed by parliament on Tuesday (May 7). Under amendments to the Cybersecurity Act, owners of critical information infrastructure (CII) must now report more types of incidents including those that happen in their supply chains. This is to address the “inventiveness” of malicious cyber actors, said Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary. “As the tactics and techniques of malicious actors evolve to target systems at the periphery or along supply chains, we must also start placing our alarms at those places,” he added. The new law will allow authorities to regulate a new type of system called Systems of Temporary Cybersecurity Concern (STCC). These are systems that, for a time-limited period, are at high risk of cyberattacks, and if compromised, would damage Singapore’s national interests. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) will now also be able to manage entities beyond its current regulatory regime. These include Entities of Special Cybersecurity Interest (ESCIs). Attacks on ESCIs could have a “significant detrimental effect” on Singapore’s defence, foreign relations, economy, public health, public safety, or public order, because of the disruption of the function they perform, or the disclosure of sensitive information their computer systems contain, explained Dr Janil. The specific list of entities designated as ESCIs should not be disclosed publicly to avoid inadvertently advertising these entities as “worthy targets” to malicious actors, he added. CSA will now also be able to deal with situations where a CII is supporting an essential service from overseas. With the new changes, CSA can designate and regulate such CIIs so long as its owner is in Singapore and the computer system would have been designated as a CII had it been located in Singapore. Tabling the Bill for a second reading, Dr Janil said that it aims to tackle “shifts in the operating context” in cybersecurity, and strengthen the administration of the Act to address “operational challenges” CSA has faced. “The Cybersecurity Act has now been in force for six years. The core objectives continue to be relevant today. We’ve reviewed the Act, learning from our experiences, and taking into account changes in technology,” he explained. “In order to continue to ensure Singapore’s cybersecurity, a review and an update to the Act is needed as several aspects of our operating context have changed.” While Singapore implemented legislation in the form of the Cybersecurity Act in 2018, technology has evolved and business models have changed. For one, cloud computing is widely available and used. While it was once the norm for CII to be physical systems on premises and entirely owned or controlled by the CII owner, this is no longer always the case, said Dr Janil. Now it is also possible to aggregate and share common digital services and functions across borders. This means it is needful to review how Singapore can safeguard the cybersecurity of its essential services, he added. All this is happening amid a backdrop of increased use and reliance on digital technology. In Singapore, over 90 per cent of residents now communicate online and firms’ technology adoption rate has grown from 74 per cent in 2018 to 94 per cent in 2022. More are now online for longer and online for more varied purposes. This means that there is an increased “attack surface” as people are exposed to more cyber risks, said the Senior Minister of State. The cyber threat landscape has also evolved and malicious actors are increasingly finding new ways to their target. With all this in mind, it is “vital” Singapore updates cybersecurity laws to stay ahead of the curve, said Dr Janil. Singapore is making a “major update” to its Cybersecurity Act, given the significant shifts in the digital domain, said Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary. It will have the power to keep pace with developments in technology and business practices and respond to evolving cybersecurity challenges in the cyber threat landscape, he said in Parliament on Tuesday (May 7). This means extending the regulatory oversight to other important systems and entities, and using a risk-based approach to regulate entities for cybersecurity and administer the Act more effectively. These will strengthen Singapore’s national cybersecurity and increase trust in using online services, said Dr Janil. A key provision involves Critical Information Infrastructure (CII). Dr Janil said regulating CIIs is no longer sufficient and it is vital to update cybersecurity laws to continue to stay ahead of the curve. Dr Janil pointed out that the 2018 Act was developed to regulate CIIs as physical systems, but new technology and business models have emerged. Hence, the need to better regulate CIIs to ensure that they continue to be secure and resilient against cyber threats, whatever technology or business model they run on. Under the Bill, the meaning of computer and computer system in specified portions will include virtual computers and virtual computer systems. The new definition will make clear that the CII owner is responsible for the cybersecurity of its virtualised CII. Another provision deals with essential services from overseas. CIIs that are wholly located outside of Singapore can be designated and regulated so long as the owners are in Singapore and the computer system would have been designated as a CII under the law had it been located wholly or partly in Singapore. The law will also be updated to address malicious cyber actors who target systems at the periphery or along supply chains. Dr Janil said Singapore must start “placing our alarms” at these places. It will require CII owners to additionally report incidents that affect computers that interconnect or communicate with the CII. The Government also wants to expand the Act to regulate a new Systems of Temporary Cybersecurity Concern. It deals with the cybersecurity of ICT systems that for a time-limited period are at high risk of cyberattacks and if compromised, would have a serious detrimental effect on Singapore's national interests. Provisions will also be introduced to cover new entities that could be attractive targets for malicious threat actors. These are Entities of Special Cybersecurity Interest, such as universities. Dr Janil told the House that the Bill is calibrated to address the risks to the nation, economy and Singapore’s way of life while balancing the compliance costs. He added that the Government will continue to refine its approach in consultation with stakeholders and consider new international practices as they emerge. Members of Parliament supported the Bill, although they also raised questions on how CSA would cope with more reports of cybersecurity incidents and the compliance costs associated with the new obligations. Ms Tin Pei Ling (PAP-Macpherson) wanted to know if the government would consider requiring CII owners to monitor and report incidents of those further down the supply chain - beyond their immediate suppliers - in the future. Given how entities could potentially be designated as STCCs or ESCIs, Nominated Member of Parliament Mark Lee asked how businesses will be informed of or reveal and appeal designations. Some MPs called for clarity on entities that fall under ESCI, which may hold sensitive information or perform a function of national interest. Nominated Member of Parliament Razwana Begum also raised concerns about the ambiguity of the terms “sensitive information” and “function of national interest”, pointing out that a lack of clear definition could lead to inconsistencies in regulatory decisions. Addressing concerns on increased compliance costs, Dr Janil said that neither the Cybersecurity Act nor the amendments proposed in the Bill imposes “cybersecurity obligations” on the business community at large. Instead, what the new law will do is regulate only the cybersecurity of systems infrastructure and services that are important at a national level because their disruption or compromise could affect Singapore’s survival, security, safety or other national interest, he said. “This is a known and finite set of systems and entities. Our approach is a targeted and calibrated one, precisely because we recognise that regulation will involve compliance costs,” Dr Janil added. “Some compliance costs cannot be avoided where regulation is concerned. It's something we are mindful of. We do not seek to regulate without good reason.” In Parliament on Tuesday (May 7), Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary responded to clarifications sought by Members of the House on the Cybersecurity (Amendment) Bill. The Bill was then passed. On designating entities as STCCs or ESCIs, Dr Janil highlighted that CSA’s practice has been and will be to provide “ample support” to regulated entities to guide them towards compliance. “This begins even before a system or an entity is designated,” he added. If CSA has reason to believe that a system or entity should be designated, the agency will first engage the owner to better understand the operating context, such as the cybersecurity measures that have already been implemented and the level of their cybersecurity capabilities, to ensure that any designation is appropriate. CSA will then work with the owner to assess what needs to be done for the entity or system to be in compliance with the Act as well as the support and lead time that the organisation needs, said Dr Janil. Entities that receive a designation notice can also appeal against it, while ​​a regulated entity may also appeal against CSA’s decisions, orders and directions as well as codes of practice and standards of performance, he added. Reiterating that he would not disclose any “specific real-life examples” of entities designated as ESCIs, Dr Janil said that publication and disclosure of an ESCI’s identity would be on a “case by case basis”. “The issue for consideration is not whether a regulated entity is a large company, an MNC (Multinational Corporation) or a SME (small-and-medium-size enterprises), the key consideration is whether a cyberattack on the entity could have serious implications on our national security or other national interests,” he added. “We do not take these decisions to impose obligations lightly.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

Private apartments in Farrer Park in Singapore. (Photo: Unsplash/Eugenia Clara) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has found 166 cases of private property purchases involving the “99-to-1” scheme as a means to avoid paying the additional buyer’s stamp duty (ABSD). Mr Chee Hong Tat, who was then Senior Minister of State for Finance, said in April last year that as part of its surveillance efforts, IRAS had detected a small but rising number of “99-to-1” arrangements in recent years and the authority had initiated audits of such transactions. IRAS, as of April, has completed the review of 187 such “99-to-1” cases, of which 166 cases were found to have involved tax avoidance, said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (May 7). \"About S$60 million (US$44 million) in ABSD and surcharges will accordingly be clawed back,\" he added. Mr Wong was responding to Ms He Ting Ru's (WP-Sengkang) parliamentary questions about the \"99-to-1\" scheme. She had asked about how many referrals had IRAS made to the Council for Estate Agencies and the Law Society in the course of its investigations, whether there were any findings to be shared on their results and if the government would look to assist private property buyers who have been \"misadvised\" by estate agents and lawyers to obtain compensation. On the \"99-to-1\" arrangement, Mr Wong said it is a \"tax avoidance arrangement used by some property buyers to reduce the rightful ABSD payable on the purchase of a residential property\". The government introduced ABSD as a tax in 2011 to manage demand for property. From Apr 27, 2023, Singaporeans must pay 20 per cent in ABSD , up from 17 per cent, when purchasing a second property, and 30 per cent on subsequent purchases. Those figures are higher for permanent residents and foreigners. ABSD is computed \"on the purchase price as stated in the dutiable document or the market value of the property\", whichever is the higher amount, according to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) website. There are two ways to buy property in Singapore when there are two owners: One would be joint tenancy, which is commonly used by couples, where both parties will have an equal share of the property. The second way would be tenancy-in-common, which is commonly used for investment properties. Under this structure, the co-owners own a specific number of shares in the property and this could be split in any ratio, such as 80 to 20. IRAS is looking into the second way – private property buyers who have entered into split agreements with the possible intention of avoiding ABSD. If the 99-to-1 intention is declared at the outset, the ABSD is payable as long as one party is an existing property owner. What IRAS is looking out for are cases of possible tax avoidance by buyers who have entered into a 99-to-1 scheme in which the 1 per cent stake is sold immediately after the purchase option is exercised. Using such an arrangement, where the 1 per cent stake is sold in the second stage, as an example: A Singaporean who owns a residential property buys a second. This means he is liable to pay ABSD of 20 per cent. If the property costs S$1 million (US$752,000) and he buys 1 per cent of this, his share of the property is S$10,000. Therefore, he has to pay 20 per cent of S$10,000 – that is, S$2,000 – as ABSD. When a residential property is jointly purchased by two or more buyers, the ABSD rate arising from the buyer with the highest ABSD profile will apply on the entire value of the purchase. Hence, when a single purchase is split up into two or more steps to reduce the tax payable, the Commissioner of Stamp Duties is empowered under Section 33A of the Stamp Duties Act to disregard the individual steps and assess stamp duty as a single joint purchase, and to recover the rightful amount of ABSD due. He explained that when such arrangements are made to reduce the tax payable, the Commissioner of Stamp Duties is empowered to \"disregard the individual transactions and assess them as a single joint purchase\". Mr Wong added that the commissioner is also empowered to recover the rightful amount of ABSD due, along with a 50 per cent surcharge. Of the 166 cases found to have involved tax avoidance, about 10 of them have evidence of potential involvement by property agents and are \"currently under review by the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA)\". Such audits are part of regular checks by Singapore's tax authority to uncover \"contrived or artificial\" setups that home buyers use to avoid paying tax or stamp duties. IRAS told CNA last April that if it determines that tax avoidance has taken place, it will recover the rightful amount of stamp duty and impose a 50 per cent surcharge on the additional duty payable. If the stamp duty and surcharge are not paid by the deadline, it can also impose penalties of up to four times the outstanding amount. IRAS added that the time frame does not matter and that audits can be conducted on any past cases or transactions. Mr Chee said in parliament last April that from 2018 to 2021, about 0.5 per cent of private residential properties transacted involved “99-to-1” or similar arrangements, and action will be taken against both buyers and property agents. In the case of property agents, IRAS will refer them to CEA for investigation and disciplinary action. \"Depending on the severity of the breach, agents may face financial penalties and/or suspension of their registrations,\" Mr Chee then said. IRAS will also refer individuals who promote or facilitate such tax avoidance arrangements to the relevant regulatory agencies, he added. In response to queries from CNA, CEA said on Friday that it \"takes a serious view of property agents who do not act responsibly and professionally\". \"Under the Council for Estate Agencies Code of Ethics and Professional Client Care, property agencies and their agents are required to conduct estate agency work with due diligence and care, and in compliance with all laws including statutory and regulatory requirements,\" a CEA spokesperson said. \"They must act ethically and honestly, and should not collaborate with or induce the client or any other person to engage in illegal, dishonest or unethical practices.\" The spokesperson added: \"We will take appropriate enforcement action against any property agencies or agents who breach the Code of Ethics and Professional Client Care when conducting estate agency work for their clients.\" Serious code breaches could result in disciplinary action from CEA's Disciplinary Committee, with errant property agencies facing financial penalties of up to S$200,000, the revocation or suspension of their licences, or both. Property agents referred to the Disciplinary Committee, meanwhile, could face penalties of up to S$100,000, the revocation or suspension of their registrations, or both. Minor code breaches can result in agencies and agents being censured, handed financial penalties of up to S$5,000, or both. The spokesperson declined to comment on the cases that have been referred to CEA as they are currently under investigation, but said: \"No agents have been investigated for their involvement in similar cases before.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore SINGAPORE: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is reviewing legal penalties to strengthen deterrence against the advertising, importation and distribution of e-vaporisers, said Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam on Wednesday (May 8). Speaking in parliament, Ms Rahayu said HSA has been monitoring illicit sales of e-vaporisers on social media, e-commerce and messaging platforms, as well as carrying out operations to remove e-vaporiser content. It is trying to expand its efforts, she added. She was responding to a question from MP Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (PAP-Choa Chu Kang), who had asked what strategies are in place to engage social media platforms and advertising on social media to raise awareness about the harms of vaping and to discourage the use of vapes among youths. In her reply, Ms Rahayu also responded to written questions from MP Wan Rizal (PAP-Jalan Besar). Singapore authorities handled around 8,000 vaping-related offences last year, representing a 43 per cent jump from the 5,600 similar offences recorded in 2022. A total of 7,600 offences were recorded in 2021. Vaping is illegal in Singapore and offenders can be fined up to S$2,000 (US$1,478) for the possession, use and purchase of vapes. Those who import, distribute or sell such products face stiffer penalties, including a higher fine and a possible jail term. Currently, the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act prohibits advertisement of e-vaporisers. However, like all domestic laws, the Act applies to vaping-related content published in Singapore and by Singapore-connected persons or entities, she said. \"The internet and social media is a global ecosystem, and having domestic laws that ban harmful content or advertisements does not mean these materials would not come from a foreign source or a foreign influencer,\" Ms Rahayu added. She added that authorities are \"not without agency\" and elaborated on a number of measures in place. There is a global rise in the use of e-vaporisers among youths. Marketing for e-vaporisers, including through social media and influencers, is largely targeted at youths, which contributed to its widespread usage amongst this age group. Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam said this in reply to MPs' questions in Parliament on Wednesday (May 8). She added that while the Tobacco Act applies to all vaping-related content published in Singapore and by Singapore-connected persons or entities, the Internet and social media is a global ecosystem and having these domestic laws does not mean that harmful content or advertisements would not come from a foreign source or foreign influencer. She highlighted several measures that have been put in place by the Ministry of Health (MOH), including allowing enforcement action to be taken against platforms found with inadequate processes to detect and remove vaping-related content. She also said that the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has been monitoring illicit sales of e-vaporisers via social media, e-commerce and messaging platforms and carrying out operations to remove such content. HSA is also reviewing the legal penalties to strengthen the deterrence against the advertising, importation and distribution of e-vaporisers, said Ms Rahayu. For one, social media and e-commerce platforms are aware that under the Tobacco Act, they are expected to exercise \"due diligence\" and actively remove vaping-related content that target Singapore residents, said Ms Rahayu. Enforcement actions may be taken against platforms that are found with inadequate processes to detect and remove vaping-related content, she added. Responding to a supplementary question from Mr Rizal, Ms Rahayu said that the Health Ministry and HSA issued a Letter of Notice to 16 social media services and e-commerce platforms in March to remind them that hosting vaping-related content is in breach of the Act. In addition, under the Code of Practice for Online Safety, the Infocomm Media Development Authority has designated social media services with \"significant reach or impact\" such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, to minimise users’ exposure to harmful content. Ms Rahayu added that even as the authorities remove e-vaporisers content, it tries to increase \"pro-health\" content. For instance, the Health Promotion Board launched a vape-free campaign last year, targeting youths and younger adults.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Israel's embassy is covered by sovereign immunity in its actions relating to its Facebook post about Palestine. Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam speaking in parliament on May 8, 2024. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Israel's ambassador to Singapore met Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam last week when he apologised for a Facebook post on Palestine that the embassy published in March. Ambassador Eliyahu Vered Hazan said it was wrong for the post to have been put up, that it was not authorised by him, and that the officer responsible will be sent back, Mr Shanmugam said on Wednesday (May 8). \"And he said that this will never happen again,\" Mr Shanmugam told parliament. The minister was responding to a question by Member of Parliament Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (PAP-Chua Chu Kang), who asked whether further steps would be taken in this matter and whether the person responsible would enjoy diplomatic immunity. On Mar 24, the official Facebook account of Israel's embassy in Singapore published a post containing claims comparing mentions of Israel and Palestine in the Quran. The post said: \"Israel is mentioned 43 times in the Quran. On the other hand, Palestine is not mentioned even once. \"Each and every archaeological evidence – maps, documents, coins, link the land of Israel to the Jewish people as the indigenous people of the land.\" The post was deleted later that same day. Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs had informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which told Israel's embassy that the post had to be taken down immediately. The minister said that the police received a report on the post, and assessed in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers that \"no further action was to be taken\". \"The Israeli embassy's actions are covered by the principle of sovereign immunity,\" Mr Shanmugam said on Wednesday. According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, diplomats are immune from criminal jurisdiction in their host country, although immunity can be waived by the diplomat's state. The meeting with Mr Shanmugam was requested by Israel's ambassador. The minister said: \"I pointed out to him that embassies are entitled to have their point of view. \"But where what has been said affects Singapore, in this case the harmony and safety within Singapore, especially the security as well of our minority communities, we have to step in.\" Mr Shanmugam also provided an update on reports of alleged offensive remarks or actions against the Jewish or Muslim communities in Singapore. Between Oct 7, 2023 and Mar 31, 2024, the police received 43 such reports, he said. A previous update stated that the police received eight such reports in October 2023. Describing the conflict in the Middle East as \"emotionally charged\", Mr Shanmugam said deeply held feelings can result in words or actions that offend other communities. Divides can be seen especially between Singapore's Malay-Muslim community on the one hand, and the Jewish and Christian communities on the other. Mr Shanmugam said the government will intervene against acts that can affect social harmony. He also said that overseas protests about the conflict have often turned violent. \"They may start off well-intentioned, led by honest, idealistic people,\" he said. \"Often, there is a group which has legitimate aims, wants to be peaceful. \"But there are often others who use these events where people gather to then engineer violence and put the police on the defensive, and try and egg the police on to try and engage in forcibly preventing acts of violence, and then it escalates.\" He continued: \"Our own view is that if we allow protests on this issue, initially it may be peaceful, but over time, as the protests take a life of their own, there could be some violence, breach of the peace and law, occupying of buildings.\" Individuals who engage in offensive or violent conduct are \"a very small minority\" in Singapore, he acknowledged. \"Even where views on the conflict have differed, people in Singapore have been relatively measured and rational in the way we have approached the issues,\" the minister said. He added that the government will work to build mutual trust and understanding across Singapore's ethnic and religious communities, at the leadership and people-to-people levels.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Early adopters who had installed their processing unit on the passenger side can opt to switch it over to the driver’s side for free, says the Minister for Transport. For motorcycles, the OBU components - a processing unit, an antenna and a touchscreen display - are integrated into a single unit. (Photo: CNA/Hanidah Amin) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The one-piece ERP 2.0 on-board unit (OBU) used for motorcycles cannot be used for cars, as the “greenhouse effect” within a car can make it too hot for such a device to be placed on the dashboard. On Wednesday (May 8) in parliament, Minister for Transport Chee Hong Tat explained the rationale for cars requiring a three-piece OBU. Issues related to the device, including its multiple parts and placement within the vehicle, have caused considerable consternation among motorists. Specifically, Mr Chee was responding to a question by Member of Parliament Lim Wee Kiak (PAP-Sembawang), who had asked why a one-piece OBU could not be used for both motorcycles and cars. “If you think about the physics of it, in an enclosed environment with glass, it is like a greenhouse … which will cause the interior of the car in an enclosed space to be warmer,” replied Mr Chee. He said tests had shown it was \"quite clear\" that both footwells - driver and passenger - experienced significantly lower temperatures than that of the dashboard on a sunny day. “The ambient temperature: If it's about 35 degrees - for the motorcycle, (it) is pretty much that because it's not an enclosed space,” said Mr Chee. For the footwell of a car, he added, temperatures can go up to 38 to 39 degrees Celsius and on the dashboard, as high as 50 to 52 degrees Celsius. “With this kind of temperature, if you were to put a single-piece OBU, which means the antenna, the display, and the processing unit all on the dashboard, there is a risk that it could overheat, and then it will affect the functionality of this unit,” he said. A cooling fan could be incorporated into the OBU's design, but this would make the system very bulky. “I don't think motorists will want a very big and bulky one piece unit on their dashboard. It would not be the right design,” he said. Mr Chee added that early adopters who had installed their processing unit on the passenger side could opt to switch it over to the driver’s side without charge. “I think that is fair because when they installed earlier, they were not given an option,” said Mr Chee. “But if some of them now want to do it, we will offer this reconfiguration for them free of charge.” Mr Chee also responded to another question by Dr Lim on the installation of the processing unit at the driver's footwell ever since the Land Transport Authority made it clear last week it was an option. The processing unit holds payment cards, also known as CEPAS cards, such as the NETS FlashPay card, NETS Motoring Card and EZ-Link Motoring Card, which drivers use to pay for electronic road pricing or parking charges. Dr Lim referenced a CNA article citing concerns by car mechanics that installing the processing unit at the driver's footwell may also come with its own set of complications. Referring to the article, Mr Chee agreed with the assessment of the mechanics. “It's not so straightforward for all vehicle makes and models, because depending on the design and the layout and specifications of different vehicles, the preferred location, the ideal location (of the processing unit) may vary from vehicle to vehicle,” he said. He added that the compromise for having choices was more complexity in the installation process. “But we think this trade-off is important because we do need to respect the individual choices of vehicle owners,” he said. The Transport Minister said he is among the 18,000 motorists who have installed the OBU in their vehicles so far. He too, like many early adopters, had concerns about reaching his payment card conveniently if he had to use complimentary parking tickets. “That's why I was very happy when LTA developed that feature where I could just deactivate the card by pressing a button on the touchscreen display,” Mr Chee said. “Now I can do that very conveniently, I do not need to take my card in and out.” Replacing the whole OBU with a smartphone is not feasible because usage-based charging requires the device to be attached to the car, said Mr Chee, responding to a question by Workers’ Party MP Gerald Giam (Aljunied). A smartphone is “something that you carry with you; it's not secured to the vehicle”, said Mr Chee. For the purposes of ERP - whether distance- or usage-based - a device needs to be secured to the vehicle “so that you know where the vehicle is, and there's no dispute about whether the device is functioning or not”. He added that smartphones would not be able to provide the same level of data and systems security as the current OBU. However, using smartphones as a device for displaying information would be feasible. “We have studied that option and we are going to allow people to opt out of (using the OBU touchscreen) and to use a smartphone or their in-vehicle display if they wish to,” said Mr Chee.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Both Israel and Hamas have made no secret of the fact that once the ceasefire is over, they will again go at each other with hammer and tongs, says Carl Skadian, senior associate director at the Middle East Institute, NUS. This audio is generated by an AI tool. BAHRAIN: At the opening panel of the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain on Saturday (Nov 18), White House adviser Brett McGurk, one of the speakers, hinted at what was to come in the war between Israel and Hamas . Mr McGurk, the Middle East Coordinator at the United States’ National Security Council, told the audience that the “release of a large number of hostages would result in a significant pause in fighting and a massive surge in humanitarian relief”. It was a point he made several times, adding that Hamas had said that “if you want the hostages returned, we need fuel, more humanitarian supplies”. His statement shows how neither side is willing to budge in the war, which is now well into its second month . For Israel and its main ally, the US, the message was: Release the hostages, and aid and a truce would follow. Hamas’ counter: Impose a ceasefire first, then we will release hostages. On Wednesday, news broke that a deal had been agreed . The start time for a ceasefire will be announced within the next 24 hours and is expected to last at least four days. In return for the pause in fighting, 50 women and children held hostage by Hamas will be freed. Details are sketchy, but the good news is that some hostages - in total, about 240 people were kidnapped by Hamas during its Oct 7 attacks - perhaps those most vulnerable, will soon be reunited with their loved ones. It has been reported that in addition to Israeli citizens, more than half the hostages hold foreign and dual citizenship from about 40 countries including the US, Thailand, Britain, France, Argentina, Germany, Chile, Spain and Portugal. At the same time, Israel will release 150 Palestinians prisoners and allow hundreds of trucks of humanitarian, medical and fuel aid to enter Gaza. The deal spotlights again how both sides in the conflict have used civilians to further their aims. Israel’s pounding of Gaza was partly aimed at getting them freed, while Hamas took hostages knowing it could command a price for them. Based on previous instances, we can be sure that the cost of securing the freedom of the remaining hostages, particularly if they are soldiers, will be much higher - in 2011, Israel exchanged 1,027 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners for a single trooper, Gilad Shalit, who was captured five years earlier. The impending release of hostages, a pause in fighting, and the flow of aid are welcome developments. The truce and flow of aid, in particular, will bring untold relief to Palestinian non-combatants, who have borne the brunt of fighting. Sadly, that is likely the only good news we are going to get in a while. In effect, the deal relieves pressure on both sides of the fight. Israeli citizens have turned up the heat on their government to do more on the hostage front. Hamas, meanwhile, has been roundly condemned internationally for holding women and children. Both sides have made no secret of the fact that once the ceasefire is over, they will again go at each other with hammer and tongs. Before the pause in fighting was formally announced, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took to the airwaves to debunk any notion that it would lead to wider moves. “We are at war, and we’ll continue this war until we meet all our objectives,” he said. For its part, Hamas warned in a statement that “our hands will remain on the trigger”, among other things. In effect, what both sides are saying is that they will keep fighting until the other is gone. That likely means the gloves will come off once the truce lapses, rather than a prelude to intense negotiations to arrive at a peaceful solution. One can only hope that will not be the case.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary There were high stakes and low expectations for the in-person dialogue between China’s President Xi Jinping and US’ Joe Biden, but it offers some hope for the rest of the world, says Yale-NUS College’s Trisha Craig. US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a bilateral meeting at Filoli estate on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, in Woodside, California, US, Nov 15, 2023. (Photo: Reuters/Kevin Lamarque) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The face-to-face dialogue between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden on Wednesday (Nov 15) in San Francisco was seen by both sides as a chance to reset the tone of the world’s most important bilateral relationship and reduce the chances of tensions escalating into more serious conflict. While the meeting is high-stakes, the expectations around outcomes were deliberately set low. It concluded with both sides claiming progress and mutual respect, and a clear sense that they have to mutually co-exist. Mr Biden said they had to manage their competition responsibly and noted they needed to find areas of mutual interest. Neither country could turn its back on the other, said Mr Xi, adding: “Planet Earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed”. In that sense, the summit achieved its goal of keeping channels of communication open, which is a key factor in ensuring global stability. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated to their most tense level in 40 years but had improved somewhat amid recent visits by senior officials. Ahead of the leaders’ encounter at the start of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum , the White House cautioned against assuming that it would produce a long list of outcomes or deliverables. Neither was a joint statement on the table, as would be often produced at such summits. Still, both sides had goals beyond lowering tensions. For the US, Mr Biden in particular had signalled the desire to resume military-to-military communications . These were suspended by China, as a sign of displeasure at then US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in August 2022. Other topics, such as cooperation on areas like climate change and the narcotic fentanyl, were suggested areas of progress. On these fronts, Mr Biden seemed to have got what he wanted, with the resumption of military communications and China’s agreement to curb production of fentanyl. Sceptics though might point out that former US president Donald Trump had also secured a similar promise from Mr Xi in 2018. For China, the meeting came at a time of significant economic slowdown. Progress would look like US messaging that it was not pursuing a strategy of “decoupling” or an all-out economic war. It was also looking for reassurance from the US that it does not support Taiwanese independence . The bigger issues of contention, such as Taiwan (amid Mr Biden’s reiteration of the US’ unchanged commitment to a one-China policy), trade restrictions or China’s role in global conflicts, remain far from settled. No amount of dialogue between the two nations’ leaders is likely to change these. Looming in the background of the summit is the 2024 US presidential election, with Mr Biden trailing in the polls against the expected Trump candidacy. With more than 80 per cent of Americans expressing a negative view of China, any concessions around trade would be politically disastrous, even when a lifting of restrictions could achieve something the US public wants - lower inflation. For the Chinese, a change in the US administration offers a complicated picture. A better working relationship with Mr Biden might not count for much if this could be their last meeting. A second Trump presidency portends a more intensified trade war and restrictions on China. At the same time, in contrast to most Republican presidential candidates, Trump has not taken a clear position of support towards Taiwan. A decrease in US support for Ukraine, as Trump has indicated he favours, could remove one of the more uncomfortable elements in Xi’s “no-limits” partnership with Russian President Vladimir Putin. For the rest of the world, the summit offers some hope that a return to dialogue between the superpowers may help smoothen the bumpy future of US-China relations.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary After a bumpy first year in power and challenges from a feisty opposition, Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's new Cabinet line-up reflects his strengthened political grip. His challenge now is to deliver on economic reforms, says CNA's Leslie Lopez. This audio is generated by an AI tool. KUALA LUMPUR: The immediate takeaway from Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's first shake-up of his ministerial line-up since taking power over a year ago is that he is now firmly in charge. Compared to the first team that was based on compromises with partners in a unity government after an inconclusive general election, Mr Anwar assembled his new team this week with a mandate of more than a two-thirds majority in the 222-member parliament. His position has been further bolstered in recent weeks with five elected representatives from the opposition pledging support for his government, amid speculation of more to follow. The new line-up features five new ministers and the appointment of a trusted technocrat as second-in-command at the finance ministry, which Mr Anwar will continue to helm, reassignments and the return of several experienced hands to give the Cabinet more depth. The original Cabinet, which had 28 ministers, now has been expanded to 31. On paper, the ministerial rejig by Mr Anwar is clearly aimed to better suit his pledge to spur Malaysia’s economy, which has slowed considerably after expanding 8.7 per cent in 2022. The appointment of technocrat Amir Hamzah Azizan, who stepped down as CEO of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) to take up the position of second finance minister, will provide the operational support at the ministry, while Mr Anwar can ensure that the management of the national cash register does not become open to the rent-seeking practices of the past that led to many financial scandals, such as the fiasco at state-owned 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB). The breaking up of the Communications and Digital Ministry, with seasoned elected Member of Parliament Gobind Singh Deo heading the newly minted Digital Minister, is a reflection of the government's determination to become more aggressive in the digitalisation of the national economy. Fahmi Fadzil will continue to lead the communications arms, which Mr Anwar recently acknowledged needed more improvement, particularly in communicating national policies to the public. Mr Anwar also broke up the Ministry of National Resource and Climate Change that was headed by a loyalist, Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad, who will now lead the newly formed Ministry of Natural Resource and Sustainability. Fadhillah Yusof, one of Malaysia’s two deputy prime ministers and a powerful politician from the Sarawak state, has been appointed to the new portfolio of energy transition and public utilities, while remaining in charge of the affairs of Borneo states that include Sabah. Mr Anwar added depth to the new line-up with the appointment of Johari Abdul Ghani, a powerful politician from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), to the Plantation and Commodities Ministry that was previously headed by Mr Fadhillah. There was also a strong political dimension to a set of reassignments involving ministers from UMNO , a key component in Mr Anwar’s coalition. Defence minister Mohamad Hasan, who is also UMNO deputy president, will be moved to the foreign ministry, replacing Zambry Abdul Kadir, who is moving to the higher education ministry. Another UMNO stalwart Khaled Nodrin will leave the higher education ministry to take over the defence portfolio. The moves involving the UMNO ministers came as a result of some lobbying by the party president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi , who is also one of the deputy prime ministers in the current government. UMNO is seeking to repair its scandal-scarred reputation among the politically dominant Malay community. Mr Ahmad Zahid has tasked Mr Zambry to lead the party’s political renewal plan and he appealed to Mr Anwar in recent weeks to move the UMNO politician to a ministry that would not require too much overseas travel, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. Now that Mr Anwar has successfully negotiated the politics of government formation, the pressure is on him to deliver with the economic reforms.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary The effects of the strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen will likely ripple far and wide, but might not deter further Red Sea attacks, says Carl Skadian, senior associate director at the Middle East Institute, NUS. An RAF Typhoon aircraft takes off to join the US-led coalition from RAF Akrotiri to conduct air strikes against military targets in Yemen on Jan 12, 2024. (Photo: Sgt Lee Goddard/UK MOD/Handout via Reuters) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The strikes against the Houthis by a United States-led coalition, while not unexpected, have significantly widened the conflict in the Middle East, despite Washington’s efforts to contain it over the past few months. The air and sea strikes by the US and some of its allies on Thursday (Jan 11) against about a dozen Houthi military targets in Yemen had been widely telegraphed: A “last warning” was issued last week, but the Iran-backed Houthis vowed not to back down. On Jan 9, the militants made good on their word, launching what was described by US Central Command as a “complex attack” using drones and anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles, all of which were shot down by coalition forces. That attack was widely viewed as the straw that would break the camel’s back - an assessment proved correct by Thursday’s strikes. The anti-Houthi operation now risks dragging the US deeper into the Middle Eastern quagmire. Although the strikes aimed to thread the needle - by attempting to cripple the Houthis’ ability to continue attacks against shipping, rather than more escalatory moves such as targeting the group’s leaders or its Iranian advisers - whether they will prove to be a deterrent is far from clear. Indeed, the Houthis appear to relish an open confrontation with the US. In the wake of last week’s warnings, the group’s leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, was reported as saying in the New York Times that the “Yemeni people … are comfortable with a direct confrontation with the Americans”. The group has now vowed to respond, warning that the US and the United Kingdom will pay a “heavy price” for their “blatant aggression”. There are relatively low costs for the Houthis to continue even limited attacks against shipping: Even a single attack on a ship would allow it to claim a psychologically significant win over US might. Meanwhile, Iran, though reluctant to get directly involved in a confrontation with the West, will likely ratchet up actions by its proxies. The effects of Thursday’s events will likely ripple far and wide. Already, oil prices have surged by more than 2 per cent. With the prospect of increased violence in the Red Sea, more shippers are expected to avoid sending vessels through the area and will instead opt for the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope, leading to lengthier shipping times and increased costs. Thursday’s seizure of an oil tanker off the Omani coast by the Iranian Navy will add to the fears. Just as important is the battle over the narrative in the wake of Israel’s campaign in Gaza. While the US and its allies have painted their actions in the Red Sea as an effort to protect global commerce, the Houthis have linked theirs directly to the war, openly stating they want to force Israel to halt its offensive and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. As Tel Aviv pursues its campaign unabated, global opinion is increasingly arrayed against it and the US. That risks painting the Red Sea operation less as a campaign to protect freedom of navigation than one that directly supports Israel’s prosecution of the war in Gaza. As of now, the former retains traction: The United Nations Security Council voted 11-0 in favour of a resolution condemning Houthi attacks against shipping earlier this week. The challenge for the coalition is to keep its narrative valid. Its strongest argument for this is the continuing havoc being wreaked on the global economy by Houthi actions, which has consequences for us all.

It is important to note that he is innocent until proven guilty, says SMU associate professor of law Eugene K B Tan. Former Transport Minister S Iswaran arriving at the State Courts on Jan 18, 2024, when he was charged with multiple offences including corruption. (Photo: CNA/Jeremy Long) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Singapore’s consistent zero tolerance against corruption was underscored on Thursday (Jan 18) when former Transport Minister S Iswaran was handed 27 criminal charges , related to his dealings with property billionaire Ong Beng Seng. The case is a body blow to the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) and the government, which has long prided itself and benefited from the commitment to clean governance and incorruptibility. But the damage has been managed by the swift and resolute action taken. While there is no perfect system and zero corruption is an aspiration, what Iswaran's case might show up will come under intense scrutiny. Any judgment failures and leadership inadequacies will feature long after the investigations and the judicial process are concluded. Of the 27 charges, 24 are for obtaining valuable items as a public servant. They may seem minor if we only consider the dollar value of the things Iswaran is accused of receiving, among which were tickets to football matches and musicals . But the quantum is not at the heart of the issue. Section 165 makes it an offence for a public servant to accept or obtain, or attempt to do so, a gift from a party with whom they have official dealings - even if there is no evidence of any official favour shown. Such a gift creates a conflict of interest - whether real, apparent or potential. All are problematic, especially for a minister. These 24 charges are just as serious as the two charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act - involving gifts allegedly in relation to public contracts - and one charge for obstructing justice. The case has inevitably attracted comments that high ministerial salaries do not stop corruption. But high salaries never were intended to be the perfect antidote, and never will be. They are but one of a suite of measures to having a strong Cabinet. It is important to pay our elected officials and civil servants salaries that recognise their role and contributions and to attract individuals of calibre. But high salaries also mean that they are held to high standards of probity and performance. One surprise in court on Thursday was that Mr Ong, who was also arrested last year, was not charged. But it is not uncommon, in a corruption case, for the Public Prosecutor to proceed first against the alleged receiver of the bribe. Under Singapore’s corruption laws, it is an offence for both the giver and receiver of a bribe. The Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) approach signals the strong public interest in ensuring that the case against Iswaran be dealt with swiftly and resolutely and with due process. Mr Ong is not out of the woods and he can be expected to be a prosecution witness. AGC said it will decide how best to proceed against Mr Ong after the case against Iswaran has concluded. But it is also important to note that Iswaran is innocent until proven guilty . This is a fundamental precept of Singapore’s criminal justice system and due process must be observed scrupulously. In his Jan 16 letter resigning from his positions in government , Iswaran rejected the allegations and “will now focus on clearing (his) name”. The Public Prosecutor must now provide the necessary evidence and persuade the court that the offences had been committed. There will definitely be a political price to pay, but this is indeterminate for now. Regardless of the outcome of the criminal case, the PAP’s challenge is to rebuild trust and confidence that it can and does uphold the high standards it sets for itself.

The attacks were widely expected, given that a clearly telegraphed US red line was crossed when American troops were killed in a strike on an outpost in Jordan . Indeed, President Joe Biden had said earlier in the week that he had decided on what the American response would be. The only questions were when the US would retaliate and the form it would take. But while unsurprising, there are several takeaways from the US action. The first is that this is just the start. There will be more actions in the days to come: In a statement, Mr Biden said “our response began today. It will continue at times and places of our choosing”. Also of note was the muscularity of the US action. The attacks were reportedly carried out by B-1B bombers dispatched from America, not assets that had been deployed to the Middle East. This demonstrates the reach of US power, and sends a clear warning to Iran and its proxies. Before the attacks, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin noted that Iran and its allies “have a lot of capability”. But, he added pointedly: “I have more”. The “gas and go” mission by bombers flying thousands of kilometres non-stop demonstrated this. By not using in-theatre assets, the Americans have signalled both their reach and that they have plenty of power in reserve. It should not be overlooked that no attacks were carried out on Iran itself. In the days since US troops were killed, there was much speculation over whether Washington would go after Tehran. This resulted in a climbdown from the Islamic Republic, which said it was not looking to go to war with the US, as well as the group believed to be behind the fatal attack in Jordan, Kata’ib Hezbollah. Earlier this week, it said it would suspend operations against US forces in the region - recognition that it had gone a step too far. The Iranians were not totally unscathed, however. Washington has announced sanctions against senior members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps , as well as criminal charges against several people who had a direct role in funding Hamas and Hezbollah. The effects of these actions are negligible, however. Iran has long been under wide-ranging strictures, and the latest moves are unlikely to make things much worse for it. What remains to be seen is whether both sides will decide that enough is enough, after all is said and done. Iran will have to tread even more carefully now after the latest round of strikes. It must know that despite the latest US action, pressure is mounting on Mr Biden to do more. Already, some Republicans have decried the American strikes as less than muscular. The president will have little wiggle room if Tehran does not get the message, more so since this is an election year. In the Middle East, however, it is often said - with good reason - that there are no good options, only bad ones and worse ones.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Former prime minister Najib Razak could be released from prison as early as August 2026, after his sentence for his role in the 1MDB corruption scandal was halved. Whatever the reasons for the decision, the political implications are vast, says ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute’s James Chai. Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak escorted by prison officers as he leaves the court after court proceedings in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on Jan 19, 2024. (Photo: Reuters/Hasnoor Hussain) This audio is generated by an AI tool. KUALA LUMPUR: After days of intense speculation, it is now official: Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak will be released from jail earlier than expected . The Pardons Board has decided to halve the sentence – from 12 years to 6 years – and reduce the fine - from RM210 million (US$44.5 million) to RM50 million, by 76 per cent. No reasons were given in the board’s announcement on Friday (Feb 2) . The language was careful: No mention of the king’s prerogative; no mention of the word “pardon”. The only qualification was that if the fine imposed is not paid on time, one year will be added to his prison sentence. That means his earliest release date is on Aug 23, 2028. Should Najib qualify for parole for good behaviour, he could be free by August 2026 after serving two-thirds of the new jail term. Whatever the background and legal powers of the decision, the political implications are vast, as Najib’s shadow continue to loom large in Malaysia’s “grand old party”, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), and Malaysian politics. UMNO diehards still believe that Najib’s return to politics is a prerequisite to UMNO’s revival from its lowest point in history. They believe in Najib’s main defence: That he is a victim of a system that did not sufficiently support him to act against the massive fraud of 1MDB happening behind his back. That is why from the day Najib was sentenced to jail, his supporters have been clinging on to the hope of a royal pardon that could bring him back to action, even hopefully as prime minister again. Now that hope is fulfilled – albeit partially. Najib’s age matters a lot here. If he does not receive any sentence reduction, he will be 81 years old when released in 2034. If Najib walks free in 2026, he will be 73 years old – not significantly older than the past four prime ministers when they assumed office. However, the Pardons Board made no mention of the five-year ban from politics, as laid out in the constitution, that typically succeeds a prison sentence. Even if Najib is released on 2026, he has to wait till August 2031 before contesting in any election, guaranteeing him to miss at least one election cycle. Of course, Najib’s influence is not only limited to elections. Returning in 2026 could already guarantee his place in UMNO, using his flagship “Bossku” (my boss) branding to reinvigorate his base. The current UMNO president, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, could now tell his party that he has fulfilled his promise of pursuing a pardon for Najib, and this is the fruit of his labour. While this success could help him hold on to the presidency for a few years, the pressure for Najib to take over the reins will start to build. Mr Ahmad Zahid would have to make another political manoeuvre to keep Najib friendly but at bay. The irony for UMNO is that while this carries the promise of a strategic turnaround, it risks driving fence-sitter voters further away from the party. Its rapid electoral decline is not attributed to its opponent, Perikatan Nasional’s strength, but also its own corruption scandals and a leadership rejuvenation that never came. Besides completing his PhD, now Najib will also spend his time in jail counting down the days to his release. He might be plotting a glorious comeback and imagine an adoring crowd waiting for him as he takes his first steps as a free man. But in that crowd, there will not be the hopeful voters who dreamt of a corruption-free Malaysia. They will be his unwavering loyalists, who remember only his glory and none of his flaws.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary While the official presidential election result is yet to be confirmed, it looks highly likely that the near future of Indonesia will be significantly shaped by the dynamics between Prabowo Subianto and Joko Widodo, says Indonesia analyst Dedi Dinarto. Presidential candidate and Indonesia's Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto (centre) during a gathering with supporters after polls closed in the country’s presidential and legislative elections in Jakarta on Feb 14, 2024. (Photo: AFP/Yasuyoshi Chiba) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Initial results from pollsters’ quick counts indicate that Prabowo Subianto, a former military general and persistent contender in Indonesia’s presidential race, has clinched a decisive victory over his rivals , Anies Baswedan and Ganjar Pranowo. Exit polls show that Mr Prabowo, alongside his running mate, Gibran Rakabuming Raka , won around 60 per cent of the national vote. If the final results confirm that they won more than 50 per cent of the vote , Mr Prabowo and Mr Gibran will assume office in October this year. While the official result might not come until next month, the strong likelihood is that we are seeing how the public perceives Prabowo-Gibran as the successor to President Joko Widodo, who has served Indonesia for two terms . But would Mr Prabowo be a worthy successor to Mr Jokowi? In their campaign platform, Mr Prabowo and Mr Gibran pledged to uphold Mr Jokowi’s policies, emphasising “continuity” as the cornerstone of their political agenda. Mr Jokowi’s influence would persist in a Prabowo administration via his eldest son, Mr Gibran. As the vice president, Mr Gibran’s role would be pivotal in shaping policy decisions, ensuring that Mr Prabowo’s administration remains under Mr Jokowi’s oversight. Mr Prabowo’s priorities align closely with Mr Jokowi’s emphasis on advancing value-added manufacturing, expanding infrastructure, and developing the new capital, Nusantara. However, certain campaign promises , such as a free school lunch programme, should be taken with a grain of salt because they are unlikely to be financially viable and would potentially strain the state budget. Under Mr Prabowo, Indonesia would continue to court foreign investment to foster economic growth. Mr Prabowo is likely to strengthen trade and investment ties with China , building on the groundwork laid by Mr Jokowi over the past decade. However, closer economic cooperation with China will not come at the expense of weakened ties with other countries. Like his predecessors, Mr Prabowo would not compromise Indonesia’s foreign policy principle of non-alignment. He would continue to engage with all countries, as long as there are political and economic benefits coming from the cooperation. To ensure the stability of an administration under him, Mr Prabowo is expected to emulate Mr Jokowi’s footsteps of forming a broad coalition in parliament. Working with political parties supporting his rivals is essential for effective governance and the enactment of laws and regulations. Should Mr Prabowo succeed in forming the grand alliance, it will result in weakened parliamentary opposition. However, failing to do so would create a strong opposition in parliament, which could prevent his administration from running effectively. Despite the anticipated continuity, a Prabowo-Jokowi alliance faces inherent risks. In Indonesia, political alliances tend to be transactional and hence susceptible to change. Considering Mr Prabowo’s ambitious and self-directed personality, it is plausible for Mr Prabowo if he becomes president to eventually assert independence from Mr Jokowi’s influence. The future of Indonesia in the next five years will be significantly shaped by the post-election dynamics between Mr Prabowo and Mr Jokowi. The succession of Mr Jokowi’s legacy under Mr Prabowo will depend on how committed both men are to their alliance. Barring any friction cropping up in their alliance or any shocks in the final outcome of the election, 270 million Indonesians will see an echo of Mr Jokowi’s administration in the next five years, this time under different leadership.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary With the SkillsFuture Credit top-up, access to subsidised diploma and a training allowance, individuals could be pulled towards upskilling proactively instead of being pushed by circumstances, says NTU economics assistant professor Chua Yeow Hwee. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme is a bold commitment to support continuous learning and professional development for Singapore’s workforce. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong announced in his Budget 2024 speech on Friday (Feb 16) that mid-career Singaporeans aged 40 and above will receive a S$4,000 top-up in SkillsFuture credit , sizeable subsidies to pursue a second full-time diploma and a monthly training allowance for those who enrol in selected full-time courses. This initiative has the potential to inspire individuals to take upskilling more seriously - to pull towards upskilling proactively instead of being pushed by circumstances. As individuals assume responsibility of their learning, an increase in productivity and innovation in the economy should follow. The focus on proactive learning is no surprise. The Progressive Wage Model is built on similar thinking, with emphasis on a skills-income ladder rather than a traditional minimum wage scheme seen overseas. There are two key economic factors that could contribute to the paradigm change in upskilling. Working adults are all too familiar with the concept of opportunity cost - the benefits of upskilling and reskilling are seldom guaranteed, but the sacrifices are plain to see. Beyond the time and effort invested in training, there is often a loss of income during this period. Many mid-career Singaporeans , especially those with school-going children and elderly parents, will thus find it challenging to pursue a diploma and upskill due to their financial obligations. On the one hand, a monthly training allowance will directly alleviate these financial concerns, enabling them to enrol in classes with greater confidence. On the other hand, the credit, subsidies and allowances are more confined in scope to selected programmes, notably full-time courses, for more quality learning and hopefully better employability . Amid economic uncertainty and the spectre of layoffs, it will certainly cost workers more if they lack relevant and transferable skills. The remaining challenge then will be our own behavioural biases. We are often aware of what is beneficial for us - we know we should save for rainy days, exercise more regularly and continuously enhance our skills. Yet, due to behavioural biases like the status quo bias, we often struggle to make meaningful progress towards our goal. Consequently, we may lack the motivation to do meaningful action such as upskilling until it is too late, where we face challenges in the labour force. As a major policy initiative, the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme has the ability to mitigate these behavioural biases as skills upgrading is made more salient. With the attractive financial benefits, the initiative can help overcome the inertia associated with inaction. Additionally, households might feel that they are missing out on the benefits and subsidies should they choose not to pursue another full-time course. Coupled with the influence of peer effects, this could eventually create a movement of continuous learning. Let us keep the conversation going.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary The announced changes to the Central Provident Fund system can have incremental but meaningful effects on Singaporeans’ retirement adequacy, says the Institute of Policy Studies’ Christopher Gee. An elderly couple cross the road in Toa Payoh on Feb 8, 2024. Central Provident Fund (CPF) members aged at least 55 will no longer have a Special Account from 2025 onwards, but they will be able to put more money into their Retirement Accounts. (File photo: CNA/Jeremy Long) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: In his Budget statement on Friday (Feb 16), Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong announced higher Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rates for those aged 55 to 65 years by 1.5 percentage points, beginning in 2025. The current rates are 31 per cent for those aged 55 to 60 and 22 per cent for those aged 60 to 65. This is among adjustments made since the last three annual Budgets to improve the retirement adequacy outcomes of Singaporeans. This year’s Budget announcement of CPF contribution rates will mean that we are getting ever closer to long-term targets recommended in the 2019 Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers report for strengthening older workers’ retirement adequacy. The announced contribution rate increases can have incremental but meaningful effects on older workers’ retirement adequacy. Assuming one works consistently from ages 55 to 65, that CPF member’s Retirement Account balance would be boosted by S$200 for every S$100 of wages earned over 10 years. This takes into account interest earned in the Retirement Account and would be capped at prevailing monthly CPF wage ceilings . The CPF Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS), the maximum amount that Singaporeans can place in their Retirement Accounts to secure the highest CPF Life payouts will also be increased to four times the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), up from three times. The effect of such a change is that a member with the higher ERS of S$426,000 from 2025 would be able to receive monthly payouts of S$3,330 as compared to S$2,530 if the member’s Retirement Account only had the current ERS of S$319,500. With foreseeable higher cost of living in the future, this will help Singaporeans better meet their retirement needs and expenses in the future. Bundled in the Budget 2024 announcements relating to CPF was the closure of the Special Account once members are 55 years of age and their CPF Retirement Account has been set up. When implemented next year, this would resolve a long-standing anomaly whereby a CPF member aged 55 years and up would have two accounts that hold savings intended to provide retirement payouts: The Special Account and the Retirement Account. Both these accounts earn the same long-term interest rate at 4.08 per cent for the current quarter. However, while some Special Account savings of CPF members aged above 55 can be withdrawn on demand, savings in the Retirement Account are held to provide CPF Life payouts at the applicable CPF Life payout eligibility age (currently 65 for those born in 1954 or later). Some savvy investors may be aware of this loophole that enables them to withdraw some of their Special Account funds out on demand after they hit 55 years of age, and still transfer it back as and when they wish. Thus, these funds should not earn the long-term interest rates that fund long-term retirement adequacy. The continued existence of a member’s Special Account when the Retirement Account has taken over the role of holding long-term retirement savings is thus an anomaly that the CPF Board is now resolving.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary US President Joe Biden is trying to thread the eye of the needle, by putting some daylight between himself and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, says Carl Skadian, senior associate director at the Middle East Institute, NUS. US President Joe Biden meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Oct 18, 2023 in Tel Aviv to discuss the Israel-Hamas war. (File photo: Pool/Miriam Alster via Reuters) SINGAPORE: Was the American abstention on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza part of the tough conversation that President Joe Biden promised to have with Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu? Or in Mr Biden’s own words, the “come to Jesus” conversation - where both sides need to have a serious talk and think about the consequences of Israel's actions. While uncommon, it is not unheard of for the United States to stand by and allow resolutions against Israel to pass - both Democrat and Republican presidents have done so from time to time, the most recent being last December when the US abstained on a resolution calling for more humanitarian aid in Gaza. What is clear from the latest US action - or, more accurately, inaction - is that the rift between the Biden administration and Mr Netanyahu is becoming a chasm. A crucial distinction must be made here: Mr Biden is still a very staunch supporter of Israel. What he is doing, instead, is trying to thread the eye of the needle, by putting some daylight between himself and Mr Netanyahu. The US is not the only country attempting this high-wire act. Before the UNSC vote on Monday (Mar 25), a deepening rift between Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu spilled into public view with the US president openly embracing a strongly-worded speech by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer criticising the Israeli government. Senator Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the US, effectively waded into Israeli domestic politics by portraying Mr Netanyahu as an obstacle to peace, before calling for new polls. In a US election year, with warnings about foreign interference flying, the remarks were startling. Even more revelatory: The speech was cleared with the White House before delivery, and Mr Biden praised it after. This added to tensions already brewing from Mr Biden’s hot mic comment after his State of the Union address on Mar 7, in which he was heard saying that he and Mr Netanyahu needed to have a “come to Jesus” meeting about the war in Gaza. Asked to clarify what he meant in an MSNBC interview two days later, Mr Biden said: “What I meant was, it’s an expression used in the southern part of my state meaning a serious meeting. I’ve known Bibi for 50 years. He knew what I meant by it.” “What’s happening is he has a right to defend Israel, a right to continue to pursue Hamas, but he must, he must, he must pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost as a consequence of the actions taken,” Mr Biden said. “In my view, he’s hurting Israel more than helping Israel by making the rest of the world - it’s contrary to what Israel stands for.” “I think it’s a big mistake,” the US president added. “I want to see a ceasefire.” Mr Netanyahu, however, is not backing down. He criticised the US abstention on the Security Council vote, and then cancelled a planned visit by a high-level delegation to Washington to discuss a threatened offensive into Rafah - a meeting requested by Mr Biden. Despite pressure from around the world, Mr Netanyahu has stuck to his guns and insisted that he will go ahead with the incursion into the southern Gazan city, where more than a million Palestinians have sought refuge. In effect, both Mr Biden and the Israeli leader are playing to their domestic constituencies. Unbridled American support for Israeli actions since Hamas’ terrorist attacks on Oct 7 last year has been costly for the US president: Large sections of his base have criticised him, particularly in the more progressive swing states that will likely decide the outcome of the election. It is a significant enough factor in US politics that even Mr Biden’s challenger, Donald Trump, offered a lukewarm endorsement of Israel, urging it to “finish up your war” and warning that the country was bleeding international support. Mr Netanyahu, meanwhile, is deeply unpopular at home. To remain in power, he will need to continue down a path that retains the backing of his far-right governing coalition. All of which is to say the promised “come to Jesus” moment has not arrived. Yet. Israeli officials, including Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, have said that the Security Council resolution will not be implemented. But the crunch is coming. The planned offensive in Rafah will likely be the flashpoint. The US has been clear that current plans for the incursion are a no go, and Mr Biden has several options available to him to get tough with Mr Netanyahu. The UNSC abstention was one, but there are others in the quiver, including withholding further military aid. As always, Washington will be critical in determining what Israel does next. The difference is that as November draws closer, the US administration has a big, and growing, stake in reining in the Israeli leadership.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary For years, Iran and Israel have engaged in tit-for-tat strikes against each other. Their conflict increasingly looks like a slow-motion war with no obvious off-ramp, says Pusan National University’s Robert Kelly. An image grab from AFPTV footage shows Jordanian onlookers and security agents standing around the debris of a missile that Jordanian forces intercepted over Amman amid an unprecedented Iranian drone and missile attack on Israel in the early hours of Apr 14, 2024. (Image: AFP/Ahmad Shoura) This audio is generated by an AI tool. BUSAN, South Korea: Iran launched hundreds of attack drones and missiles at Israel late on Saturday (Apr 13) in its first ever direct military assault on Israeli territory. It appears that most were shot down with minimal damage to Israeli citizens or infrastructure. The wave of attacks was a response to Israel’s repeated strikes against Iranian leadership targets, both in and outside of Iran. Iran blamed Israel for bombing a consular annex building next to its main embassy in Syria on Apr 1, killing at least 16 people, including two generals. Israel has said it will respond to Saturday’s drone strikes. That retaliation will likely be swift and punishing. Israel and Iran are sliding into an increasingly direct conflict. For years, the two sides have engaged in tit-for-tat, action-reaction strikes against each other. The pace and size of those strikes are increasing. Their interaction increasingly looks like a slow-motion war with no obvious off-ramp. The United States has generally been unable or unwilling to rein in Israeli asymmetric action against Iran or anyone else, and it is unclear to whom Iran might listen. Indeed, Russia and China have a general strategic interest in Iran making trouble for the US in the Middle East. That keeps Washington distracted from the Ukraine war and Taiwan. Escalating asymmetric actions obviously create a threat of an open conflict. To date, this has not occurred for two reasons, which the increasing scale of violence may undermine: First, the US relationship with Israel is souring. The religious conservatives who run Israel have alienated the American left. As far back as the Obama administration, the US signalled that it would not be chain-ganged into an Israeli-forced conflict with Iran. The Biden administration has likely signalled the same. But Iran is a major American opponent in the region. Widely televised strikes like these drone attacks will push Biden back toward unwavering support of Israel . Second, the Sunni Arab states between Israel and Iran are deeply conflicted. They are theologically hostile to both players. Iran is a Shiite state which many find distasteful. But if Israel and Iran increasingly trade open blows – likely with greater casualties on the Iranian side – calls for Muslim unity and pressure from the “Arab street” could push these states toward informal alignment with Iran. This is the wider conflagration the Biden administration has sought to avoid since the Gazan War began: Muslim states, pushed by images of destruction in a Muslim state, rally against Israel, which would compel the US to intervene on Israel’s side. Something like this happened in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. That conflict pulled in the Cold War superpowers too, threatening a much wider stand-off. While this outcome seems unlikely at the moment, it looms, because there is no obvious resolution to this slow-boiling conflict. Not even a two-state solution, in which the Palestinians finally receive their own state, would likely end Israeli-Iranian recriminations. That solution would improve Israel’s relations with its Arab Sunni neighbors and isolate Iran, but it would not end the Iranian theological hostility toward Israel. Persistent conflicts like this often require an outside mediator to tamp down. Unfortunately, there is no credible interlocuter for the relevant parties. The US is no longer a credible mediator in the Middle East; it is seen as too partisan. Russia and the EU are too weak. China is too distant. The UN is the other obvious choice, but it too lacks weight and credibility in the Middle East after decades of failed initiatives. In short, the conflict is deeply set; there is no obvious solution to it; and there are no obvious mediators. This will get worse before it gets better.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Anything that distracts from the war in Gaza and eases international pressure on Israel cannot be in Iran’s interest, says international security expert Stefan Wolff from the University of Birmingham.

Majid Asgaripour/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS/File Photo This audio is generated by an AI tool. BIRMINGHAM, England: Overnight on Friday (Apr 19), Israel responded to the massive, but ultimately low-impact, Iranian aerial attack last weekend with a reported strike of its own. This, too, did little actual damage , but it sent a clear message to Iran: Israel has the capabilities not just to attack Iran but also to carry out potential precision strikes at its nuclear facilities like those in Isfahan, a central region that also hosts a missile factory and an airbase. Moreover, and likely very important to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it is likely to be the “last word” in the current escalation between the two foes. Tehran has downplayed the significance of the Israeli strike in its tightly controlled media landscape and an Iranian official told Reuters there were no plans to respond. If this is indeed the end of it, for now at least, then it confirms two things. First, Iran has no interest in further escalation. This was already apparent in Iran’s strike on Israel, which was carried out in a way that provided ample early warning to Israel and its allies. This allowed them to effectively neuter the attack by taking down all but a few of the 300 projectiles launched. Iran’s reasoning behind this is likely complex. The regime in Tehran want to avoid a direct confrontation with a regional rival that has superior military capabilities – including nuclear weapons – and is backed by some of the world’s most powerful militaries. But Iran’s own allies, Russia and China in particular, will also likely have communicated their disinterest in a full-scale escalation. Anything that distracts from the war in Gaza and eases pressure on Israel on that front, including from its Western allies, cannot be in Iran’s interest either. The growing isolation of Mr Netanyahu’s government is surely more advantageous to Tehran: It drives a welcome wedge between Israel and the West, and it limits the prospects of rapprochement between Israel and the Arab states. Saudi Arabia remains Iran’s other major regional rival despite last year’s China-brokered deal to normalise ties between Tehran and Riyadh. Second, even though Mr Netanyahu may have had the last word in this latest major confrontation, he does not emerge as a clear winner. On the contrary, of the many options that the Israeli government had in its arsenal of possible responses – from actually damaging strikes against multiple nuclear sites, military bases, critical national infrastructure to cyberattacks and assassinations – it chose the one with lowest risk of escalation. This happened most likely because of US pressure , not out of a sense of restraint. It indicates that for all his bluster, Mr Netanyahu can still be effectively constrained and prevented from engulfing the entire Middle East into an all-out war. It also means that a likely earlier calculation by the Israeli government that escalation on the “Iranian front” could take international pressure off its military campaign in Gaza has failed to materialise. This leaves Mr Netanyahu in a weaker position domestically and internationally. Having in all probability avoided a very dangerous situation from escalating further, however, does not in and of itself pave the way towards more peace and stability in the Middle East. For the flipside of one crisis managed effectively is that all sides can now refocus their resources: Israel on its war in Gaza and Iran on support for its many proxies in the region. This does not bode well for the civilians suffering the brunt of violence across the Middle East, nor does it mean that all will remain quiet on the Iran-Israel front.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Donald Trump's guilty verdict will go down in history, but it won't determine the outcome of the US election, say Steven R Okun and Thurgood Marshall Jr. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The next President of the United States could be a convicted felon . The stakes of the US presidential race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden have now become even higher. However, the conviction of Trump on 34 felony counts does not fundamentally alter the odds of who will win the 2024 US election. US President Joe Biden’s approval rating has sunk to just below 38 per cent, placing him worse off at this stage of his term than the three incumbents who all lost re-election (Trump at 42.6 per cent, George HW Bush at 40 per cent and Jimmy Carter at 40.7 per cent). A record 73 per cent of Americans today believe the country is heading down the wrong track. Sure, a few independent and Republican-leaning voters may decide that the United States cannot have a convicted felon as president no matter who the opponent and will now vote for Mr Biden. The Democrats who were wavering over voting for Mr Biden because they disagree with his administration’s approach to Israel may now stay in the Democratic fold. However, those votes could be offset by supporters who may be tired of Trump the man, but not his core “Make America Great Again” message. Ten-day-old fish wrapping paper will have more relevance than Trump’s conviction when they head to the polls in November. So much more could impact the outcome of the election than this guilty verdict: The Presidential debates and whether either candidate appears incompetent or unhinged; a worsening of the situation in Gaza or a widening of the conflict; an economic crisis in the US; or a health emergency from either of the two oldest people to ever run for office. We know that the former US president will aggressively leverage the conviction to advance his personal and political aims. A Trump win post-conviction will increase his focus on going after the US constitutional, law enforcement and judicial systems, all of which have so far constrained him. This could place the US system of governance under greater stress than any time since the end of the Civil War in 1865. While efforts such as eliminating the “deep state” of US independent prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are domestic in nature, the rest of the world will feel the impact as well. If Trump assumes office , his “America First” foreign policy would mean slamming China with massive tariffs, and steeper tariffs across the board for the rest of the world. A Trump administration would withdraw from frameworks that increase US engagement in the region, such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which hosts its next ministerial meeting and first Clean Economy Investor Forum in Singapore next week. Regardless of Biden or Trump 2.0, the world grapples with more crises than it can handle: The climate crisis, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war, rising US-China tensions, and China’s increasing aggressiveness in the South China Sea. A second Trump term bent on retribution back home risks allowing these crises to metastasise, or worse, escalate into a global conflagration that threatens American interests despite Trump’s efforts to isolate the country. China, North Korea and Russia will have less to fear from a distracted US. “Asia policy will not change under Trump except, possibly, on Taiwan where the US commitment to its defence may weaken,” Bilahari Kausikan, former Permanent Secretary at Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told us this morning after Trump's conviction. If that happens, and it changes China’s cross-strait approach, forget the tremors Asia would experience under a second Trump term - the impact would be tsunami-like. The jury’s unanimous verdict will go down in history, but it won’t determine the outcome of the US election. \"The real verdict is going to be Nov 5 by the people,\" said convicted felon Donald Trump. In this instance, Trump speaks the truth. Steven R Okun and Thurgood Marshall Jr served in the Clinton administration as Deputy General Counsel at the Department of Transportation and White House Cabinet Secretary, respectively. Mr Okun serves as CEO of APAC Advisors in Singapore. Mr Marshall practices law in Washington.

    "article_content": "Asia Asia In 2023, the number of Taiwanese under the age of 30 who were taking medication for depression symptoms doubled from a decade ago. Mr Wu Yi-fan, 28, suffered from depression during his college days. This audio is generated by an AI tool. TAIPEI: While most college students fill their time with classes and partying, Mr Wu Yi-fan was going through the darkest moment of his life. The 21-year-old felt constantly lost and helpless. Things that he used to be attracted to had lost their appeal, and nothing was worth pursuing anymore. “I didn’t want to do anything. I felt a lot of emotional pain. I felt I was in a really terrible condition,” he told CNA. “I lost all hope. I felt that I will never be successful no matter what I do.\" He could not put a name to what he was feeling until he sought medical help and was diagnosed with depression. “I … internalised those expectations (of my parents and society), that I needed to be successful so that people would look up to me, that I had to make a lot of money and be powerful, so that I would live a good life.\" Experts say low wages and high property prices are among factors contributing to the decline of mental health among young Taiwanese. Many do not think they can afford to buy a home, let alone have a family – leading them to think they have no future. Last year, more than 215,000 Taiwanese under the age of 30 took medication for depression symptoms – over double the number recorded a decade ago. However, the number of people living with the condition is likely much higher. According to some studies, less than 30 per cent of people with depression seek medical attention. The Guardian newspaper reported that between 2014 and 2022, the suicide rate among Taiwanese aged 15 to 24 more than doubled, even as the overall rate declined. Taiwanese social enterprise Teacher Chang Foundation, which offers mental health counselling, said about a quarter of those reaching out to its counsellors are below 30 years old. The chairwoman of its Taipei branch, Ms Liu Su Fang, said her young clients often express doubts about whether their job will lead to good prospects, or if they will be able to attain a steady income and stable livelihood. “Some even worry whether they would be able to afford a home, or have a family,” Ms Liu said. Another non-profit organisation John Tung Foundation said the prolonged use of social media has contributed to low self-esteem among young people and made them more susceptible to symptoms of depression. “Our study shows that those who spend more than six hours a day on the internet, their depressed level would be higher than other young people,” said the foundation’s mental health centre director Yeh Ya Hsing. “One reason is because when you’re on social media, you are more prone to make comparisons such as: Why is everyone so happy? Why is everyone better than me? Why are they prettier?” Mr Ivan Yeo, deputy director and lived experience lead at Asian Family Services in New Zealand, pointed to another factor: the COVID-19 pandemic. During that period, there was also an increase in knowledge and understanding of what mental health was, Mr Yeo told CNA’s East Asia Tonight programme. For Mr Wu, he has come a long way since his diagnosis seven years ago. Now aged 28, he works as a producer at a local internet company. He said he also picked up an important lesson during his recovery process. “When I felt depressed, I often thought I was going to stay this way for the rest of my life. I thought I would never get well and I would lose hope,” he recounted. “But it’s important to remind yourself that the depressed emotion is only temporary and it will pass. “Don’t rush to judge yourself and make major decisions. I think that’s very important.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary A comprehensive care framework is essential for helping employees through the difficult transitions associated with job loss, says psychiatrist Lim Boon Leng. File photo. Many patients have cited retrenchment, along with the persistent fear of job loss and ensuing insecurity, as primary stressors triggering their depressive episodes or anxiety disorders. (Photo: iStock/SARINYAPINNGAM) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: I recently congratulated a friend who swiftly secured a new job after enduring a few months of retrenchment. With a generous severance package, I had presumed he would relish the opportunity for a paid respite from work. However, his sad countenance revealed a different narrative. In a moment of vulnerability, he confided: “You know, I can't shake the feeling that I was the one chosen for retrenchment.\" This statement underscored the lingering sadness and self-doubt he harboured despite outward appearances of resilience. In 2023, Singapore saw a significant surge in retrenchments , with 14,320 people losing their jobs - a stark increase from 6,440 the previous year. This year alone, there have been at least 3,000 retrenchments in the first quarter, according to preliminary data released by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Apr 30. Just before May Day, a holiday meant to celebrate the contributions of workers, news broke that Yahoo and Ninja Van had laid off staff, prompting a statement from the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) about its “dismay” over the timing of the exercises. Aside from Yahoo and Ninja Van, Apple has also laid off more than 600 employees following the termination of its self-driving car project, while Amazon Web Services is eliminating several hundred sales, marketing and tech roles, in the latest series of retrenchments by parent Amazon, which has cut nearly 30,000 jobs since the end of 2022. As layoffs increasingly become a common response by companies to challenging market conditions, I’ve observed a corresponding rise in psychological distress among individuals in my clinical practice. Many patients have cited retrenchment, along with the persistent fear of job loss and ensuing insecurity, as primary stressors triggering their depressive episodes or anxiety disorders. The experience of losing a job is universally distressing, impacting individuals far beyond the immediate loss of income. The emotional process of retrenchment often mirrors the stages of grief, as individuals cope with the loss of their jobs in ways that can strikingly resemble mourning a significant personal loss. This comparison is grounded in the framework of the five stages of grief developed by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, which include denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Denial is the initial stage where the reality of retrenchment may not sink in, and employees might believe there has been a mistake or hope that the decision might be reversed. Anger arises as individuals cope with the perceived injustice and vulnerability caused by job loss. Bargaining is the stage where individuals may seek ways to regain control or postpone the inevitable, such as negotiating to keep their job or extend their tenure, or scrambling to find new employment, while depression is characterised by sadness and hopelessness. Finally, in the acceptance stage, the individuals adjust to the new reality, redefine their identity, and plan future moves. Retrenchment can be understood as a significant life event - a psychological lexicon denoting a disruption that necessitates major adjustments to one's daily life. Such events, which range from marriage to major illness to job loss, often require substantial mental and emotional adaptation. The relationship between life events - even ostensibly positive ones - and mental health is robustly documented. Research shows that these events can trigger or worsen mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and stress-related disorders. Involuntary job loss is particularly impactful, frequently leading to profound psychological distress due to the sudden change and uncertainty it brings. Such uncertainty can severely disrupt personal identity, a phenomenon psychologists term “role loss”. The sudden absence of a professional role removes a core component of self-esteem and identity, potentially leading to anxiety and depression as the affected individual struggles to redefine themselves beyond their former job. The stress of financial instability following job loss is directly tied to mental health decline. This acute financial stress exacerbates psychological distress and complicates the recovery process, as the ongoing financial hardships can continue affecting the individual's mental health well after they have found new employment. Furthermore, job loss typically results in social isolation. The workplace is a key social environment, and being severed from it restricts access to important social support networks, contributing to loneliness - a significant risk factor for depressive disorders. Additionally, the cascade of challenges initiated by retrenchment often leads to more severe life events and disruptions. This domino effect can cause financial ruin, loss of housing, family stress, and reduced access to healthcare, compounding the individual's stress and negatively impacting their overall mental health. It can be argued that retrenchment affects not only those who have lost their jobs. The immediate effect of retrenchments can manifest as reduced morale among remaining staff, who may experience \"survivor's guilt\" , and a general decrease in productivity and engagement. There is also the potential long-term brand damage. Companies perceived as treating employees as just statistics and unfairly or without transparency during layoffs may find it harder to attract top talent when conditions improve. Moreover, abrupt reductions in staff can lead to a loss of institutional knowledge and disrupt internal operations, potentially leading to decreased efficiency and effectiveness. Comprehending these dynamics is essential for providing effective support. Organisations have an ethical responsibility to assist workers displaced by retrenchment. By recognising the stages of grief and the profound psychological impacts of a life event like job loss, they can deliver support that is not only more empathetic but also practically beneficial. If healthcare is intended to support individuals from cradle to grave, then similarly, occupational health should encompass the full spectrum from employment through to re-employment. This holistic approach ensures continuous support for employees, aiding them not only during their tenure but also as they navigate the transition to new roles post-retrenchment. Initiating counselling services before the start of the retrenchment process is crucial. Such preemptive support prepares employees for the emotional toll of job loss and provides a confidential environment to discuss anxieties and concerns, significantly reducing stress related to upcoming changes. Maintaining clear and open communication throughout the retrenchment process is vital. Employees should be well-informed about the reasons behind layoffs, the criteria used for making such decisions, and the logistics involved. Transparency in this process helps mitigate the spread of rumours and misinformation that can exacerbate employee stress and anxiety. Providing financial planning services assists employees in effectively managing their post-job loss financial situation. Guidance on budgeting, navigating financial aid, managing severance packages, and understanding benefits like unemployment insurance supports workers in their transition from employment to unemployment. Extending support with career transition services is essential. This includes offering resume writing workshops, career coaching, interview preparation, and job search resources, which facilitate a smoother transition to new employment opportunities. Collaborating with employment agencies can enhance this support, helping place retrenched workers in suitable new positions. Finally, continuing to offer access to mental health resources after retrenchment is crucial for supporting the well-being of former employees. Extending Employee Assistance Programmes to cover the period until re-employment and providing therapy sessions or referrals to mental health professionals, can significantly aid in the psychological adjustment during this challenging time. Together, these measures not only help mitigate the immediate impact of retrenchment but also contribute to a culture of care within the organisation, reinforcing its reputation as a responsible employer. A comprehensive care framework is essential for assisting employees through the difficult transitions associated with job loss, ensuring they feel supported every step of the way and preventing long-term mental health difficulties.

    "article_content": "Asia Asia Demand for psychological counselling has increased in China. (Illustration: SCMP/Lau Ka-kuen) This audio is generated by an AI tool. In the past few years, psychological counsellor Huang Jing has watched her business thrive. With any other industry, that would be cause for celebration – China has made private enterprise a priority as it pushes for sustained economic recovery – but a higher demand for mental health services carries other, more troubling implications. Huang set up her first counselling company, Better Family, in Shanghai in February 2022 – not long before the city’s notorious two-month lockdown began. Business recovered quickly when quarantine lifted in June, and her practice broke even three months later. Six months after that, she opened two more offices there. Now, she has expanded to Hangzhou, operating three offices in the Yangtze Delta tech hub. The rapid growth in businesses like Huang’s, lucrative though it may be, reflects a rise in conditions like anxiety and depression among the public – including the middle class, widely regarded as foundational to China’s economic growth and social progress. “People cannot help but wonder why the Chinese economy has ground to a halt,” she said. “We’ve seen a sea change in the property market, disillusionment of young people, and, particularly, mountains of pressure from parents: To make money, save money, rigid education (standards) and dim outlooks for their children’s future.” The World Health Organization has estimated 54 million people in China suffer from depression and 41 million suffer from anxiety disorders. In recent years, health authorities have also made attempts to address the issue. These phenomena are motivating people to seek psychological therapy and self-help in larger numbers, leading to a tenfold increase in the number of counselling institutions from 2011 to 2020 according to data from Qcc.com, a corporate credit information provider. The number soared by more than 60 per cent year on year in 2022, reaching 30,700. The state-run newspaper Legal Daily reported more than 160,000 companies in China had business profiles which included psychological counselling as of the end of last year. “I studied psychology in 2001 when the market was very small”, said Huang, whose centres charge clients 600 yuan per hour or above. “Because (psychological counselling) is expensive, and ordinary wage-earning classes can’t afford it. Only the affluent can.” She added those clients’ interests are mostly personal or familial. “Solving psychological stress is their immediate need,” she said. “Our customers are mainly from families that have encountered marriage problems and issues in child-rearing and education.” A gap between expectations and reality could be the cause for many people who seek counselling, Huang said. “Parents of many teenagers were raised after China kicked off reform and opening-up in the 1980s, rode the crest of the economic boom and had high hopes their children would replicate their success,” she said. “(They are) deeply averse to the idea (their children could) fail to achieve their full potential in school or not land an ideal job.” Industry insiders and scholars said the coming two years may be the peak period for anxiety among Chinese families, with previously unseen pessimism over careers and income in the bumpy post-pandemic economy driving the counselling industry’s expansion. Anxiety, a sense of meaninglessness and depression were the most commonly reported psychological problems for the Chinese public last year, according to a mental health report that featured the results of a survey of 40,000 people. Annual expenditures on counselling over the past three years averaged 6,500 yuan (US$898) per person, and 90 per cent of clients have a bachelor’s degree or higher, the survey population said. The group was polled as part of the 2023-2024 Mental Health and Industry Population Insight Report, jointly released by Jiandanxinli.com – a platform that connects therapists with clients- and the CBNData Business Data Center. The rise in potential clients has also generated interest in therapy as a career from those entering the job market. More people aged 30 to 40 are considering entering the profession, according to those surveyed, with more than 30 per cent of beginner counsellors aged 20 to 29 and 51.6 per cent aged 30 to 39. Lu Fang, a senior translator in her 40s who lives in Guangzhou, has been dealing with stress over fears of being laid off and suffering losses on investments. In a further blow to her mental well-being, the US$300,000 she has saved to support her now 12-year-old daughter to eventually study overseas appears insufficient to cover the high costs of living in the United States or Europe. The worry almost broke her and was enough to motivate her to seek professional help in February. She bought a package of eight one-hour in-person sessions at 850 yuan each. “I started receiving psychological counselling once a week,” Lu said. “It was worth the money. Although it’s hard to say how helpful it was in the end, I feel relieved. “I would recommend counselling to my friends, despite the fact that it is quite expensive,” she said. “It can help change perspectives on personal problems. Things have changed too fast, which has led to a loss of years of effort by families and a dramatic shift of their plans.” A crisis in the property market, erratic post-pandemic economic recovery and shaky job prospects – along with higher costs for medical care and education – have amplified mental distress and a sense of helplessness among China’s middle class. Shen Jiake, a writer of psychological novels from the central province of Hubei, has also heard from readers across the country that anxiety was a prevalent issue – a trend he said is indicative of intensifying competition in society as a whole. “China has developed so fast over the past 40 years, which resulted in dramatic changes in lifestyles but also a rise of anxieties,” Shen said. “These include the clash between Western lifestyles and traditional Chinese family values, the sudden onset of epidemics and economic uncertainties, and a rising sense of anxiety among the younger generation.” Additionally, he attributed the rise in mental health problems to the “curse of 35” – a toxic perception that white-collar workers are too old for new job opportunities once they reach a certain age – as well as the growing population of young women who have chosen not to marry , leading to a rapid decline in fertility rates . “The sense of meaninglessness is now more apparent than ever before, especially among the middle class and young people,” Shen said. Huang with Better Family warned that parents’ anxieties could easily pass to their children. After the fast-paced economic growth of their youth which benefited them greatly, she said, they want the same for their children – and are shocked if it does not happen. “Some even think that if their first child does not excel in school, they can simply have another child and focus on the younger one, neglecting the first child’s development.” The 2023 Blue Book on China’s Mental Health – a report jointly drafted by the China National Narcotic Drugs Association and Haoxinqing, an online platform for psychiatric services – determined the detection rate of depression among high school students was 40 per cent, 30 per cent for junior high school students, and only 10 per cent for those in primary school. From 2010 to 2021, China’s suicide rate in children aged 5 to 14 increased annually at an average of nearly 10 per cent. Shen expected significant growth for psychological counselling services in the future, as more individuals become open to seeking professional help. Concurrent with increases in internet use – China is already the world’s largest consumer base for online services – the counselling industry is adding remote functions to turbocharge its development in the digital age, he said. Overseas professionals have an advantage in the Chinese market because psychological counselling systems and training methods are of Western origin, Shen said – though some adaptation will be required to fine-tune those practices to account for essential differences in culture. “As long as the localisation problem is solved, counselling services are expected to become more popular.” This article was first published on SCMP .

(Photo: iStock/Kong Ding Chek) LONDON: Securing a job that you find meaningful - work that you think is significant and value positively - may be one of your most important career goals. But there can be a negative side to doing work that you’re passionate about. It can lead to placing too much of your sense of self in your work - and strain on your mental health and relationships. People who derive a strong sense of meaningfulness from their work may over-identify with their professional roles. This means that their work becomes their primary, and sometimes only, source of self-definition and self-worth: They see their identity only as someone who does that job, and that their value comes only from work. This can result in high work commitment and dedication with porous boundaries between personal and work domains . If this is the case for you, you may find that work consumes a significant portion of your time, attention and energy. You may find yourself working long or erratic hours, and perhaps struggling to mentally disconnect from work even when not working. You might end up sacrificing sleep, hobbies and relationships. And this can have compounding effects over time. Prioritising your work over yourself and going without time for recovery can result in exhaustion, chronic stress and burnout . Meaningful work can also lead to people neglecting their relationships. Doing work you consider meaningful that becomes a high priority can leave little room for nurturing connections with family, friends and communities outside employment. This can lead to missed social gatherings and forgotten relationship milestones. It may also mean giving lower priority to the everyday interactions with loved ones that make up the core of your relationships with them. Prioritising work over people can also undermine the trust essential for close personal relationships. The loved ones of people who attach such high value to their work may feel they cannot rely on their presence or emotional availability. Organisations may knowingly or unknowingly exploit the dedication of people who experience their work as meaningful. Your employer might take advantage of your commitment by expecting you to work long hours, take on additional responsibilities or accept lower pay compared to market standards. Meaningful work can be used as an excuse for strategic decisions from companies to invest inadequately in people and working conditions. Employees themselves may be willing to make sacrifices. If you work in a career you find deeply meaningful, you may find yourself tolerating poor working conditions or unreasonable demands. You might voluntarily take on extra work. For example, a passionate teacher might voluntarily take on extra unpaid duties, such as organising after-school programmes or mentoring struggling students, to compensate for systemic issues at the expense of their personal life. While these sacrifices may initially seem worthwhile, they are a recipe for burnout, resentment and a sense of being taken for granted. It might also make changing jobs difficult. You might put off leaving a role or organisation, or find the very prospect of changing jobs emotionally daunting. If you get a strong sense of purpose and identity from your work, it can be challenging to envisage yourself in a different context. But this could mean missing out on career and pay opportunities elsewhere. Doing meaningful work is an opportunity to be authentic to your values and beliefs. Over time, though, it can lead to an erosion of your sense of authentic self. For instance, the pursuit of meaningful work can lead to moral dilemmas when workplace expectations or practices conflict with ethical principles, particularly in commercial settings. For example, a sustainability consultant may find that the only measures a client is willing to work with them on are greenwashing campaigns to make the company look better. Accepting this contract pits the consultant’s dedication to sustainability against the realities of working in a commercial setting. In situations like this, people may feel torn between their dedication and working conditions. Suppressing your values can lead to feelings of guilt, shame and disillusionment, eroding the very sense of meaning and authenticity that your work brings you. And if work is your primary source of validation and identification, setbacks and failures can trigger questioning - not only of your professional capabilities but also of your very purpose and self-worth. Meaningful work can be a double-edged sword. It requires careful management of its all-consuming nature. But maintaining this delicate balance between the power and pitfalls of meaningful work is not just a task for individuals. Organisations need to develop a foundation of working conditions that centre respect, care and fairness to avoid exploiting people and harming their well-being.

(File Photo: REUTERS/Tyrone Siu) HONG KONG: China's Ministry of Education said on Tuesday (May 14) it was launching a campaign to address issues including excessive homework and bullying in schools, as part of efforts to boost students' mental health . The announcement came a day after the ministry said it was carrying out mental health education for teachers and students, with a particular focus on rural migrant children or those \"left behind\", whose parents work in large cities for much of the year. The ministry's notice, published on its website, detailed 12 negative practices at schools, including encroachment during scheduled breaks, neglect and tolerance of bullying behaviour. Beijing has, since 2021, tried to reform the education sector and ease academic pressure on students, clamping down on a US$120 billion private tutoring industry to cut education costs. Many residents have cited high childcare and education costs as reasons not to have children. The announcements come after the killing of a 13-year-old boy in northern China, whose case triggered a heated media debate over juvenile crime and the plight of children left at home by migrant workers. Three boys were arrested after they allegedly bullied and killed the student in the small city of Handan on Mar 10.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Individuals with social phobia feel such intense anxiety of judgement or scrutiny that it interferes with daily functioning, says psychiatrist Dr Jared Ng. File photo. Social anxiety disorder extends far beyond shyness, representing a debilitating mental health condition characterised by an intense fear of social situations. (Photo: iStock/PeopleImages) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Imagine being called on by your teacher or boss to present a project to a room full of people. Your heart begins to race, your palms grow clammy. And yet, despite it all, you push through - with a huge sigh of relief as soon as it’s over. This is common for most people. For those with social anxiety disorder , however, the experience is akin to stepping into a battlefield, stripped of armour and weapons, with weights tied to your ankles. The fear is excruciating and crippling. The mother of 18-year-old Peter* recently shared with me her son’s extreme challenges. Peter’s life took a drastic turn after a distressing incident in primary school, leaving him struggling with everyday activities such as leaving the house alone, using public transport or making purchases without assistance. His anxiety became so overwhelming that he could not continue his education and eventually had to drop out altogether after primary school. Peter's difficulties were not merely a case of shyness ; he was battling social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia. This disorder is widely prevalent yet often overlooked and carries substantial economic and personal costs, including educational underachievement, decreased work productivity, increased dependency and frequent comorbidities, such as depression and alcohol dependence. With Singapore making mental health a key priority in its national agenda, it is encouraging to see progress being made. However, there is still much work to be done in terms of raising awareness, reducing stigma, and ensuring accessible and effective treatment options for those in need. Social anxiety disorder extends far beyond shyness, representing a debilitating mental health condition characterised by an intense fear of social situations. Unlike shyness - a personality trait where individuals may feel awkward but can still participate in social interactions - social phobia leads to profound avoidance behaviours. Individuals with social phobia feel such intense anxiety of judgement or scrutiny that it interferes with daily functioning, leading them to avoid social situations, affecting work, school and personal relationships. Social anxiety disorder displays globally diverse characteristics , shaped significantly by cultural norms and societal expectations. In Japan, this is reflected in the unique form known as taijin kyofusho, where the fear centres not on one's own potential embarrassment, but on offending or embarrassing others. This contrasts with the fears typical in Western cultures, where the anxiety is about oneself being negatively judged. In a 2020 study involving nearly 7,000 respondents from seven countries, a staggering 36 per cent globally met the threshold for social anxiety disorder. It doesn’t just affect regular people. Celebrities such as Nicole Kidman, Kim Basinger and Ed Sheeran - whose very jobs require performing for people - have admitted to having social anxiety. According to a World Mental Health Survey Initiative involving more than 140,000 respondents across low- to high-income nations, the global prevalence of social phobia ranges from 2 per cent to 12 per cent, with variations largely influenced by cultural factors and diagnostic criteria. Other studies have shown that about 80 per cent of individuals with social anxiety disorder report onset at the age of 18, and it is more commonly reported in females than in males. There are no recent studies about the extent of social phobia in Singapore to my knowledge, although a recent study led by the National University of Singapore showed that about one-third of Singapore adolescents reported mental health symptoms such as depression, anxiety and loneliness. Social anxiety disorder can severely disrupt daily functioning due to the intense fear and avoidance of social interactions . Routine activities most people take for granted become sources of profound distress. For example, buying food from hawker stalls can be overwhelming due to the fear of interacting with others or being observed by other diners. In severe cases, individuals may avoid eating or drinking in public settings entirely, as was the case with a patient of mine. She stopped eating in school altogether as she could not bear the perceived scrutiny, skipping both recess and lunchtime. Some may become virtually mute in social settings due to overwhelming anxiety. This level of social avoidance and ensuing isolation can have significant repercussions on personal development, educational achievement, and overall quality of life. The causes of social anxiety disorder are multifaceted, involving biological, environmental, psychological, and increasingly recognised, digital influences. Genetic factors play a significant role. Individuals with social anxiety disorder often have an overactive amygdala, a part of the brain that intensifies their response to social threats, making them more susceptible to social anxiety. Social anxiety disorder is also influenced by environmental factors, such as upbringing and personal experiences. For example, children who grow up with overprotective or critical parents and those who experience bullying can struggle to feel confident in social situations, which might increase their risk of developing social phobia. Personal traits also play a role; those who are naturally introverted or particularly sensitive to criticism may be more susceptible to this disorder. In today's digital world, extensive use of smartphones and social media can exacerbate anxiety. Constant connectivity can lead to an overreliance on digital communication, reducing face-to-face interactions and potentially weakening the individual’s social skills. Additionally, constant exposure to idealised images of others' lives may increase feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. The pressure to be constantly available and to manage one's digital persona can create and reinforce anxiety, particularly in social contexts. Effectively managing social anxiety disorder starts with psychoeducation, which is crucial for clearing up misconceptions and helping with early detection. Learning about social phobia can help patients and their caregivers spot early signs, like a child refusing to go to school or not speaking in certain situations. Therapy, particularly cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), is essential in treating social anxiety disorder across all ages, from very young children to adults. CBT focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviours that contribute to anxiety. In severe cases, some may consider medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). But as with all medications, there can be side effects and the decision to medicate should be made after a thorough evaluation by a psychiatrist, who will consider how severe the anxiety is, how it affects everyday life and the benefits versus the risks of the medication. Support from schools and families is essential; they play a big role in providing the necessary support systems. Schools can contribute by training teachers and staff to be aware of mental health issues and by creating an inclusive learning environment. Including mental health education in the curriculum can significantly improve how students understand and manage their mental health. Families should keep an open dialogue about mental health, normalise seeking help when necessary, and encourage the development of social skills from an early age. Peter's story is just one among many, but it's a reminder that behind every statistic is a real person struggling with real challenges. By working together to address social anxiety disorder and other mental health issues, we can create a more inclusive and supportive society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. *A pseudonym was used in this commentary.

    "article_content": "East Asia East Asia The directive comes as deaths from school bullying incidents spark outrage. But some worry that increased surveillance would just shift the bullying outside of campus. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Surveillance cameras will be installed in places like corridors, store rooms and rooftops of all primary and secondary schools in China as the government seeks to stamp out bullying and campus violence. The move to “fully watch over” schools swiftly drew mixed views from educators after China’s Education Ministry put up the notice on Friday (May 31). Some felt bullying would simply shift outside of campuses, while others said teachers would be better able to monitor it in secluded areas of school compounds. As for technology providers who stand to gain from the measure, the discussion is already moving to surveillance for toilets and what methods would be too intrusive. In its notice, the Ministry of Education instructed each school to set up a management committee to deal with campus violence and publish contact information such as phone numbers and emails of relevant officials to report cases to. The notice also instructed local education departments to develop guidelines for teachers and parents on matters such as counselling. The directives come as deaths from school bullying incidents spark debate and outrage in China. In March, a 13-year-old boy in the northern province of Hebei was allegedly killed and buried by three classmates. That same month, a 14-year-old girl in Fujian jumped to her death after suspected bullying. More recently, the parents of a 15-year-old girl in Hunan shared a distressing video of their daughter slashing herself to escape acts of violence by her classmates. Teachers in China told CNA some schools already deploy closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems in classrooms, which are beneficial in some ways. A primary school form teacher in Guangzhou said over half of the 50 classrooms in her school have surveillance cameras installed. The decision was jointly made by form teachers and the parents’ committee, added the teacher, who asked to be known as Ms Ou. “If the majority of parents are agreeable, a CCTV would be installed in the class for them to keep watch,\" said the Chinese language teacher with over 26 years of experience. While her classroom does not have CCTVs, she has asked class monitors to help film students using her phone when she is not physically present – such as when students are queuing up for their afternoon nap. This enables her to monitor the situation, said Ms Ou. \"Most children still need a pair of eyes on them to behave,” she added. Surveillance footage serves “as a deterrent and provides evidence in case incidents occur\". The Shandong-based China Association of Anti-Campus Bullying firmly supported the ministry’s plan and agreed that cameras would help deter bullies. Bullying tends to happen in secluded areas of campuses, and using technology to monitor these areas will “help teachers and staff to notice such acts sooner to prevent further harm”, the ground-up initiative said. Guangzhou high school teacher Lin Feng, however, felt surveillance cameras were not a real solution. “If the bullies know there are CCTVs in schools, they will choose to carry out harmful actions outside of the campus,” he said. Installing surveillance cameras would only absolve schools and the authorities of their responsibility, he argued. \"The best effort is still implementing anti-bullying education, and empowering victims and bystanders.” Increasing penalties for bullying could also be helpful, Mr Lin suggested. The Ministry of Education did not spell out measures to protect the privacy of individuals in its notice. In the wake of high-profile bullying cases, there is growing attention on using technology to tackle the scourge. Guangdong Zhilian Chuanghe Technology told CNA it has installed cameras at more than 10 schools including primary schools and universities. If enquiries from commercial and public entities are any indication, restrooms could be the next spaces to be monitored, a spokesperson said. In general, surveillance of toilets is still in its early phase, said the company, which has been in business for over 20 years. “Our artificial intelligence (AI) system was launched in January, and there are suppliers enquiring about installing voice recording systems in toilets,” she said. “However, due to privacy concerns, we have not installed any such systems yet.” The Education Ministry made no mention of surveillance of restrooms in its notice. The Chinese authorities are trying to boost students’ mental health in other ways. The government recently announced a campaign to tackle excessive homework and bullying. It also issued a notice detailing 12 negative practices in schools such as actions that eat into students’ scheduled breaks, neglect and tolerance of bullying behaviour. In April, China’s top legislature vowed tougher discipline of minors who bully. Those who commit serious offences will be sent to specialised educational institutions or be subjected to public security penalties or criminal charges, reported the state news outlet Global Times. Mr Yang Heqing, a spokesperson for the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said parents, schools and education authorities play a role in preventing campus bullying.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary While Singapore's youths may live in Asia's happiest country statistically, the reality of their experiences paints a more complex picture, says psychiatrist Lim Boon Leng. File photo of people in Singapore crossing a street. (Photo: TODAY) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Who truly has it better, the young or the old? This has been a topic of conversation for centuries, debated over kitchen tables, in classrooms and across social media. Yet, the answer remains elusive. Mr Lee Hsien Loong, in an interview with Singapore media a few weeks before his May 15 handover of the Prime Minister baton to Lawrence Wong, said: “As an old man, I envy the young men and women ... I wish I had been born later .” He added that they enjoy opportunities that did not exist in his generation and have a better quality of living. According to the 2024 World Happiness Report , however, it seems that globally, and in Singapore, today’s youth are less happy than their elders. The data suggests a happiness divide with those aged 60 and above happier than those below 30. In my interactions with younger people, I have noticed that they are often jaded and tired. What concerns me the most are the complaints about the lack of self-direction and a sense of meaninglessness in their lives. Aside from anecdotes, we have a barrage of evidence pointing to poorer mental health in the youths of Singapore. According to a survey conducted by Duke-NUS Medical School and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in 2022, 12 per cent of young individuals showed symptoms consistent with depression, while about 13 per cent showed symptoms consistent with anxiety. Overall, 16.2 per cent of youths reported having symptoms consistent with at least one of these conditions. The National Population Health Survey in 2022 revealed that adults between the ages of 18 to 29 had the highest percentage of poor mental health, with 25.3 per cent reporting such issues. In line with these studies, the annual proportion of children or adolescents being prescribed antidepressants increased from 3.4 per cent to 4.1 per cent over the five years between 2017 and 2021. Similarly, young adult prescriptions increased from 11.2 per cent to 15.5 per cent during the same period. The escalating mental health challenges faced by youths have reached a critical juncture. In February, Mr Wong addressed this issue during a parliamentary motion aimed at advancing mental health initiatives. He emphasised the need for more research and a fundamental shift in our perception of success, underscoring the gravity of the situation. In understanding why young Singaporeans are unhappy, a few culprits often come to mind: Social media, and the academic and work environment. Today's youth face a world that is vastly different from that of previous generations. With the rapid pace of technological advancements, the omnipresence of social media, and an increasingly globalised society, unique stressors present themselves. These tools, while designed to connect us, often foster a sense of isolation and inadequacy. For instance, social media can distort reality, setting unrealistic benchmarks for personal success and happiness. The constant exposure to curated portrayals of others' lives can lead to feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and depression. Many young people lament that instead of forming camaraderie in full-time national service or socialising on school campuses, most interactions are now in group chats. They find it hard to find time or opportunities to meet new people and have trouble looking for meaningful romantic partnerships from dating apps . In Singapore, the education system is still based on academic success. This can be both psychologically and emotionally draining, with young people often feeling that they are in a relentless race for academic excellence - a race with elusive and intangible rewards. Even for those with high academic achievements, the promise of a fulfilling and secure future remains questionable with an ever-increasing cost of living. The daunting reality that despite their best efforts, they are unlikely to surpass their parents' success, in a society that has already reached remarkable heights, adds an extra layer of complexity. This environment can lead to burnout and a questioning of the purpose of their efforts, diminishing the perceived value of their hard work and achievements. Simply put, “What is the point?” To address this existential discontent among local youths, we can examine the psychological frameworks of Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Erik Erikson's stages of psychosocial development. Maslow's hierarchy categorises human needs from basic necessities such as food and safety to higher levels such as belonging, esteem, and ultimately, self-actualisation, where individuals realise their full potential. However, when young people are primarily focused on academic success, their higher needs, particularly esteem and self-actualisation, may not be adequately met. Similarly, Erikson’s model describes eight stages that individuals typically go through from infancy to adulthood, facing specific psychosocial conflicts that shape their identities. In this context, the stages of identity versus role confusion and intimacy versus isolation are crucial for young adults developing personal identities and intimate relationships. A highly competitive academic system may hinder these developmental stages, which can lead to role confusion and social isolation, ultimately affecting their overall happiness and well-being. The existential isolation can be particularly poignant for youths in today's digital age, where virtual connections might seem abundant but are often superficial. The paradox of being \"connected\" yet feeling alone is a common plight that can lead to sadness as young individuals struggle to form deep, meaningful relationships in an increasingly disconnected world. The existential discontent among Singapore's youth poses significant questions about the country's future. As a nation that relies heavily on its human capital, Singapore must consider the long-term implications of a workforce that is both high-performing and increasingly burnt out or disenchanted. A persistent drive for academic and economic supremacy could undermine the holistic well-being of its citizens, which could stifle creativity and innovation over time. Is the pendulum swinging to the other side with young people choosing “tang ping” (a Chinese expression that describes those who reject societal pressures to overwork and over-achieve), choosing to \"lie flat\" with a more indifferent attitude towards life? For youths feeling sad and complaining of meaninglessness, engaging in self-reflection to understand their true desires and values can be a starting point. Finding meaning can be a personal journey of connecting with others authentically, choosing paths that resonate with their inner selves, and embracing the freedom to forge their destinies despite the inherent uncertainties of life. While Singapore's youths may live in Asia's happiest country statistically, the reality of their experiences paints a more complex picture. Young Singaporeans need to realise that happiness should not be an ephemeral state achieved through external accolades. Instead, it can be redefined as a byproduct of engaging in meaningful activities that align with one's values and contribute to the welfare of others. That way, they can experience a more durable and fulfilling sense of satisfaction and purpose. Dr Lim Boon Leng is a psychiatrist at the Gleneagles Medical Centre.

(Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: How much can someone’s mental well-being be affected by the built environment? To find out, Singapore will embark on a three-year project that will help to shape how the city-state is planned and make it healthier and more liveable. This builds on current research that has primarily focused on how the built environment affects physical health, as well as the benefits of greenery on mental well-being. The government will invest S$1 million (US$742,820) in the project which will be led by researchers from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), announced Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Monday (Jun 3). \"The study will examine factors such as urban design features, density, human behaviours and mental well-being,” he said on the second day of this year’s World Cities Summit, held at the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre. “The evidence-based insights gleaned from this study will serve to better inform the way we rejuvenate, reinvent and re-imagine our city-state,” Mr Heng added. A*STAR researchers have proposed to develop a framework and an index of indicators to link the built environment to mental well-being. The eventual findings can help city planners better understand and shape the city's future. It could also impact where facilities are located, land use configuration, and the intensity of a land development. The research project was commissioned by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Housing and Development Board. It falls under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 Masterplan, to which the government committed S$28 billion in 2020. On Tuesday, Mr Heng noted that cities must continuously evolve and develop “good hard infrastructure”. These include buildings, roads, ports, and airports to enhance connectivity and convenience. “And equally, cities need soft infrastructure – for people to form social connections and build a sense of community and identity,” he added. “Both these dimensions are vital in keeping cities buzzing, dynamic and cohesive.” Mr Michael Leong, senior executive director of SAA Architects, a member company of the Surbana Jurong Group, noted that Singapore has still been able to cover about 40 per cent of its land with greenery despite limited land space and several competing needs. “We have studies that are telling us that the presence of greenery in our physical environment - be it just being in a park, being in a garden, or even just looking at greenery - it does have health and well-being benefits to us,” he told Singapore Tonight. “I think having that knowledge is very important because it takes a lot of time for us to create an environment that makes that possible,” he added. In terms of a design element he would like to see, Mr Leong said that public spaces should allow communities to come together, especially in an intergenerational setting. Mr Ben Channon, director of wellbeing consultancy Ekkist in the United Kingdom, said that people around the world are experiencing mental health crises linked to technology and information overload. “We certainly see this as an opportunity for the built environment, because buildings and cities are an excellent way to get people away from their screens; get them engaging with the world around them,” he told Singapore Tonight. The biggest challenge around this, Mr Channon pointed out, is getting leaders and governments to understand the link between buildings in cities and people’s health. He equated spending on urban design to spending on healthcare, given how creating better places will result in better health outcomes for populations. “Suddenly, it makes more sense to increase investment in housing and investment in cities, because governments will start to realise this will save the money in the long term in terms of reducing health care costs, reducing costs of caring for ageing populations,” Mr Channon added. This year’s World Cities Summit also saw the signing of several memoranda of understanding, with the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) announcing one such collaboration with the Singapore Management University (SMU) to tackle urban heat by using map technology. The government agency will share resources such as heat and street maps with SMU to address the problem. The aim of the collaboration is for such maps to identify problem areas that generate intense heat. Analysing these trouble spots, which are surrounded by buildings and roads, could lead to better urban planning to mitigate rising temperatures. Urban heating is partly why Singapore is warming up twice as fast compared with the rest of the world, at 0.25 degrees Celsius per decade, according to the country’s Meteorological Service. Through its partnership with SMU, SLA also aims to groom talent in the field through student climate research projects. Dr Orlando Woods, director of the SMU Urban Institute, said the collaboration will provide new data for researchers to better understand cities. “What we're hoping to do with this, especially with the (geospatial) data that SLA can provide, is to add them to our existing models of cooling or heating in Singapore. And so the solutions that we propose can be even better; even more translational,” he added.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Parents should reframe their thinking so they see their child as having a problem, not being the problem, say these Bond University professors. GOLD COAST: Welcome aboard the roller coaster of parenthood, where emotions run wild, tantrums reign supreme and love flows deep. As children reach toddlerhood and beyond, parents adapt to manage their child’s big emotions and meltdowns. Parenting terminology has adapted too, with more parents describing their child as “dysregulated”. But what does this actually mean? Emotional dysregulation refers to challenges a child faces in recognising and expressing emotions, and managing emotional reactions in social settings. This may involve either suppressing emotions or displaying exaggerated and intense emotional responses that get in the way of the child doing what they want or need to do. “ Dysregulation ” is more than just feeling an emotion. An emotion is a signal, or cue, that can give us important insights to ourselves and our preferences, desires and goals. An emotionally dysregulated brain is overwhelmed and overloaded (often, with distressing emotions like frustration, disappointment and fear) and is ready to fight, flight or freeze. Emotion regulation is a skill that develops across childhood and is influenced by factors such as the child’s temperament and the emotional environment in which they are raised. In the stage of emotional development where emotion regulation is a primary goal (around 3 to 5 years old), children begin exploring their surroundings and asserting their desires more actively. It’s typical for them to experience emotional dysregulation when their initiatives are thwarted or criticised, leading to occasional tantrums or outbursts. A typically developing child will see these types of outbursts reduce as their cognitive abilities become more sophisticated, usually around the age they start school. Expressing emotions in childhood is crucial for social and emotional development. It involves the ability to convey feelings verbally and through facial expressions and body language. When children struggle with emotional expression, it can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty in being understood, flat facial expressions even in emotionally charged situations, challenges in forming close relationships, and indecisiveness. Several factors, including anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, giftedness, rigidity and both mild and significant trauma experiences , can contribute to these issues. Common mistakes parents can make is dismissing emotions, or distracting children away from how they feel. These strategies don’t work and increase feelings of overwhelm. In the long term, they fail to equip children with the skills to identify, express and communicate their emotions, making them vulnerable to future emotional difficulties. We need to help children move compassionately towards their difficulties, rather than away from them. Parents need to do this for themselves too. Parents are responsible for creating an emotional climate that facilitates the development of emotion regulation skills. Parents’ own modelling of emotion regulation when they feel distressed. The way they respond to the expression of emotions in their children, contributes to how children understand and regulate their own emotions. Children are hardwired to be attuned to their caregivers’ emotions, moods, and coping as this is integral to their survival. In fact, their biggest threat to a child is their caregiver not being okay. Unsafe, unpredictable, or chaotic home environments rarely give children exposure to healthy emotion expression and regulation. Children who go through maltreatment have a harder time controlling their emotions, needing more brainpower for tasks that involve managing feelings. This struggle could lead to more problems with emotions later on, like feeling anxious and hypervigilant to potential threats . Recognising and addressing these challenges early on is essential for supporting children’s emotional wellbeing and development. When kids enter “fight or flight” mode, they often struggle to cope or listen to reason. When children experience acute stress, they may respond instinctively without pausing to consider strategies or logic. If your child is in fight mode, you might observe behaviours such as crying, clenching fists or jaw, kicking, punching, biting, swearing, spitting or screaming. In flight mode, they may appear restless, have darting eyes, exhibit excessive fidgeting, breathe rapidly, or try to run away. A shut-down response may look like fainting or a panic attack. When a child feels threatened, their brain’s frontal lobe, responsible for rational thinking and problem-solving, essentially goes offline. This happens when the amygdala, the brain’s alarm system, sends out a false alarm, triggering the survival instinct. In this state, a child may not be able to access higher functions like reasoning or decision-making. While our instinct might be to immediately fix the problem, staying present with our child during these moments is more effective. It’s about providing support and understanding until they feel safe enough to engage their higher brain functions again. Reframe your thinking so you see your child as having a problem – not being the problem. Take turns discussing the highs and lows of the day at meal times . This is a chance for you to be curious, acknowledge and label feelings, and model that you, too, experience a range of emotions that require you to put into practice skills to cope and has shown evidence in numerous physical, social-emotional, academic and behavioural benefits. Spending even small amounts (five minutes a day) of quality one-on-one time with your child is an investment in your child’s emotional wellbeing. Let them pick the activity, do your best to follow their lead, and try to notice and comment on the things they do well, like creative ideas, persevering when things are difficult, and being gentle or kind. Take a tip from parents of children with neurodiversity: Learn about your unique child. Approaching your child’s emotions, temperament, and behaviours with curiosity can help you to help them develop emotion regulation skills. If emotion dysregulation is a persistent issue that is getting in the way of your child feeling happy, calm, or confident – or interfering with learning or important relationships with family members or peers – talk to their general practitioner about engaging with a mental health professional. Many families have found parenting programmes helpful in creating a climate where emotions can be safely expressed and shared. Remember, you can’t pour from an empty cup. Parenting requires you to be your best self and tend to your needs first to see your child flourish.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary We have gone from having lunch with colleagues and meeting after work to eating hurriedly at our desks at home. The change in relationships at work also affects our productivity, argues SMU’s Kenneth Tai. Work friendships have waned with work-from-home. (Photo: iStock/hxyume) SINGAPORE: It was not that long ago, in the not-so-distant past, that going out to lunch with the same group of colleagues was a regular routine for most people at work. It was as habitual as our daily commute to work. Yet both have been absent since COVID-19 forced most of us to work from home. For more than a year now, we have been eating lunches alone at our home desks, missing our colleagues who used to help break a mundane workday with banter and even gossip. With the shift towards working from home and fewer physical opportunities to connect if at all, many of our work friendships have been languishing. Work flies on the wings of face-to-face interactions, chemistry and collaboration and yet gone are the serendipitous water cooler chats, brainstorming sessions and inside jokes. Much of our joy and mind-meld also stemmed from the partnerships that bloomed out of shared challenges: A difficult colleague, an impossible appraisal goal or hygiene issues around the offices. Yet now with workers disappearing back into homes, we are left to cope - often alone - with disruptions to our daily routines and events outside of work. They have sapped our energy, but we don’t have the ballast of work friends to lean on. Are you missing your colleagues? If this sounds like you, you’re not alone. About 65 per cent of workers working from home due to the pandemic reported feeling less connected to their colleagues, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center involving over 10,300 working adults in the United States in October 2020. In a more recent 2021 study published in Journal of Applied Psychology, a group of researchers from the University of Texas at Austin headed by Jae Kwon Jo showed COVID-19 has impacted friendship ties at work, likely due to social distancing reducing opportunities for employees to seek out help. This is despite work friendships being key source of social support. In another 2020 study published in Applied Psychology, Professor Bin Wang and his colleagues found that employees working from home reported higher levels of loneliness due to fewer opportunities for physical interactions with colleagues and supervisors which made it challenging to maintain these relationships. The pandemic has resulted in increased stress, anxiety and emotional exhaustion that threatens work friendships. In a 2020 survey conducted by the National University Health System's (NUHS) Mind Science Centre involving 1,407 respondents, 61 per cent of those working from home reported feeling stressed, compared with 53 per cent of front-line workers. This suggests that the impact of declining work friendships is more likely to be felt by those working from home. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on work friendships is also evident at the firm level. In a large-scale survey, conducted by the Boston Consulting Group in 2020, involving over 12,000 employees in Germany, US and India, employees who experienced less social connectivity during the pandemic became less productive in collaborative work. To that end, employees’ impacted productivity, psychological and mental well-being as well as lower levels of team collaboration, are likely to have an adverse impact on organisational performance and culture. Having a best friend at work has been often cited as a key reason why people stay on with an organisation so what happens when the friendship takes a beating? The effects of working from home might run deeper. Friendships play a central role in people's lives. They provide joy and meaning. In fact, one of the most reliable indicators of happiness and life satisfaction for all ages is the quantity and quality of interpersonal relationships and this extends to work friendships. Although one might argue that work friendships are transactional relationships of convenience to some extent , this is more likely to occur in the initial stages of the friendship where people help one another while trying to complete a project or work task. But once workers settle down, research in communications suggests that workplace friendships share similar foundations as friendships outside of the workplace. According to a 1998 study conducted by Professor Patricia M Sias and Professor Daniel J Cahill, found that co-workers can become closer over time and develop meaningful forms of companionship, with people sharing more work-related problems and aspects of their personal lives. They may also socialise outside of work, with communication becoming less cautious and more intimate. So, work friendships are no less genuine or less important compared with friendships outside of work settings. Those with “work spouses” in their organisations also benefit in multiple ways. Empirical studies have shown that work friends can offer task assistance, emotional support, work and non-work related advice - all of which are associated with positive work outcomes. Work friends experience higher job satisfaction and psychological well-being, feel more positive at work, and see work to be more meaningful Good work friendships ultimately benefit teams and organisations by increasing organisational commitment, facilitating cooperation and cohesion, and driving creativity and innovation. A 2016 study published in European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, psychologist Simone Donati and her colleagues found the greater the extent to which teams members form friendships at work, the more likely team members will engage in innovative behaviours in which they constantly exchange information. Given just how important work friendships are – not just to people’s own well-being but also that of a company - it is even more critical during a pandemic where a sense of isolation and loneliness has sunken in with extended remote working conditions. This is why everyone needs to make it a point to maintain workplace friendships. Instead of waiting for work friends to reach out to you, be proactive and make the effort to check in more often with them. Colleagues could schedule a \"virtual lunch date\" where they can eat together, share about one another’s personal challenges while being an active and empathetic listener. These conversations are not about work – but about lives outside of it, such as interests, hobbies, books people read or food they tried and liked. Organisations can also play an important role by creating virtual opportunities for employees to build and maintain their work friendships. When the pandemic struck in early 2020, Krissee Chasseur, brand aura research and development lead at online retailer Zappos, decided to host weekly virtual happy hours for her team of 100 and up to 60 people have participated each week. Elsewhere, Boston Consulting Group provides meditation sessions and online fitness classes in many of their offices. Besides helping employees with their psychological well-being, these group wellness activities also allow them to remain connected with their work friends. And perhaps when restrictions finally ease, hopefully in end-October in Singapore, we can reconnect and enjoy the benefits of friends at work.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary We may feel our stress levels rising during this pandemic but remembering it’s a normal biological reaction to challenging situations can give us perspective, says the Institute for Mental Health's CEO Daniel Fung. How best does one cope with stress? (Photo: iStock) SINGAPORE: The last few weeks have seen growing apprehension as the cases of serious COVID-19 infections and deaths rise nationally. At our hospital, the national institution for the mentally unwell, we have faced our own coronavirus outbreak . The anxiety over whether we could cope with the numbers, which rose rapidly for patients and the staff around them, had my heart pounding every time I thought of the situation. This is stress. Stress is the internal reaction to threats to the status quo. It’s one of the most talked about feelings since COVID-19 struck. About 9 per cent surveyed by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) between May 2020 and June 2021 reported mild to severe stress while 13 per cent experienced symptoms of anxiety or depression. While stress has been thought of as something destructive that we struggle with and makes us ill, it plays a critical, even healthy, role in preparing our minds and bodies for a difficult situation. Yes, toxic stress can take a toll on our minds and bodies when extreme emotions and symptoms take over, continue for a long time and begin to extend beyond an individual’s control. This is especially true during this pandemic in which individuals are isolated, families separated, and work disrupted. Added stress has come from managing kids while working from home and the uncertainty of whether businesses can reopen over these two years. But chronic stress is slightly different. It can be caused by difficult relationships like when couples fight constantly, or a parent loses their temper with their child regularly. These problems can become associated with abuse and trauma which amplifies the stress. Such forms of stress leave people vulnerable to physical and mental illnesses. The body tries to deal with this through releasing chemical messengers called hormones and individual behavioural changes such as trying to escape from their problems and finding ways to defuse the stress. This mechanism is called allostasis. It’s the same way your body strives to regulate body temperature when you catch a fever or how your stomach maintains its acidic juices. But like suffering from a long bout of a pernicious virus, longstanding chronic stress can change your biological response. Overloading of your system can lead to a nervous breakdown and physical illness. The reality is that most stress is neither good nor bad. These feelings merely set up a physiological response in our bodies to cope with it. The study of stress started with a medical researcher Hans Selye in the 1930s tinkering with rats and observing their hormonal changes when “stressed” with unpleasant environmental manipulation such as drastic changes to temperatures. His discovery led the application of this understanding to humans and that the body’s physiological responses after exposure to a variety of stressors can make a person sick if they remain in a persistent state of heightened stress. However, the body and the brain try to return to the status quo first by using internal body-wide mechanisms to establish control. When there is a sensing of danger, we breathe faster, allowing more oxygen to get into our blood stream. Our heart pumps harder to get this oxygen delivered to all vital organs. This “fight or flight” response prepares us to deal with a coming crisis. This bodily reaction is good for the short term because it prepares us for the coming danger, but if prolonged, will become a problem as the hormones may wear down our organs and literally make us sick. Stress is an inevitable part of all life. Famed neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky in his book, Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers, explained that a zebra when faced with its natural predator, the large cats, either ends up escaping or being eaten. Both events are short termed. On the other hand, humans, tend to subject themselves to long-term stress, by over worrying and continuing to subject the body and mind to the stress response. The immediate dangers are often prolonged in constant worrying and looking out for signs of trouble. This normal physiological response to acute stress becomes prolonged and can result in peptic ulcer disease. For example, in a rating scale of student stress, the stress of an increased workload and having a new boyfriend or girlfriend had the same weightage. Yet, young people don’t shy away from relationships just because they are stressful. What distinguishes good stress from bad ones is how it affects people. Good, tolerable stress tends to motivate us and keep us alert to things around us, reaping positive outcomes such as motivating students to study for exams. Such forms of stress help develop resilience. A well-known study of Romanian children adopted from neglectful and abusive situations go on to have a variety of outcomes. Some do badly while others do well despite having similar stressful childhoods. Resilience is the result of recovering from stress and becoming stronger. Dealing with normal amounts of stress should be a cinch, requiring us to learn to manage challenges in bite-sized packages. Stress comes along, our body recognises it, reacts to it and copes. Our brains may tell us to perhaps take a deeper breath or go for a walk. Still, as this pandemic demonstrates, there may be novel microbes that surprise our system. For example, we may experience a tragic, traumatic event for which we did not anticipate – a fatal accident, the sudden loss of livelihood that plunges a family into financial distress, or losing a loved one to suicide. This overwhelms our natural coping mechanisms and we can succumb to its severe effects. Like the COVID-19 vaccine which protects us from SARS-COV-2, we need a type of inoculation to protect us from novel but toxic stress. Studies around mental resilience show three main ways we can build our defences against the detrimental effects of stress to bounce back from difficult experiences. First, understanding ourselves better, knowing what our strengths and weaknesses are as well as how we feel about ourselves. The introduction of social emotional learning into the curriculum in schools so that every child has the necessary skills to negotiate social situations and relationships beyond the family is underway and will evolve further in 2022. Mental health education has been included in the curriculum for secondary schools this year to help students understand common mental health issues and how to seek help for themselves and others. An improvement in help-seeking behaviour would be a sign this is working. Second, focusing on our relationships with others, starting with the family and then extending to our friends and colleagues, helps us build stronger connections to people around us who we can seek help from. In a study of family resilience, we were able to show that family resilience results in individual resilience. Family resilience was shown in the care and concern members had for each other as well as how feelings are managed at home, the sense of meaning and purpose in life and the sharing of common values and beliefs. These are important factors in coping with stress. Third, we should encourage our personal development, and establish interests, hobbies and ways we achieve a personal sense of meaning and purpose. This is in fact one of the sustainable development goals of the United Nations, that of “ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all ages”. Creating supportive community ecosystems that encourage the social compact, neighbourliness, and love for one another can be facilitated by the teaching of emotional literacy in schools and workplaces. Emotion regulation, problem solving, mindfulness, interpersonal skills and even stress management training are competencies that can be built on the foundational values of care and concern for one another. We can take small steps to remind ourselves of our incredible fortitude and fortunes. When I worry about what will happen in this next phase of the pandemic, and seeing the stress and burnout reported in the surveys of our workers, I remind myself of our healthcare teams as they do their utmost to contain the infections, manage their lives and turn to each other for care and support. In my regular chats with staff, I ask them who they go to for help and invariably, they point to the colleagues around them. And then I realise, what doesn’t kill you will indeed make you stronger.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Bruce was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder at the age of 15. (Illustration: Kenneth Choy) SINGAPORE: He stood frozen in the toilet for up to five hours at a go, often walked an overhead bridge backwards and found comfort opening and closing the refrigerator door repeatedly for hours. These are the memories that Evelyn Chng and Tony Kee have of their son’s childhood. Evelyn and Tony first noticed something was amiss in 2011, when they received a memo from their eldest child, *Bruce’s (not his real name) Mathematics teacher about him not handing in eight weeks of homework. Tony had wondered if his 14-year-old son – who was exceptionally skilled at Math – was struggling under the stress of his Triple Science course or his experience being bullied a year ago. Concerned, he looked for Bruce’s school bag. “I discovered the question papers, all crumpled inside. That’s when I realised that something was not right,” the 51-year-old recounted. For the next two years or so, the Kees watched as their usually happy-go-lucky and active child became increasingly reticent and withdrawn. Bruce, who used to place in the top 10 per cent of his cohort, started to become untidy and fall behind in school. Just months before he was due to sit for his O-Level examinations, he was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). OCD is a mental health condition that makes it “difficult for individuals with the condition to process information”, says Haanu Prithivi Raj, senior clinical psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health’s (IMH) Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. “Having OCD is similar to having a broken filter or sieve in the brain. When the sieve works, the brain is able to ignore intrusive thoughts (that do not make sense) that we all have. However, when we have OCD, the sieve or filter is broken or torn and hence these thoughts fall through and this causes distress to us as we are not able to ignore these intrusive thoughts and fears anymore,” Ms Raj told CNA. While there is not much data on OCD in Singapore youth, Ms Raj estimates it could affect up to 4 per cent of youths here, which is almost double the global prevalence of 2 to 3 per cent. From 2014 to 2018, the IMH Child Guidance Clinics saw an average of about 130 children and adolescents aged between 6 and 18 years old with OCD. When Tony and Evelyn received the diagnosis, they didn’t know what to do. “We thought that it could be treated,” recalled Evelyn. “We thought OCD could be fully recovered from – with everything reset back to normal,” Tony said. Then, Bruce started to display compulsions during his first semester in polytechnic. “By 17, his condition was already severe. He would keep going in and out of the classroom doors during class because of anxiety,” said Evelyn. Both parents recall having to wait hours in the school’s carpark as their teenage son flitted in and out of his empty classroom in a deserted school. Because they had no access to the school’s facilities, they sometimes had to enlist the help of a security guard to escort their son down. Bruce also began calling his mother from the canteen every day to help him decide what to eat. Once, he called her to ask if he could bring an empty wrapper back. “He couldn’t seem to make decisions. His decision-making was affected,” said Tony, who works in the financial services sector. At home, Bruce would spend several hours in the toilet after a shower, standing in one spot as if frozen in time. When he was ready to exit the toilet, his family was forced to rearrange the house to the state it had been in before he entered hours earlier, or else, he could not bring himself to enter an environment he perceived himself to have no control over. This daily occurrence meant having to switch off all the lights and gas and wait around, even if the family happened to be preparing dinner at the time. These rituals were a way for Bruce to relieve his anxiety, Evelyn, 49, explained. Whether it is counting or what, he will have to do whatever feels right. If he doesn’t count properly to relieve the anxiety, then he will feel like it is incomplete. Once he does complete it, he releases his anxiety and everything goes back to normal. \"OCD MANIPULATES THE WHOLE FAMILY” Even though they were hoping it was just “a passing phase of puberty”, the Kees brought their son to a temple where they were told to perform rituals to rid him of “spiritual possessions” and “bad luck”. “It’s that thing when you’re hopeless and confused and everything people say, you just believe. You just grab it,” said Tony with a wry smile. “It was so bizarre that we could not even try to understand. We were trying to see what we could do to help him because … he had just changed into another person,” Evelyn said. Things soon came to a head in 2014 when Bruce was asked to leave his diploma course after his first year of study due to poor results. Hospitals they had applied to for treatment also rejected him due to the severity of his condition. Evelyn suffered two breakdowns and had to be hospitalised, she said. “I was under too much stress … I had a panic attack because of his rituals. It affected the whole family because we had to try and manage his anxiety,” Evelyn recounted quietly. Back then, she was acting as caregiver to her mother with dementia as well. “I felt like an octopus. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know what to handle and what came first. I didn’t know how to manage.” Bruce also didn’t allow the family to eat in the kitchen or talk at home as it made him anxious and affected the rigid rules and order he expected himself and others to abide by. He also targeted his younger sister whom he couldn’t stand the sight of, once going so far as to impede her from going to the toilet for several hours when their parents were out. Soon, Bruce began demanding that his mother help him with some rituals, such as opening and closing the refrigerator door. “I was being sucked into his rituals. My husband tried to intervene and I got sandwiched in between trying to manage his anxiety and not participate,” said Evelyn. “When he got tired, he would ask me to complete the ritual and I had to do exactly as instructed. He would beg me saying ‘Please mummy, last time, last time’ when I refused. He would also shout and yell.” Evelyn often attempted to remove herself from the situation. In the middle of the night, she would walk out of their home and sit at the staircase landing. “He would try to stop me from leaving – which stopped him (doing his rituals) … and sometimes, I would end up dozing off because I had to sit there for one to two hours while waiting for him to calm down,” she said, grimacing. “It was painful, but I had no choice.” Dr Adrian Loh, visiting consultant with the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at IMH explained that children and teens suffering from OCD frequently display compulsions such as touching certain objects in a specific pattern, or having to say things in a certain way, without understanding why. “In some of these cases, all they can explain is that this just ‘feels right’, leading to much parental frustration. In some cases when sufferers are unable to obtain relief from overwhelming anxiety and discomfort, they may even end up with rage attacks which can be misunderstood as misconduct by family members,” added Dr Loh. “IT WAS HELL. IT WAS HELL” Dealing with a child who had to perform rituals at the expense of the family’s peace meant several clashes and fights within the family. “The police have come (to the house) so many times that we can apply to be VIP members,\" joked Tony. “Sometimes, it was us who called. And sometimes, it was the neighbours from the opposite block who called because … of the serious fights. It was too stressful and my daughter and I would get very scared when they fought as they would throw things here and there,\" Evelyn said. Tony and Evelyn were also at constant loggerheads due to the mounting stress. Said Tony: “It’s like … as a man, in the office, you can solve an issue. But you can’t even bring your child from the toilet to the bedroom. It’s just a short distance but you can’t do it, you know? The frustration was just too much,” he said. At their lowest, the couple who have been married for 25 years, briefly considered ending it all. Father and son stopped speaking to each other, and Bruce began to regard Tony as an enemy. Not even extended family were privy to the situation and the Kees suffered in silence as both parents feared the stigma young Bruce would face if people found out he had a mental condition. Neighbours started giving the family the cold shoulder on account of Bruce’s odd behaviour in public. They had spotted him walking backwards on roads and overhead bridges, or pacing up and down at nearby bus stops for hours. “Once, we tried dragging him home, but he went back to the place because he had to complete his ritual. (At home), whenever we tried bringing him from the toilet to his room, after we turned off the lights, he would come out and go to the toilet and finish his ritual then go,” said Tony. Oftentimes, when he was coming home, Bruce would stop just shy of his front door to perform a mental ritual that would have him wait outside for one to two hours while his family waited inside, unable to leave. THE TURNING POINT A turning point came in 2015, three years after Bruce was diagnosed. Tony recalled being in a heated quarrel with Bruce one night when the elder Kee’s cousin – who was called in for help - walked into the house, demanding to know: “What happened again this time? Why again?” “When I heard her saying it like that, I told myself I need to make some changes, otherwise one day, even your own cousin will not come and help you anymore,” he said. The realisation drove Tony and Evelyn to begin searching for support groups. They attended an OCD seminar at IMH where they came across Caregivers Alliance (CAL), which helps caregivers of mentally ill people. “We began attending their classes and from there, it started to change our perception,” Evelyn said. “We got to hear other people’s stories when they shared. We learned about how to journey with them, the symptoms itself and working closely with the medical team. (This) really helped us.” Around the same time, Bruce was accepted by IMH for treatment and his parents picked up skills on how to reinforce those messages at home. “I tried to find out how I could actually support him at home – how to not reinforce his behaviour and participate in his rituals at home,” said Evelyn. “They used Exposure Response Therapy (ERT), so at home I used other forms like daily chores or daily routines to build back his confidence and self-esteem. \"Because of his OCD, he was very good at cleaning, cutting vegetables – so I would ask him to do that for me. After that, I started to look at his strengths. If he could do (a task), I would tell him, ‘Thank you son, for helping me with this’.” “After that, he started to change and we could empathise with what he was going through. We were no longer fighting,” she added with a smile. For Tony, the courses helped his wife and him to develop a “common language” that helped them at home when caring for Bruce. “In the past, she had her method and I had my own method and we always clashed. So going for the courses helped us a lot,” he said. JOURNEYING WITH OTHER SILENT SUFFERERS Motivated by their breakthroughs, Tony and Evelyn began volunteering with CAL, conducting training for other caregivers in Mandarin. “Along the way, things got better and better,” said Tony. In class, caregivers marvelled at the pair’s experience dealing with their son’s OCD and Evelyn’s mother’s dementia. “They asked us: ‘Eh? How come you look healthy?’” laughed Tony. “That’s how people viewed us,” said Evelyn. “We were a source of inspiration, a source of hope.” Encouraged by the results, Evelyn left her job in retail pharmacy to join CAL as a caregiver support specialist. She and her husband also signed up for an 18-month-long graduate diploma course in counselling and psychology, which allowed them to become counsellors with CAL. They now hold three-hour classes for caregivers in Mandarin every week. When this reporter sat in for one of their classes, the pair was engaging and jovial, often joking to keep things lighthearted. “We wanted to help those walking the same journey as us. Patients themselves may be in denial because they don’t have much insight. The family members might feel that it’s okay la, just cope and live with it. But it’s very difficult - it will get worse, and not only that, it will disintegrate the family,” said Evelyn. Looking back, Tony admits he wouldn’t have considered volunteering if not for years of struggle with Bruce and his mother-in-law’s situation. “I took it as a lesson that I needed to go through to learn from it.” Perhaps most surprising is that Bruce himself, now 23, recently joined IMH as a full-time peer support specialist, egged on by his mother. “I told him: ‘Since you’re recovering to a stage where you are more stable, what do you want to do? What do you want to move on to in life? Work or study?’ So when the National Council of Social Service offered this course, I actually encouraged him to go for it,” Evelyn said. “On the first day, he was five minutes late, but from the second day onwards, he was half an hour early and even volunteered to leave the house early,” Tony said. He and Evelyn were soon amazed at the transformation in their once-incapacitated son. “I encouraged him to view his illness in a different light and he began to realise that there were so many people walking a similar journey. His view and perception of his peers, mental health and people with similar conditions really changed then,” Evelyn said. She was overjoyed when Bruce told her: “Mummy, I am happy you know”, when he came back home after work. “Along the way, he told me: ‘All of us have gone through a certain kind of abuse for our mental condition and there are so many people out there who actually need support in health’ and that he wanted to thank his psychologist and psychiatrist for helping him to achieve what he is today. He had never thanked them until that moment, but after the course, he had learned to appreciate them, and I remember thinking ‘Wow’,” Evelyn said proudly. “Now he is able to advise me on what kind of therapy to give his por por (Mandarin for grandmother) and how to speak to her. There is a drastic change and we can see that he is going back to what he used to be – a very lovely, kind and helpful boy,” she said. Still, they understand that Bruce’s mental illness is a life-long journey. “Of course, now he may be coping well, but in the future we don’t know. It’s still a lot of uncertainty, but we can only be hopeful and be positive,” said Evelyn. “We told him that ‘This is meaningful, and you’re creating value with your life, and that is all that is important – you don’t need to have very high qualifications to live that type of life … you’re actually giving hope to others that recovery is possible and your loved ones can be treated. That is the satisfaction.’” *************** CNA spoke to Bruce about his experience with OCD and this is what he shared with us: What is your OCD based on? Bruce: For me it’s checking and mostly I have to do things right. I have a particular way (of doing things) that is correct that I have to do. It’s based on my own logic. What kind of rituals are involved? Bruce: Like there are things that I need to place in certain areas of my house. And when I do things, I sort of plan them out in my head before I do them - there’s a certain order. What happens when it doesn’t fall in that order? Bruce: Then I will feel like very stressed out, because I had already planned out everything nicely in my head. I’m very aware of how people view me. Even if people aren’t judging me, I have that feeling that people are judging me. What kind of rituals were you doing in the toilet? Mental rituals. After bathing, I do my mental rituals inside my mind and they mostly involve counting and running through all the steps and all the things in my head. The steps are mostly related to showering. I’m just usually slowly moving through the steps. And I’m also trying to sort out all the things in my life, because in the toilet I feel more comfortable. After bathing I’m very relaxed, so I just sort like staying in there. So I’m done with my shower already when I do the rituals, I just want to stay in the shower. Your parents said after you come out of the shower, the surroundings have to be the same. Yes, because I sort of feel like things are moving around without me - it’s like I didn’t have a feeling of control over the moving things. I need everything to be in the same place because I want to feel a sense of control. How are you learning to cope with OCD now? How are you living with the anxiety? What I do now is mostly keep myself engaged … like do things. Even if I’m at home, I’ll be surfing the Net, or finding something to do to keep my mind occupied to distract myself. Because if I don’t do anything, I tend to think a lot. Because my normal state is picking on all the details where I am very aware, I’m hyper-aware. So I know that if I don’t do anything, I will go back to that state and nitpick on everything happening around me. I know that that is actually not good for me and it would make me go back to past habits so I try to focus on what the ERP (Exposure Response Prevention) taught me - which is keeping myself occupied. Between graduating from therapy and now, have you ever felt the need to perform your rituals creep up on you? Yes, when I started work, I did. Because working needed me to go back to work the next day. But now it is more controlled - I can sort of resist it even though I still had the urge to do (the rituals). I try to distract myself, mostly. It has helped me to be more spontaneous also. Because of doing things that are sort of losing the control already so I’ve gotten used to it and I start to feel more at ease with just suddenly doing things instead of overplanning and making sure that things go a certain way. Now I am more able to just react as things happen. Your parents took up a lot of courses and studied to walk on this journey with you and today they are helping caregivers. What do you think about what they have done? I think it’s a good thing because they help others. It’s because of my mum taking part in this caregiver thing that she made me go for the sessions and that made me more aware that I wanted to help people also. After I went for the sessions then I started to want to help out with peer support. I was inspired when I saw my parents teaching others. I am grateful that they took those steps to help me. They were my pillars of support as well as my psychologists … they were not ostracising me. What has it been like as a peer support specialist for the past three months? I feel like it’s a good thing, even though it may not seem like a good job in the eyes of the public. I feel like it makes me able to do things. It is meaningful and it’s something that I want to wake up and do. It’s not like some jobs where you have to drag yourself to work because this environment is quite good I feel. The people are nice and I feel very at ease. I work with a multi-disciplinary OCD team where I’m the only PSS. What is a regular day like for you? Because they don’t want to rush me through, I only currently have a few patients that I’m working with. I either talk to them over the phone or if I can meet them face-to-face, I’ll meet them face-to-face and just talk to them. It’s quite simple, it’s just befriending and just being yourself. Have you met any patients who are in the same place that you once were? Yes, some bits, but not exactly the same. Certain parts when I hear more about their personality, I can relate. If they are perfectionists, I can sort of relate that I’m also like that in a certain way. I can use my experience to talk about how I would react to and how I apply and handle certain things. I think doing this helps me in my own recovery because I go back home and reflect on it and it becomes more instilled in myself that I did go through this and I’ll remind myself that I should not (go back to that). What is one piece of advice you would give a youth who has OCD? They must be willing to seek help, because for me at that point, I didn’t really accept that I had OCD. I think awareness … being aware of it is quite hard. For me, I didn’t have awareness but my parents sort of forced me to seek help, so I sought help. If you have a feeling that maybe things are not really right, try to seek help and be willing to receive therapy, treatment and medicine. I think one thing that stops people from recovering is that a lot of the patients with OCD, if they aren’t being forced to receive help, they won’t want to seek help – they think that there is nothing wrong with them. For me, I also thought that way. I thought: “I’m normal, what. OCD is just some doctor’s label”. Spending 4 hours in the toilet … To me, it was not illogical in my point of view. I just thought that it was my way of doing things. It didn’t occur to me that it was OCD. I just thought it was my personality. OCD is highly treatable. You have to be conscious of what OCD is like so that you know if you have some traits that start to affect your life, then you have to be willing to seek help. It’s not the end of the road if you are diagnosed with OCD. *Bruce’s name has been changed to protect his privacy.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Think Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and the image of a hyperactive boy might come to mind. It’s a misconception that has caused some people to struggle for decades before they learnt the truth, and found their tribe. Cheyenne Seah, 39, had always felt she had to work twice, even three times as hard as others. An ADHD diagnosis changed her life. (Photo: Eileen Chew) SINGAPORE: Growing up, Cheyenne Seah always felt she had to work twice, even three times as hard as the people around her to get things done. “I felt like I was the stupid one,” she said. Seah, now 39, would forget even the simplest of things. Organisation and administrative tasks stressed her out to no end. She could never motivate herself to get her homework done until the last minute – and would end up copying from friends. At the age of 10, she realised that her brain “worked” when she drank coffee, so she picked up the habit to “give herself a hit”. By the time she was in her early 20s, she was downing eight cups to get through the day. After the caffeine overload, she would drink alcohol – 500ml or so – in the evenings to sleep. When she won a scholarship and began pursuing a PhD in biology and research, however, the demands became too much to bear. Despite putting in 16-hour days in the lab, she never felt she was able to catch up. The anxiety of turning in quality work on tight deadlines began to gnaw away at her. Soon, there were days she couldn’t even get out o f bed. She knew she was failing, but could not do anything to motivate herself. “I didn’t shower for days. I just wanted to die,” she said. “It was like seeing a car crash in front of you in slow motion and you cannot help yourself.” At the urging of those around her, she saw a doctor and was treated for anxiety and depression for almost a year. She was 30 by the time an eagle-eyed visiting doctor dug a little deeper and looked at her childhood habits. “Cheyenne,” he told her. “I think you might have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).” As an adult woman by then, she was an unlikely candidate. There are no local studies on the prevalence of ADHD in Singapore, but international data suggests that about 5 per cent of children have ADHD, according to Dr Bhanu Gupta of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). Traditionally, ADHD has been known as a childhood disorder associated with, in Gupta's words, “young boys bouncing around and creating a lot of trouble in the classroom”. Despite the association with hyperactivity, there are elements that may be harder to pick up, said the senior consultant at IMH’s department of mood and anxiety. For example, some people with ADHD are simply inattentive. “They can be easily distracted, have difficulty in focusing or sustaining attention on tasks, and can be quite disorganised,” he said. There are also those who are impulsive and may act or speak without thinking. A review published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal noted that ADHD is more common in boys than girls, with a ratio of 2 to 3:1 reported in community prevalence studies. “This may represent the fact that ADHD in girls and women is not recognised very well,” said Gupta. This is because male patients tend to be more hyperactive, according to psychiatrist Lim Boon Leng. “The behaviour is obvious – they’re running around shouting and disrupting classes,” said Dr Lim, who is in private practice at Gleneagles Medical Centre. “But some of the female patients are quietly sitting in the corner daydreaming, and they’re never surfaced .” About 30 per cent of children with ADHD will grow into adulthood with difficulties, and continue to have symptoms that need treatment, he said. While adults with ADHD may be able to suppress their restlessness, they may continue to have difficulty sustaining their focus and be distracted and careless. From 2018 to 2020, IMH saw an average of 67 new cases of adult ADHD a year. But this represents only the tip of the iceberg, Gupta said. “A lot of people with ADHD don’t seek (medical) attention.” One reason is that they may not know they have it. Patients may also develop skills to live with their condition and only come forward when they are no longer able to cope. Characterised by hyperactivity, inattention and impulsive behaviour, ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in children. It is, however, a lifelong condition: About 30 per cent of children would have their symptoms continue into adulthood. Not everyone with ADHD will have the same symptoms, but common ones include being easily distracted, having difficulty concentrating, fidgeting or feeling restless. While ADHD cannot be cured, its symptoms can be treated. Medical professionals use diagnostic tools like the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) to diagnose ADHD. There are nine criteria for hyperactivity, and nine for inattention. Children would usually have to meet six out of the nine, while adults have to fulfil five. Only a trained medical professional can diagnose ADHD. More information on ADHD in the local context can be found at SPARK and Unlocking ADHD . Misconceptions do not help. For example, the notion that people can “grow out” of ADHD, or it afflicts only those who are struggling academically. Misconceptions had very real consequences for Jnanee Krishnasamy, 30, another “unlikely candidate”. In primary school, her mother had structured and organised her schedule, making sure she completed her homework. Thanks to this, she excelled, doing well enough to get into the Integrated Programme at one of the top secondary schools in Singapore. “That was when my mum decided I was old enough to manage my own schoolwork, and that’s when everything came crashing down,” she said. Jnanee would attempt to do school assignments but get distracted by video games within a few minutes. She rarely handed in assignments, and would be extremely late if she did. She tried her best to get her life organised, getting a diary and making to-do lists. But within days, she would lose or forget about them. When her grades started slipping, no one thought much about it, she recalled. “People thought it was a combination of laziness, because we had no O-Levels, or that I didn’t have the natural aptitude to begin with.” Curious about psychology, she remembers coming across ADHD in a book and was startled to realise that the description matched what she was feeling. She told her mother about it and asked to see a doctor. “As soon as the doctor heard the name of my school, he was like, ‘No, you can’t have ADHD. You’re from a good school, you’re probably just stressed’,” she said. Over the next few years, she saw another two doctors, both of whom told her she was “probably just stressed” by the upcoming A-Level exams. “If two or three of them have said that, then who am I to question them?” Now a veterinarian, Jnanee was only diagnosed two years ago due to “a difficult situation” that she declined to elaborate on. Psychiatrist Lim acknowledged that there has been a general lack of awareness about the condition. “Traditionally, ADHD is understood and emphasised to be a childhood illness,” he said. It can, in fact, persist throughout one’s life. “If you were disorganised, not completing what you’re supposed to do, the advice would be to try harder,” added Gupta. “A lot of the time, people just end up blaming themselves, even though they recognise that they seem to be struggling much more doing day-to-day tasks compared to their peers.” WATCH: Women With ADHD: How A Diagnosis Changed Our Lives (08:01) The repercussions of a late diagnosis can be huge. The demands of going through life with undiagnosed ADHD can be so overwhelming that patients can end up developing other conditions. “We do see people who come with depressive or anxiety symptoms. But when you talk to them more in detail, it turns out that’s the external manifestation, and they struggled all their life with ADHD-type symptoms,” said IMH’s Gupta. By then, the condition could have damaged careers and relationships. Take Angie Chang, 28, who remembers never being able to focus in school and failing subjects right from the beginning. She took six years to complete secondary school and four years to get a polytechnic diploma. “Some people said I would never make it in life,” she said. Her parents thought she was a slow learner, and it never occurred to them that she had ADHD. After graduating with a nursing diploma in 2016, Chang reckoned she tried out more than 20 different jobs, from nursing roles to part-time positions like waiting tables. She estimates that 95 per cent of the time, she did not manage to pass probation. Twice, she was fired after only three days. “They said I was slow. Couldn’t focus,” she said. She often found it difficult to explain her employment history to prospective employers. “I always said I’d rather work (at the company I was interviewing at), or maybe that (the previous) place wasn’t my ideal, or I wanted a change,” she said. “But it was just to cover the weakness.” Moonlake Lee, 52, meanwhile, is happily married to her husband of 29 years. But it was only at the end of 2019, when she was diagnosed with ADHD, that she realised her condition had caused tension in her marriage. “Sometimes, it’s the small things you do that get on people’s nerves,” she said. She remembers always being late, interrupting her husband during serious conversations and being very disorganised. Time blindness, which in Lee’s case meant she could be anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour late for appointments, can have a negative impact on work, family and social relationships, she said. This is compounded by the struggles people with ADHD tend to face with executive functioning skills like planning and organisation. Lee’s daughter was diagnosed with ADHD in 2018, and it was then that she realised she also had the condition. The benefits of a diagnosis were immediate – first and foremost, in her marriage. “There’s a lot more compassion,” she said. “ In the past, my husband would see all the little things that bugged him about me as character flaws. But now he knows it’s just my ADHD ‘wiring’. ” On a deeper level, a diagnosis can also aid self-acceptance. For this reason, doctors say getting formally diagnosed can be life-changing. “They never realise that the problem was not them – they have always been blaming themselves,” said Lim. “So they heave a sigh of relief and say: ‘It’s not me, it’s just a condition’.” “It’s really akin to short-sightedness,” he added. “ Imagine a person who has been seeing with blurred vision suddenly wearing glasses – it can really be life changing. ” After diagnosis, treatment can make a remarkable difference. Medication can help those with ADHD sustain their concentration and perform better at work, said Lim. There are also other forms of treatment. Life coaches can help with strategies on time management and overcoming some of the symptoms of ADHD, said Lim. Individuals can also see a psychologist or counsellor to address any other emotional difficulties arising from their condition, such as anxiety or depression. There are also individuals who think they have ADHD but actually do not, said Lim. Some may have read misleading articles while others feel they have certain symptoms. There are also people who may erroneously attribute their difficulties or failures to ADHD when that may not be the case, he said. “We often get people who come to us, and are worried that if they come for the diagnosis, we will prescribe medication,” added Gupta. “But it’s always a consultation. We give people a choice – you’d discuss what you think is the best possible treatment, and a lot of people choose not to take medication or go for therapy. We respect that choice.” Following her diagnosis, Seah’s life has taken a different turn. She decided not to pursue her PhD or a science career, telling herself to start on a clean slate. S he took a part-time diploma in learning disabilities management to understand how she could manage herself better and use her strengths and weaknesses. She read books and listened to podcasts to find out more about ADHD. These equipped her with practical ways to deal with her “bad short-term memory”. She now sets recurring reminders on her phone to pay her credit card bill, for instance, and has a smart watch that beeps every hour to remind her to go for meetings. While she still enjoys a cup of coffee in the morning, it’s nowhere near the amount she used to drink to get through the day. “(The diagnosis) gave me the peace to know that I’m all about the new stuff – so it’s okay to achieve a certain level, hand it over well and then go on my next adventure,” she said. She has done this with panache. In recent years, she has tried her hand at business and industry development, human resource strategy and psychology. She now does business advisory and career coaching, and is studying cybersecurity and blockchain. She also coaches girls with ADHD, teaching them life skills and some executive functions like managing priorities, handling people, and dealing with emotional trauma. “I want to buy these girls an opportunity for a better life than the one I had,” she said. These days, she works out of the bedroom of her simply decorated flat. With the air-conditioner running and soft music playing on her laptop, it is a conducive spot. Small squeeze toys and gummy bears are within close reach as outlets for stress and to “help her brain work”. So is her medication – she is prescribed two different types of medication, one for days she needs to focus and “be an adult”, and another to help with her disrupted sleep patterns. Chang, too, decided to play to her strengths after being diagnosed in 2020. A colleague had urged her to get herself checked – and it was, in her words, an “aha” moment, especially when she did online searches on the condition. “I saw there were so many famous people with ADHD, and I was like: ‘Wow, I’m not alone’,” she said. She realised she shared some of their traits – in particular, creativity and the ability to hyper-focus on things for long periods of time – and this gave her the courage to turn her back on corporate life altogether. She chose not to take medication to deal with her condition. Instead, her therapy involves pouring herself into a passion project: Her own business, ThriftStoreIAm, where she gives second-hand items a new lease of life. “As I focus on packing and doing things like design, I’ll be very tired at the end of the day, and that helps to calm me down,” she said. She is also sleeping better at night after picking up relaxation techniques, such as breathing exercises, online. WATCH: From The Archives: Don't Call Us Beaten | Troubles In The Classroom (21:50) Today, there is much more awareness about ADHD than a few years ago, said both doctors, and there is less stigma in coming forward for help. Younger doctors are gaining an understanding of the condition and becoming more aware of the misconceptions surrounding ADHD, said Lim. Spurred on by the lack of local resources for people with ADHD when she was trying to help her daughter, Lee started an online portal called Unlocking ADHD in April. She hopes to raise awareness about the condition and help people access support groups and coaching programmes. “We wanted to have a comprehensive portal on everything (about) ADHD that people need to know, to live a better life,” she said. Through word-of-mouth and the recruitment of volunteers, she has also managed to meet more people with ADHD and build a support network. This sense of community was particularly helpful for Jnanee. “It gives me a sense of comfort to know that you’re not alone,” she said. The group often shares jokes or memes about ADHD, and she has also learnt coping strategies like setting multiple reminders for meetings and carrying a clipboard with all her tasks for the day. The aim is for Unlocking ADHD to share real stories: Of living with the condition, the struggles, treatment options and, ultimately, the triumph of transformed lives. To Lee, this is the most powerful way to reach people. Jnanee concurs. She “found her tribe” only after meeting Lee and reading about adults with ADHD in a 2020 news article. She now wants others to do the same. “I also want to shatter the stereotype that ADHD is only found in hyperactive little boys,” she declared.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore The creative director for NDP 2022 also spoke about having to find the balance between retaining creative control and letting go, and how to inject the intimacy of theatre into a large-scale show. Adrian Pang, actor and artistic director at local theatre company Pangdemonium, is the creative director for NDP 2022. (Photo: NDP 2022 Executive Committee) SINGAPORE: At 56 years old, actor and theatre veteran Adrian Pang has realised that optimism is a choice. But, he admits, it is one that he is “not normally predisposed to”. “When the pandemic hit, I thought I was going to be okay. But very quickly, I took a turn for the worse and before I could even scramble around for my life vest, I found myself drowning. I was drowning really quickly,” he recounted to CNA. “I was constantly being lifted up by family and friends, just trying to shove me up to the surface again. (I was) just gasping for air.” Then just as he had learnt to tread water, Mr Pang, who is the artistic director of local theatre company Pangdemonium, was approached to be the creative director for the National Day Parade (NDP) 2022. Having hosted the parade in 2008, it is his first time behind the scenes this year. Being creative director was never on his bucket list – in fact, he considers himself a “wild card” choice. But Mr Pang, drawing parallels between Singapore’s battle with the coronavirus and his own fight against depression during the pandemic, found the parade theme \"Stronger Together, Majulah!\" resonating with his own struggles. “I think if I had been approached in any previous year to do this, and if I had said yes, I would have struggled to know what I wanted to say. But they just happened to catch me at this time of my own journey where I felt maybe there was something worth sharing. … This is a new way of trying to look at my life to see where I am and where I’m going,” he said. “And I think communally, this is a collective story. We have been going through a really, really difficult time together (as a nation).” In conversation, Mr Pang often juxtaposes his natural irreverence and aversion to authority with the patriotic gig he has been tasked with that requires him to “deal with civil service sensibilities and bureaucracy”. After all, he has had “artistic and creative control” over his work choices for almost 12 years since setting up Pangdemonium. His theatre company is known for “telling stories that are not just for entertainment value”, he said. “We hope to make you think and feel and talk and debate and, you know, get angry. So I’ve been told not to make people angry.” On the other hand, the work for NDP, which began about 11 months ago, required Mr Pang to “find a happy medium” while “retaining some sense of creative control”. This balancing act has proven to take “a bit of guesswork, anticipation and a lot of hope”. But Mr Pang remains mindful of the significance of his role, for NDP 2022 will mark the return of live performances on a grand scale after celebrations were pared back two years ago. “As maverick as my own instincts might be, I’ve had to, to a large extent, kind of temper that for the greater good,” he told CNA. “Nobody makes work that they hope is not liked. But you know, (Pangdemonium has) never been the kind of company that deliberately creates work or chooses specific pieces of work as crowd pleasers,” he added. “So now, being in a position where I’m very aware that you’re creating an experience for the whole nation … it's having to approach that with a different mindset. You just have to be very cognisant and make sure as many people are taken care of as possible.” There is a need to balance “the appetite, sensibilities and people’s needs” in this “very tricky time” when the country has been “tested in every way”, and figure out whether that means a more celebratory or conservative show, explained Mr Pang. This often means reshaping his personal vision to accede to requests from various parties. For instance, when something in the show has to be altered, it affects every department from choreography to lighting and music. But he has taken it in stride, aware that there are other creatives whose responsibilities are “beyond mine”. “The point is just giving artistic freedom to these creatives as well as respecting their work and trying to align everybody's individual visions into one coherent beast. That's been a huge challenge.” As such, the journey so far has been “a lesson in humility”. “It’s been a lesson in listening, a lesson in trying not to swear so much. That one I’m still learning and failing. Especially not into the microphone at The Float to rally the troops,” he said, laughing. “And it’s a lesson in … drawing the balance between ‘Listen, I need this, so can you find a way to do this?’ and ‘I don’t care what you think, I want this.’” Reflecting on the past 11 months, Mr Pang admitted there is “quite a lot that’s really out of one’s control”, and the job required him to “let go and give in”. “It’s many cooks trying to cook a nine-course meal. And you hope it’s pleasing to 5.8 million people. You can’t win,” he said. “We can only hope that most people enjoy most of the courses, if not all. Chances are there will be people who are not crazy about a certain course, or even a certain ingredient or a certain serving plate … but hopefully everyone comes out of the meal feeling that they’ve had a satisfying meal that is nourishment for the heart, soul and mind,” he further told CNA in a text message. “So I'm just going to shut out all the noise and take it with a huge sack of salt, and just try and put together the best damn show that we can.” To that end, Mr Pang hopes to inject the intimacy from theatre into the parade show, so both live and home audiences have “something they can experience viscerally”. “But on a stage as humongous as that, I told myself early on that it’s going to be folly to try and tell any kind of narrative on the stage, tell a little story, have actors yell their intimate lines … there’s been none of that,” he said. “And so, a lot of the live performances would be painting broad brushstrokes of images and putting across a feeling or an idea that hopefully is clear and resonant enough for people to go, ‘Ah I see, this particular performance is all about resilience’ that kind of thing.” Without sacrificing an intimate narrative, Mr Pang will then use film to present “intimate scenes between individuals with different locations” and “an actual storyline that would be best achieved by film”. The film, called Connections, is written and directed by award-winning Singaporean filmmaker Ken Kwek, and will be interwoven into the performance. “So the structure of NDP this year really has been very cleanly and neatly spread across five live chapters, interspersed by four episodes of film. To tell a big, grand, in-your-face idea and then we go into an intimate story on film. “And then just alternating that while having a coherent and cohesive arc from the first live chapter across all the films, across all the chapters, right to the final chapter,” added Mr Pang. On occasion, he returns to the advice of “one very wise person” who spoke to him before he accepted the gig of creative director. This person told him to “dream a big dream, but one day you must wake up”, he recalled. “If you don’t start with a big dream, you’re just thinking small, thinking within your box. So just start off with as wild a dream as possible. And then as reality sets in, and as one becomes much more aware of the needs of a show like this, you adapt and you convince yourself that the word compromise is not a bad word,” he said. “As long as I am not undermining the very heart and spirit of what I wanted to create, then at least I can look myself in the mirror and go, ‘You know, the final product was not this absurd fantasy that I had envisioned, but it still achieved what I wanted it to achieve in a different way.’” Unexpectedly, the past 11 months also produced a different outcome for Mr Pang. Being NDP 2022’s creative director didn’t just stretch him professionally. It also provoked deeper reflection of his personal revelations from the pandemic – lessons he said he might not have learnt if he hadn’t gone through a dark time. “You just coast along and things are okay. You don’t question things, you don’t appreciate things. You’re not provoked to take stock. This has forced me to take stock and to reevaluate,” he said. “We, as a nation, have been through a very challenging time of our lives in the last two-and-a-half years. But you have to learn some lessons from it. You cannot pretend that this period hasn’t happened. If you want to just erase it and hope to go back to normal, we would have wasted three years of our lives,\" he added. “That message of gratitude for what we still have that’s good in our lives, and also moving forward with a sense of hope, a sense of optimism, with a sense of ‘I’ve grown from this difficult time’ in order to go into the future … I hope that comes across in the show.” And despite not having felt like he was the obvious choice for creative director, Mr Pang’s reflections ultimately led him to realise the journey was for himself. Even after his role in NDP comes to a close next month, he will continue with the uniquely challenging role of being a “better version” of himself. “Growing up as an angsty teen and youth, I didn’t know what outlet to express myself. Probably why I became an actor. And I grew into an angry old man. But as amusing an idea as that might be, it’s not good for myself. I don’t want to be angry. … I am trying to learn some valuable life lessons from the last few years to be better,” he said. In the meantime, Mr Pang may impart these lessons to 5.8 million people – all while putting on the best show he can.

A youth survivor shares three tips on how to get more out of treatment. SINGAPORE: Mental health stigma is still a major barrier to seeking help, although more youths and other survivors are bravely sharing their stories to break the silence. It’s why I documented my experiences and treatment for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) at the Institute of Mental Health on TikTok (@elephantsandmango). It was for the same reason that I agreed to be interviewed for CNA Insider’s deep dive into youth mental health. I have chosen to remain anonymous because I want to protect my family’s privacy whilst being able to speak openly about the issues surrounding mental health. I find that it is difficult to do one without the other. Seeking help – be it confiding in a trusted adult, tapping a service like the Institute of Mental Health’s Community Health Assessment Team, or approaching your nearest polyclinic – is a huge first step. But what next? The “seek help” narrative can sometimes paint a picture in which all your troubles go away when you start therapy. It can oversimplify what entering the mental healthcare system truly entails – a lot of hard work. Now that more people are beginning to seek help, we need to empower them with realistic expectations and practical information. Here are three tips that helped me get the most out of treatment. When I met my first psychologist, I found her to be a kind lady who made me feel validated. However, I could not understand her because – through no fault of her own – she was not a native English speaker. After the first session, I shyly shared with her my reservations. We decided to try for another session. After the second session a week later, I realised it would be difficult to make it work. I was paying for therapy out of my own pocket at that time – each session cost S$57 after subsidies – and did not have the luxury of money to try and build a connection. I had to wait a month to see a different psychologist, but the effort was worth it. I built a strong working relationship with my second psychologist, whom I have been seeing for two years. American psychologist, researcher and author Michael J Lambert, renowned for his work on improving psychotherapy outcomes, argues that the patient-psychologist relationship is important for therapy to be effective. In my experience, this makes perfect sense because psychologists process painful memories with us and advise us on techniques to move forward in life. The way they communicate their insights is as important as what they have to say. What makes for a good connection with your psychologist? A common way of gauging this is whether one sees positive changes after three sessions. If not, you should give feedback to the psychologist (more on this in point 3) and, by the fifth session, you could try finding someone else. That said, if you’ve changed psychologist numerous times, perhaps it is worth reflecting on your approach to psychotherapy. There is significant social stigma and misinformation surrounding medication for mental conditions. I say this based on my own initial scepticism and the reactions of those around me, including my father. He was worried I would develop a lifelong addiction to antidepressants. Another common worry is whether the medicine would compromise one’s daily functions. I have had many conversations about medication with my psychiatrist. Initially, I readily embraced the medication after doing some basic research. After a while, however, the fears from my father and self-doubt crept in. At many points, I asked my psychiatrist why it was important for me to be on medication and whether it would be a lifelong prescription. He shared the science behind selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors – SSRIs, the most commonly prescribed antidepressants – and mental illness. He distinguished between dependency and addiction, and clarified that some patients may be able to slowly wean off the medication in the long run. Others may have to take it for life because their brains are more vulnerable to mental illness and would require it to be functional. (Think of it as a Type 1 diabetes patient’s dependence on insulin injections.) In my case, we are currently working towards weaning off medication. This was not vastly different from what I had read, but hearing it from him gave me more assurance. It was important for me to know what was happening to my body, explain to my father why I needed to be on the medication, and what to expect in the future. WATCH: Are Young People Getting The Help They Need? | Confronting Youth Mental Health Part 2/2 (31:15) It is also helpful to let your psychiatrist know how you are responding to the medication. My body did not react well to the first prescription – while my mood was lighter, I was falling asleep whenever I sat down. I shared this with my doctor and the new prescription worked better – the new drugs lightened my mood without causing drowsiness. My advice to those with the same doubts: Seek the knowledge and assurance you need. Do not be afraid to clear any doubts with your psychiatrist, and honestly share your experience with the medication. There are a variety of psychotherapy methods. I started with exposure therapy which, in my experience, is a paradoxical therapy method that has peer-reviewed legitimacy. Initially, however, I was confused by it as I left most sessions feeling distressed. I found myself dreading sessions and unwilling to recount traumatic memories. I also felt I was wasting my money on sessions and did not want to continue therapy. Yet, I knew that if I wanted to get better, I needed to work through this with my psychologist. She explained the mechanics behind exposure therapy – that complex PTSD is fuelled by avoidance of traumatic memories, which causes them to surface intrusively through flashbacks and nightmares. Imaginal exposure – intentionally reliving the memory in a safe space with the psychologist – breaks this avoidance pattern. After I understood the mechanics, I found myself motivated to go for sessions. I no longer felt like I was wasting time, money and emotions. I saw purpose in the initial discomfort. True enough, the intrusive memories subsided, and I was better able to cope with the trauma. After a year of imaginal exposure therapy, however, I found myself getting bored. We had gone through most of the traumatic memories and I no longer felt as much distress. Yet, I knew that I had so much more to unpack. Perhaps, I had had sufficient exposure to past traumatic incidents and needed a change in methods? I broached this with my psychologist and we spoke about whether my boredom was an unconscious act of avoidance, or if I truly needed a change. Once she was certain it was the latter, she obtained my consent to raise this with her psychologist and psychiatrist colleagues at IMH’s trauma department. To my relief, the first instinct of the team was not, “sigh, more work”. Rather, they rejoiced that I was advocating for myself. This is because complex PTSD patients have typically experienced prolonged domestic violence – thrashings by my mother were a feature of my childhood – and often have difficulty knowing and advocating for their needs. I eventually changed to the schema therapy method and found it profoundly helpful for the next step in my recovery. Schema therapy is designed to break negative thought patterns arising from unmet needs, such as for connection, autonomy and assertion, early in life. Finally, while I’ve urged fellow survivors to be pro-active in getting treatment for mental conditions, I recognise that certain factors are beyond patients’ control. Our public mental healthcare system faces a heavy load and waiting times are longer than before. I also acknowledge that there are some who have felt re-traumatised by the system, be it through mis-diagnoses, insensitive comments made by therapists or the sheer waiting time causing one to feel abandoned. For factors that are within our control, however, I hope these tips will be useful in getting a richer and more effective experience from therapy. All the best in your journey.

    "article_content": "Business Business FILE PHOTO: Pedestrians walk past the Bank of Japan building in Tokyo, Japan March 18, 2024. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo TOKYO : Moody's credit-rating firm would unlikely take negative rating action on Japan even if the government fails to meet its primary budget-balancing target next fiscal year, saying that the target should be considered a commitment to fiscal reform, its Japan sovereign analyst said on Monday. Christian de Guzman of Moody's said he did not expect the fiscal 2025 budget target to be met, but the failure would not trigger a negative rating action. \"If they abandon that commitment and then we actually see that being followed through by actual deterioration and significant deterioration in the fiscal deficit that leads to much higher debt, I think we would have to examine the pillars of the rating,\" he said. The interview with de Guzman comes as he spoke exclusively to Reuters with the prospects of the world with rising interest rates and its potential impacts on Japan's fiscal and monetary policy. \"We expect the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to take a very gradual approach to normalisation,\" de Guzman told Reuters in an interview on Monday. \"That means they (the government) have some time to adjust their fiscal settings to prepare for a time when interest rates at some point could rise even higher,\" de Guzman said. \"We don't see that happening in let's say one to two years.\" Fiscal reform has become an urgent task since the central bank in March ended eight years of negative interest rates and other unconventional policy measures that had kept borrowing costs extraordinarily low. Public borrowing now exceeds more than twice the size of the economy, by far the most among industrialised nations. The government has pledged a primary budget surplus by the next fiscal year, a target many analysts regard as optimistic. The primary budget balance, which excludes new bond sales and debt-servicing costs, indicates to what extent policy measures can be financed without issuing debt. \"The government won't be able to achieve the target,\" de Guzman said. As long as the government sticks to spending and revenue reform commitments, failure to meet the target will not trigger any rating action, at least for the time being, he said. \"I don't think those are forthcoming yet. Still, I think it's signalling there's a commitment, and I think it's important to anchor that commitment.\" Moody's rating for Japanese credit was last set at A1 with stable outlook in late 2014.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Some alternative wellness providers have seen strong demand for flower baths, reiki and other services since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. What’s the draw, and when should people seek professional medical help? By the candlelight: A segment of alternative wellness practitioner Fiona Teo's cacao ceremony. (Photo: Goh Chiew Tong) SINGAPORE: One customer signed up for a ceremony that involved singing mantras, reflecting on things she wanted to let go of, and drinking thick cacao infused with spices. This was part of her journey to recover from personal losses. Another customer takes flower baths regularly because they make her feel more radiant and positive. Alternative therapies remain niche in Singapore, but demand has been holding steady amid the COVID-19 pandemic as some wellness providers report a steady stream of clients turning to them for reiki, cacao ceremonies, crystal healing and other services. While the pandemic is not the sole reason clients have come knocking, it has given rise to people seeking ways to deal with being cooped up, relationship stresses, and livelihoods hurt by the coronavirus, some alternative wellness practitioners told CNA Insider. One fan of flower baths who only wanted to be known as Jit, a 69-year-old retiree, said: “Of course everybody is sceptical at the beginning… because there’s no scientific proof per se. You have to experience it… Another person could have the same flower bath (and) the effect might be different.\" Researchers indeed note the lack of data to back up the effectiveness of many alternative therapies, and caution that they are no substitute for professional medical treatment. Those with physical or mental health problems should still consult mainstream healthcare providers, they advised. One cacao ceremony participant, who only wanted to be known as Ms Khoo, said she felt the need to “recalibrate” her life after she went through a rough patch in her marriage and lost an unborn child. She started doing yin yoga, a slower style of yoga that targets deep connective tissues, at the end of last year. In recent months, she has signed up for two cacao ceremonies. One was conducted virtually, with participants receiving kits with instructions to prepare the cacao drink themselves. The other was held at a candle-lit yoga studio with a few other participants. For Khoo, a 29-year-old social worker, the cacao ceremonies were “very powerful” although they felt “a bit strange” initially. They were conducted by Fiona Teo, who goes by the handle Fiona Healer on social media. She first encountered cacao ceremonies in Bali in early 2019, and enjoyed the full-moon parties and ceremonies where cacao was served. “Cacao ceremonies can be done on many occasions but during a full moon, it’s nice… to set a healing intention, to clear things that no longer serve us, to rejuvenate,” Teo said. Teo’s interest in alternative therapies began when she took up yoga in 2016. At the time, she was a personal assistant at a financial advisory firm, with an eight-to-five job “just like everyone”, she said. The following year, she picked up reiki because she wanted to help heal her mother, dog and friends, who were sick. Starting July last year, she ran a few cacao ceremonies with a friend before conducting her own a few months later. Her attendees are in their mid-20s to 40s, and learn about the ceremonies from her Instagram account, yoga classes or friends of friends. Similarly for psychic reader and reiki practitioner Jenny Tan, there are clients who want to improve their overall well-being, reduce stress or seek help for emotional issues. Some want to relieve their physical ailments. There are also clients who have lost their jobs, as well as those who want to get their businesses out of a slump, said Tan, who owns Gypsee Jenny’s World of Light. The 65-year-old has practised reiki since 2000. Reiki is a form of energy healing where practitioners use their hands to channel what they call universal energy to their clients. Tan said her business has increased by 20 to 30 per cent since the pandemic, and most sessions are now conducted through Zoom. Her in-person sessions consist of reiki, sound healing using singing bowls from Nepal, and the laying of crystals on clients’ bodies. Virtual sessions — which she’d started years ago to cater to customers who have moved away from Singapore — consist of sound healing and reiki. For flower bath provider Srikanthan Balakrishnan, the number of clients has held steady in the last 18 months, but the proportion of them with work-related issues has grown. Some are job-seekers who go to him after having sleepless nights, he said. The 54-year-old founder of Zakti Consultancy conducts eight to nine flower baths a day at his Hoy Fatt Road shop. He also supplies bath packages containing various herbs and flowers to customers who want to do it in their own homes. He has a YouTube video that instructs them how to go about the baths. Srikanthan, who has been in the business for almost 18 years, said he learnt about flower baths from a “spiritual lady” in Indonesia. His clients wear old clothes when they arrive for the baths, which they later throw away. They pu t on new garments before leaving. He encourages clients to “talk to the water” before the baths. He also offers a listening ear to those with problems. WATCH: I Tried a Flower Bath for Migraine Relief (04:55) But alternative wellness providers emphasise that they do not make promises, and advise clients with specific health problems to see a healthcare professional. “I want to tell people that alternative healing is not the answer to all (their) problems. It’s just mostly back-up and it’s not a miracle,” said Tan. “If you have cancer and you have to go for chemotherapy, it means you have to go for chemotherapy.” Although more alternative therapies are becoming available in Singapore, they remain relatively niche, going by findings of the 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study. It found that 6.4 per cent of the adult population in Singapore used at least one form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for their mental illness in the past 12 months prior to the study interviews, which were conducted in 2016. Examples of CAM include homeopathy, herbal therapy, energy healing, relaxation and meditation techniques, and massage therapy, noted Dr Mythily Subramaniam, the Institute of Mental Health’s assistant chairman of the medical board (research). Respondents were asked if they had used any of the therapies in the past 12 months for problems with their emotions or nerves, or their use of alcohol or drugs. The study did not look at why people used CAM, and whether they used it in conjunction with medical treatment or as an alternative to medical treatment, said Mythily. People seek out alternative therapies for a host of reasons – even those they may not necessarily believe in or know much about, said National Institute of Education senior lecturer Lee Boon Ooi. “Very seldom do sick people only receive one source of help. Often they receive multiple kinds of help, both mainstream and alternative, concurrently or sequentially,” said Dr Lee, who has done research on culture and mental health and is also a psychologist. Many people have a pragmatic attitude and want to get the best option, or combination of options, for themselves. “The reason for them to seek alternative help is actually to increase the effectiveness of something else they’ve already done,” he said. That said, there is also a group that seeks out alternative therapies because they believe in them. Lee has also observed an increase in types of alternative healing here over the past decade or two — animal communication, for instance. Except for traditional Chinese medicine, alternative therapies are generally not regulated in Singapore, and training could be done through short courses or apprenticeships, he noted. And while mainstream medical practices are based on clinical trials that assess their efficacy, most alternative therapies have very little research or data to back up their effectiveness. The placebo effect, where symptoms improve despite a non-active treatment, could be at work if alternative healing is effective, said Lee. “The placebo effect doesn’t mean it’s not real, because now we know the placebo effect is as real as some active ingredients. Our mind and body are so intertwined that if we believe in certain things, this may have impact on our bodies,” he said. Placebos work through patient expectations, meaningful procedures, and a positive practitioner-patient relationship, he added. But people with physical or mental health problems should still consult mainstream healthcare providers, the experts advise. Should they wish to concurrently see alternative wellness providers, they should seek recommendations from friends or people they know, and be aware of the consequences, said Lee. “If individuals, despite using CAM, are feeling very distressed or find that their mental health issues have affected their daily functioning, they should seek help from a mental health professional,” said Mythily. “They should not rely on just CAM to address their issues and avoid professional medical treatment.” As CAM grows in popularity, such practitioners can also help refer individuals to medical services if they feel the person is not getting better or worsening in terms of symptoms or functioning, added Mythily. Meanwhile, the alternative wellness providers say they do not try to convince sceptics about what they do. In the early days, “I would try to explain from a point of validation, getting approval”, said Teo. These days, she embraces the fact that sceptics may not change their minds, and she is a “hippie living in Singapore”. Said Tan: “If people were to come (to me) and say, ‘Actually your healing is all hocus pocus’, I’d say, ‘So be it. You need not have to come see me or heal with me’.” Said Khoo, the cacao ceremony participant: “I wouldn’t advise anyone to just choose alternative healing as the solution… It is not, but it does complement in a holistic way.” Learn more about other fringe interest communities in Singapore, on On The Red Dot’s new digital-only series, OTRD X Unfiltered: How To Be A Fringe Fan .

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Clients often show up at the counsellor’s office when their issues interfere with day-to-day living. But counselling is more than just problem-solving, says social worker Yeow Ming Zhen. You don't need to have a mental illness to attend therapy sessions – it can be part of your personal upkeep. (Photo: iStock/Prostock-Studio) SINGAPORE: Charmaine* and Tom* have been arguing over how he meets his buddies for drinks after work. From her perspective, he complains about being too tired to chat with her but somehow has the energy to hang out with his friends. Charmaine feels helpless and hopeless about how little they communicate and is seriously considering divorce. When she asks him to go for counselling, he dismisses counselling as simply talking that won’t change anything. Why would he waste his time talking to a stranger who doesn’t understand his marriage? Stories like Charmaine and Tom’s may seem familiar. Individuals often consider counselling only as a last resort, after they have failed to resolve problems on their own or when problems affect their work or relationships. COVID-19 has forced families to be together for long hours, exacerbating tensions that might have lurked beneath the surface. The past two years have seen rising numbers of divorce applications and reports of family violence . There’s actually been a spike in the number of people in Singapore seeking counselling over the pandemic – to the extent that counsellors and social workers are facing burnout . But do we only seek help when we are close to breaking point, when push comes to shove? It might have something to do with the social stigma long associated with counselling – it tends to be seen as for people who are unable to manage their own emotions, suffer after a traumatic event, or have serious mental health concerns. According to one study, 47 per cent of Americans believe that seeking therapy is a sign of weakness. If we thought about our physical health in the same way, is it a sign of weakness to see a doctor when we are unwell or to consider medical treatment only at the brink of collapse? Is it a bad idea to seek our doctor’s advice about trying to lose weight to stave off diabetes? By the time clients show up in my office, a small issue may have snowballed into a major crisis. It could start as an argument about who is responsible for bringing the trash out. Over time, other “problematic” behaviours – who seems to always leave out dirty dishes, who comes home late more often – blur into a larger problem where one partner feels disrespected and expected to take on a disproportionate share of household responsibilities. Perhaps it’s time to look at counselling as a form of preventive or supportive care too, rather than purely remedial. If conducted before problems fester, counselling can build up mental resilience and possibly avert interpersonal crises. Counselling in such circumstances tends to prioritise problem-solving and managing its impact on our lives. But surely we shouldn’t be going for counselling at the slightest conflict? Day-to-day disagreements and anxieties can be the ordinary hiccups of life. Preventive counselling should take place when we are aware that there is a problem but that it is still manageable enough to discuss and work through amicably. One sign could be how often the same argument comes up or how easily we lose our temper. It could be when we feel we can no longer share our thoughts and feelings without being called names or getting into a quarrel. Children and adolescents also show signs they are not coping well when they verbalise stress or fears, frequently cry over high-stakes events such as national exams, have regular nightmares, or lose sleep or appetite. Social workers and counsellors also do their part by identifying cases where preventive counselling can be done. At the Family Service Centre I used to practise in, families often approach us with urgent financial difficulties. Bread-and-butter needs may mask more complex issues such as intergenerational poverty, marital strife, employment struggles, mental health and caregiving burden. Instead of only addressing problems they raise, social workers and counsellors also provide counselling for families so they can avoid conflicts when discussing financial matters. We also check in on the children, because they tend to bottle up problems to avoid stressing or confiding in their parents. For example, we have uncovered incidents of children bullied at school for being poor. In one case, the children were harbouring thoughts of dropping out to lighten their family’s financial burden. In just two to three sessions, the family decided against this drastic move that could have a long-term impact on the children’s well-being and future. Preventive counselling helps clients rethink such significant choices, even getting divorced or married. Remarkably, we see more couples who request pre-marriage counselling to help them work through any potential issues – from finances, relationships and extended family dynamics, to their perspectives on child-raising and physical intimacy. These couples not only felt more confident about marriage but learnt to set boundaries and expectations which equips them for major transitions like moving into a new home and preparing for parenthood. Preventive counselling does not need to be a protracted affair. A few sessions could help put us on a healthier path. Nor does it need to be expensive . A factor that holds people back from counselling is the cost. While private practitioners could charge up to S$200 per session, many counselling centres offer subsidised rates with means testing and may charge from as low as S$30 per session after subsidy. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the National Council of Social Service have also introduced schemes to make counselling more accessible and affordable. MSF launched a new alliance to boost Singapore marriages and strengthen family ties amid COVID-19, such as through marriage preparation and parenting support programmes. These are provided free of charge or at a small nominal fee. Another MSF initiative is Strengthening Families Programme@Family Service Centres (FAM@FSC), which provides services and support to couples and families with early risks and stressors. Trained counsellors, family therapists and social workers at these centres provide counselling for couples and families for free. This service will be provided at 10 locations in Singapore by the end of 2022. Poor familial relationships take a heavy toll on individuals. A 2012 study on 1,026 married workers in Singapore showed that marital distress was a significant predictor of depressive symptoms, health and work satisfaction. The results also suggested that marriage-to-work spill-over is real and costly for society. The loss of work productivity due to marital distress has been estimated at nearly US$6.8 billion annually in the United States. Families remain the closest support system for many in Singapore. Preventive counselling and therapy can enable families in Singapore to support each other better and build strength to weather crises like COVID-19 again in the future. *Names used in this commentary are pseudonyms.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary COVID-19 has taken a toll on our mental health, leading more to turn to wellness apps. These can be helpful resources if used appropriately, say clinical psychologists. A file photo of a man using a handphone. (Photo: iStock) SINGAPORE: The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on all of us. Each time a new phase or transition period rolls out, we’ve had to grapple with isolation from our friends and family, hybrid work and school arrangements, and general uncertainties about the future. The impact on the psychological wellbeing of our nation cannot be understated. A study by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) between May 2020 and June 2021 indicated 13 per cent of participants reported symptoms of depression or anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic . IMH’s helpline also received 50 per cent more callers in 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. Given the circumstances, it is unsurprising some are looking for more ways to support their mental wellbeing , including the use of mental health apps. In fact, the use of such resources is getting more popular and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) has rolled out an online portal, MindSG, with mental health resources curated by experts. There is a plethora of mental health apps that can be readily accessed or downloaded from app stores or the Internet. Some focus on empowering individuals to manage their own emotions. These provide various forms of support, ranging from automated bite-sized pieces of information, to guides on how to develop various coping skills. For instance, some provide step-by-step audio instructions on how to practise mindfulness meditations or help users pace their breathing when feeling overwhelmed. Other apps guide users to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts. These may appeal to those uncomfortable with sharing their emotional vulnerabilities with others or want support readily available at their fingertips. Their anonymity may also destigmatise the process of seeking help. Some even offer virtual psychotherapy or counselling sessions to those who prefer an individualised approach and real-time interaction with professionals, but have concerns about going out in the pandemic. These may take place over text messaging, phone call or video conferencing. With a mobile penetration rate of over 100 per cent and relatively higher rates of smartphone usage among millennials in Singapore, it isn’t difficult to imagine such apps appealing to a younger and technologically savvy population. The apparent perks of such mental health apps then raise the question: Are they a replacement for face-to-face psychotherapy, which aims to help people manage troubling symptoms of emotional difficulties and support functionality and wellbeing? Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of empirical evidence on the efficacy or effectiveness for many of these apps. Whether apps can replace face-to-face psychotherapy depends on what an individual hopes to achieve, the level of support they need, their current life circumstances, and barriers such as fear of stigmatisation , time constraints and costs. Take for example, Adam*, who initially found some relief using apps from the mental health challenges he was facing. He found comfort in the anonymity and thought using such apps was better than doing nothing at all. However, his circumstances and stressors changed during the pandemic. He found himself spending more time with quarrelsome parents and faced changes in work demands. But he was unable to engage in usual coping strategies, like going to the gym and meeting friends for meals. It became increasingly difficult to address his mental health difficulties on his own. Frustrated, he blamed himself for not being able to cope, especially since people claimed to have benefitted from these apps that were highly recommended online. Adam soon realised he needed individualised support and structure to improve his mental health. While he initially contemplated virtual individual therapy sessions, he decided against this, as his home environment and proximity to his family were not conducive. This gave him the push he needed to see an in-person therapist. The initial transition to having to open up to his therapist was daunting, but he slowly found comfort and safety, setting the stage for his continued growth and recovery. As he gradually returned to work with the economy reopening, he found it increasingly difficult to commit to regular therapy sessions. Adam and his therapist both agreed to stop sessions as he was coping better and could return to using apps to maintain treatment gains. In deciding which platforms of mental health support to engage, it is important to consider your own needs and wants, and how offline or online resources can meet them. What suited you in the past may not suit you now or in the future. It is perfectly normal to try something new if current efforts have not been working out. It isn’t uncommon for individuals to use apps in between face-to-face sessions, especially if a professional assesses this may be helpful in the development or maintenance of coping strategies. For instance, those beginning to learn relaxation skills may find it less stressful to do so with an audio guide reminding them what to do, rather than memorising instructions. App reminders can also improve adherence to practising the skills outside of scheduled sessions. That said, more is not always better, as there are many different therapeutic approaches to addressing mental health difficulties. So people may receive different or even conflicting information across various platforms or apps. For instance, to manage work-related anxiety, some apps may promote finding calm through relaxation exercises while others may encourage exposure to the anxiety to develop emotional tolerance. This difference in approach can be confusing for users. Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Those unsure which platform best suits them may benefit from professional advice. In a hyperconnected digital world, it is unsurprising that mental health apps have gained traction among users. If you already use apps and continue to find yourself in persistent or intense emotional distress, seeking out various mental health care providers located in the community or healthcare institutions may be helpful. As we move towards a “new normal”, expect bumps along the way. It is important to treat yourself with compassion. Your emotional needs are valid, and they are what make you human. Allow yourself to seek the help you need in whatever way or form that works. *A pseudonym was used in this commentary.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Schools in Singapore are taking steps to improve mental health, from making counselling — and good counsel — more readily available, to getting youths to keep an eye on friends and peers who might need help. The Singapore Management University (SMU) has a peer support programme called SMU Peer Helpers. Its members are seen here in a symposium held before the pandemic. (Photo courtesy of SMU) SINGAPORE: When Kranji Secondary’s peer support leaders last year initiated a project called #SAFESPACE to increase awareness of how words can hurt, they did not expect many to respond. They had made a video calling on students to submit notes on hurtful things others have said to them before. “We emphasised that it was optional, and we thought that a lot of students wouldn’t be willing to share,” said Felicia Mah, the teacher in charge of Kranji Secondary’s peer support leaders. But 400 to 500 note cards were submitted. Following the project, a Secondary Three student in her form class approached her. The student had noticed the number of notes relating to body image and volunteered to share her experience with anorexia, an eating disorder, with the student body. Speaking over the public address system during morning assembly, she told her schoolmates what they could do if someone around them showed symptoms of the illness. Urging them to be kinder, she said: “Your nasty words could’ve changed someone else’s life completely and definitely not in a good way … We should take care of our words and not be so reckless to say what we want.” The impact of schools’ measures to boost mental health is not always tangible or measurable. But sometimes, as in this case, students send a clear signal that it has made a difference. WATCH: Why children and teenagers struggle with mental health | Confronting youth mental health — Part 1/2 (24:04) More schools in Singapore are making efforts to get rid of taboos around seeking help for mental health. Each of the three Institute of Technical Education (ITE) campuses, for example — which have 28,000 students in total — has eight counsellors, known as student care officers. They introduce themselves to new students during orientation, and their contact details are available in classrooms, on the ITE website and through QR codes flashed on television screens on campus, said ITE student care officer Rachel Chung. “We want to make sure the students know that the door is always open for them … be it for a small matter or huge one.” The officers also organise activities based on feedback from students and staff, added Chung, who is based in ITE College West. For instance, after lecturers at ITE College West noticed some hospitality students worrying about career prospects amid the pandemic, the officers worked with their education and career guidance colleagues to present talks to first-year hospitality students — to brighten their outlook and tell them how they could apply their skill set. Over at Crescent Girls’ School, meetings with the school counsellor need not be held in the counselling room but in the canteen instead or elsewhere in school, if students wish. “Within the culture of the school, meeting a counsellor isn’t a bad thing,” said Chris Kwok, who heads Crescent Girls’ character and citizenship education (CCE) department. “I don’t think our girls have that stigma or that fear of … being seen meeting a counsellor.” It is a deliberate endeavour. At the start of each year, the school counsellor introduces herself in a talk during morning assembly. As part of the school’s CCE module, she meets about 10 students from each Secondary One class for a “chit-chat session”. This is to establish contact and become a familiar face with the students, said Kwok. “The main idea, for Crescent, is that seeking help isn’t a sign that you aren’t coping. Rather, it’s about you growing into who you want to be.” What students share with school counsellors is confidential unless a student’s safety is at stake, according to the schools CNA Insider contacted. — Location matters . Where schools site their counselling room or centre is important. A central location is good “because we don’t want to stigmatise it and put it in some basement, hidden away”, said Yale-NUS College associate dean of students Cory Owen. But it should not be in such a public place that people are deterred from going for counselling. Neither should it be in a place with so little foot traffic that “if you go down that corridor, everyone knows where you’re going”. — Know your population. If your students come from many countries and cultures, counsellors must be adept at working with different communication styles, said Owen. “If you work at a college that has a high level of, maybe, disordered eating because of … sports, then you may want to have counsellors who are specifically trained in disordered eating.” — If the school has multiple counsellors, it is important to let students know that they can switch counsellors any time and that finding a good fit could take a while. Owen also reminds people that although they may not find a “perfect fit”, they should consider whether the counsellor is “someone you can grow with … (and) can be vulnerable with, because that’s the most important part”. — Use language and methods that are supportive. “Even if you don’t agree with somebody’s assessment, life choice or whatever they’re struggling with, (understand) that we don’t bring our own preconceptions into it, but (rather) allow them to talk in a safe space,” said Owen. “If you’re not comfortable, make sure you refer them to someone in a non-judgemental way so that they don’t feel they’re being rejected, but rather that you’re helping them find a resource that’s going to be better suited for them.” — Destigmatise. For instance, let students know that seeking help is “more common than people think”, said Owen. “If we tell them how many hours of counselling are utilised by students every year, all of a sudden it feels less stigmatising.” Singaporean schools are also tapping youths to keep an eye on friends and others who may need help. And youths are stepping up to the plate. Since October last year, all schools and institutes of higher learning have had a peer support structure in place, according to the Ministry of Education (MOE). At some institutions, peer support programmes have been around for much longer. The Singapore Management University’s programme, for example, started in 2004. Its peer helpers manage a campus space called Cosy Haven, where students can drop in and de-stress in a massage chair, play video games or chat with a peer helper. “Because (peer helpers) are fellow students, they go through the same academic stressors … the same difficulties in the classroom, in their co-curricular activities and so forth,” said SMU dean of students Paulin Straughan. WATCH: Are young people getting the help they need? | Confronting youth mental health — Part 2/2 (31:15) Similarly, at the Yale-NUS College, the P.S. We Care student group operates online or from a space in the counselling centre — COVID-19 measures permitting — from 9pm to midnight, six days a week. Peer supporters at university may go through rigorous training that includes the basics of suicide intervention, and role-play. The first thing that undergraduate Ong Wen Hao learnt in SMU Peer Helpers was “not to give advice but to listen instead and to understand what the friend needs”. In the past, when his friends talked to him about their problems, he would not know how to proceed after saying, “Uh, okay, thanks for telling me that.” “I’d just stare at them awkwardly, and then they look sad, and they stare back at me awkwardly,” said the 23-year-old third-year political science student. At secondary school, they are taught the CHEER model, among other things. “Calm them down, hear them out, empathise with them, encourage them to seek help and refer them to a trusted adult,” said Kranji Secondary student Chiam Zhi Quan, explaining the acronym. “Normally … I only really need to do the first three steps.” Schools say they regularly check in with peer supporters to ensure that they are well-supported. At Crescent Girls’ — one of the pioneers in peer support, with a programme in place since 2018 — teachers initially nominated students as peer supporters. But around two years ago, it let students volunteer themselves and nominate others. Besides wanting to be “enabling”, there is another benefit from this: Students trust those they have nominated and are willing to share their concerns and challenges with the peer supporters, said Kwok. For ITE student Nur Ezra Qistina Rosli, being a peer supporter does not mean all her own insecurities have disappeared. “Sometimes … I feel like, oh my God, I’m a mentor and my grades are like this! And I have a fear of failing — how am I going to be able to help someone else?” she cited. But serving as a mentor to two classmates has made her feel she is making a difference. Clinical psychologist Joel Yang said the MOE’s peer support programme is probably still in its infancy, but the intent to train more youths as well as educators in skills like active listening is good. “It’s really about normalising mental health,” he said.

    "article_content": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Breaking the silence, youths share candidly with CNA Insider about their struggles with depression, self-harm and trauma – and about persevering on the sometimes-bumpy road to finding help and healing. They struggled but managed to find help and people who care. SINGAPORE: After making it through secondary school without any close friends, introverted teenager Poh Zhi Nan vowed to “be a new person” at junior college. He said ‘hi’ to everyone, went out with different people. But like any teen searching for identity, he wondered: “Who am I? Why am I trying so hard to be that outgoing person that I’m not?” Before he could find a new rhythm, however, the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, and schools switched to home-based learning. Without face-to-face interactions and support, Poh grew more anxious, ever so stressed, and began imagining worst-case scenarios. He tried speaking to his parents about getting professional help – but they thought he was possessed. They put him through an exorcism ritual that left him traumatised. “To their generation, there’s no such thing as mental health issues,” said Poh, now 19. Things didn’t improve when in-person classes resumed. He got panic attacks, and was taken to hospital and diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). That’s when he decided to prioritise his mental well-being – and made the “unglamorous” call to take a break from school. He also knocked on several doors, approaching a few public hospitals and private healthcare providers, before he found a treatment setting and team he felt comfortable with. Poh has not been alone in his struggle with mental health demons – or in his quest to get help and be better understood. One study published last year (2021) revealed, the number of those aged 10 to 24 diagnosed with depression at one healthcare group grew four-fold between 2013 and 2018 – a more rapid increase than for any other age group. Writing in the ASEAN Journal of Psychiatry , the study’s authors referred to other research that has shown how \"compared to adult-onset depression, adolescent-onset depression has been found to be associated with greater psychosocial impairment, physical health problems, psychiatric comorbidity, and suicidality\". “Early interventions are critical,” they added. During the pandemic, in the second half of 2020, 52 per cent of young respondents in National Youth Council polls said mental well-being was a challenge. The same year, the suicide rate among those aged 10 to 19 rose, similar to other age groups as Singapore recorded its highest number of deaths by suicide since 2012. Last year, youth mental health become the topic of a national conversation when a 16-year-old River Valley High School student, who had previously attempted suicide, allegedly killed a schoolmate . In the wake of the incident, President Halimah Yacob noted that schools need greater resources and support to help students with mental health issues. In recent years, more resources have indeed been added – at the school, community and national levels. So why do some youths still find it a challenge to get the help they need? CNA Insider spoke in-depth to more than 15 youths about why and how they struggled, sometimes for years, with conditions such as depression, anxiety, self-harm and eating disorders. The upside: Most, if not all, had found a way out of their darkest days, and want their stories to serve as encouragement to others. The worry? Many reported roadblocks on the way to finding help, be it at home, in school or from healthcare institutions. Take Roy (not his real name), 22, who struggled to even find the motivation to seek help, didn’t have a close family and didn’t find his sessions with a community counsellor useful. It was when he landed at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in 2020 following a suicide attempt, that he decided he “could not let things get any worse”. Home is a place where many children feel safest and most loved. But for some, it is a source of distress. “When I was young, I liked to tiptoe when I walked,” recounted Mohammed Narish Mohamed Noh, 22. “My dad kept on warning me to stop… ‘The next time I see you tiptoe, I’m going to tie your legs and put you in a cage’.” And so he did. Narish’s father put him in a “big parrot cage” in the kitchen. He was in primary school at the time. “I didn’t know what to feel,” he said. For other infractions such as returning home a few minutes late, he would be beaten or made to stand for a whole night. By the time he was 15, Narish had joined a gang, and later turned to substance abuse for “happiness”. It was when he was sent to a boys’ home that a psychology-trained aftercare officer helped Narish to understand how his childhood experiences were linked to his symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress. Other youths talked about the impact of parental expectations on their mental health – a recurring theme. University student Zoe (not her real name), 21, remembers being caned by her mother when she missed a note during music practice when she was around four to six years old. But even when family isn’t the root of the original problem, it can become one when the young person confesses that they need psychological help – like in Poh’s case, when his parents turned to exorcism instead of therapy. Denial is often parents’ immediate reaction. When children open up about mental health issues, said clinical psychologist Cherie Chan, parents may think it is a phase or that their children are weak or being “woke”. They may not comprehend why their children would be feeling this way when they seem to have “everything in life”. In reality, the parents most likely had similar troubled feelings in the past, said Chan, who is in private practice at Thrive Family. “It’s just that at the time, survival was more important… whereas now, it’s not so much about surviving or living, it’s about thriving.” WATCH: Why Children And Teenagers Struggle With Mental Health | Confronting Youth Mental Health Part 1/2 (24:04) Take Karen Lee, 24, who began self-harming in junior college when she felt “numb” and “hopeless” from the pressure of her parents’ high expectations and her “school environment”. “My self-worth was contingent on how well I did in school,” she said. She did not tell her parents how she felt — they were conservative, and mental health was “misunderstood” — until she realised, on her 17th birthday, that she was “so miserable” that she needed help. But treatment would cost money. So she finally shared her feelings with her father during a car ride to school. His response was encouraging. She recalled him saying, “I’m sorry that you’ve been through all this… I’m willing to support you.” At first, they did not tell her mother, who was the stricter parent. Lee was referred to the Child Guidance Clinic at the IMH, where she was diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. As part of treatment, the psychologist wanted Lee’s mother to attend a session. That’s when Mrs Lee, as she asked to be known, learnt of her daughter’s condition and got “really upset\", according to her daughter. Mrs Lee’s reaction was to put her daughter’s feelings down to her perfectionist tendencies “as a Virgo” rather than clinical depression. “I just thought at the time, how could it be possible?” she recounted in Mandarin. At university, Lee majored in psychology and gained a “deeper understanding” of how her family had affected her mental health. But this also gave rise to anger. She realised she needed to talk to her parents. She first apologised to her mum. “It took us maybe 30 minutes to calm down and stop insulting each other and getting angry,” she said. The conversation turned out to be “monumental”. What she learnt was that her mother had grown up with the tough expectations of being the eldest child herself. “That’s why I was also so strict with Karen,” said Mrs Lee. Lee also asked her father why, when she used to cry, he did not comfort her. He told Lee that “his coping mechanism was to suck it up”. The conversations helped her to be reconciled with her parents, and she encourages others to “be brave to (have) difficult conversations”. “Because honestly… nothing that bad will come out of a conversation if you have the right intentions of clarifying your doubts, your misconceptions and feelings,” said Lee, who has since graduated and wants to be a clinical psychologist. She has also volunteered for the IMH as well as a community initiative called SG Mental Health Matters. As for parents, Mrs Lee said: “It works both ways. Both parties have to compromise and forgive each other’s past and wrongdoings.” Much of the talk about ramping up mental health support has been focused on schools, where youths are grappling with not just academic pressure but also the woes of friendship and wanting to belong. For Uma (not her real name), the first two years at secondary school were intensely lonely. She had yet to make friends and felt like an outcast. \"Suicidal thoughts were plaguing me,” said the 17-year-old junior college student who requested anonymity. Germaine Goh, 18, remembers how she got on Instagram in Primary Four and kept tabs on who had the most followers and number of likes. “There were people going around asking their friends to like their photos or to follow them so they’d seem more popular,” she said. “That was something I also resorted to.” Back then, if a photo she posted did not garner more than 100 likes, she would delete it. “I tied my self-esteem to the amount of likes I was getting.” Cyberbullying also reared its ugly head, with people commenting on her physical appearance. Nasty messages from people who were supposedly her friends made her question whether she could trust anybody. The desire to fit in, and the stress to do well in school, caused her mental health to spiral downwards. She was 11 the first time she self-harmed. It made her feel slightly better as it was “the only thing” she could feel. For students with issues bigger than they can handle, schools have developed resources to help. All schools have at least one or two full-time counsellors, while each polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education college has five to seven counsellors, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said in September last year. The autonomous universities are “similarly equipped”. And what students share with school counsellors is confidential unless a student’s safety is at stake, according to the schools CNA Insider contacted. But the experience of seeking help at school differs greatly, youths told CNA Insider. Some benefited from their school counsellors and teachers; others did not feel adequately listened to, and even felt betrayed. Uma, for instance, felt that her school counsellor was becoming increasingly impatient towards the end of Secondary One. She claimed the counsellor also betrayed her confidence to her parents and teachers. This magnified her stress as her parents “got very defensive and angry”, and teachers “no longer had a good impression” of her. She stopped seeing the counsellor in Secondary Two. Goh, on the other hand, “really trusted” her junior college counsellor and teachers. They were the ones who urged her to tell her IMH doctors about having been sexually harassed so she could get help; it’s how she got diagnosed with PTSD. Her teachers were also a pillar of support when she began hearing voices in 2020. She confided in them after the “voices” got so bad that she did not attend school for a week. They referred her to the school counsellor, who she said made some calls to get her professional help. Owing to the waiting time involved, Goh opted to go to the emergency department of a hospital and was referred to the IMH. While others have had similarly positive encounters, what can turn the experience of seeking help at school into a nightmare? Some pointed to educators and counsellors who belittled their woes. Muhammad Syazwan Rahmat, 23, recalled how his discipline master and form teacher ascribed his problems in Secondary Three to laziness and truancy. In fact, he was feeling “empty” after being separated into a different class from his friends. His school subjects were also “getting tougher”, and he was grappling with confusion over his sexuality. His parents were called to school over his poor attendance. The discipline master, he said, told him: “If you’ve really got issues, give me a doctor’s letter.” A session with the school counsellor “didn’t really help much” as his issues were still seen mainly as a truancy problem – he was given tips on staying motivated. In Ryan Ong’s case, a teacher mocked him in front of the class for an essay he wrote about a suicide attempt. The class laughed at him. Already feeling overwhelmed by his schoolmates’ bullying — with remarks like “why aren’t you dead yet” — he sank deeper into depression, recalled the 23-year-old. But ultimately, the people who are the source of distress – school peers and teachers – are also the ones who can make the most positive difference, the youths told CNA Insider. Things began looking up for Uma, for example, in Secondary Three when her teachers created a positive environment and discouraged unhealthy competition by reminding the class that friendships were more important than grades, she said. Her classmates ensured everyone was included in birthday and other celebrations. Although Uma did not immediately stop self-harming, it was no longer over “friendships and stuff”. In fact, she made a best friend over a shared love of comics. “I talked to her about how I was lonely. She introduced me to her two friends who are also my best friends now,” said Uma. In recognition of how friends are often the first line of support, since last October, all schools and institutes of higher learning have had peer support structures in place, where participants look out for fellow students and encourage peers in distress to seek help from trusted adults. The MOE also aims to deploy more than 1,000 teacher-counsellors in the next few years, up from the 700-plus in schools as at last year. These are teachers who have received additional training so they can help students who are dealing with more challenging social-emotional problems, like grief and loss. For Goh, who was on medical leave from school for most of 2020, her teachers were and remain a fount of support. When she returned, PTSD had affected her memory, and her teachers would sit down and help her understand various concepts taught in class. They were understanding when she needed to leave midway through a class to calm herself down. Her form teacher told her to take self-care days. The school also gave her opportunities to shine and lead: She is the captain of her co-curricular activity as well as a school ambassador who helps to promote the institution during events such as open house. \"It makes me feel very good because they have that trust in me that I’m able to still uphold these responsibilities while I’m trying to fight my own battles,\" she said. Goh no longer looks to social media for that self-esteem lift. “Now I don’t really care about what people think about me and I just have fun. The likes and amount of followers don’t define who I am.” Working closely with school counsellors are the IMH’s teams of psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists and doctors. When activated, the IMH’s Response, Early intervention and Assessment in Community Mental Health (Reach) teams will head out to schools to do assessments, said IMH medical board chairman and psychiatrist Swapna Verma. Problems that are “not that complex or that severe” can be handled with therapy within the school system, while cases requiring tertiary care are escalated to IMH, she added. But for those who take the initiative to seek professional help on their own, getting it can take long waiting times and a lot of money, said youths, parents and experts. It can take months to get an appointment with a public-sector psychiatrist or psychologist, while the private sector is priced out of the reach of some. When Sean Cheng, 19, decided to seek help at the end of 2020 for the “intrusive negative thoughts” he had been having for about two years, he tried to “do everything” by himself. He contacted the IMH. When he eventually turned to his parents with his problem, his mother – after the initial shock of finding out – paid for a private psychologist, at S$300 to S$400 a session, for which Cheng was very grateful. He was diagnosed with dysthymia, a form of depression also known as persistent depressive disorder, and attended monthly sessions for about half a year. Zoe, whose mother imposed harsh punishments, was diagnosed with complex PTSD in 2019 and pays roughly S$230 a month as a subsidised patient at the IMH. This is the cost of seeing a psychologist weekly and for medication. It is “quite a lot” for an undergraduate, remarked Zoe, who worked three jobs on campus to pay the bills. Even so she deems it a “luxury” that she could take on three jobs – because not everyone with a mental condition can do so. For 46-year-old Jasmine (not her real name), getting help for her 15-year-old daughter has wiped out the family’s savings. Her daughter has major depression and has grappled with suicidal thoughts since Primary Five. A weeks-long stay in the IMH did not improve the situation, so Jasmine searched for alternatives and found a doctor at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. A stay there of over three weeks cost about S$26,000 after Medisave withdrawals, said Jasmine. Plus there were monthly medication costs of about S$1,000 and subsequent inpatient stays. She and her husband, who also have a younger daughter, remain stoic. But they have used up their savings, cashed out endowment plans and maxed out their Medisave withdrawals and insurance claims for general hospitalisation. With a monthly household income of about S$5,000, they live from “pay cheque to pay cheque”. She is appealing for more to be done about the cost of treating mental conditions. Experts note that AIA is the only insurance company here with a critical illness plan that offers mental health coverage. The AIA Beyond Critical Care covers five mental illnesses: Major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette’s syndrome (until age 21). Employers that offer insurance coverage for mental health are also “really important”, said former Nominated Member of Parliament Anthea Ong. Clinical psychologist Chan believes that having insurance schemes that cover psychological services would improve accessibility. For that to happen, formal regulation of the profession may be needed as clinical psychologists are currently not registered under Singapore’s Allied Health Professions Act, though they may voluntarily register with professional associations. On affordability, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is working with insurance companies and other stakeholders to “further optimise the coverage process”, Senior Minister of State (Health) Janil Puthucheary told Parliament last August. The Covid-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce and an inter-agency task force on mental health are also looking at the infrastructure needed. MOH said the IMH monitors appointment waiting times and has measures to optimise appointment slots. Non-urgent cases are referred to primary and community-based care providers, which include over 220 general practitioners and 14 polyclinics providing mental health and/or dementia services as of 2020. But why are fees in the private sector so high? Chan said the fees help to cover the non-billable training hours put in by private practitioners. “There’s a lot of learning, training… doctorate programmes, master’s programmes that we need before we become a psychologist,” she said. A lot of professional development costs also come out of their own pocket. WATCH: Are Young People Getting The Help They Need? | Confronting Youth Mental Health Part 2/2 (31:15 Some providers have tried to lower the barriers to seeking help. Last year, some members of the Singapore Psychological Society, where Chan is president, responded to the increased mental health needs brought on by the pandemic by offering reduced fees or pro bono services. This initiative will run until June. Community service organisations that charge subsidised or affordable fees for seeing a counsellor or psychologist include Shan You Counselling Centre and Clarity Singapore , a Catholic mental health charity, Ong noted. According to their websites, Shan You charges S$80 for an individual counselling session of 50 to 60 minutes, while at Clarity Singapore, it is S$40 per session. Ong suggested people be allowed to use Medisave to seek help from such organisations. If she had a magic wand, Ong would also expand the IMH’s Community Health Assessment Team (Chat) to cater to more young people. This service in Orchard Road enables those aged 16 to 30 to seek a mental health check outside of a hospital or clinic. Chat was set up in 2009 in response to youths worrying about being labelled “mentally ill” if they went to the IMH, said Swapna, who is also Chat’s programme director. From fewer than 100 youths seen by Chat that year, the figure rose to about 2,000 in 2020. About 60 to 70 per cent of them do not need treatment in the IMH or public hospitals, and are referred to community or school counsellors. Those who need to see a psychiatrist at a hospital are given a note that will get them subsidised care, said Swapna. Hesitation to seek help at IMH can spring from word-of-mouth accounts of experiences there. While a few youths spoke positively of their IMH treatment, one described his inpatient experience to CNA Insider as “horrific”, such as witnessing other patients in restraints. Swapna said the hospital takes feedback seriously and will see how it can mitigate matters. The IMH is training staff in trauma-informed care — recognising that patients may have experienced trauma previously and working to avoid re-traumatising them. Acknowledging that restraints are traumatic for both patients and onlookers, she stressed that they are a last resort — when verbal de-escalation and medications do not work and for the safety of the patient and others. The hospital is also trying to provide a quieter and more private space for patients, she said. When it refurbished its wards, it sought feedback from some former inpatients. Its child and adolescent ward now has some individual rooms where parents can sleep over if it helps the child. Meanwhile, for youths (aged 13 to 19) who seek help at the IMH emergency room but are not admitted, four social service agencies – Club HEAL, Singapore Association for Mental Health, Singapore Children’s Society and TOUCH Community Services – will be trained to provide them with mental health support. They will similarly serve those discharged from the psychiatric ward or receiving follow-ups in specialist clinics. To destigmatise mental illness, some youths are doing their part on social media. For example, Zoe, who had a good experience at the IMH, has taken to TikTok to spread the word. She talks about things like the cost of treatment and whether it is possible to change doctors — “yes you can, I did it before”, she says — to let others know “what’s going on in there”. For Goh, her posts about going to IMH marked a turnaround from those days when she refused to accept the diagnosis of her depression and anxiety and had an unhealthy relationship with social media. “Growing up, I always had this (idea) that the IMH was very scary,” she said. Destigmatising the act of calling a helpline is also key at Tinkle Friend , a service provided by the Singapore Children’s Society. “We don’t portray ourselves (as a helpline to call only when) in distress,” said the society’s head of student service Ann Hui Peng. “It was a very deliberate attempt to tell a child that you can talk to Tinkle Friend about anything under the sun, even your happy moments.” While it means many calls from children who just want to chat, she said it is an opportunity for skilled listeners to pick up any sign of distress. As for the link between heavy social media use and poor self-esteem, social media platforms have taken steps to mitigate harm. Instagram’s owner, Meta, said last year it has a dedicated reporting option for eating disorder content. Among other measures, it has a feature called Restrict, which allows users to protect themselves from bullying. For its part, TikTok has been driving mental health awareness in collaboration with local non-profit organisations and youths themselves, said Teresa Tan, its Southeast Asia head of public policy. For example, the non-profits provided training in mental health knowledge that youths could translate into creative content. TikTok also launched the in-app Singapore Wellness Hub, which serves as a repository of resources. Several youths said their own struggles have spurred them on to help others. Narish, for instance, he has dealt with the issues triggered by his childhood trauma. Today, he is a mental health advocate with Strengthening Youths in a Network of Care, the mental healthcare arm of the non-profit Impart . Narish also coaches youths in boxing and describes himself as “still healing”. Cheng is active in three initiatives. Besides an organisation called Mental Health Collective, which aims to consolidate information related to mental health in Singapore, he is part of a group called Mummy Yummy. He coordinates its youth team’s tuition programme for lower-income families. As an officer of voluntary organisation St John Singapore, he is trying to connect its youth members to mental wellness groups for more exposure to this field. “I’m just very grateful for what I have right now,” he said. For Zoe, life today is a far cry from the suicidal thoughts brought on by harsh punishment in childhood, sexual assault and the absence of anyone who had her back. Therapy has helped. “It doesn’t actually make the pain go away, but it gives you a bigger capacity to deal with it,” she said. “I never knew of a possibility (that) I wouldn’t be so tormented by suicidal (feelings), low self-esteem, thoughts of being worthless.” This article by CNA Insider was done in partnership with Temasek Foundation and the Institute of Mental Health.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary People who have poor well-being might use social media more often as a coping mechanism, but this doesn’t seem to be helping, says a researcher. File photo. Poorer well-being – specifically higher psychological distress and lower life satisfaction – is linked to higher social media use. (Photo: iStock/Kerkez) MELBOURNE: We often hear about the negative impacts of social media on our well-being, but we don’t usually think of it the other way round – whereby how we feel may impact how we use social media. In a recent study, my colleagues and I investigated the relationship between social media use and well-being in more than 7,000 adults across four years, using survey responses from the longitudinal New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study. We found social media use and well-being impact each other. Poorer well-being – specifically higher psychological distress and lower life satisfaction – predicted higher social media use one year later, and higher social media use predicted poorer well-being one year later. Interestingly, well-being impacted social media use more than the other way round. Going from having “no distress” to being distressed “some of the time”, or “some of the time” to “most of the time”, was associated with an extra 27 minutes of daily social media use one year later. These findings were the same for men and women across all age groups. This suggests people who have poor well-being might be turning to social media more, perhaps as a coping mechanism – but this doesn’t seem to be helping. Unfortunately, and paradoxically, turning to social media may worsen the very feelings and symptoms someone is hoping to escape. Our study found higher social media use results in poorer well-being, which in turn increases social media use, exacerbating the existing negative feelings, and so on. This creates a vicious cycle in which people seem to get trapped. If you think this might describe your relationship with social media, there are some strategies you can use to try to get out of this vicious cycle. Social media aren’t inherently bad, but how and why we use them is really important – even more than how much time we spend on social media. For example, using social media to interact with others or for entertainment has been linked to improved well-being, whereas engaging in comparisons on social media can be detrimental to well-being. So chat to your friends and watch funny dog videos to your heart’s content, but just watch out for those comparisons. What we look at online is important too. One experimental study found just 10 minutes of exposure to “fitspiration” images (such as slim or toned people posing in exercise clothing or engaging in fitness) led to significantly poorer mood and body image in women than exposure to travel images. And mindless scrolling can also be harmful. Research suggests this passive use of social media is more damaging to well-being than active use (such as talking or interacting with friends). So be mindful about how and why you use social media, and how it makes you feel. If most of your use falls under the “harmful” category, that’s a sign to change or cut down your use, or even take a break. One 2015 experiment with more than 1,000 participants found taking a break from Facebook for just one week increased life satisfaction. Life is all about balance, so make sure you’re still doing important activities away from your phone that support your well-being. Research suggests time spent outdoors, on hobbies or crafts, and engaging in physical activity can help improve your well-being. So put your phone down and organise a picnic with friends, join a new class, or find an enjoyable way to move your body. According to our findings, it may be useful to think of your own habitual social media use as a symptom of how you’re feeling. If your use suggests you aren’t in a good place, perhaps you need to identify and address what’s getting you down. The first, very crucial step is getting help. A great place to start is talking to a health professional such as your general practitioner or a therapist. You can also reach out to mental health organisations for evidence-based support.

    "article_content": "Asia Asia An elderly man walks in a residential district in Bangkok's Chatuchak. (Photo: iStock/justhavealook) BANGKOK: Depression has come to be one of the main illnesses plaguing seniors in a rapidly ageing society in Thailand. However, conversations about mental health among the aged society remain less prevalent than they need to be. Geriatrician at Thailand’s Siriraj Hospital Dr Titima Wongviriyawong said that seniors may not know that what constitutes a mental health issue. \"It's an issue of knowledge about mental health problems,\" she said But even those who know may refuse to acknowledge mental health problems “because they feel like they’re weak\", said Dr Titima, adding that stigma is also a barrier to seniors seeking help. In the past, there were about seven cases of elderly suicide per 100,000 population but in the past five years, this rate has risen to 11 per 100,000 population, she noted. With an increasing rate of suicide among the elderly, Dr Titima is afraid unaddressed mental health issues may lead to more suicide cases among this group. \"That's a very high concern. The main factor is due to the financial problems and the mental health problem as well,\" she said. She suggested that addressing the problem requires cooperation with multiple segments of government, community and private sectors. According to the Thai mental health department, about 14 per cent of 12 million senior citizens in the country this year are at risk of suffering from depression, and the problem is expected to worsen. Failure of early detection and treatment of mental health issues may not be just a problem for individuals and their families, doctors said. Dr Sakarn Charoensakulchai from the Phramongkutklao College of Medicine said such illnesses come at a social and economic expense for the country. The government has to use funding allocated for public health to deal with the mental health problems, he noted. He added that given that senior citizens are expected to have the potential to work up to 70 years old in the future, if a larger population of elderly suffer from mental health problems, “that may reduce the ability of the working force of our country”. Dr Titima zoomed in on the social and economic implications of suicide. “If elderly (people) can kill themselves because they think that they’re useless, they’re worthless, they have no money ... then other people around them will see that as an example and they may follow that person,\" she said. Both Dr Sakarn and Dr Titima said that Thailand lacks the resources and knowledge to tackle mental health problems, and they expect more seniors to face mental health issues as the population ages. According to the United Nations, in less than 20 years, Thailand will be a “super-aged” society where one in four Thais will be over 65 years old, compared with one in eight now. The director-general of the Department of Mental Health, Dr Ampon Benjaponpitak, acknowledged that areas such as welfare and related laws need improvement. “There are still gaps in our elderly mental health care programme. The important thing is how to access (these elderly). We are working on a progressive plan to approach them in the communities by using volunteers or our staff,” she said. “We aim to survey and detect the problems early.” Siriraj Hospital’s Dr Titima suggested that medical practitioners should start paying more attention to the mental health of their elderly patients. Doctors should incorporate the screening of mental health and social well-being into senior citizens’ regular physical check ups, she said. “Whenever they see a doctor, (doctors ask) usual questions like ‘your blood pressure is good?’, ‘your blood sugar is good?’ but maybe they haven’t asked ‘how are you feeling today?’,” she said. Given that there is a lack of manpower in Thailand’s healthcare sector, Dr Ampon hopes to tap into the grassroots to identify and help the elderly with their mental issues. “A strength of Thai society is community, your neighbours, especially in the rural areas. They can take care of each other. We need to get the community involved in taking care of their own elderly instead of sending them to care centres,” she said.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore An estimated 12 billion workdays are lost annually due to depression and anxiety, costing the global economy nearly US$1 trillion (S$1.44 trillion), according to the World Health Organization. Among the efforts to improve mental wellbeing at the LinkedIn office in Singapore are collaborative workspaces and spaces where employees can take a mid-day break. (Photo: Screengrab) SINGAPORE: At one firm in Singapore, employees' moods are being monitored as they work, providing insights into when they feel stressed or focus best. The study is part of real estate consultancy JLL's efforts to boost mental health at the workplace. Mr Ben Hamley, JLL's Future of Work lead for Asia Pacific, noted that Southeast Asian countries including Singapore struggle with \"quite a lot of stigma\" surrounding mental health. \"The idea of being open and vulnerable about times that you might be struggling or feelings of mental ill health, anxiety and depression is very misunderstood,\" he said. \"By giving people insight into the data around when they're feeling stressed, when they are focused the most ... I think we can actually start a much bigger conversation about mental well-being in the workplace all across Asia Pacific.” He added that it is important to shape a dialogue in which people feel comfortable talking about their mental well-being. JLL is working with bioinformatics firm Emotiv for the study. The study aims to uncover factors that allow for optimal work experiences, such as ideal environments for creative tasks and the type of work conditions that can drive collaboration. At the same time, it hopes to use the data to turn the office into an uplifting space. \"We're capturing neuroscientific brain data from individuals while they're actually doing work as they normally would,\" said Emotiv research scientist Nik Williams. JLL’s push to improve work life comes amid studies showing the cost of poor mental health among employees and the benefits of paying attention to their well-being. According to a recent McKinsey study, one in four employees worldwide is experiencing symptoms of burnout. In Asia, that figure is one in three. The study found that poor workplace mental health can lead to costly organisational issues including absenteeism, lower engagement, decreased productivity and increased insurance costs. In a CNA-commissioned survey of mental health across six Asian societies during the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore was the only place where burnout was the leading factor affecting mental health. This bucked the trend seen in the other places in the survey, where most people pointed to public measures to keep the pandemic under control, such as restrictions on mask-wearing and travel, and financial burden from the loss of income. Mental health at the workplace is also on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) radar. WHO and the International Labour Organization recently called for concrete actions to address mental health concerns in the working population. An estimated 12 billion workdays are lost annually due to depression and anxiety, costing the global economy nearly US$1 trillion (S$1.44 trillion). Addressing well-being could help not just with the mental health of employees, but with productivity as well. A report by Mental Health Foundation UK found that doing so increases employee productivity by 12 per cent. While JLL has taken to data to improve things, another firm, networking platform LinkedIn, has focused on creating a workplace where staff have the space to unwind. There are pool tables, table tennis tables and a gym where classes are offered. Employees are free to take a mid-day break in a way that suits them. Ms Sumita Tandon, director of human resources for Asia Pacific at LinkedIn, said that the firm does a survey with employees every quarter and is “intentional” about asking questions on well-being. From that survey, the company gleaned feedback specific to the office space, which it then took on board to make enhancements. “We have received feedback about wanting to have more collaborative spaces in the office, or wanting to have more on-site wellness sessions when it comes to mindfulness, when it comes to dealing with young children,” she said. With hybrid work life now prevalent in firms, LinkedIn also trained managers to deal with the new norm and identify early signs of mental health issues like depression and burnout, as well as fatigue, Ms Tandon added. One employee who has benefitted is regional account director Madushan Alwis. “I think taking a breather is something that's really important, especially in a stressful job. It's also important that there are suitable options for that. So over here, it could be taking a break, having a coffee with one of your colleagues or going for a mid-day yoga or meditation session,” he said. “I think it's important to be able to take 30 minutes to an hour to have that breather in between your workday when you want to create some space in your mind and come back with new energy to really handle the task at hand.\" Ms Tandon believes companies should continue to invest in their employees’ well-being. “Companies should continue to invest, consult employees and make sure that what you're doing is relevant for them, it resonates with them, and it's helping them whether it is more programs to equip managers or whether it is changes to your physical workspace,” she said.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Is it possible for overwhelmed stay-at-home parents to “quiet quit”? What would that workplace trend look like at home? Mother-of-two Yong Qiao Qing tried it out. File photo of a mother carrying her baby on her back while cooking. (Photo: iStock/rudi_suardi) SINGAPORE: You would probably have heard of the term “ quiet quitting ” by now. An employment trend that rose to fame from a TikTok video, quiet quitting refers to the act of an unhappy employee cutting back on the time and effort spent at work so that he performs as per his job description and nothing beyond that. Often, it is the result of being unappreciated and exhausted after putting in best efforts. What about those who work for their own household? After all, stay-at-home parents – who care for their children and make sure a household runs smoothly – work very hard. Some might argue a full-time homemaker is harder than a corporate job. If being a stay-at-home mum was a profession, her annual salary would be about US$184,820 (S$254,460), according to Salary.com in its 2021 annual Mom Salary Survey. This is not surprising. After all, stay-home parents wear multiple hats, playing the role of chef, teacher, nurse, chauffeur, cleaner, accountant and more. According to the Salary.com survey, stay-at-home mums work an average of 106 hours per week. This breaks down to 15 hours a day, seven days a week. Let that sink in for a bit. When I chanced upon this concept of quiet quitting, I was reeling from the mental, physical and emotional exhaustion of looking after the family during my trusted helper ’s two-week home leave. I have two young daughters who require round-the-clock care because of severe eczema and allergies . For those two weeks, the responsibility of ensuring the family survived with one less in manpower fell almost entirely upon me. I was burning both ends of the candle by making sure the kids were clean and fed during the day, their intense eczema itch soothed at night and that they didn’t scratch themselves bloody during their sleep. Oftentimes, I would feel my stomach growl at midday and remember that I had not eaten despite having already prepared two meals for the children. I became a zombie mum – exhausted, angry and hungry. My husband, on the other hand, took leave from work and managed to exercise every day. I was brewing in vile resentment and decided on a whim that since I obviously cannot resign from my role as a doer-of-all-things-at-home, I should quietly quit. Parental burnout is a real thing. I’ve experienced it firsthand, and it’s nothing like normal parenting stress . A study of nearly 1,300 parents released by Ohio State University in May 2022 showed that 66 per cent of parents feel burnt out. Their symptoms included being easily irritated by children, waking up exhausted, feeling overwhelmed, feeling like a failure as a parent, and being emotionally detached from their little ones. Females were more likely than males to report parental burnout, and this likelihood increased with the number of children in the family, according to the study. Perhaps this has to do with gender roles. While fewer married couples (40 per cent in 2021 versus 56 per cent in 2016) in the recently released 2021 Marriage and Parenthood Survey said that mothers should ideally be the ones to take care of children full-time, in reality, women still spend more time on childcare duties. During weekdays, women in Singapore spent on average of six hours each day on childcare duties, compared with 3.6 hours for men. On weekends, women spent an average of 10 hours versus 7.7 hours for men. I decided that something would have to change to make me feel like me again. The first step: I tried to define my job description as a mum. My JD went along the lines of “to strategise, plan, budget, procure, oversee and execute all matters regarding the home and children”. It already felt impossible. So, I decided instead to focus on behaviours instead of actual responsibilities. I realised that I was exhausted because I had been anticipating problems and jumping into situations that I had originally delegated. I was also redoing tasks that had not been performed to my expectations. Essentially, I had been working all the time but not getting tasks completed because my attention had been all over the place. So, I decided that if my husband were to bring one child out of the house, I would not drop everything on hand to pack for them. This meant that if they were to forget to bring anything, they’d just have to handle the consequences. Also, I stopped myself from re-washing milk bottles with dried crusts in crevices because the effort to do that could be spent on other important tasks. Next up was to put in place boundaries . Loud noises and children running about during meals were the main reasons for me to launch into mum rage every evening. I told the children that in order for our dinners to be more enjoyable, we would turn off the TV and sit around the table to eat as a family. This way, Mama would not have to get up 20 times in between bites of food to make them finish their meals. Surprisingly, they agreed without much fuss. It was life-changing to be able to consume a hot meal while seated beside young children. Finally, I worked on guilt and self-care. One of the main objectives for quiet quitting is to bring balance back into the life of an overworked person. Previously, I could never care for myself because whenever the children were out of the house, I would jump at the opportunity to work on my online business, cook or clean the house (often all three tasks at the same time). Even if I were sick, I would be too wracked with guilt to take a nap . But last week, I picked up a book and for the first time in months, sat down in the middle of the day to read while my husband brought the children out to play. The silence was precious. I have never been able to appreciate the true beauty of silence until I become a parent. It has been a few weeks since my impulse to “ resign ”. I can’t say that my quiet quitting tactics have made me a better parent, but it did bring to my awareness that I can let go of things around the house and my children will still be alive. I have not finished reading the book I started because yet again, the children and the house needed me. But I did set aside time in the middle of several days to write this piece and that in itself, is my form of self-care and balance in my role as a doer-of-all-things-at-home.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Despite more companies making efforts, only two in five workers in Singapore feel that their employers provide adequate support for mental well-being. Mr Low Kok Wah, deaf lead at Hush TeaBar’s department of engagement and experience, uses sign language during a session. SINGAPORE: Work opportunities for people with mental health conditions may not be easy to come by, but one organisation is helping to train and connect them with employers. The Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) MINDSET Learning Hub has coached about 900 people who are at risk of, or recovering from, mental health conditions since it was established six years ago. The organisation, a collaboration between MINDSET Care Limited and SAMH, partners with employers in industries such as cleaning, food and beverage, and retail to boost employment opportunities for its trainees. However, even as more employers are open to offering positions to these job seekers, there is still a lack of opportunities, especially in white-collar professions, it said. One employer providing jobs for the differently-abled is Hush TeaBar. There, patrons can experience having a silent cup of tea led by the deaf, and supported by persons with mental health conditions. Beyond hiring them, the firm – founded by mental health advocate and former Nominated Member of Parliament Anthea Ong – offers benefits such as flexible work arrangements and a trust-based leave system where medical certificates are not required. This was particularly important for Hush TeaBar employees like Ms JJ Goh, an engagement and experience curator who is recovering from depression and borderline personality disorder. She said that a flexible arrangement helps ease stress and keeps her in the job. \"I had to quit my initial job during the long-term treatment, and that's kind of unhealthy. I mean, if let's say you were to keep changing jobs, it also kind of adds extra mental health stress,\" she told CNA. However, meeting each employees' spectrum of mental and emotional needs is not an easy task, especially more so for those suffering from mental health or other conditions. \"Confidence can be lacking generally as a team. Only because they've been marginalised, maybe for a big part of their lives,\" said Ms Ong of her employees. \"We still have those interpersonal challenges … we are also more emotionally intense,\" she added. \"Understandably, you know, because all of us are a bit more sensitive because of what we've come through … These would be some of the challenges that we have as a team of differently-abled people.\" Ms Ong, whose own experiences with mental health conditions and the healing process motivated her to set up the tea bar, said she hopes that companies go beyond employment to focus on empowerment. To promote self-care and empathy, the tea bar provides counselling sessions to help employees better understand and support each other. Mr Low Kok Wah, deaf lead at Hush TeaBar’s department of engagement and experience, told CNA in sign language that the sessions helped colleagues who are hearing-impaired and those who are suffering from mental health conditions see similarities though their differences. \"I felt more aware of their mental health and started to show my support for them, although the road ahead is rough because of their mental health conditions, just as it is for me, a deaf person.\" Mr Low signed. With mental well-being increasingly seen as essential for retaining employees and boosting productivity , more companies are introducing welfare policies, said Ms Jaya Dass, managing director of permanent recruitment in Asia Pacific at recruitment company Randstad. \"Companies are making provisions in the workplace to take a more holistic approach on what it means to employ a person,\" she said. \"To keep (people) engaged and employed and producing wealth over a longer period of time, means that (they) take an active care in (their) personal lives.\" For instance, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, whose products include sports drink Pocari Sweat, has made working from the office optional for its employees in Singapore, and holds weekly engagement sessions for team leaders to check in on employee morale. But despite more companies making efforts, only two in five workers in Singapore feel that their employers provide adequate support for mental well-being, a recent study by the National Council of Social Services found. A lack of understanding of what employees really need is likely why workers do not resonate with the benefits provided, said Ms Dass. She recommended engaging professional advisors to address the gap. \"I think the first thing a company needs to do is maybe get an outside-in approach, where they get consultants or support to basically indicate and help them redesign the benefits that they offer people and what is actually required for mental health support,\" said Ms Dass. \"It all starts with an education and an understanding of what they're dealing with and how this impacts the employees on a day-to-day basis and the people who surround them.\" More companies are gradually making greater efforts to encompass inclusion and diversity in their policymaking and processes to hire those with different needs, said Ms Dass. Persons with mental health conditions sometimes find interactions difficult, but many of them are equipped with the skills to contribute in workplaces, said Dr Geraldine Tan, principal psychologist at The Therapy Room. \"With human relationships or social relationships, they find it a little bit more difficult. But with a lot of understanding from the environment, they blossom, they can contribute because they have the capability and skills,\" said Dr Tan. She added she hopes to see the stigma surrounding mental health fade and become a condition that is accommodated by employers and workspaces in Singapore. \"Imagine if we are able to give them that space and nurture them in our environment or in the work environment,\" she said. \"The amount of work that they can contribute or the level that they can contribute is going to bring so much more benefits to the society and into the organisations,\" she said.

    "article_content": "Asia Asia Indiscriminate sharing of photos and videos of such tragedies could lead to a wider fallout on the public's mental well-being, said experts. Flowers tributes are seen at a makeshift memorial outside a subway station in Seoul's Itaewon district, two days after a deadly Halloween surge in the area (Photo: AFP/Anthony Wallace) SINGAPORE: Recent tragedies, such as the crowd crush in South Korea and bridge collapse in India, have seen the issue of mental health take centre stage. At least 155 people were killed in a crowd crush in the packed Itaewon nightlife district in Seoul, where revellers were celebrating Halloween. Meanwhile, some 132 people died in Gujarat when an overloaded pedestrian bridge collapsed into the river below. There are concerns that the indiscriminate sharing of photos and videos could lead to a wider fallout on the mental well-being of the public. Authorities have urged people to stop circulating the images. Experts, too, have noted that repeated viewings may have negative impacts, such as triggering survivor’s guilt, and urged netizens to avoid them as much as they can. In the aftermath of a tragedy, family members of victims, witnesses, survivors and first responders all experience post-traumatic stress symptoms in their emotional and mental states, said Dr Alison Holman, professor of psychological science at the University of California Irvine. “Many will have those symptoms and they will go away within a short period of time. But for some others, those symptoms may last a little bit longer,” Dr Holman told CNA’s Asia First. “When you see something ‘live’ happen like that, whether it's ‘live’ in-person or ‘live’ via the media, that can be harmful because it's very real and it reflects … our own mortality,” she said. Dr Holman said people are mentally affected by such incidents based on their own life experiences. “Perhaps somebody that used to travel on that bridge a lot may feel guilt or remorse because they ended up not being on the bridge that time, but somebody they knew was on the bridge and died,” said Dr Holman. She emphasised, however, that there is no one way for people to respond to such events. In the age of social media, it is difficult to avoid images and videos being shared in near real-time when a tragedy occurs. However, there are risks and dangers involved in indiscriminately sharing them. “Our research shows very clearly that the more you expose yourself to media coverage of such events, and the more you expose yourself to graphic images of that kind, you're more likely to have post-traumatic stress symptoms,” said Dr Holman. “I'm talking about experiences of re-experiencing the event over and over, maybe having intrusive thoughts about it, or trying to avoid anything that reminds you of it, and feeling hypervigilant,” she explained. Dr Holman encouraged media firms to put up warnings before they show graphic videos or pictures, so that people are aware and can make a choice whether they want to look at it. In times of tragedy, it is also important for the community to come together to provide support for one another to heal from the shock, said Dr Holman. “Taking steps to provide support for somebody else is not only good for them, but it's good for you too. That kind of pro-social engagement that people have is really good for your mental health, (and) is good for your physical health,” she said. “It's also really good for building a community and having a sense of social responsibility for making sure that your country and your community can move on and find a way to heal.” Dr Holman noted that it is important not to rush people to move on immediately, and instead offer them a safe space to talk about their experiences. The government can also help by providing resources to people affected and families who have lost a loved one in the tragedy, such as early mental health interventions, she said. “It is very important to remember, if somebody doesn't feel like they need a mental health intervention, you should not force something upon them,” added Dr Holman.

More than S$3 billion in assets, including vehicles and luxury goods, have been seized as a result of police operations into money laundering and forgery activities since August 2023. (Photo: Singapore Police Force) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The police have spent about S$646,282 (US$477,758) so far to maintain billions of dollars of assets seized or frozen in relation to Singapore’s largest money laundering case . Over 150 properties, dozens of vehicles , gold bars, jewellery, crypto, cash and luxury watches make up the more than S$3 billion of assets seized or frozen since police operations began in August last year. Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam on Tuesday (May 7) provided a written response to a parliamentary question by Member of Parliament Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa Payoh). Mr Saktiandi had asked about the money spent to preserve the assets seized and how this sum would be covered. \"Expenses are incurred for the storage, maintenance and safeguarding of the seized assets, comprising properties, vehicles and luxury goods such as branded bags, watches and alcohol,\" Mr Shanmugam said. He added that these expenses include the engaging of specialised services from industry partners or service providers to oversee the handling, upkeep and value preservation of the assets. \"These expenses are borne by the state,\" said Mr Shanmugam. \"They are covered by the forfeited cash and the proceeds of sale of the forfeited non-cash assets, which are channelled to the state.\" Some of the seized items, like the \"thousands\" of bottles of liquor and wine, as well as ornaments like Bearbrick figures and branded bags, must be stored appropriately to maintain their condition, while the vehicles will have to be serviced. The police said in January that the total value of assets seized or issued with prohibition of disposal orders is more than S$3 billion to date. Singapore police seized four cars worth about S$4.8 million, including two Rolls-Royces and a Porsche, from a property along Third Avenue on Wednesday (Oct 25). This was part of the S$2.8 billion worth of assets in Singapore's largest money laundering probe. The police also seized 56 Bearbricks from another location. Five people have been sentenced in relation to this case. Two of them were deported to Cambodia on Monday . Su Wenqiang and Wang Baosen , both 32, have been barred from re-entering Singapore. Authorities had seized more than S$5.9 million from Su in the form of cash, vehicles, luxury items and liquor. More than S$8 million in assets belonging to Wang – in cash, vehicles, property and collectible items – was seized. This includes his assets under his wife's name.

A Cordlife branch at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital on Dec 1, 2023. (Photo: TODAY/Ooi Boon Keong) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Cord blood banking is a commercial service provided by the private sector, and the government is limited in how it can intervene despite Cordlife's mishandling of its storage tanks, Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said on Wednesday (May 8). \"Government cannot overstep the law,\" Dr Janil said in response to parliamentary questions about Cordlife. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is not a party to the commercial contracts that parents sign with service providers, he noted. \"There are limits to which the government can intervene, especially when it comes to issues of compensation and refunds,\" he said. \"The role that we might play in government is to engage with Cordlife and ask them to facilitate some form of recompense to maintain their relationship with their customers,\" he added. MOH announced last November that Cordlife, a private blood bank that is listed on the Singapore Exchange, was under investigation after seven of its tanks were exposed to temperatures above -150 degrees Celsius, the acceptable limit for cord blood units. About 2,200 cord blood units belonging to approximately 2,150 clients were damaged. Further investigations found that another 5,300 cord blood units were \"non-viable\". These units were stored in a tank and a dry shipper, which is intended for transport rather than long-term storage. Last month, CNA reported that affected parents were unhappy with refunds offered, and that one client had sent a letter of demand to the company. On Tuesday, Cordlife said a \"significant number\" of clients whose cord blood units were damaged have accepted refunds , but declined to reveal the exact figure. In Parliament on Wednesday (May 8), Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said that the Government understands the anxiety and concern among parents as a result of the lapses at cord blood bank Cordlife. He said in his reply to MPs' questions that cord blood banking is an elective, commercial service provided by the private sector and the Ministry of Health (MOH) is not a party to these contracts. Dr Janil also said that the Government \"cannot overstep the law\", and there are limits to which it can intervene, especially when it comes to issues of compensation and refunds. \"What MOH is actively doing is with respect to regulation and facilitation,\" he said. This includes supervising the proper completion of further tests in the affected tanks to achieve a high level of confidence in the findings, a process which he said will take another year. He added that the ministry will also closely monitor Cordlife's dissemination of information to its customers and the public as well as the progress in addressing the deficiencies identified and in making improvements. He also said that MOH has discussed with other service providers that are prepared to facilitate the transfer of cord blood units. Dr Janil urged parents, however, to \"carefully consider\" the risks of doing so, given the logistical complexity of making a physical transfer at sub-zero temperatures, \"particularly so, when the cord blood is not ascertained to be impacted\". Dr Janil said what MOH can do is related to regulation and facilitation. \"The ministry will be supervising the proper completion of further tests in the affected tanks, to achieve a high level of confidence in the findings,\" he said. The testing will take another year to complete due to sample sizes and testing capacity. Addressing a question on whether the testing can be sped up, Dr Janil said the timeline takes various operational factors into consideration, including rectification measures that Cordlife has been asked to put in place to reduce the chance of \"warming events\". MOH will try to minimise the time taken, but maintain the quality of the findings, he said. Retrieving and testing have to be done very carefully to avoid invalidating the potency of the sample when trying to establish the potency of the cord blood unit. \"For all of these reasons, and then subsequently the assessment and review of the results, it does appear that the one-year timeline is reasonable,\" said Dr Janil. \"We understand the need ... to expedite this and reassure people as fast as possible, but I think it's important that when the process is complete, that all who are involved have confidence in the findings from the process.\" The ministry also said it will closely monitor the company's communication with its customers and the public, and its progress in addressing deficiencies and making improvements. It will direct Cordlife to properly validate and implement its new temperature monitoring system, revalidate its processing method for cord blood units and improve staff training and supervision of operations. Singapore Cord Blood Bank, Stemcord and Cryoviva are able and willing to help parents transfer their cord blood units from Cordlife if they wish to do so, though they each have specific conditions that must be met. \"They will only accept cord blood units that are demonstrated to be still viable, and the receiving cord blood banks are unlikely able to guarantee the viability of cord blood units that are then transferred from Cordlife. \"So there is some risk to the customer, the parents, associated with making the choice for this transfer, and it will also take some time. It's not a small decision to be taken lightly.\" Dr Janil urged parents to \"carefully consider\" the risks, because of the logistical complexity of making a physical transfer at sub-zero temperatures, especially when the cord blood is not ascertained to be impacted. Five tanks at Cordlife, containing about 14,000 cord blood units, have been assessed to be at low-risk of being affected.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore The new law aims to enhance the resilience of essential transport services in Singapore, and protect it against possible future disruptions, says Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat. File photo of an MRT train in Kallang, Singapore (Photo: CNA/Jeremy Long) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A Bill has been passed by parliament on Wednesday (May 8) to designate and subject essential companies in the air, sea and land transport sectors to greater regulatory controls. These include allowing relevant authorities to have oversight of who owns and manages these firms. Authorities will also have additional powers under the new law to step in during extreme scenarios where a designated entity cannot provide its transport services safely and reliably. These changes aim to enhance the resilience of essential transport services in Singapore, said Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat as he tabled the Transport Sector (Critical Firms) Bill for a second reading. They also seek to guard against the risk of “malicious actors” gaining control and exerting undue influence over key entities, and ensure that commercial decisions taken by these entities do not jeopardise the provision of essential transport services in Singapore, he told the House. The Bill will amend four Acts: the Bus Services Industry Act 2015, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore Act 2009, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore Act 1996, and the Rapid Transit Systems Act 1995. Under the changes, the entities will be designated by the relevant authority - namely the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, Maritime and Port Authority and Land Transport Authority. Mr Chee stressed that the new law is not intended to apply to every entity providing a transport service. Instead, it will take a “targeted approach” by designating those that are involved in the provision of essential transport services in Singapore. The Bill defines essential transport services as public bus and rail services, airport ground handling and passenger and cargo air services, as well as port and marine services and facilities. Designated entities will also be “strategically important” within the sector, such as how their services are not readily replaceable due to significant market share or expertise, he said. There will be two types of designated entities: A “designated operating entity” if they directly provide essential transport services in Singapore, or a “designated equity interest holder” if they hold equity interest in the former. The designation process will be initiated after the Bill is passed and the law is brought into force, said the minister, adding that relevant firms will be designated by the end of the year. The new law will subject the designated entities to controls in three areas: Ownership, management appointments, and in their operations and resourcing. Under new proposed ownership controls, buyers will need to notify the authorities within seven days of becoming a 5 per cent controller of an entity. Approval is needed for other controlling thresholds - 25, 50 and 75 per cent - or if buyers gain indirect control over a designated entity. Sellers are also required to seek approval when they lower their controlling interest in an entity below the thresholds of 25 per cent, 50 per cent and 75 per cent. Designated entities must notify the authorities within seven days of becoming aware of these changes in ownership and control. Also proposed in the law are management appointment controls, with new approval requirements for designated entities to appoint the chief executive officer and the chairperson of the board. For a designated operating entity that is also a licensee under the relevant authority, approval will be required for the appointment of the directors of the board, in addition to the chief executive officer and the chairperson. Under proposed operations and resourcing controls, the designated entities will be required to notify the relevant authority of events that could impede or impair the provision of essential transport services in Singapore. In an “extreme scenario” where the designated operating entity becomes unable to provide essential transport services safely and reliably, the relevant authority will be given “step-in powers via a Special Administration Order” to ensure service continuity. Mr Chee noted that such step-in powers “will be exercised as a last resort to deal with extreme scenarios”. “For example, this could include when a designated operating entity becomes insolvent and unable to pay its debts, and this in turn jeopardises the continued provision of essential transport services.” He added that the government “will not interfere in the commercial operations and affairs of the entities in the normal course of business”. “If we need to use the proposed step-in powers, we will exercise them judiciously and only for the period which they are required for,” said the minister. Other than these three aspects of enhanced control, designated entities may also be issued remedial directions under certain circumstances. One example is when prior approval was not sought or conditions of approval were not complied with. “These remedial directions could include directing the disposal of equity interest and removal of key appointment holders if prior approval was not sought or if conditions of approval were breached,” Mr Chee said. The proposed law will also allow parties to appeal over decisions made by the relevant Authority to the Minister for Transport. These can be decisions regarding designation and applications for approval on ownership or management appointments. The new law aims to enhance the resilience of essential transport services in Singapore, and protect it against possible future disruptions, said Mr Chee. “For example, we cannot rule out the risk of malicious actors gaining control and adversely influencing our key transport entities, jeopardising the provision of essential transport services in Singapore,” he said. Currently, there are sector-specific laws in place – such as legislative restrictions on foreign ownership and licensing regimes where investors must seek approval from relevant regulators – to manage entities in regulated sectors like telecommunications, banking and utilities. The Significant Investments Review Act was also passed in January to allow authorities to scrutinise significant investments into entities that are critical to Singapore’s national security interests. The Transport Ministry has said its new law will complement the Significant Investments Review Act (SIRA), meaning that entities designated under its sectoral legislation will not be designated under the Significant Investments Review Act at the same time. Mr Chee explained the difference between the proposed law and SIRA. He said that SIRA is designed to complement sectoral legislation and safeguards, but where possible, the preference is for sector leads to enforce controls over the entities under their purview. “We do not intend for entities adequately regulated under sectoral legislation, including critical transport firms covered under MOT’s sectoral acts, to be designated under SIRA.” Member of Parliament (MP) Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast) asked why point-to-point platform service providers like Grab are not regulated under the new proposed law. He asked: “Disruptions to such platform services could have far-reaching implications for those who rely on this means of transport for their daily commute … Did MOT consider designating such platform providers as designated entities?” Mr Chee said that there are no plans to include the point-to-point sector as part of this law, as the sector is still evolving, and plays a complementary role to public transport. “We have an ongoing review of the (point-to point) industry structure and regulatory framework and a decision can be taken after the review is completed,” said Mr Chee. MP Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan–Toa Payoh) questioned the criteria for which firms would be identified as a designated entity, while MP Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) asked for the number of designated entities under the Bill. Mr Chee said that since only critical transport services are expected to be covered under the Bill, only a “small number of firms” are expected to be designated under each sector. Various criteria that will be taken into consideration for designation will include whether the entity is involved in the provision of essential transport services and whether it is “strategically important in the sector”, said Mr Chee. An entity may also be considered strategically important if it has significant market share or specialised expertise in the industry. These entities are thus unlikely to be smaller companies with lower market share in the industry. In addition, designated entities may include firms owned by the government or Temasek holdings, and it could also include firms owned by other shareholders. Several MPs, such as Ms Poh Li San (PAP-Sembawang) and Mr Don Wee (PAP-Chua Chu Kang), questioned if the increased regulatory oversight could affect the transport industry’s competitiveness, growth and attractiveness to local and international investors. Disagreeing, Mr Chee said the Bill will “not adversely impact” the transport industry by creating significant compliance costs and regulatory burden, as well as affect day-to-day operations of the designated entities. The minister added that many of the proposed regulatory controls are not new and that they can already be found in existing sectoral regulations or licensing criteria. “What this Bill seeks to do is to consolidate some of these existing controls under a common legislative framework and extend it to other entities including some non-licensees,” Mr Chee told the House. Questions were also raised about the circumstances under which the Special Administration Order, which extends a relevant authority with “step-in powers”, will be put in place. Mr Chee reiterated that the government will be judicious in exercising these powers and that the order will “only be activated as a last resort” in “extreme” scenarios. Noting that such a concept is not new, he added that this is similar to the step-in arrangements for critical firms in other sectors such as power and water. “When an order is issued, the minister will appoint a person who may be the respective authorities, operators or other third parties with the requisite competencies to manage the affairs, business and property of the designated entity,” he told the House. “The main objective is to ensure that the entity can continue to provide the essential services.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

(Photo: CNA/Hanidah Amin) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is looking to set up more red-amber-green arrows to reduce the proportion of road junctions where motorists can make discretionary right turns. Red-amber-green arrows have been implemented at over 1,200 traffic junctions since 2018, and LTA is making similar plans for about 200 other junctions, subject to further site studies. \"This will further reduce the proportion of traffic junctions in Singapore that allow motorists to make discretionary right turns to less than 15 per cent of all signalised junctions,\" Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat said in a written parliamentary reply on Wednesday (May 8). \"Most of the remaining junctions are single-right turn lanes with only one lane of oncoming traffic, so the risks are lower.\" Mr Chee was responding to questions from Member of Parliament Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast) about the number of traffic junctions that allow motorists to make discretionary right turns and the number of accidents involving discretionary right turns. The issue of discretionary right turns became a talking point in 2018 after an accident which killed National University of Singapore (NUS) undergraduate Kathy Ong . Her taxi driver made a discretionary right turn at the cross junction of Commonwealth Avenue West and Clementi Road, and an oncoming car subsequently crashed into the cab. There have been other high-profile cases. In 2022, a Grab driver died after his car collided with a lorry in Ang Mo Kio while he was making a discretionary right turn. Another man was jailed for 10 weeks in July last year after causing the death of a police officer at a Shenton Way crossing while performing a discretionary right turn. During a 2019 parliamentary debate on amendments to the Road Traffic Act , MPs urged authorities to speed up the removal of discretionary right turns at all junctions, arguing that they were \"fundamentally problematic\". Mr Chee said on Wednesday that between 2019 and 2023, there were about 2,700 reported accidents at junctions with discretionary right turns. “Of these, 56 accidents resulted in fatalities,\" he added. Former Transport Minister S Iswaran previously said in August 2022 that LTA observed about a 40 per cent reduction in accidents involving right turns after implementing the arrows. Road safety has been in the spotlight in parliament with a high-profile accident in Tampines last month that killed two people , including a teenage girl . In response to questions from various MPs, the Ministry of Home Affairs said on Tuesday that it will not be increasing the penalties for dangerous driving for now. Nevertheless, LTA will continue to review, develop and implement programmes to enhance road safety. MP Murali Pillai (PAP-Bukit Batok) also suggested on Wednesday a proposal to construct motorcycle lanes on expressways, in light of the continued increase in motorcycle-related fatalities on such routes. Last month, a 26-year-old motorcyclist was killed in an accident involving a lorry along the Pan Island Expressway (PIE), and in November 2023, a motorcyclist died after a man with schizophrenia jumped out of a minibus along the East Coast Parkway (ECP), causing an accident. In February, the police said that motorcyclists and elderly pedestrians are the most vulnerable groups of road users, and continue to account for a disproportionate number of traffic accidents resulting in injuries or death. While motorcycles make up only 14.4 per cent of the total vehicle population, motorcyclists or pillion riders were involved in 53.5 per cent of all traffic accidents and accounted for half of all traffic fatalities, they added. \"Compared to 2022, the number of fatal accidents in 2023 involving motorcyclists and elderly pedestrians increased by 44.0 per cent and 13.0 per cent respectively,\" the police said. Addressing the concern raised by Mr Murali, Mr Chee said LTA has implemented engineering measures to improve the safety of motorcyclists and pillion riders. These include the use of more skid-resistant road surfaces, the implementation of wider and more prominent lane markings to encourage motorists to keep in lane, and the building of motorcycle rain shelters below flyovers. However, “it is not feasible to construct motorcycle lanes on expressways given our land constraints, and also because many expressway sections are viaducts, flyovers and tunnels which are not wide enough to construct additional motorcycle lanes,” he said. Mr Chee added that the government remains committed to improving the safety of motorcyclists, as well as other road users, and will continue to work on various initiatives and measures to enhance road safety. “The LTA, Traffic Police, and the Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) have various outreach activities to engage key stakeholder groups annually,” he said. “This includes the Singapore Road Safety Month, and the Singapore Ride Safe Campaign, which encourage all road users to do their part in making our roads safe, and motorcyclists to practise safe riding habits.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Drug policies have a long-term impact on the next generation that cannot be easily reversed, the Home Affairs and Law Minister tells parliament. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Every region in the world is affected by drugs, said Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam on Wednesday (May 8) in parliament. He was laying out the global and regional narcotics situation as part of a ministerial statement on Singapore’s drug control policy. Close to Singapore, the Golden Triangle – or where the borders of Myanmmar, Thailand and Laos meet – is a major drug-producing region, said Mr Shanmugam. In 2022, 151 tonnes of methamphetamine were seized in East and Southeast Asia, he noted. Neighbouring Malaysia seized 6,200kg of cannabis in 2022, up from 3,700kg in 2021, Mr Shanmugam said, calling it a “worrying trend”. Even first-world countries in Europe “have been hard hit”, he said, with their ports described as “drug hubs” and “safe terrain for narcos”. In the European Union, half of all homicides and more than a quarter of illegal firearms seizures are linked to drug trafficking, he added. “Members can just consider just how many lives have been lost,” said Mr Shanmugam, pointing to the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium and the United Kingdom as examples. In Belgian city Antwerp, there have been hundreds of shootings, grenade attacks, fires and bombings in the last decade, with many linked to gang-related violence to do with the cocaine trade, said Mr Shanmugam. Antwerp's mayor has described the situation as a much bigger threat than the 2016 Brussels bombings that killed 32 people. “When terrorists attack, it becomes big news,\" said Mr Shanmugam. \"But with drug violence, it gets ignored, even though it is much bigger and a more continuous threat, which affects many more people. And really, this should be taken more seriously.” Belgian customs seized a record amount of cocaine last year, and they were not able to burn the drugs quickly enough, said Mr Shanmugam. “Customs officials now tell the media that they will never win the war against the cartels,” he continued. He then highlighted a United Nations report on how 18 out of 21 countries in Latin America are the main sources for the transit of cocaine. In Mexico, murders, abductions and forced disappearances happen almost every day because of turf wars between drug cartels, said Mr Shanmugam. Nearly 450,000 people have been killed since 2006, and a \"significant number\" are believed to be linked to drugs and the drug trade, he added. Mr Shanmugam noted that in recent years, some places have chosen to legalise drugs. “They take the position that drug use is a personal choice, and it should be destigmatised and allowed under certain conditions,” he added. But some of these jurisdictions later reversed their policies after realising that the results were “not as promised”. In 2020, the state of Oregon in the United States decriminalised the use and possession of small amounts of most drugs, including cocaine, meth and heroin. The 58 per cent of voters who supported this thought the police could \"focus on other work\", and that abusers would feel less stigmatised and seek treatment, he added. After the policy was pushed through, the number of drug overdose deaths more than doubled from about 600 in 2019 to 1,300 in 2022. “People felt very unsafe on the streets, businesses started leaving and the situation got very bad,” said Mr Shanmugam. By August 2023, the majority of people in Oregon wanted to repeal the measure, and they did so in 2024. Thailand also decriminalised cannabis in 2022, making it no longer a crime to grow and trade marijuana and hemp products or to use any parts of the plant to treat illnesses. “When cannabis was legalised, it was available immediately almost anywhere you looked – in restaurants, convenience stores, even near schools,” said Mr Shanmugam. Within six months, the number of addicts quadrupled, he noted. “There were young teens and children who consumed cannabis-infused cookies, candies, sweets. They thought these were ordinary snacks but ended up having to be hospitalised.” The Thai government recently announced plans to reimpose a ban on recreational cannabis use by the end of this year. \"But it's no longer going to be easy to do because if part of it is legal and part of it is not legal, then enforcement is not going to be easy,\" said Mr Shanmugam. Businesses that have invested in the industry will also \"push back strongly\", he added. “Those who are now addicted to the drug will find it very difficult to kick off the habit, and will need to be supported by the healthcare system. \"The consequences in many cases can be irreversible. The impact will be very long-lasting.” When governments \"experiment\" with laws around drugs, they are experimenting with “the lives of people”, including those of young innocent children, said the Home Affairs and Law Minister. “Such policies and U-turns have a long-term impact on the next generation, and the impact cannot be easily reversed.” If parents become drug addicts, homeless and unemployed, their children \"suffer disproportionately\", he added. Mr Shanmugam pointed to a Gallup survey showing a doubling of the proportion of Americans who say that drug use has caused trouble in their family, from 1999 to 2021. Another study projected that by 2030, about 4.3 million children and adolescents in the US would have a parent with an opioid use disorder or be affected by opioids themselves. \"These children often don’t have a proper home to grow up in, no role models to look up to and no stability to anchor their development,\" said Mr Shanmugam. \"Without basic support, they have poorer educational outcomes, increased likelihood of developing substance use disorders and early emergence of chronic diseases. \"The cycle will keep repeating itself. Really, one has got to ask, who speaks for the human rights of these millions of affected children?\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Polls show that in Singapore, backing for the death penalty as appropriate punishment for drug trafficking has risen; while the majority of residents in the region see it as an effective deterrent. Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam delivering a ministerial statement in Parliament on May 8, 2024. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Singapore's Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam on Wednesday (May 8) cited local and regional surveys as proof of strong and growing support for using the death penalty on drug traffickers. He was delivering a ministerial statement in parliament on Singapore’s approach to drug control . “There is broad support from our population because we have been upfront and open about the rationale, circumstances and safeguards on the use of the death penalty,” said Mr Shanmugam. Preliminary findings from a Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) survey conducted in 2023 showed that about 69 per cent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the mandatory death penalty was an appropriate punishment for trafficking a significant amount of drugs. This was up from 66 per cent recorded in 2021, Mr Shanmugam noted, adding that MHA will publish a full report of the most recent survey later this year. Nearly 77 per cent of survey respondents agreed that the death penalty should be used for the most serious crimes – up from almost 74 per cent two years back. He also pointed to a National Council Against Drug Abuse survey last year, where almost 91 per cent of respondents expressed support for the country’s drug-free approach. Eighty-seven per cent agreed that Singapore’s drug laws are effective in keeping the country relatively free of drugs. Beyond Singapore, Mr Shanmugam highlighted a 2021 study conducted in parts of the region where most of the country's arrested drug traffickers have come from in recent years. It showed that 87 per cent of respondents believed that the death penalty deters people from trafficking substantial amounts of drugs into Singapore. A similar proportion - 86 per cent - believed that the death penalty makes people not want to commit serious crimes in Singapore. Of the respondents, 83 per cent also believed the death penalty is more effective than life imprisonment, in discouraging people from bringing drugs in. \"So those who suggest that the death penalty can be replaced by life imprisonment, should look at these figures. The deterrent effects of the two penalties are very different,\" said Mr Shanmugam. \"It is not easy for us ... to decide to have capital punishment as part of the penalties in law. But the evidence shows that it is necessary to protect our people, prevent the destruction of thousands of families, and prevent the loss of thousands of lives.\" Mr Shanmugam said the high levels of support were due to Singaporeans' trust in the government to do the right thing, and do right by Singapore. “So when Mr Richard Branson comes in to argue, he doesn’t realise that we take our duty seriously, we are accountable to Singaporeans, we speak with thousands of them and we know what Singaporeans support,” said Mr Shanmugam. The British billionaire has been vocal in his views against Singapore's death penalty. In 2022, he made false assertions on alleged racial bias and the treatment of defence lawyers in the case of convicted drug trafficker Nagaenthran Dharmalingam . In response, MHA invited Branson to Singapore for a live televised debate with Mr Shanmugam on the topic, but he turned it down . “The vast majority of Singaporeans know and understand the facts and reality, and why the government says the death penalty is necessary,\" said Mr Shanmugam. In his speech, Mr Shanmugam described anti-death penalty activists as making “baseless allegations, one-sided claims and half-truths”. In May last year, Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) directions were issued against 10 social media posts and two online articles for containing false statements about the death sentence meted out to convicted drug trafficker Tangaraju Suppiah . Five parties – The Transformative Justice Collective, The Online Citizen Asia, Andrew Loh, Kirsten Han, M Ravi – had continued to falsely allege that Tangaraju was denied an interpreter during the recording of his statement, said Mr Shanmugam. \"This, despite the Courts’ clear statement to the contrary. A blatant, false attack on the criminal justice system,\" he said. Some of the activists have also helped to file \"unmeritorious\" legal applications on behalf of convicted drug traffickers, often at the last minute, said Mr Shanmugam. In one case, there were seven post-appeal applications, which were all dismissed by the courts for being without merit, he said. The last application had a correspondence email address belonging to an anti-death penalty activist, shared Mr Shanmugam. The Court dismissed that application as a \"blatant and ill-disguised application to disrupt the carrying out of the sentence\", he said. In November 2022, parliament passed the Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases (PACC) Bill to provide a clear process for such applications. Mr Shanmugam expects the PACC Act to be brought into force soon. It will seek to safeguard the administration of justice and the rule of law, introducing new requirements to reduce potential delays to proceedings, he said. \"We are now considering what else needs to be done to make sure this new legislation can be properly supported. We will come back to the House if necessary,\" he added. \"I wish to make it clear to members and Singaporeans, be assured we will take all necessary steps to ensure that this sort of abuse of process is dealt with.\" During the debate on Wednesday, MP Murali Pillai (PAP-Bukit Batok) asked how Singapore will entrench its anti-drugs policy in younger generations of Singaporeans - particularly what's known as Gen Z and Alpha - who are exposed to positive perceptions of “soft drugs” on social media. Mr Pillai added that Singapore seems to be “set aside” at international conferences for its anti-drug stance, recalling how he was referred to as having “outlier arguments” during a symposium. In response, Mr Shanmugam said that there are listed companies around the world that finance non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and publicity that sell the idea that soft drugs are good and harmless. “If you look at these international conferences, the NGOs which are taking a tough line on drugs are usually poorly financed. Their material is not so attractive whereas on the other side, there are all these glitzy arguments as to why soft drugs (like) cannabis causes you no harm, (that) it’s just something for you to try at school,” he said. Mr Shanmugam said this “cool factor” is pushed at the young from various avenues such as media, online and friends. “Wherever you turn, it is there and it’s glamorised today … You can’t get away from it.” He added: “It’s very difficult to stand against this multifaceted assault but I think we’ve done a reasonably good job.” The minister also agreed with Mr Pillai’s point about Singapore being an “outlier” at international conferences. The country is either met with silence when presenting statistics or told that Singapore’s success cannot be replicated elsewhere, he added. “I think it can be, but it is not for me to fight the fight in the rest of the world,” Mr Shanmugam said. “But as long as others don’t tell us what to do and leave us alone to protect our population, then I think that is the best that we can hope for.” Speaking to CNA at a reception at parliament hosted in conjunction with Mr Shanmugam’s ministerial statement, Minister of State for Home Affairs Faishal Ibrahim noted that those who attended the session said Singapore is heading in the right direction. “Because they recognise the harmful effects of drugs and they want to continue to protect our people. However, to do this, we must be united. We must be on board the journey, all hands on deck, regardless of who you are.” If Singapore lets go of all its efforts, drug traffickers will take advantage of it and reap the benefits, he added. “And they will not bother about how we lose out, how it affects our abusers, their family members and their loved ones.” Also at the event was 39-year-old Hannah Chun, who struggled with drug addiction for 10 years. For Ms Chun, seeing her oldest son “acting up” in school was the turning point. In some instances, her son used a pencil to poke his friends' hands, injuring them. Her son also seemed scared and insecure. “Because of the addiction, I would go in and out of the toilet, he would also mimic that … This was also how he coped with fear. Whenever he felt fearful, he would hide in the toilet.” Ms Chun knew that her son was behaving this way because of her. Her health was also suffering because of her addiction and she was “in a lot of pain”. “I could feel that if I don’t seek help, I’ll either die as a drug addict or be caught again,” she shared. Coming from a broken family, she started taking drugs at 13 because she wanted to rebel, which was “a cover-up” for abandonment, rejection and hurt that she could not express, she said. She was imprisoned for one-and-a-half years when she was 17 for possessing and consuming drugs. After she was released, she quickly fell back into her addiction and was incarcerated again at 18. “I would make light of the situation, and I would deceive myself into believing that it’s ok, everyone makes mistakes … I would just bluff myself, and of course I never thought much about other consequences.” She was pregnant during her second sentence and gave birth to her oldest son, now 21, during her prison sentence. But this did not stop her. “I had no knowledge that addiction is a lifetime battle. And it’s not like being in prison for a few years could stop that addiction. I wasn’t in control.” Her family took care of her son while she was serving her sentence, and Ms Chun said her sister supported her throughout. “Coming out (of prison) as a single parent, there were more responsibilities. There were more things to be fearful about,” she said. This prompted her to return to work at nightclubs, which built up to her next relapse, she shared. “I would always find friends who used to party and take drugs with me. And I always thought that by just joining them and not touching any drugs, I would be fine. But that was just wrong,” she continued. Fourteen years ago, she met her current husband, with whom she had three more children aged 12, nine and five. Her husband was very helpful in her recovery, said Ms Chun, adding that she’s relieved that she met “the right person”. “When you think back on the years that you’ve lost, the amount of bad decisions, consequences, burdens and responsibilities that happened because of your bad choices, you think ‘you’re such a loser’,” she said. At her lowest points, she often felt like there was no way out. “But to have someone who’ll constantly remind you to take one step at a time … I think that really helped. Someone positive in the family.” She also speaks to all her children openly about her addiction, in the hope that it will help them understand what she went through. “They know everything, (I told them about it) to make sure that they are not ashamed, that they don’t think that they are lesser,” said Ms Chun, who now works at a shelter for women with addiction. “I think that’s what I want to bring them up with - confidence and with a lot of compassion towards people with addiction.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

Vials with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine labels are seen in this illustration picture taken Mar 19, 2021. (Photo: REUTERS/Dado Ruvic) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Jun 3) rejected \"egregious and false claims\" cited by the People's Power Party, which had called for a suspension of COVID-19 vaccination. The opposition party's Facebook post on May 29 cited \"studies and analyses by prominent medical experts\", which claimed that COVID-19 vaccines caused high incidences of severe side effects, MOH said. It also attempted to draw associations between high vaccination rates and excess deaths, the ministry said in a media statement on Monday. The People's Power Party claimed that Singapore has been experiencing \"unusual and exceptionally high excess deaths\" since 2021 when COVID-19 vaccination was introduced as compared to pre-vaccination years. \"It is more worrying that such high excess deaths situation is not unique to Singapore as other highly COVID-19-vaccinated countries and region are also encountering similar problems,\" said the opposition party in its Facebook post. MOH categorically rejects these egregious and false claims, said the Health Ministry, adding that people must \"draw the right conclusions and follow the scientific evidence on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines\". \"The primary reason why Singapore recorded one of the lowest excess death rates in the world during the pandemic, is because the majority of Singaporeans took the vaccines,\" said MOH. The ministry also said that contrary to the claims that vaccination has led to excess deaths, multiple studies have shown that that COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of death as compared to the unvaccinated during the period of the pandemic. This includes countries that predominantly use the mRNA vaccines, it added. “In fact, 19.8 million deaths from COVID-19 were prevented globally within the first 12 months that vaccines became available (from December 2020 to December 2021)”, said MOH. The Health Ministry added that excess deaths in Singapore during the pandemic were attributable to deaths of people infected with COVID-19 or those with a recent infection. Of those who died, there was an \"over-representation\" of people who were not fully vaccinated. The high level of vaccine protection in our society averted many COVID-related deaths, protected our healthcare system from being overwhelmed, and allowed us to preserve lives and livelihoods, said the ministry. “The normalcy in our daily lives today is in large part due to the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide.” MOH said that during Singapore’s previous JN.1 wave, the incidence rate of COVID-19 hospitalisations and ICU admissions among seniors aged 60 years and above who were not vaccinated was nearly double that of those who had kept their vaccination updated. Multiple international and local studies conducted over other past waves also consistently showed the effectiveness of vaccination in preventing severe outcome of COVID-19 infection, especially among seniors, it added. Vaccination and boosting also \"mitigate the risk of developing long-term conditions after COVID-19 infection\", it said. These include cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and thrombotic complications. “This is why keeping up to date with additional vaccine doses is pertinent even as COVID-19 becomes endemic, much like vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus,” said the ministry. “COVID-19 waves occur from time to time and can cause severe disease among those who are older or medically vulnerable. \"The vaccines will be able to protect individuals and prevent deaths.\" MOH has responded to each of the \"so-called experts\" cited by the People's Power Party. \"His research highlighted a high correlation between the vaccination and an increased incidence of myocarditis, particularly among young individuals. In a comprehensive review, Dr McCullough noted that the risks of myocarditis, particularly among males under 30 appeared to outweigh the benefits of vaccination.\" MOH does not dispute that myocarditis/pericarditis is a possible serious adverse event post mRNA or Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccination. This is a recognised side effect of these vaccines that was picked up by safety monitoring by health regulators. However, data and experience that have accrued to date confirm that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis continue to be very rare after vaccination. This rare risk is predominantly observed in men aged 12 to 29 years and largely occurs within the first week after vaccination. Risk of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination is less likely than after a COVID-19 infection. In consultation with the Expert Committee On COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V), male vaccinees aged 12 to 29 years who are receiving any dose of Moderna/Spikevax, Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Novavax/Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccines would have been advised to refrain from participating in strenuous physical activities for one week after vaccination. The benefits of being vaccinated continues to outweigh the risks of doing so, including in men aged 12 to 29 years, and individuals are encouraged to do so based on prevailing recommendations. In addition, we note that Dr McCullough’s study on A Systematic Review of Autopsy Findings in Deaths after COVID-19 Vaccination was removed by Preprints with the Lancet as “the study’s conclusions are not supported by the study methodology”. Dr McCullough was the co-author, and the first author - Nicolas Hulscher is a research fellow at the McCullough Foundation started by Dr McCullough. \"Expressed significant concerns regarding the potential long-term impact of mass vaccination during a pandemic. Dr Vanden Bossche’s studies indicated that widespread vaccination could potentially lead to the evolution of more virulent strains of the virus.\" MOH notes that although the PPP did not provide any references for studies done by Dr Bossche, his open letter to WHO in March 2021, and in his book published in 2023, The Inescapable Immune Escape Pandemic, he discussed that COVID-19 mass vaccination (mRNA vaccines in particular) during the Omicron phase of the pandemic has expedited the selectional adaptive evolution of the virus, as booster doses and growing vaccine coverage rates allowed for more frequent and widespread infections. We note that viruses naturally mutate as they replicate, and there is no evidence that the mRNA vaccines contribute to this. The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant which caused a major COVID-19 wave globally, rapidly emerged even before the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccines. This demonstrates that the virus mutates substantially even without the vaccine. The mRNA vaccine generates a protective immune response by our bodies and does not interact directly with the SARS-CoV-2 virus to result in mutations or variants. “He pointed out potential issues with vaccine safety profiles and called for more transparency and rigorous post-marketing surveillance. Dr Malone stressed that comprehensive data was needed to fully understand the long-term safety and efficacy of the mRNA vaccines.” We note that Dr Malone did not author any of the quoted articles. Nonetheless, MOH and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) will continue to monitor local adverse reporting, as well as local and international safety data of COVID-19 vaccines, on an ongoing basis. “Analysed data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and found a notable increase in reports of serious adverse events following the COVID-19 vaccination. Her findings indicated a need for immediate and thorough investigation into the reports.” The 2021 paper by Dr Rose, A report on myocarditis adverse events in the US Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) in association with COVID-19 injectable biological product has been indicated as “withdrawn at the request of the author(s) and/or editor”. MOH does not dispute that myocarditis/pericarditis is a possible serious adverse event post mRNA or Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccination. This is a recognised side effect of these vaccines that was picked up by safety monitoring by health regulators. “Highlighted potential risks associated with COVID-19 vaccines. He has been vocal about the need to re-evaluate current vaccination strategies in light of emerging evidence. Dr Malhotra pointed out that given the increasing reports of adverse events, there was a compelling case for re - assessing the risk-benefit profile of these vaccines.” We note that Dr Malhotra did not author any of the quoted articles. We also note that he is known to be promoting messages against mRNA vaccines “Expressed concerns about the long-term effects of COVID-19 vaccines. Stressing the importance of transparency and rigorous scientific evaluation, Professor Fukushima remarked that comprehensive and transparent evaluations should be prioritised to ensure public trust and safety in vaccination programmes.” We note that the study quoted “Autoimmune inflammatory reactions triggered by the COVID-19 genetic vaccines in terminally differentiated tissues” is co-authored by Prof Fukushima and Dr McCullough which “aims to draw attention ... to the critical need for biodistribution studies” for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Biodistribution data based on animal studies was assessed for mRNA vaccines and the approval of the vaccines was based on totality of evidence supporting the vaccines’ efficacy, safety and quality. “Also raised concerns about the COVID-19 vaccines. He echoed that the potential for adverse effects, particularly with respect to immune responses, warranted a re-evaluation of the current vaccination strategies.” We note that Prof Dalgleish did not author any of the quoted articles. “Expressed apprehension regarding the long-term impact of the COVID-19 vaccines on immune system function. Professor Clancy said that there were unresolved questions about the long-term effects of these vaccines on immune memory and response, which needed to be addressed before continuing mass vaccination programmes.” We note that Prof Clancy did not author any of the quoted articles Human Reproduction, 38(12), 2536-2536 Thorp, JA, Rogers et al (2023) We note that this is a letter to the Editors of the Human Reproduction journal, on the fact that a separate systematic review by Rimmer et al (2023) had omitted their manuscript which reported significant harms to pregnant women and infants from COVID-19 vaccination. This manuscript was published in the Journal of the American Physicians and Surgeons, which is the official journal of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS). AAPS is known to publish articles that cast doubts on COVID-19 vaccination risk-benefit and call for suspension of COVID-19 vaccination. We note that the Rimmer team responded to point out that this said manuscript was based on a simulation model that was constructed using data from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database that compares adverse events between COVID-19 and influenza vaccines as opposed to true incidence. The Rimmer team also said, “Should the authors provide robust factual data on the true incidence of miscarriage following the use of COVID-19 vaccines, we would be more than happy to update our meta-analysis accordingly.” Therapeutic Advances in Drug Safety, 15, 20420986241226566 Rose J, et al We note an expression of concern has been issued for this article and investigations are underway. Nonetheless, myocarditis is a known side-effect and necessary precautions have been instituted when it was first reported in 2021, ahead of this article in 2024. The New York Times, 3 May 2024 We note that the article did not question the safety, effectiveness and risk-benefit of COVID-19 vaccination, nor ask for suspension of COVID-19 vaccination. MOH said its recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination are evidence-based, adding that it will continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and adjust its recommendations accordingly. The long-term effects of COVID-19 infections, collectively known as Long COVID, can be much worse without the protection of vaccines, said the ministry. Patients could register heart, respiratory and other complications post-infection. Singapore has been transparent in reporting the incidence of side effects of COVID-19 vaccination, said MOH. There are side effects to any vaccination, noted the Health Ministry. \"Until July 2023 when the safety profiles of the vaccines have been reviewed to be consistent with no new safety signals, we reported this on a regular basis, which showed that most side effects were mild, and that the reporting rates of severe side effects remained rare at seven per 100,000 doses (0.007 per cent).\" Most recovered smoothly after rest and treatment, it added. \"In particular, we highlighted the relatively higher incidence of myocarditis amongst the young males, at about one in 100,000 doses (0.001 per cent),\" said MOH. The Health Ministry also cited data from the US showing that young men ages 18 to 29 years had seven to eight times the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis after COVID-19 infection, compared to after COVID-19 vaccination. This is supported by other studies, including a systematic review which reported similar findings that the risk of myocarditis is more than seven times higher in persons who had COVID-19 infections than in those who received the vaccine. As such, the benefit of vaccination continues to outweigh the risk for all ages, said MOH. “That is why international and national health authorities continue to recommend COVID-19 vaccination,” it added. There is a very large body of scientific evidence that overwhelmingly shows that the protection from COVID-19 vaccines outweighs the side effects, said the ministry. \"Yet, several groups continue to spread misinformation, either by quoting scientific literature out of context or sharing materials from non-credible sources who cannot be held accountable, to cast doubts on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. \"At least the People’s Power Party has consolidated these reports, to give us the opportunity to rebut them at one go.\" MOH noted that the list of scientific articles cited by the opposition party was mostly from the same group of authors, including some who have been reported to be promoting messages against COVID-19 vaccination. “We urge the public to verify information found on the Internet against authoritative sources,” said MOH.

(Photo: REUTERS/Dado Ruvic) Advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday (Jun 5) unanimously voted in favour of recommending that COVID-19 vaccines for 2024-25 should target a strain within the lineage of the JN.1 variant that has been dominant this year. The 16 advisors did not vote on whether to favour the original JN.1 variant or one of its successors like the currently dominant KP.2 strain . However, during their discussion they overwhelmingly recommended using the older JN.1 variant, particularly as it is the only strain for which Novavax - one of the vaccine makers - said it would be able to target with its shot. \"We wanted to make sure that we gave people the option to potentially make a choice of a KP.2 vaccine. We hear loud and clear from all of the members that they don't feel like that is necessary at this time,\" said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation & Research. While the agency typically follows its advisers' recommendation when it makes its final decision, it is not obligated to do. Shares of Novavax rose 18 per cent on Wednesday, while Moderna closed up 6.5 per cent. Pfizer shares ended marginally higher. COVID-19 vaccine makers earlier in the day said data from animals studies showed their 2024-25 shots targeting the JN.1 variant that was dominant earlier this year could neutralize newer subvariants such as KP.2 much better than the older shots. Pfizer and partner BioNTech said they will be ready to supply their updated vaccines immediately upon approval, while Moderna forecasts a timeline for August. Pfizer and Moderna said they were ready to supply vaccines that target either JN.1 or KP.2 variants. Vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech can be developed more quickly. Pfizer had earlier said it could make the shots in 100 days. Novavax, which makes a more traditional protein-based shot, said it expects to be ready for commercial delivery of its JN.1 vaccine in the United States in September.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Even though progress has been made with revisions to the WHO's International Health Regulations, more global cooperation is needed to prevent the same devastation that COVID-19 caused, say these professors. WELLINGTON, New Zealand: The international community’s recent failure to conclude a global pandemic agreement leaves large gaps in our capacity to deal with the next major infectious disease emergency. The risk of another pandemic like COVID-19 - the worst in a century - is increasing. The World Health Organization (WHO) took an important step by adopting useful revisions to the existing legally-binding International Health Regulations. But while this advance is something to celebrate, it is not enough. Even if governments approve the revised regulations, our best chance of preventing history repeating itself lies in a pandemic agreement. Global responses to health hazards that cross borders date back to an international sanitary conference in 1851 which focused on measures to limit the spread of cholera. Since then, several initiatives have aimed to improve global health security, including the formation of the WHO itself in 1946. The International Health Regulations of 2005 were a major step in this evolution. They ushered in the modern era of risk assessment and created a global surveillance system for public health emergencies of international concern. Nonetheless, it was soon evident the new tools were limited in dealing with the increasingly complex and fast moving threat of zoonotic diseases (when an animal pathogen “spills over” to infect people). Not all proposed amendment were achieved. Some commentators had advocated to incorporate the experience of countries in the Asia-Pacific region that used an elimination strategy to delay the spread of COVID-19, giving time to roll out vaccines and other interventions. Such measures protected both high-income islands (New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan) as well as low and middle-income countries in continental Asia (Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia). These nations generally achieved lower excess mortality than countries where the pandemic was less controlled. Similarly, the concept of elimination at source (sometimes called containment) wasn’t included in this revision. A range of other potential improvements also failed to make it into the final text. These included an emphasis on preventing zoonotic spillovers from animals, enhanced sharing of scientific data and specimens, and strengthened accountability. All WHO member states now have 18 months to consider the proposed revisions. They may enter reservations to parts they disagree with, even though this may weaken the coherence of the proposed amendments. A pandemic agreement could address the many needed reforms that go beyond the International Health Regulations. But the negotiations to reach global agreement are proving contentious. There have been deep divisions between rich and poorer countries over the sharing and affordable pricing of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for developing states. The sharing of pathogen data has also proven problematic. The negotiations have been further undermined by completely unfounded assertions that the WHO will be given power to impose restrictive measures such as lockdowns and vaccine mandates. It is not clear whether New Zealand’s changed negotiating position to focus more on national sovereignty influenced these discussions. Due to these challenges, the international community has not yet agreed on a text for a pandemic agreement. The WHO has announced the next steps for further negotiations, which are already years past their start date. From the threats of war to environmental devastation and pandemics, no country can unilaterally protect its citizens from the gravest shared threats to humanity. But while the need for global solidarity and cooperation is greater than ever, support for many of the key areas of international law is failing. We owe it to the memory of the more than 27 million people estimated to have died so far from COVID-19, and the rising threats to future generations, to do the best we can to achieve a safer and more secure world.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore While Singapore's COVID-19 response was based on what was learnt from the SARS outbreak, \"expect the next pandemic to be different\", says Health Minister Ong Ye Kung. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung speaks in parliament on May 10, 2023. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: There is a tendency for governments to prepare for old challenges rather than new ones, and this applies to the approach to pandemic preparedness, Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung said on Tuesday (Jun 18). Speaking at a virtual conference to launch a new Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response Report, Mr Ong shared the lessons Singapore learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic and what the country is doing to prepare for the next pandemic. The Health Minister noted the conclusions of a White Paper on the government’s review of its pandemic response, which the Prime Minister’s Office published in March last year. It listed the effective responses and acknowledged areas where the government had \"fallen short\". \"The lessons are many, so let me focus on one key thrust, which is that governments, just like any other organisations, are prone to make the mistake of fighting the last war. And that was the case for COVID-19,\" said Mr Ong. He acknowledged that Singapore's COVID-19 response - similar to that of many East Asian countries - had been based on what was learnt from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. The spread of SARS had been curbed through contact tracing and isolation, Mr Ong said. \"In Western countries, on the other hand, their responses, I think, are based on what they learned during a bad influenza season, so they tried to ride through the epidemic with higher than usual patient load at hospitals, but eventually, things would subside and go back to normal,\" he added. Both approaches to COVID-19, however, \"turned out to be unworkable because they were fundamentally responses to the last war that the respective regions had experienced\", Mr Ong said. Singapore, as did other East Asian countries, soon realised that COVID-19 was \"far more transmissible than SARS\" and that tracing and isolation could not contain the virus. Western countries generally took a different approach but found that the virus was far more severe than influenza and by trying to ride through the transmission wave, their hospitals were overwhelmed, leading to more deaths, Mr Ong noted. Singapore has drawn lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic but \"the more enduring insight, or even wisdom, is to expect the next pandemic to be different\". This means the country \"must be prepared for the worst-case scenario\", he said. While SARS infected fewer people than COVID-19 , SARS had a higher fatality rate of around 9.5 per cent. In comparison, the fatality rate of COVID-19 - which had infected more than 766 million people worldwide and killed nearly 7 million as of May 24, 2023, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) - is about 0.9 per cent. The next pandemic could be as severe as SARS, and as transmissible as an influenza virus, said Mr Ong. Mr Ong pointed out that a \"full range of measures\" would be needed during a pandemic as the common mission as a healthcare jurisdiction is to minimise deaths. This ranges from \"entirely domestic\" social restrictions - up to and including a lockdown - to curb the number of infections, as well as vaccines and other medical countermeasures, and ensuring healthcare facilities are adequate and competent. \"Governments need to prepare people to accept such measures, no matter how draconian they are, in an emergency,\" Mr Ong said. For social restrictions, Singapore amended the Infectious Diseases Act to allow the authorities to implement appropriate restrictions and responses during a pandemic alert or emergency. On the other hand, vaccines and medical countermeasures, as well as adequate healthcare facilities are not \"merely domestic efforts\". \"Developing vaccines and medical countermeasures, for example, is a global effort. Singapore is contributing to the 100-day mission with our niche expertise, but that is all we have - niche expertise,\" Mr Ong said. \"We do not have all the expertise to develop an effective vaccine for the next time. So we are not seeking to develop a Singapore vaccine for the next pandemic; we are working with scientists around the world to develop the best possible vaccine in as short a time as possible.\" Mr Ong noted that building up production capacity for vaccines when there is time and space to do so is the \"best way to address vaccine inequity\". \"Capacity is not built up through coercion and force, but by encouraging and facilitating investment from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he added. \"Governments need to be a strong partner to industry, to incentivise them to conduct research and development, formulate, produce and distribute the vaccines.\" Singapore has since attracted five vaccine manufacturers to set up their production facilities here, which will eventually produce more than a billion doses per year. \"As for the adequacy of the healthcare system, while it is a domestic response, many countries of the Global South require support and help. They will need capacity building to strengthen disease surveillance systems, better equip primary care and expand acute care,\" said Mr Ong. Mr Ong acknowledged that this will require global financing, which is the motivation in setting up the Pandemic Fund, under the supervision of the World Bank. Singapore has pledged about US$18 million (S$24.3 million) to support the WHO Investment Round for its 14th General Programme of Work 2025-2028, he added. \"We hope to prioritise our contribution for capacity building amongst developing countries, and hopefully catalyse contributions by other nations.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore MOH is calling on the community to keep up to date with their boosters to prevent severe illness, and has ramped up operating hours and locations of vaccination sites. Patients are screened before taking their COVID-19 booster jabs at a mobile vaccination venue in Bedok. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: At least 30 mobile vaccination teams have been deployed to the heartlands this month as the Health Ministry (MOH) extends their reach amid the current COVID-19 wave . Cases have dropped for three straight weeks since peaking in May. About 12,600 infections were recorded from Jun 9 to 16, down from 16,800 the week before. The number of hospitalised cases also dropped to 195, from the previous week’s 236. However, daily intensive care unit (ICU) cases rose by one to four on the average. MOH is calling on the community to keep up to date with boosters to prevent severe illness, and has ramped up operating hours and locations of vaccination sites. Mobile vaccination teams are deployed for a few days at each venue before moving to other locations. They operate from 9am to 5pm, with a break between 11.30am and 1pm. Anyone can walk in without making an appointment, with slots allocated on a first come first served basis, subject to space and vaccine availability. Priority will be given to seniors aged 60 and above. When CNA visited one mobile vaccination station in Bedok over the weekend, patients were able to receive a shot in the arm in less than 10 minutes. “I saw the site nearby, so I thought why not just drop by? It's convenient, I don't need to travel further out. One jab is one layer of defence,” 76-year-old resident Lau Hang Sia, who received his booster shot, told CNA. Another resident Ng Choi Meng, 74, who was waiting in line for her turn, said: “I got COVID-19 two times already. Because I'm elderly, maybe if I get another time, (it’ll be) serious already. That's why I need (the) protection.” Clinic chain Minmed Group, which currently operates two mobile teams, said each location has the capacity to accommodate about 75 patients a day. If there is a surge in demand, it will set up more booths and deploy additional manpower accordingly. The stations offer updated versions of both the Pfizer and Moderna shots. There is also a doctor at each site to answer queries. \"Pfizer and Moderna are both mRNA vaccines and are equally effective. People with concerns about the vaccines can approach our on-site doctor for further discussion,” said Dr Lock Jing Zhan. “They may want to share about their medical history or past experience with the previous mRNA vaccines and from there, our on-site doctors can make further recommendations.\" MOH said teams will continue to be deployed to more venues in the coming weeks to cater to demand. The five Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres across Singapore have also extended their operating hours until the end of the month. The centres at Bukit Merah, Jurong East, Kaki Bukit, Sengkang and Woodlands now run from 9am to 7pm, instead of the usual closing time of 1pm. MOH said more people have gotten their vaccination shots during the current wave of infections. About 49,000 people received jabs between May 20 and Jun 16, five times more than the weeks before. Dr Lock said that keeping up with vaccines is important, as COVID-19 – like all viruses – mutates and generates new variants. “Regular booster shots help to stimulate the immune system that can reduce the severity of the illness and also reduce transmission if you do get infected,” he said. This is even more so for the vulnerable population including the elderly, those with chronic conditions and the immunosuppressed. The current number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore remains what MOH calls “elevated”, compared to earlier in the year. As many Singaporeans return from overseas travel following the June school holidays, the health ministry said it will continue to monitor the situation closely. Capacity at public hospitals also remains tight. The National University Health System, which runs three hospitals, said it has seen more patients at its emergency departments, although ICU capacity remains stable. The health cluster added that it is doing its best to optimise resources, and is reviewing elective procedures to ensure sufficient capacity for inpatients. It warned that a longer waiting time may be expected at its emergency departments and urged patients to go to general practitioners, and only visit hospitals if they are facing serious or life-threatening conditions.

    "article_content": "Podcasts Podcasts Companies need to provide managers with clear guidelines on how to assess flexible work arrangement requests to remove any bias, say our guest. Looking for a job or trying to nail it at your current one? Host Tiffany Ang and career counsellor Gerald Tan help navigate your important - and sometimes thorny - work life questions. Employers now have to consider staff requests around flexible work arrangements. But what are reasonable requests and can managers avoid bias in decision making? Mukul Anand, head of HR in HSBC Singapore, talks about how companies can better serve their staff’s needs. Jump to these key moments: Here's an excerpt from the conversation: Tiffany Ang: I want to talk a bit about this flexible working communications toolkit. I mean, that term jumped out to me. What exactly is in this toolkit and how do you get everyone to be on board with it? Mukul Anand: I think the key there is that when people came back to work after COVID, we never underestimated the challenge which managers may have had to decide where they should allow what because we were trying to find the right balance, what works for our employees, but also what works for our customers and other colleagues. So when I decide about hybrid what works for me, that cannot be the only way I look at hybrid what works for me, I also have to keep in mind what works for people around me. And what works for my customers, because the customer behavior, also during COVID, everyone was interacting over zoom calls, but then maybe the customers want to meet the bankers face to face. So that is where we have given tools to managers, where they use that to determine what is the right balance to achieve in certain roles, and it also gives them confidence that they will not be alleged that you are biased, or you are doing something else for someone else and something else for me. So it's important for them to have some consistent kind of guidelines. Tiffany: I mean, that's the tricky thing, right? What is a reasonable or unreasonable request? Mukul: So I talked about outcome focus. That's really important, that if you're able to get the right outcome for the client and for the bank, then we can be very flexible in terms of the arrangement or how you want to approach certain things. What we need to be aware that in multinational organisations like HSBC, we have a lot of international clients, so the interaction with clients, anyway happens through various channels. Sometimes you fly down to meet the clients. Sometimes you do it over Zoom or telephone or email etc. So I think that is something which has always existed in a multinational organisation. But we do encourage our employees to also think about their colleagues. And we try to categorise certain roles. There are certain roles wherein flexible working is not achievable to the same extent as most of the other roles, right? You look at trading jobs. You look at jobs which are in branches, which are dependent on physical interaction. So in those kind of roles, I think the requirement is different, but employees do have a choice that if they want to adopt a certain kind of work pattern and only that works for them, then they look at roles which actually support that kind of work pattern.

REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo SYDNEY/LONDON :Global shares steadied on Monday ahead of U.S. price data that investors are banking on to show a renewed moderation in inflation, while markets were on alert for Japanese intervention as the dollar tested the 160-yen barrier. Geopolitics also loomed large, with the first U.S. presidential debate on Thursday and the first round of voting in the French election at the weekend. The MSCI All-World index was flat on the day, having fallen for the previous two sessions. In Europe, the STOXX 600 edged into positive territory, while U.S. index futures were up 0.1-0.2 per cent. Shares in Boeing could face pressure after Reuters reported that U.S. prosecutors are recommending criminal charges be brought against the aircraft maker. Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.5 per cent, with the continued decline in the yen putting pressure on the Bank of Japan to tighten policy despite patchy domestic data. Minutes of the central bank's last policy meeting out on Monday showed there was much discussion about tapering its bond buying and raising rates. Japan's top currency official was out early to voice disapproval with the yen's latest drop which saw the dollar reach as high as 159.94. The dollar was trading just a shade softer at 159.74, eyeing the 160.245 peak from late April where Japan is thought to have started spending around $60 billion buying the yen. Demand for carry trades - borrowing yen at low rates to buy higher yielding currencies - has also seen both the Australian and New Zealand dollars reach 17-year peaks on the yen. \"Fresh cyclical highs for the dollar versus the yen overnight, further intervention jawboning from Japan's FX supremo Kanda and continued pressure on the yuan underline the pain being felt in Asia and EM more broadly from the Fed's high for longer stance, and will probably revive 'currency wars' chatter,\" Marc Ostwald, chief global economist at ADM Investor Services. PARSING THE PCE Even the euro was testing recent highs at 170.87 yen , despite being saddled with a round of soft manufacturing surveys (PMI). The euro is heading for a drop of 1.2 per cent in June, its largest monthly decline since January. But on Monday, it was trading up 0.2 per cent on the day at $1.07123 . \"The decline in the euro area flash June PMI raises some concern that the nascent rebound is being cut short,\" analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note. \"The abruptness of the drop is notable against the backdrop of the French election, which was mentioned explicitly by firms as a reason for the drag.\" France's far-right National Rally (RN) party and its allies were seen leading the first round of the country's elections with 35.5 per cent of the vote, according to a poll published on Sunday. Manufacturing surveys from the United States, in contrast, showed activity at a 26-month high in June, though price pressures subsided considerably. The latter shift whetted appetites for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index due on Friday. Annual growth in the Federal Reserve's favoured core index is expected to slow to 2.6 per cent in May, the lowest in more than three years. \"Note that low PCE deflator outcomes are needed to keep the y/y rate from rising through the course of this year given the string of low prints in the second half of 2023,\" cautioned analysts at NAB. \"The Fed is well aware of this as the median dot for end 2024 was 2.8 per cent for PCE, unchanged from its current level and implying average monthly outcomes of 0.18 per cent.\" A low result would probably reinforce market bets on a Fed rate cut as early as September, which futures currently price as a 65 per cent prospect. There are at least five Fed speakers on the docket this week, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Fed Governors Lisa Cook and Michelle Bowman. In commodity markets, gold pared losses in line with the retreat in the dollar to trade up 0.5 per cent at $2,330 an ounce, while oil rose, pushing Brent crude up 0.2 per cent to $85.41 a barrel and U.S. crude also up 0.2 per cent at $80.87.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore While harassment from unlicensed moneylenders, or loan sharks, is nothing new, some illegal lenders have adopted new technologically savvy means. (Image: TODAY/Nurjannah Suhaimi) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Mr Alan had no idea that his employee had borrowed from “loan sharks” until he was harassed with almost 120 calls over three days from various unlicensed money lenders. The strategic consultant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, discovered that his Singaporean employee had given Mr Alan’s name, personal phone number and the company's main line to the illegal moneylenders, listing Mr Alan as a guarantor. “During the period where there was constant harassment, if you don’t pick up right away they will call back immediately. They don’t allow your phone to rest, so if other people try to call you they cannot get through,” said Mr Alan, who is in his 50s. He immediately terminated the man’s contract for placing his office and other colleagues “at risk”. Mr Alan also advised his staff on how to field calls searching for the former employee. “I was more scared for my staff, who might think, ‘what kind of company is this, what is happening?’” While this happened in 2017, Mr Alan received a call from a stranger looking for his ex-employee last year. He told the caller that he did not know who the caller was referring to before hanging up, and did not receive any further calls from purported lenders. Mr Alan’s brush with “Ah Longs” - a colloquial term derived from the Cantonese phrase for illegal moneylenders - despite him not having borrowed a cent from them is not unique. In recent years, unlicensed money lenders have used both time-tested and less conventional methods to force their borrowers to pay up - from harassing the latter’s employers to using social media to scare and shame debtors and engaging “runners” to intimidate them. Mr Sebastian Pereira, a sales manager and delivery rider on Foodpanda, also had a taste of another loan-shark tactic last year. The 51-year-old said “nothing looked amiss” when he picked up a cash-on-delivery order for fishball noodles in Pasir Ris. Upon arriving at the drop-off location in Bedok, however, he found more than 10 other delivery riders from various platforms congregating at the void deck. “When I walked towards them, they asked me, ‘Is it for this address? This is a scam, a fake order. It’s a loan-shark case’,” said Mr Pereira, who reported the incident to the delivery platform and was told to discard the food. The other riders, from platforms such as Grab and Lalamove, also had cash-on-delivery orders for the same address placed under a similar username, but the resident had not placed any orders. “It’s another way of harassing the victims, because the loan sharks themselves don’t want to be caught. Especially (for harassment tactics) like paint and graffiti, those people can be caught. But food delivery, you don’t know who they are,” said Mr Pereira. In April 2020, during the COVID-19 circuit breaker, the police released an advisory stating that unlicensed moneylenders had increasingly been making use of food delivery services to harass debtors, such as by ordering large quantities of food, often late at night. For Ms Ika Lestari, the aftermath of her former helper borrowing money from unlicensed moneylenders was two months of calls and messages from various numbers, mostly Malaysian, threatening to burn down her house this year. The intimidation tactics escalated when harassers sent raw pork on two occasions via cash-on-delivery orders through Foodpanda and Grab. Despite blocking many phone numbers that sent threatening messages, the loan sharks still managed to track her down via social media, the 40-year-old teacher said. They took screenshots of public photos of her face and sent them to her with messages such as “Is this you?” and issued other threats such as “I go your house because you block me (sic)”. Ms Ika made four separate police reports during the harassment, which eventually stopped after three months in April this year when she blocked all the contacts and installed a closed-circuit television camera at her main door. In May, Mr Md Sharif Uddin, a Bangladeshi worker, left Singapore after being fired by his employer amid alleged harassment by loan sharks and a failed last-minute appeal to extend his stay. Mr Sharif denied ever taking any loan and the police did not find any evidence that he had borrowed from unlicensed moneylenders. However , the company terminated his employment after the daughter of Mr Sharif’s employer said that she had received debtor’s notes and hell notes addressed to Mr Sharif at her home. There are no publicly available statistics on cases relating to unlicensed money lender harassment, though such cases make headlines every now and then. Notably, some lawyers told TODAY that they have seen more cases of teenagers or youths being recruited by these illegal moneylenders as their runners. The police said on Thursday (Jun 20) that they too have seen an increase in the proportion of youth arrested for unlicensed moneylending activities. From January to May 2024, 8.6 per cent of unlicensed money lending arrests involved youths between the ages of 14 and 19, a spike from 3.1 per cent for the corresponding period in 2023. A search of police news releases by TODAY found at least 67 reported cases of individuals being arrested for allegedly helping loan sharks in the past six months. Many of the cases involved teenagers caught for alleged loanshark harassment, including a 14-year-old who was arrested on Jun 5, for suspected involvement in setting a fire outside a flat at Yishun Avenue 6. Since January this year, at least three islandwide operations have been conducted to suppress unlicensed moneylending activities, with over 100 persons being investigated on each occasion for allegedly harassing debtors at their homes, carrying out bank transfers and providing banking information to facilitate unlicensed money lending business. On Jun 8, the police said that 128 persons aged between 14 and 73 were being investigated for their suspected involvement in unlicensed moneylending activities, following a five-day islandwide operation in May. On Friday, Ng Kwong Seng, a Singaporean man who rose through the ranks to become a “towkay” (boss) for an illegal moneylending syndicate based in China, was sentenced to 51 months' jail and a fine of S$495,000. For 13 years, Ng had worked for the syndicate, which charged Singapore borrowers 20 per cent interest for loans. With the “Ah Long” menace being a never-ending story, TODAY takes a closer look at how unlicensed moneylender harassment tactics have evolved in this digital age, and why this illicit industry persists. Before the dawn of the digital age, spraying paint and locking gates were among the unlicensed moneylenders’ favourite tools of the trade. Ms Priya (not her real name), who works in the media industry, recalled a period when her family was harassed by loan sharks every few days between 2003 and 2008 after her father was saddled with unpaid debts. “Common tactics were spray paint, putting a copy of my father’s identity card and address in all our neighbours’ letterboxes and chain locking our gate,” said the 34-year-old. Harassers would bang on their door and shout in her family members’ faces to return the money when they opened the door. However, unlicensed money lenders had to reduce such “open harassment” tactics when the authorities installed closed-circuit television cameras in all lifts and at lift landings, said Ms Priya. They instead adopted “very silent” approaches, such as having a person pass a letter through the door which demanded repayment. The harassment eventually “tapered off” in 2008, said Ms Priya, who attributed this to a stepped-up police presence in her neighbourhood and her family successfully paying off their loans. Mr Howard (not his real name), 28, recalled his family being the neighbourhood’s “public enemy” when they faced loan shark harassment. The intimidation, which continued for over a month in 2010, included continuous calls looking for his father who had borrowed the money, and vulgarities and threats over the phone. “They spray-painted my father’s and our house details across the block, at the lift lobby, ground floor and car park. We attempted to put a plastic sheet over our door to minimise the mess, however, they went on to splash red paint on our neighbours’ doors,” said Mr Howard. The harassment stopped after one alleged harasser was caught while carrying paint in Mr Howard's neighbourhood. But having been stigmatised as the “family who borrowed from Ah Long”, Mr Howard’s mother later moved the family out of the area. Ms Gloria James, head lawyer at Gloria James Civetta and Co, said that unlicensed money lenders typically use intimidation, harassment and threats to collect debts, including threats of violence to the borrower and their loved ones. She noted that the people involved in harassing borrowers may not be the actual moneylenders, but other individuals they engage as runners. Recent years have also seen the increasing use of social media not only to harass debtors - but also to advertise and contact potential borrowers, such as in unsolicited messages boasting fast approval loans. “Unlicensed money lenders have increasingly been using online tactics to harass debtors, including posting on social media platforms … This causes embarrassment for the borrowers and it would be difficult to detect given that postings can be made anonymously,” said Ms James. “They may also contact neighbours, family members, co-workers and employers online in an attempt to cause harassment and to embarrass the borrower.” She recalled her recent case where an unlicensed moneylender had contacted the borrower’s estranged wife and mother-in-law on Instagram and sent them threatening messages in an attempt to demand payment. Another victim of unlicensed money lender harassment, who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan, said his troubles started last month after his former domestic helper had purportedly borrowed around S$500 from an unlicensed money lender she had met on social media platform TikTok. During the period of harassment, besides calls from unlicensed moneylenders, Mr Tan encountered five to six delivery platform workers from Lalamove sent to collect items from his house for three days. He ended up installing closed-circuit television cameras outside his home in case the harassers took “more aggressive” actions, said the 45-year-old personal trainer. A combination of factors finally put a stop to the harassment, including making a police report, unplugging his landline and urging Lalamove to ban the account that was sending orders to his house. Despite the plethora of strictly regulated licensed money lending alternatives and the exorbitant interest rates charged by loan sharks, many still resort to borrowing money from illegal moneylenders due to financial and socioeconomic reasons, financial experts told TODAY. For the borrowers, the perceived immediate access to cash with minimal documentation and credit checks are key factors that draw them to loan sharks. Associate Professor of Finance Mandy Tham from Singapore Management University (SMU) noted that as legal lending requires the credit assessment of the borrower, it is less accessible to “subprime borrowers” whose credit assessment may not meet the loan requirements. Subprime refers to a credit classification for borrowers who have a limited credit history, and for loans made to such borrowers who may pose a higher risk of being unable to repay their loan. “When one could not meet the credit assessment of legal lenders, one has no choice but to borrow from loan sharks as a last resort, especially after exhausting friends and families,” said Assoc Prof Tham. Those who borrow from loan sharks also tend to be from lower-income backgrounds who may be more “desperate”, and less able to access legal lending options, the experts said. “With the ease of obtaining a credit card today or a credit line from the bank, only the communities that are struggling turn to such options (illegal moneylenders). It is less of an awareness issue, but more of a lack of options,” said Mr Reginald Koh, founder of financial literacy podcast The Financial Coconut. “I believe this will never stop. Loan sharks have always been around, the increased discussion today merely reflects harder financial times for our fellow Singaporeans,” he added. Associate Professor Razwana Begum, head of the public safety and security programme at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said that gig workers, who may be living “day by day” on an unstable income with no savings may also be at “higher risk” of seeking financial assistance from unlicensed moneylenders. “Immigrants and foreign workers are also targeted by unlicensed money lenders. Without established credit histories or sufficient knowledge of local financial systems, immigrants might see unlicensed moneylenders as accessible sources of funds,” said Assoc Prof Razwana, who is also a Nominated Member of Parliament. Over the years, various measures have been introduced to protect borrowers, including tighter regulation of licensed moneylenders and debt collectors, and harsher punishments for unlicensed moneylenders. In a written parliamentary reply on trends in illegal moneylending activities in 2020, Minister for Home Affairs and Law K Shanmugam said that there was “no clear trend of increase” in terms of youths arrested for such offences every year. He added that the police were stepping up efforts to counter these crimes, in light of the economic downturn potentially leading to more people seeking illegal loans. “On the public education front, police launched the fourth anti-unlicensed money lending campaign in January 2020, with the aim of increasing public awareness, first to not to borrow from unlicensed moneylenders or work for them.” He added that social assistance and credit counselling agencies also provide help for unlicensed money lender cases. In November 2008, the Moneylenders Act 2008 was passed in parliament. The Act, which came into effect in March the next year, clarified the money lending activities to be licensed. Under the updated law, all moneylenders who grant secured and unsecured loans to the public have to be licensed and regulated, adhering to regulations including restrictions on publishing false and misleading marketing material. It also introduced measures to counter loansharking such as extending the punishments for those who instigate harassment activities to include caning. Since then, various amendments to the Act have been made, including tightening the laws to tackle loan sharks more effectively. In 2018, changes to the Moneylenders Act were passed in parliament. These include amendments to help prevent over-borrowing, including adding a cap to ensure that those earning less than S$20,000 a year may borrow only up to S$3,000 from all moneylenders combined. Those earning above this amount can borrow up to six times their monthly income. Regulations related to unlicensed moneylending under the Moneylenders Act 2008 include: As for licensed moneylenders, some of the restrictions they face include: A few years later in 2022, parliament passed the Debt Collectors Bill to regulate debt collection activities in Singapore, following a “high number of police reports” on debt collector harassment the previous year. A statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs then noted a spike in the number of police reports against debt collectors acting in a manner that caused “alarm and nuisance” to members of the public. The Bill introduced a licensing regime for the debt collection industry, requiring firms to obtain a licence to operate and have their workers screened and approved by the authorities. Licensed debt collectors told TODAY that since the introduction of the Debt Collectors Act, which took effect in 2023, companies have adapted to greater scrutiny on tactics that might be perceived as harassment. Mr Sean Lee, business manager of Assured Debt Recovery, said that debt recovery is more difficult with the tighter regulations, especially when encountering “aggressive” or uncooperative debtors. Certain debt collection tactics such as hanging banners identifying debtors at their residences are outdated, he said. However, he emphasised that it is also important for the law to weed out the “black sheep” in the industry who may go “overboard” with their debt collection tactics to embarrass debtors. Mr Lee’s staff wear uniforms and adhere to industry practices such as wearing body cameras to record the entire debt recovery process, so that debtors are also clear that the staff are legal debt collectors. Mr Leroy Frank Ratnam, chief executive and commercial adviser at debt collection firm JMS Rogers Global, said the firm follows a “strict protocol” for engagements with debtors. While its debt recovery tactics have remained largely the same, the company has strengthened its “intelligence divisions” to ensure they have the “most accurate data” on debtors to increase the probability of collections. “Gone are the days of using the approach of aggression and intimidation. Debts can be collected with the accurate study of the situation and the crafting of the right strategy to approach,” said Mr Ratnam. More than expanding the ways unlicensed moneylenders harass debtors, online platforms have also enabled the recruitment of those who assist unlicensed moneylender activities, especially young people. Lawyers who have acted in proceedings related to unlicensed moneylending noted an increase in young people being recruited to assist unlicensed moneylender activities, including harassing borrowers. Telegram has been a “game changer” in the past five years, as a transnational messaging platform popular among youths where users can be easily recruited for criminal activities , said lawyer Kalidass Murugaiyan, who has worked with young offenders between the ages of 16 and 22. “Around 10 to 15 years ago, (recruitment) used to be on websites. There were popular forums where these (listings) were posted, but now it’s gone even deeper, because it’s on Telegram. If you go to Telegram and type ‘Sell ATM card’, you might get something,” said Mr Kalidass from Kalidass Law Corporation. Young people can also be “easily manipulated”, as some unlicensed money lenders will “acclimatise” runners by asking them to do less aggressive modes of harassment, such as placing a debtor's note, before asking them if they want to do “something more” for an additional S$100. Mr Kalidass cited cases where the youths involved were told they only had to place a post-it note at debtors' homes, but were later asked to buy paint and splash it there, which they may feel pressured to do since they were “already in the loop”. Lawyer Ray Louis also noted an increase in young offenders involved in cases of unlicensed moneylender harassment, who were recruited over Telegram or online marketplace Carousell. The youths’ parents were not aware of their involvement with loan sharks until it was uncovered by the authorities, as the youngsters’ handphone usage was unsupervised. “For the young who are naive, it just means going to the debtors' home, doing some stuff and then running away. So they think it's a simple job and they get paid S$50 to S$100,” said Mr Louis from Ray Louis Law Corporation. Furthermore, young persons may be more easily recruited because they or the loan sharks recruiting them are aware that young offenders, such as those between 16 and 21 years old, are likely to get lighter sentences such as probation if convicted, though it is always possible for them to get a harsher punishment like reformative training. “In the past, more adults were involved. However, with the penalty of possibly jail and also caning, a lot of adults may not be willing to take the risk,” said Mr Louis. “My last client was young, (studying) at the Institute of Technical Education and he was accused of harassing debtors. He did get probation, but this exemplifies the trend right now.” As for why young persons are drawn to working as runners, the police said on Thursday that youths tend to commit such offences for “fast cash”. For conducting harassment such as splashing paint or placing a bicycle lock at a debtor’s gate, the going rate can be S$300 to S$800 per job, though some are paid less, said officer-in-charge of the Bedok Police Division's Anti-Unlicensed Moneylending Squad, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Michael Ho in an interview with the media. He pointed to a March 2020 case where four youths aged between 17 and 18 were caught for vandalising a house with paint and locking a gate with a bicycle lock. The youths in that case confessed to having committed the acts for “quick cash” and having learned about the job through a Telegram group called “SG Fast Cash”. They were offered S$100 as a group for this incident of harassment and eventually charged in court and sentenced to 21 months of probation. When asked if there was a noticeable trend of youths who commit such offences being from lower-income families, ASP Ho said that these youths typically come from a range of backgrounds. “Some of them come from better-off families, but (they commit these offences) because of the attraction (of earning money) and the lifestyle, their daily expenditure, (as) they may spend more as compared to previously,” said Mr Ho. Lawyer Sanjiv Vaswani said that his firm Vaswani Law Chambers has also seen a “marked increase” in the number of enquiries from young persons charged with being debtors turned runners. This refers to individuals who cannot secure a credit line with a bank and so turn to online advertisements promising easy cash for a work-from-home opportunity, which can turn out to be “bait advertisements” for unlicensed moneylenders offering quick loans, said the former prosecutor. “Subsequently when it is time to repay and the borrower can’t keep up with payments, these unlicensed moneylenders will sometimes use these younger borrowers as their runners to harass some of their bigger clients,” he added. The authorities said that they are monitoring the evolving landscape of unlicensed moneylending, and are working with various stakeholders to address new methods of harassment. Senior Investigation Officer of the Criminal Investigation Department’s Unlicensed Moneylending Strike Force, Inspector Ong Tiam Huat, highlighted a February 2024 case where a woman was charged in court for using her TikTok account to promote and advertise an illegal moneylending business. “The police work closely with all the relevant stakeholders, including social media platforms to tackle the online unlicensed moneylending activities, and we’ll continue to take tough enforcement action against those involved in loansharking activities,” he added. While the evolution of the unlicensed moneylending space to the digital realm has made tracking the perpetrators and syndicates more difficult, officer-in-charge of the Criminal Investigation Department’s Unlicensed Moneylending Strike Force, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Alvin Li, said the police go through training to understand how these platforms work and the measures needed to curb criminal activity. With the strict laws and enforcement here, unlicensed moneylending syndicates have “shifted overseas” and syndicate members maintain a “high level of secrecy”, DSP Li said. “It makes it challenging, or even impossible for us to uncover their identities. Witnesses fear reprisal to themselves and family members should the syndicate members come to know that they provided information to the authorities,” he added, stating that some witnesses can turn “hostile” and refuse to cooperate with police investigations. He shared an example of a “towkay”, or financier of an overseas unlicensed moneylender syndicate, who operated “behind the scenes” and was dealt with under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act in 2019 after the police tracked the syndicate for over three years. The Act is a decades-long law that allows the detention of people linked to certain criminal activities, including secret societies and unlicensed moneylending, without trial. DSP Li said this syndicate was linked to over 1,800 reported cases of harassment here, but prosecution of the man was “not viable” as borrowers were unable to identify him and syndicate members were afraid of testifying against him. “We had to work with foreign law enforcement agencies to locate him and process his coordination back to Singapore,” said DSP Li. “The unlicensed moneylending syndicates will continue to evolve and exploit the easiest ways to harass borrowers and their families. They will stop at nothing. We will continue to monitor the trend, the tactics, and work with the various stakeholders to disrupt their activities, and identify and prosecute these offenders.” In terms of public education efforts, the police also conduct anti-unlicensed money lending talks during outreach efforts to “vulnerable groups” such as migrant workers, students and volunteers from non-governmental organisations, said Insp Ong. During school engagements, the authorities will highlight the seriousness of getting involved with unlicensed moneylending activities and the consequences by law of engaging in such actions. The authorities also engage with young offenders' parents during the course of investigations, and refer them to other resources such as counsellors through the Ministry of Social and Family Development, said ASP Ho of Bedok Police Division. \"We will talk to parents and try to understand more. Let's say if the youth is rebellious or always asking their parents for money, through talking to parents we will ... see how to help them and refer them to the appropriate resources for the future.\" Despite the well-documented horror stories about victims of loan sharks, illegal moneylenders will continue to exist in some form simply because there is demand for them, said experts. Associate Professor of Sociology Alwyn Lim from SMU said: “Illegal money lending indicates to us that in this society, there is much more of a demand for liquidity than actually exists, that is, things seem to need a lot of money. “As long as the demand for liquidity exceeds the supply, there will be an illegal industry that forms around it. If our society wants to tackle that, we have to get to the roots of what is causing that.” Mr Josephus Tan, managing director of Invictus Law and a criminal lawyer who has represented clients as young as 14 in such cases, noted that many of his cases were done pro bono for the “down and out” who became involved with loan sharks because of their financial or family circumstances. He recalled a case of a man who had borrowed money from loan sharks because he had no money to pay for his father’s funeral. In another case, a man with a failed small business who contracted cancer borrowed money from loan sharks to pay for his family's medical bills. To offset his debts, the loan sharks asked him to hand over his banking information to them. “People recruited by loan sharks are victims in their own right, either the young and ignorant who want to make a quick buck or those who owe the unlicensed moneylenders and are trapped in the vicious cycle (of assisting lenders),” said Mr Tan. One way to help people who are more likely to borrow from unlicensed sources is to introduce “targeted, contextualised” saving plans and financial literacy programmes for them, said Assoc Prof Razwana. She also suggested enhancing “financial inclusion” by increasing access to credit for low-income individuals, such as through microfinance and community banking initiatives. Mr Louis Chua, a Member of Parliament (MP) for Sengkang GRC, suggested that “ethical lending practices” should be encouraged, apart from raising awareness of the dangers of illicit borrowing. Strict regulations on all forms of lending, even from licensed moneylenders and banks, to prevent “exorbitant interest rates” and “highly misleading” charges should also be encouraged to protect borrowers, he added. “Beyond that, we should also establish stronger support systems for those in financial distress, offering a range of services from counselling to emergency financial assistance and even debt restructuring programmes,” said Mr Chua. Mr Lim Biow Chuan, MP for Mountbatten SMC, pointed to the various agencies that people can turn to. “Those who are from low-income backgrounds should also know that there are different available to assist them with their finances, for example, from Social Service Offices and Comcare,” he said. On the issue of young runners, Mr Melvin Yong, MP for Radin Mas SMC, said that during his time as a police officer, he had come across many cases of unlicensed money lending and saw the impact it had on those involved, including youths recruited by loan sharks. This motivated him to create the bi-annual youth engagement programme, Delta League, in 2011, to engage youths through football and keep them “meaningfully occupied” during the school holidays. While illegal moneylending may seem impossible to eradicate, the question then is whether the same can be said of harassment of borrowers. Ms James noted that as many unlicensed moneylenders may be based overseas , it has become “trickier” for local authorities to catch them. Agreeing, Mr Vaswani noted that unlicensed moneylending is a criminal enterprise that is “borderless”, as the masterminds can “easily tap” people in Singapore to conduct harassment or lending of their personal bank accounts no matter where they are based. “We need to address the root of the problem - which is why do people have to borrow from such sources in the first place? Are people doing so to feed an addiction? “Or is it to feed their family, in which case the other question to ask is, 'were there no other alternatives?' Theoretically, if you strip away the need to borrow from such sources you will slowly dismantle the unlicensed moneylending industry,” he said. Lawyers also noted that victims of loan-shark harassment are often caught in a “double bind”, given that borrowing from such lenders is also illegal. “They might fear getting in trouble themselves if they report the activity. As a result, even if they do come forward, they might be hesitant to provide the full details of the situation, hindering prosecution efforts,” said Ms James. “This lack of cooperation, stemming from a well-founded fear of violence and potential legal repercussions, makes it significantly harder to build strong cases against the lenders.” Still, lawyers said that cracking down on runners and illegal local lenders can curb the harassment problem. “Law enforcement can still put pressure on the unlicensed moneylender and their operations by taking strict action against the runners and local lenders, as well as seizing assets,” said Ms James. Mr Vaswani emphasised that the ubiquity of police cameras in housing estates has also gone a long way in the identification and tracing of suspects involved in loan shark harassment, and the freezing of bank accounts used for unlicensed moneylending activities can greatly hamper illegal moneylending operations. At the end of the day, reducing inequality is key to ending the “Ah Long” problem, said Assoc Prof Razwana. “As long as inequality exists, we will not be able to completely eradicate unlicensed money lenders. However, we could try to minimise the dependency and make it harder for them to operate.” This article was originally published in TODAY .

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Signs of pet neglect can go unnoticed by neighbours and friends, but animals can’t speak for themselves and must rely on us to help, says Aarthi Sankar of SPCA Singapore. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Imagine that you hear your neighbour’s dog whining loudly for hours on end. Or you see a pet cat caged up for days in the common corridor. What would you do - speak to your neighbour, or report it to the authorities? A significant legal precedent was set in April when a man received a 20-day jail sentence for neglecting 43 cats in a flat devoid of food and water. This was the first time a jail sentence was imposed for a conviction related to neglect, under Singapore’s Animals and Birds Act. In 2023 alone , the SPCA investigated 915 cases involving animal welfare. These cases generally fall into two broad categories: Abuse and cruelty, where there is intentional infliction of pain, suffering, or death; and neglect, characterised by a failure to provide basic needs for an animal, resulting in prolonged suffering due to inadequate living conditions. Alarmingly, more than two-thirds of the cases reported to the SPCA last year involved issues of neglect. There are many reasons why animals end up neglected. Some people lose interest in their pets; a once-beloved puppy that captivated everyone’s attention becomes a dog that no one wants to care for. Additionally, there are individuals who fail to sterilise their pets, resulting in more animals than they can manage. In other cases, psychological issues lead people to compulsively hoard pets, eventually overwhelming their ability to provide proper care. It is heartbreaking that in all these situations, the animals are the ones who suffer the most. On the surface, neglect might appear less severe than overt acts of animal cruelty, but its impacts are profoundly distressing. Neglect leads to prolonged suffering and can result in permanent harm or even death. Signs of animal neglect can go easily unnoticed since it may not always leave visible marks and animals cannot express their distress. Residents usually do not have the opportunity to enter someone else’s home to directly examine an animal's condition, making it difficult to detect when pets are not being properly cared for. To spot signs of neglect, observers should look for indications such as pets kept in cramped, unsanitary conditions typical of hoarding situations, or confined in unsuitable housing like tiny cages or left on balconies for prolonged periods. These environments fail to provide necessary space or comfort, clearly signalling neglect. Neglect may also manifest in pets lacking necessary medical attention , evident through visible untreated injuries or signs of distress, and improper weight management, where pets may appear to be underweight or overweight. Often, animal neglect can indicate broader issues within a household, such as the neglect of other dependents like children or the elderly. It can also arise from a significant shift in financial or living conditions. In other instances, a neighbour might be overwhelmed by personal challenges, such as illness or caring for a family member, which could affect their ability to care for their pet. It is not uncommon for reports to surface about animals appearing in poor condition, only to discover upon further investigation that these pets are elderly, with owners diligently managing chronic health issues as best as they can under challenging circumstances. While the instinct may be to immediately report such cases to the SPCA or authorities, there are situations where a more nuanced approach could be more beneficial. If you feel safe and comfortable, initiate a supportive conversation with your neighbour or friend. This approach can often alleviate the situation more effectively and immediately for the animal. Helping or sharing practical advice can lead to immediate and significant improvements in the animal's welfare. Sometimes, owners may sim ply lack the necessary resources or knowledge to provide proper care for their pets. When it comes to posting on social media about suspected neglect, one must consider the potential impact on the animal's welfare. While it might seem like a quick way to raise awareness and prompt action, public shaming can have several negative consequences that may ultimately make the situation worse. Public shaming can lead to increased stress and defensiveness from the pet owner. If they feel attacked or embarrassed, they may become less willing to accept help or advice, which can delay or even prevent improvements in the animal's care. However, if repeated attempts to assist or communicate with your neighbour fail, or if they respond with hostility, it becomes necessary to escalate the matter to the authorities and the SPCA. If you do decide to report a case, providing detailed information, including photographs or videos, can significantly expedite the investigation process. Although the SPCA does not have enforcement powers, we collaborate closely with authorities to gather as much evidence as possible and prioritise critical cases. Investigating animal neglect is challenging and can take a long time. The definition of \"unnecessary pain and suffering\", as outlined in the Animals and Birds Act, is often difficult to prove. Since animals can't speak for themselves, they rely on humans to intervene and help. The authorities focus on helping pet owners improve rather than punishing them immediately, usually starting with a warning or a fine. However, our responsibility towards animals goes beyond legal obligations; it is a duty rooted in kindness and empathy. When we choose to bring an animal into our lives, we must also embrace the lifelong responsibility of their care. After all, how we treat the most vulnerable among us speaks volumes about who we are as a people. Aarthi Sankar is Executive Director of SPCA Singapore.

BUKIT MERTAJAM: The increase in fares by Singapore travel agencies and tour buses, along with the busting of diesel-smuggling syndicates at the border, proves that the diesel subsidy rationalisation initiative should be continued, said Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. He added that the targeted diesel subsidies are critical to saving the country financially by stemming fund leakages caused by unscrupulous parties. \"All tour buses and travel companies from Singapore want to raise prices because they say they can't get diesel subsidies, which means for decades, our subsidies went to Singapore companies, to Thai fishing boats. A lot of funds were leaking. \"Subsidies were benefiting 3.8 million foreigners, (diesel) taken out to Thailand and sent to Thai fishing boats … Malaysian taxpayers are paying, but foreigners are reaping the benefits,\" he said at an event in Malaysia’s Penang state on Tuesday (Jun 18) Mr Anwar, who is also the country’s finance minister, noted that the number of cars produced from 2012 to 2020 was small compared to the skyrocketing increase in diesel consumption because the fuel was enjoyed by foreigners. Malaysia on Jun 10 cut most of its diesel subsidies, which the authorities said was costing the country RM4 billion (US$853) million annually. Mr Anwar had previously said the savings will then be redirected to lower-income groups.

(Photo: AFP/Peter PARKS) HONG KONG: Hong Kong matched on Friday (Jun 21) its record for the hottest summer solstice as a subtropical ridge drove temperatures up to 34 degrees Celsius. \"The maximum temperature recorded at the observatory was 34C, the highest so far this year and equalling the record high for summer solstice set in 1980,\" the city's weather observatory said. The Chinese financial hub saw its hottest summer on record last year, with the mean temperature hitting 29.7C in August. The top three warmest years in Hong Kong's history were all recorded after 2018. Scientists warn extreme heat globally will become more frequent and intense because of human-induced climate change. The observatory issued its \"very hot weather\" warning on Friday and health officials urged the public to drink plenty of water and take measures to avoid heatstroke. Authorities said they will continue to operate 19 temporary heat shelters for people to spend the night. Hong Kong has in recent years emphasised the need to protect workers from heat stress but has stopped short of enacting legal safeguards. The city does not list heatstroke as a work-related injury in its laws, and activists say government statistics undercount the number of workers who died of the illness.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Rising subscription prices are likely to lead to a rebundling of services, says Richard Waters for the Financial Times. Composite of Twitch and Spotify logos. (Photos: REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage; REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo) SAN FRANCISCO: What do the game streaming service Twitch, music app Spotify and video streamer Max all have in common? This week, they all raised prices for at least some of their subscribers, joining what has come to feel like a stampede by digital services of all kinds in 2024 to charge more . There is no mystery behind this spate of price rises. Streaming may have become the preferred business model for large parts of the media industry, but for most it has also been chronically unprofitable - particularly in the video world, where it has put a severe dent in the multichannel TV model that was long a reliable money-spinner. For now, the pricing actions have not done much to depress subscriber numbers, encouraging some companies to push through more than one round of increases. But they signal that streaming is entering a new phase, where the headlong race for user growth is over and new forces will determine which comes out on top. Spotify, founded 18 years ago, has yet to report a profitable year, while the chief executive of the 13-year-old Twitch, now a subsidiary of Amazon, also said in January that it loses money. Warner Bros Discovery, owner of Max, at least broke into the black in streaming last year, making it the first traditional media conglomerate to do so. But it made a negligible profit on more than US$10 billion of revenue. One notable thing about the higher subscription costs is that, at least until recently, most streamers chose to hold prices down in a race to attract users. Twitch, which raised the cost of its lowest subscription tier by 20 per cent, to US$5.99 a month, had never had a price increase in the United States before. After dipping their toes in the water, though, some are starting to see price increases as a repeatable tactic. Spotify kept its subscription unchanged, at US$10 a month, for more than a decade before raising it by US$1 last year. This week, it announced another US$1 , with even bigger percentage increases for family and other premium subscription plans. Spotify’s subscriber numbers have continued to rise strongly - one reason its stock price has soared fourfold since the start of last year. By 2031, Midia Research forecasts music streamers will be able to push through three more broad rounds of price increases, while also introducing new, higher-priced tiers of super-premium services. Tatiana Cirisano, senior music industry analyst at Midia, says music streaming has turned out to be a “stickier” service than many might have thought: Subscribers tend to stay not just because of a familiar brand, but because they have spent time assembling playlists, while a service’s algorithms have learnt their preferences. Higher prices are also set to usher in a new phase in the battle between digital services of all kinds. As consumers feel the pinch from paying for multiple high-priced premium services, getting a discount for buying a package of services starts to become more attractive - something that encourages the recreation of the very media bundles that standalone streaming services helped to destroy. This reflects a familiar pattern in the media business. Waves of unbundling, as old media packages are picked apart, are often followed by re-bundling. Consumers get more for a single payment - though one side-effect is that they also often end up, once again, paying for things they do not want. For media owners, meanwhile, selling a package also lowers overall customer acquisition costs and reduces churn of accounts. In video streaming, Disney has reported success with adding Hulu to its Disney+ video offering, and is planning to do the same with its ESPN+ sports service. Cross-company bundles are also in the works, with a Disney+, Hulu and Max subscription package promised for later this year. As these new media bundles start to form, new competitors will loom large. Amazon’s Prime, which combines video with free ecommerce deliveries, and Apple One, which includes six of the iPhone maker’s services, including iCloud storage, have shown Big Tech’s willingness to experiment with unconventional offerings that traditional media companies cannot match. Google has also included access to its latest AI models for some subscribers, though it has not gone as far in bundling all its subscription services together. The potential of these tech groups to combine many different types of services and to up-sell to their billions of users are likely to make them formidable competitors in the next phase of the streaming wars.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary The price of gold is inextricably linked to world events and the overall economic climate, says OCBC’s Christopher Wong. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Type “gold” into your search engine browser and you will see headlines shouting about the precious metal’s amazing rally in past months. Since October 2023, gold has been on a roll, hitting an all-time high of US$2,450 per ounce on May 20. As of Jun 6, gold was trading at around US$ 2,373 per ounce, quite a bit more than the previous record price of US$2,075 an ounce set in August 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic boosted demand. Consumers are buying into the hype. In China, online merchants are selling “gold beans” shaped like peanuts and fruit, at the price of US$90 apiece. In Korean convenience stores, you can buy tiny gold bars no larger than your fingernail. A 1.87g bar goes for US$170. Now, the serious investor is not going to be tempted by such knick-knacks. The outlook on gold remains constructive: Central banks have started to ease monetary policies, albeit at different paces, and gold maintains its role as a portfolio diversifier. However, it is prudent to also consider the pros and cons of gold as an investment, given that the yellow metal has risen so quickly and that it generates no yield. Reasons for gold’s rally can be broken down into what I call the three Gs. First, geopolitics. When geopolitical tensions rise, the natural response is for investors to trend towards gold, long considered to be a safe-haven asset. Gold’s recent surge has been driven by a re-escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine. The United States presidential elections in November may push the price of gold higher. Should Donald Trump become president again for a second term, he could start a new trade war with China; he recently spoke about plans of imposing tariffs of 60 per cent or higher on China goods. Let us not forget that in 2018 and 2019 when the US-China trade war started and escalated, gold prices also rose significantly. Second, global easing. One of the key drivers behind the positive outlook for gold is the anticipation of a global easing cycle. Central banks worldwide, including those in Brazil, Canada, Europe, Sweden and Switzerland, have already initiated rate cuts. The US Federal Reserve is likely to follow suit in the coming months of this year. The prospect for global central banks to enter an era of easing is expected to support gold prices. Historical evidence dating back to 2001 has shown that gold prices strengthen when US Fed rate hike cycles end. If history is a guide, then gold may still have further room to run higher when the actual rate-cut cycle starts. Third, gold buying spree by central banks. Central banks continue to purchase gold at a record pace - an estimated 1,082 tonnes of gold in 2022, and 1,037 tonnes in 2023. The momentum has continued into 2024, with China leading the pack. On a country level, China has added 225 tonnes to its reserves in 2023. April 2024 also marks the 18th consecutive month it has added gold to its coffers. Gold remains attractive to central banks due to its performance during times of crisis and the fact it is an effective portfolio diversifier and highly liquid asset. While the outlook for gold may be constructive, that is not to say that gold is immune to the fluctuations of a typical asset. It can be affected by market sentiments, monetary policy, economic data and more. Gold prices can face downside pressure in the event that the Fed delays its rate cut cycle, if it unexpectedly tightens or if there is a sharp de-escalation in geopolitical tensions. The price of gold is inextricably linked to world events and the overall economic climate. There are pros and cons to consider before deciding if it has a place in your portfolio. The first advantage of gold is that it is a stable store of value. Since 2001, gold has outperformed most currencies on average terms each calendar year. Looking at the research to date, the annualised average rate of return of gold was 9.7 per cent since 2001. The only periods when gold dramatically underperformed were when the Fed signalled it would taper quantitative easing policies or hike rates . The second advantage is that gold is seen as a steady asset in uncertain times. This is true over crisis periods when returns have largely been positive, even if returns have varied across crisis episodes. When one examines the major crises over the past 20 years, one can see that gold prices have remained relatively stable as opposed to the stock market, which can experience significant declines. The price of gold surged during the global financial crisis in 2007 to 2008, for instance, even as the stock markets plummeted. Of course, past performance is never necessarily indicative of future results, and some may argue this comparison is overly generalised. One must also consider the overall economic climate and investor sentiment will influence gold prices, not just specific crises. Spreading investments across different assets like stocks, bonds and gold helps one reduce overall portfolio risk; if one asset class performs poorly, then others may offset those losses. Still, there are cons when it comes to holding gold. Consider that gold’s price appreciation tends to be slower than say, that of stocks. You might not see substantial returns on your investment. Unlike bonds and stocks, gold does not generate income like yield or dividends. Returns from gold depend entirely on a price increase at the time you decide to - or need to - sell what you’re holding, and gold prices can and do fluctuate significantly at times. Gold is a physical asset, and so one incurs annual storage fees at professional vaults. There are security risks if you decide to store gold at home. There is a certain opportunity cost, too, when it comes to the liquidity of gold. While it is more liquid than some other investments, selling large quantities of gold quickly can be challenging, especially during downturns. Ultimately, gold may not be a suitable investment for all investors despite its glittering appeal. As with all investments, each investor has to consider their individual risk tolerance, investment goals and overall portfolio before making a foray into gold.

    "article_content": "Asia Asia Some Indonesians are making a living catching and drying house lizards for China’s traditional medicine industry. While the mosquito-munching reptiles are believed to be abundant, NGOs say more data is needed on the volumes being harvested and traded. Indonesian villager Dody Hermawan has been hunting lizards for the past 12 years. (Photo: CNA/Danang Wisanggeni) This audio is generated by an AI tool. CIREBON, West Java: Armed with headlamps, pails and thin wooden sticks, Mr Dody Hermawan and his colleagues embark on a mission most nights around the villages of West and Central Java. As they move from house to house, they are typically met by residents glad to be rid of a source of annoyance. Mr Dody, 42, and his colleagues are house lizard hunters. Using sticks about two metres long with glue applied at the tip, they nimbly stab the reptiles, then gently remove them from the stick and place them in the buckets. On a good night, each hunter could catch about 400 lizards in eight hours – double the usual amount – especially if it has just rained and there are more insects for the lizards to feast on. “It all started when my older brother gave me the task of finding house lizards because he sold them,” said Mr Dody, who started the job about 12 years ago. “Initially, nobody wanted to go lizard hunting as people did not believe it could make money.” Mr Dody proved that it could. He caught about 100 lizards per night in his first few days and sold them for IDR150,000 (US$9) to his brother, who then sold them to a businessman exporting them to China for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) purposes. The amount was quite significant at the time, as the cost of living in his village of Kertasura, in West Java’s Cirebon regency, was low compared to cities like Jakarta or Bandung. As more people noticed him going about his work and saw that lizards were in demand, “slowly they started to join”, said Mr Dody. Now, dozens among the 9,000 people in his village help hunt and process the lizards for export. Also known as the common or Asian house gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus), or rumah cicak Asia in Bahasa Indonesia, the lizards are believed to still be abundant, according to a herpetologist and hunters CNA interviewed. The house lizard is not the only gecko species used for traditional medicine, and the Indonesian government has set quotas for various species. This year, the catch quota for Asian house geckos is about 2.5 million. The catch quota for the flat-tailed house gecko (Hemidactylus platyurus) is also about 2.5 million, while that for the four-clawed gecko (Gehyra mutilata) is about 2 million. They can be caught as pets or for consumption, said Dr Satyawan Pudyatmoko, director general of natural resources and ecosystem conservation at the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. The three species are allowed to be hunted in the provinces of West Java, Central Java, East Java and Yogyakarta as they have been deemed potential regions of export, said Dr Satyawan. He said there are more than five export permit holders who work with small enterprises and hunters in villages. “The people in villages help with catching, collecting, sorting (the lizards) according to the size, drying and, finally, packing,” said Dr Satyawan. “These activities can be a main or additional source of income.” The environment ministry did not provide information on export quotas and actual export volumes. In the past, actual exports have been found to exceed quotas for certain species such as the Tokay gecko. From 2013 to 2019, over 79.5 million Tokay geckos were exported by Indonesia based on the Ministry of Trade’s data, vastly exceeding harvest quotas at the time, according to a report last year by Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. In addition, only about 1.7 million legal export permits were reported by the environment ministry from 2013 to 2019. The disparity was because exporters were not required to obtain a permit from the environment ministry at the time. In 2019, the Tokay gecko was added to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora for controls to be placed on its trade. China is a major importer of Tokay geckos, which are thought to be effective in suppressing asthma, relieving coughing and treating diabetes and other ailments. Professor Mirza Kusrini, a herpetologist or expert on reptiles and amphibians from Bogor’s Institute of Agriculture, believes house lizards remain abundant. The creatures, native to a large part of Asia from south India to Indonesia, have thrived in urban areas and feed on insects and spiders. They start reproducing from the age of about six months to a year, and live for about five years. Females lay two eggs per clutch. Professor Mirza believes house lizards are unlikely to be overhunted because the animals’ physical size has not changed. When a particular animal is overhunted, the remaining population is smaller as fewer mature members are left, she explained. Hunters are also catching the lizards manually instead of using industrial methods, she noted. Wildlife advocacy groups, however, caution that more information is needed. House lizards are not currently protected by law and international trade of the animals may not be regulated, said Ms Kanitha Krishnasamy, Southeast Asia director of wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC. “But a surge in large-scale collection of any wild species could be a potential cause for conservation concern,” she said. “Certainly more needs to be done to understand the volumes being harvested and traded, why they are sought after, and how this affects wild populations and the ecosystem.” Mr Wahyudin Iwang, executive director of environmental group Walhi’s West Java chapter, said lizard hunting and trade would “negatively impact the ecosystem and habitat”. In villages like Kertasura, the lizards have provided a source of income and given rise to small enterprises. The hunters in Cirebon head out in convoys most evenings to various regencies in West Java and even Central Java. The convoys consist of up to 16 people – when CNA visited last month, a group of eight went to Pemalang in Central Java to hunt. It takes a few weeks of continuous practice to become skilled in finding the lizards and stabbing them before they can scurry away, according to Mr Dody. To keep operations simple and efficient, the hunters would usually not remain in the same village for consecutive nights. It is also harder to catch lizards when the weather is drier, he said. During such periods, some hunters may turn to catching snakes or doing other odd jobs. Lizard catching has also become more competitive, said another hunter Mr Rosulun. Hunters get about IDR42,000 per kilogramme of lizards they catch and Mr Rosulun said he now earns about IDR150,000 a night, less than a few years ago when he could net about IDR200,000. If the 52-year-old works 20 days a month, he is still able to earn about IDR3 million, slightly above the minimum wage of IDR2.5 million in Cirebon. Mr Rosulun and Mr Dody sell their catch to the latter’s niece Ita Purwita, 27, who employs fellow villagers to clean, dry and pack the lizards. Most of the cleaners and packers Ms Ita employs have primary or secondary school education. One of them, Ms Murwanti, 51, enjoys the work and is not squeamish about it. “I really like the job because there’s freedom. There’s a TV here, wifi. We can also turn on the music. What’s there to complain about?” said Ms Murwanti, who has worked with Ms Ita for about four years and earns up to IDR100,000 a day. Another villager, 48-year-old Mdm Khasanah, has cleaned lizards for about 10 years and previously worked for Ms Ita’s mother, who ran a reptile business that included processing snakes. “Those who work in the snake business are mostly men because snakes can bite,” said Mdm Khasanah who, like Ms Murwanti, goes by one name. “But house lizards don’t. We only need to clean, dry and put them in the oven. Easy.” Ms Ita used to have a business selling noni fruit, but availability of the fruit was more dependent on the weather. So, she sought her parents’ permission to take over their business. “Even though the income (from lizards) also fluctuates, the commodity never runs out,” she said. While it can be challenging to find lizards of good quality with their tail and all body parts intact, which affects the price buyers pay, she is able to make about IDR5 million a month. Ms Ita sells the dried lizards to her uncle Mr Asep Saifudin – Mr Dody’s brother – who then exports them. His brother earns significantly more as an exporter but Mr Dody says he prefers to focus on hunting lizards as he does not have a knack for business. “After all, I am the lizard hunter pioneer here. That’s not too bad,” he said.

    "article_content": "Business Business DOHA : Nvidia has signed a deal to deploy its artificial intelligence technology at data centres owned by Qatari telecoms group Ooredoo in five Middle Eastern countries, Ooredoo's CEO told Reuters. The agreement marks Nvidia's first large-scale launch in a region to which Washington has curbed the export of sophisticated U.S. chips to stop Chinese firms from using Middle Eastern countries as a back door to access the newest AI technology. It will make Ooredoo the first company in the region able to give clients of its data centers in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait and the Maldives direct access to Nvidia's AI and graphics processing technology, Ooredoo said in a statement. Providing the technology will allow Ooredoo to better help its customers deploy generative AI applications, Nvidia's senior vice president of telecom Ronnie Vasishta said. \"Our b2b clients, thanks to this agreement, will have access to services that probably their competitors (won't) for another 18 to 24 months,\" Ooredoo's CEO Aziz Aluthman Fakhroo told Reuters in an interview. The companies did not disclose the value of the deal, which was signed on the sidelines of the TM Forum in Copenhagen on June 19. Ooredoo also would not disclose exactly what type of Nvidia technology it will be installing in its data centres, saying that it depends on availability and customer demand. Washington allows the export of some Nvidia technology to the Middle East, but curbs exports of the company's most sophisticated chips. Ooredoo is investing $1 billion to boost its regional data centre capacity by 20-25 additional megawatts on top of the 40 megawatts it currently has, and plans to almost triple that by the end of the decade, Fakhroo said. The company has carved out its data centers into a separate company following a similar move last year to create the Middle East's largest tower company in a deal with Kuwait's Zain and Dubai's TASC Towers Holding. Ooredoo also has plans to carve out its undersea cables and fiber network into a separate entity, Fakhroo said.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore It used to be the go-to place for youths to hang out in the 2000s, but Cineleisure Orchard fell out of fashion and now has many vacant units. CNA speaks to tenants and shoppers to chart the rise and fall of the once-popular mall on Orchard Road, and to find out if it can regain its popularity. In its heyday, Cineleisure was a vibrant location with shoppers, mostly youths, hanging out until late at night. (Photo: CNA/Tang See Kit) SINGAPORE: When F&B business owner Daniel Tan decided to take up a shop space at Cineleisure Orchard earlier this year, he was not unaware of the “bad publicity” surrounding the shopping mall. The once-popular mall had come under the spotlight for dismal sights of boarded-up shopfronts and empty stores. On online forum Reddit, a post titled “What happened to Cineleisure?” garnered more than 100 comments as users reminisced about the mall’s heyday as a popular spot for youths in the 2000s. More recently, the mall’s search for new tenants was mentioned by Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan, as part of an update on the authorities’ rejuvenation plan for Orchard Road. But for Mr Tan, the director of Ah Chew Desserts Cineleisure, setting up shop at the shopping mall still made business sense given a central location that would help it to expand into the tourist market. The rent was also “slightly lower” than other malls along Orchard Road. So far, the move seems to be paying off. Since it opened on Mar 31, business on weekends has been comparable to its former location at Novena. While weekdays remain “relatively quiet”, Mr Tan is optimistic and believes that will change soon with the addition of new F&B tenants. The ongoing revamp of neighbouring *SCAPE , when completed by early 2024, will also add to the appeal of the area, he added. “I think we can throw all the recent bad publicity away,” Mr Tan told CNA. “The crowds will be back.” That is the hope of other tenants at Cineleisure too following years of slow business. “To be honest, business has not been the best since opening (in 2020), especially in recent times where the mall has been deemed ‘dead’ by many media articles and netizens,” said Mr Rodney Sim, group commercial manager of restaurant-bar GudSht. “The overall footfall at Cineleisure has been quite low, compared to other popular malls within the vicinity.” The entry of Ah Chew Desserts has helped, said Mr Sim and three other businesses that this reporter spoke to separately. Footfall at the mall appears to have got another boost with the opening of fast-food giant McDonald’s two weeks ago. When CNA visited Cineleisure at around noon on May 30, the near 100-seater fast food restaurant was bustling with a consistent stream of patrons. This was in contrast with the quiet sight in the shopping mall that CNA observed at lunchtime during a visit on May 3. That said, much of this increased footfall remains concentrated on the ground level for now, with businesses on the higher floors yet to feel a boost. “It’s still too early to say if things are getting better,” said Mr Trazo Marsouvinie who works at mobile phone accessories shop Beadstreet on Level 2. Having worked at Cineleisure for a decade, Mr Trazo has seen the mall in its heyday as a vibrant location with shoppers, mostly youths, hanging out till late at night. “Those days were very enjoyable. The atmosphere was always great with all the people,” he recalled. Back then, business was brisk given the mall’s proximity to telco operators and mobile phone retailers nearby. “When people get their new phones, they come here to get their accessories,” said the 35-year-old sales representative. “Now, the crowd is less and people don’t stay very late anymore.” Sales have since halved. And with the absence of crowds, Beadstreet – the longest-running tenant at Cineleisure currently – has brought forward its closing time. “Last time, we closed at 11pm or 12am on weekends. But now, we close at 9pm every day,” Mr Trazo said. Beadstreet is one of the three remaining retail shops in the mall. The other two, also located on Level 2, are menswear label Benjamin Barker and streetwear fashion store Exit. With a restaurant serving up Hainanese food and a tufting art and craft shop making up the numbers of businesses on Level 2, nearly half of the units there were last seen boarded up. Elsewhere, the cinema, which used to take up Level 4 to 6, currently operates only on Level 5 and 6. Levels 4 and 8 are vacant, with “Temporary closed” stickers pasted over the lift buttons for these floors. Level 9 is taken up by indoor trampoline park Bounce Singapore, while Level 3 is home to several fitness studios and hair salons. Down in the basement, which used to have a food court and a variety of F&B offerings, only sushi and salad chain Maki-San is open for business now. The transformation of Cineleisure from popular mall to a comparative ghost town has been years in the making, according to those that CNA spoke to. “Even before the pandemic, there were already a lot of shops closing. The (crowd) also started to slow down,” said Mr Trazo. Competition from newer and revamped malls along Orchard Road may have been one reason. The prime shopping strip welcomed several new malls in 2009, such as ION Orchard, Orchard Central and 313@Somerset. Mandarin Gallery, which is located next to Cineleisure, also went through a S$200 million facelift before reopening in 2010. Being located slightly off the main Orchard Road has made it hard for Cineleisure to compete for shoppers. The mall also does not benefit from connections with other shopping malls. “It is a case of out of sight, out of mind,” said Associate Professor Ang Swee Hoon from the Department of Marketing at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School. At the same time, Cineleisure was losing its sweet spot. “With so many shopping malls to go to, there has to be something distinctively relevant to shoppers for them to want to go to Cineleisure,” added Assoc Prof Ang. “That sweet spot, unfortunately, is missing.” Millennials who witnessed Cineleisure during its peak in the late 1990s to the early 2010s described the mall as having everything under one roof, ranging from budget-friendly fast-food chains and a cinema, to a variety of streetwear and accessories shops that appealed to the younger crowd. Mr Darren Foo, 34, recalled spending hours at the mall every weekend with his friends. “We always came here for movies, to eat, to shop. I used to buy all my shoes here,” he said. “We could be here from like 2pm to 10pm. In between, maybe we’d go to Spinelli which was nearby at HMV Heeren.” Cineleisure was also home to a LAN gaming shop, an arcade, shops filled with Neoprint machines to take instant photos and a karaoke chain at one point. In addition, it was the go-to spot for events, ranging from celebrity autograph sessions to auditions for the Singapore Idol singing contest, which never failed to attract large crowds. “There were a lot of fun things to do, and you wouldn’t get bored,” said Mr Darren Yang, owner of fashion store Exit, who recalled spending his teenage days at the mall with friends. “It was like a collection of all the cool stuff for the young people.” But that cool factor faded as tenants made their exits. Gaming shop E2Max, for one, ceased operations at the end of 2015. On its part, Cineleisure went through a facelift in 2019 and announced several new tenants, such as indoor playground operator Amazing Castle which was making its debut in Singapore. However, that did not seem enough to attract shoppers, especially the young, whose preferences for shopping and leisure activities may have changed amid the rise of e-commerce and mobile games, some shoppers and tenants told CNA. At the same time, the cinema business – a key driver of footfall at the mall – was facing stiff competition. By 2019, the number of screens and seats operated by exhibitors in Singapore had ballooned to all-time highs. But the number of cinema-goers was falling with the arrival of online streaming services . Then COVID-19 struck in early-2020, dealing a huge blow to the retail industry. More tenants at Cineleisure pulled down their shutters, including long-time tenant and popular sneakers store Leftfoot which has since relocated to nearby Mandarin Gallery. The mall did attract some new tenants during the pandemic, such as WeTuft, Exit and GudSht which cited reasons such as favourable rents, the mall’s central location and past success. For example, setting up in Cineleisure “just felt right” for GudSht as the F&B brand is targeting the “80s and 90s kids” who used to hang out at the mall, said Mr Sim. For Mr Yang, setting up shop in Cineleisure had an additional “full-circle moment”. “When we were young, this was the hot place to be,” he told CNA. “I always came here with my friends so this place holds some memories for me.” “In fact, our first unit is one of the stores we went to a lot during secondary school days. We even have old photos of ourselves in the store which used to sell graphic tees,” said the entrepreneur. But while business owners still see value in having a presence in Cineleisure, shoppers were no longer enticed to hang out at the mall. Mr Foo, for one, heads off immediately after his session at a gym on Level 3. Gesturing to the stretch of storefronts being boarded up, he said: “There’s nothing to see now.” Some of these hoardings will be coming off, as a handful of new tenants start operations this month. Art supplies store Overjoyed will open in the basement on Jun 10, according to its manager who was in the middle of tidying up the unit when CNA visited earlier this week. Meanwhile, hoardings in other parts of the basement show confirmed names of tenants – sushi and yakitori restaurant Shujin and Taiwan Night Market which will be modelled after Taiwan’s famous Shilin and RaoHe night markets. These two F&B tenants are set to open this month as well, according to a spokesperson from Cineleisure. The fate of the empty units on Level 2 and 4 remain unknown for now, with some covered up by plain white hoardings while others display contact details for leasing inquiries. Renovations appear to be underway at Level 8, which has a “Do not enter” sign displayed prominently near the lift lobby. The mall’s spokesperson told CNA that there are further plans “to unveil new tenants presenting unique concepts” in the third quarter. “Located in the youth-centric Somerset precinct, Cineleisure has always been the ‘headquarters of youths’. In our quest to continue providing unparalleled lifestyle experiences for the young and young at heart, Cineleisure will offer a vibrant gourmetainment experience around the clock,” it added. Experts said more can be done. Currently on the list of upcoming openings, the Taiwanese night market-style food place stands out as the most interesting but its appeal remains to be seen. “(It will be) a way forward if there are enough shoppers who crave for such food, and remain craving for them,” said NUS’ Assoc Prof Ang. Beyond F&B, Cineleisure needs to spruce up its mix of retailers. Overall, it needs unique tenants that complement each other to provide shoppers with “a holistic and targeted experience”, said Ms Lim Xiu Ru, a lecturer at the Singapore Polytechnic’s School of Business. Shoppers and tenants are also hoping for other improvements. Those that work at the mall say there are still crowds on weekends. However, Level 2 is usually quiet as most visitors prefer to take the lifts straight to their destinations, such as the cinema and the fitness studios on the higher floors. One reason is the mall’s layout on Level 2, which requires shoppers to walk the entire level before getting to the next set of escalators. While the design came with good intentions to direct footfall to the stores, tenants and shoppers said adjustments can be made now that the level has largely emptied out. “This has been around for a long time but it wasn’t that bad previously when there were shops around. Now it’s just walking through a very long and boring corridor,” said Ms Jessica Lim who was at Cineleisure for a yoga class. “It’s doing more bad than good,” said Mr Wong who runs WeTuft, noting that this has resulted in long queues for the lifts. Being located at the far end of Level 2, WeTuft has received feedback from customers “about the long walk” to get to its studio. “This needs to change,” Mr Wong added. Meanwhile, others hope there can be events or activities to drive footfall. “Our biggest concerns are whether the footfall will continue to be this low,” said Mr Sim. “We hope to see more in-mall events that Cineleisure used to do in the past to draw crowds in and liven things up.” But most importantly, the once-popular mall needs to figure out a new niche for itself along the country’s premier shopping belt, said Ms Lim. The polytechnic lecturer suggested breaking away from Cineleisure’s long-standing image as a place for young people, given “a limited addressable market” amid falling fertility rates. Younger consumers also have varied niche interests these days. “Mall operators, which seek to serve a growing segment and/or focus on trends that provide sufficient opportunity to grow, will do better,” she said. One possibility is to tap into “the element of nostalgia” by targeting older millennials who frequented the mall during their adolescence and still hold fond memories of the place. Another is to double down on attracting fitness enthusiasts who now form a key group of the mall’s visitors. This can be done by revamping and curating Cineleisure’s tenant mix and offerings around health, fitness and leisure, Ms Lim said. While a cinema remains important, experts said it should no longer be depended on solely to pull in the crowds. “If Cineleisure offers the same movies as in other cinemas, then it begs the question ‘Why watch at Cineleisure?’” said Assoc Prof Ang. The cinema operator could look to satisfy potential gaps in the market by screening non-mainstream films, although it will still have to contend with the stiff competition from at-home streaming. “The movie industry is no longer like what it was during its heyday,” she said. Cathay Cineplex, owned by listed-entertainment firm mm2 Asia which acquired all of Cathay’s cinema business in Singapore in 2017, declined to comment for this story. For now, the older tenants are holding out. “Hope things will pick up soon when the new F&B shops open,” said Mr Trazo. “If not, it’s very hard for us to sustain already and it will be a pity because we have been here for so long.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Analysts had differing views on whether prices in the private and public property markets are diverging and if this can lead to more inequality. Condominiums in Singapore. (File photo: CNA/Syamil Sapari) SINGAPORE: Ms Chen and her husband, who live in a 3-room flat, hope to move to a condominium with dog-friendly facilities and gated walking areas in about five years’ time. The 29-year-old professional and her husband bought a resale flat last year as they were not willing to wait four to five years for a Build-To Order (BTO) unit. However, the couple don’t think they can bank on using the profit from selling their flat to finance a new home. Amid high private property prices, she wonders if their upgrading plans will work out as they’re not sure what the situation will be when the five-year minimum occupation period (MOP) for their Housing & Development Board (HDB) flat is up. “A lot can change in five years … historically, prices of private houses have only increased, not decreased. Supply, that is land, is finite but demand doesn’t have a ceiling,” she said. “No one’s certain of where prices will be in five years.” While flash estimates show private property prices dipping in the second quarter of 2023 by 0.4 per cent, they are still at an all-time high, having risen about 28 per cent in the past three years. In particular, new launch condo prices have risen substantially higher than resale units. A common measure to assess housing affordability is the ratio of the median or average home price to median household income - which reflects how many years it takes to purchase a home if one saves one’s entire income. A 2023 Urban Land Institute (ULI) study comparing housing prices in the region found that the median private home price in Singapore was 13.7 times the median household income. The same ratio for HDB flats was 4.7. Dr Lee Kwan Ok, a researcher who contributed to the study, said that housing is usually considered not attainable and unaffordable in a city if the ratio goes beyond five. “Therefore, HDB (4.7) is quite attainable while private housing (13.7) is not,” said the deputy head at the Department of Real Estate at NUS Business School. “It is true that public housing is more attainable in Singapore compared to other Asian global cities. But, it is questionable if private housing is more attainable.” Data from the study show that private homes in Singapore are the most expensive in the region, but the nation’s high median income means that housing affordability is in the middle of the pack compared to many other cities. Dr Lee noted that compared with many other global cities, Singapore private housing “does not do too bad”, as the housing-to-income multiple is much higher in other Asian cities: 29.3 in Beijing, 35 in Shenzhen, 26.5 in Hong Kong, 17.8 in Tokyo and 17.3 in Seoul. In Singapore, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Private Property Index for non-landed property, which reflects the price of condominiums, has risen substantially over the last decade, but so have household incomes. In 2022, the median household income was S$10,099, a 33 per cent rise from S$7,566 in 2012. In the same period, the median condo price rose from S$1.07 million to S$1.59 million. An analysis of median private housing prices in Singapore compared with median household income shows that the ratio fell from 11.73 in 2012 to 10.87 in 2015, then slowly rose to 13.14 in 2022. But this masks the different trends for new launch and resale condominiums. According to the 99-SRX price index for resale HDB and private housing, property prices have been growing below median income over the last 10 years, but new private housing prices have outpaced income. “Where median income increased around 39 per cent in the in the last 10 years, resale condos increased 32 per cent while new sale condos increased 74 per cent,” said Mr Luqman Hakim, chief data & analytics officer at 99.co. Data from the URA analysed by OrangeTee & Tie Research & Analytics show that the median price of a new launch condo was S$1.95 million last year, about half a million dollars more than the median price of a resale condo, which was S$1.39 million. Comparing this with household income data, the housing affordability ratio for new launch condominiums has risen substantially in the last five years, from 10.84 to 16.06 - meaning that it now takes about 16 years of income for an average household to afford a median new launch unit. Conversely, it has stayed flat for resale condos at about 11 to 12 times median income. HDB resale flats have remained affordable in the last decade, as the ratio has remained under five. And while private housing is above the affordability threshold, it should be noted that private housing accommodates less than 30 per cent of Singapore's population, meaning that it was never affordable for the median income, and arguably not meant to be. At S$1.6 million, the median condominium unit is affordable for a couple with a combined income of about S$10,500, based on the 99.co affordability calculator. This assumes the hypothetical couple can take a housing loan of up to S$1.2 million, or 75 per cent of the value of the property, for 30 years at 4 per cent interest. They must also have set aside funds for a down payment, legal fees and other expenses. Of course, this does not take into account that many middle-income families have car loans and many other household expenses. It also assumes that they don't have a first property, and won't incur the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD). But this simplistic example shows that private property can be attainable for about 40 per cent of income earners in Singapore - provided their other financial commitments are minimal. A more realistic estimate would be that it is available to the top 30 per cent of households by income. For those whose household incomes are just above the median income of S$10,099, executive condominiums are another option. ECs have one other advantage - there’s no need to pay the ABSD upfront. “We still see good value and reasonable price points in some new sale and resale condominium projects, including ECs, that are attainable for households that generally have joint incomes of S$12,000 and above,” said Mr Luqman. New launch condos are another story, as their prices have jumped since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the median price of new launch condos closer to S$2 million. Median psf price for new launches also crossed the S$2,000 mark last year. But it's well known that condo launches are often full of interested buyers, with thousands thronging showflats for popular developments on weekends. Grand Dunman, dubbed a \"mega launch\" as it is the only development with more than 1,000 units this year, attracted about 10,000 people on the first weekend of preview, Huttons estimated. And they're not just there to browse, as recent condominium launches have clocked impressive sales, even amid high interest rates and an uncertain economic outlook. Grand Dunman, which is on the city fringe and a short walk from the Dakota MRT station, sold more than 520 units on its launch weekend. Other launches in the first quarter of 2023, such as Tembusu Grand, also did well, selling 53 per cent, or 340 of its 638 units, during its launch in early April at an average selling price of S$2,465 per sq ft. Mr Leonard Tay, head of research at Knight Frank Singapore, said the robust demand for new homes has been fueled by the \"continued aspirations\" of Singaporeans who grew up in an era of \"steadily improving affluence\" and have the resources to purchase these new homes, said Mr Tay. Who are these buyers? Reports from property firms after each launch indicate that the majority of buyers are first-time Singaporean property buyers. Mr Luqman said that he’s noticed in recent five years that purchasers of new private residential projects are already staying in private property. “The trend was different prior to that where purchasers of such properties are likely upgraders from HDB,” he said. He thinks that profits from the sale of current private property to purchase a new launch plus growing incomes likely contribute to the large crowds seen in new launch showrooms in spite of a substantial increase in prices. The Business Times reported on May 28 that the Reserve Residences in Upper Bukit Timah sold the majority of units (520 out of the 635 units released) at an average price of S$2,460 per sq ft. The report mentioned that those aged between 31 and 40 made up 41 per cent of all buyers, but it also attracted those between 21 and 30 years of age, which comprised 22 per cent of buyers. Mr Luqman said that anecdotally there are more millennial households at new condo launches. Analysts said this younger crowd could have higher disposable income, and/or have some help from their family. “These households typically have dual incomes and smaller family sizes, something which is less common comparing to previous generations, leading to higher disposable incomes which can be used for financing their properties,” said Mr Luqman. Meanwhile, some analysts think they could have got a leg-up from asset-rich parents. Mr Tay said that household income is one indicator housing affordability, but is not the only source of household capital. \"At least two generations of Singaporeans have benefitted from asset appreciation from developing to developed nation status in the last 50 years,\" he said. \"The savings amassed largely by the baby boomers and in part by Generation X might also have been redeployed to fund their children’s private home aspirations in recent years.\" He added that families upgrading from HDB flats bought through the BTO process would also be able to use the profits from the sale after the five-year MOP to make the transition into the private market. “Historically, a family's ascension up the property ladder was not as closely tied to the assets of their parents. But we've seen this connection strengthen over time,” said Dr Lee Nai Jia, head of real estate intelligence at PropertyGuru. Given that HDB flats - which house 78 per cent of the Singapore population - remain affordable to most Singaporeans, what is the significance of having some of the most expensive private residential real estate in Asia? After all, Singapore has one of the highest home ownership rates in the world. If condominium price increases are much faster and greater than HDB price appreciation, some potential buyers will choose to invest in private condos, said Dr Lee Kwan Ok. As a result, the markets will diverge further and this may lead to unequal financial outcomes among households. Dr Lee Nai Jia thinks that the quest for property isn't solely a matter of securing a roof over one's head. A potential consequence of two diverging housing markets is the deepening divide within society, particularly between asset-rich parents and those without such advantages, he said. “It's intrinsically tied to the aspiration of social mobility … Therefore, we need to rethink housing solutions that don't just address affordability, but also foster a healthy social fabric and personal development,” he said. “Such an economic chasm poses a threat to societal stability. This is precisely why the government's strategic emphasis has been directed towards preserving our social contract and prioritising the accessibility of public housing.” But Professor Qian Wenlan, director of NUS’ Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies, does not see a sharp divergence materialising and thinks that the majority of the Singapore population would be more concerned about the affordability of public housing. Furthermore, she sees the spillover effect also moving in the opposite direction, with public housing prices possibly affecting private property prices. “The injection of supply downstream will mitigate inflation in the public housing market, which may even have a spillover effect on the property market as a whole,” she said. “By and large, we expect public housing to remain highly affordable to the majority of the population, especially since the government’s policy is to price BTO flats according to median incomes rather than market demand.” Analysts agreed that in general, the Singapore government has done a good job at housing the nation. This is unlike cities like Seoul and Hong Kong where residents “struggle a lot” due to housing attainability, said Dr Lee Kwan Ok. “For example, public housing supply is limited and private housing prices are very high in Seoul, so many young people give up their marriage and childbirth due to housing unaffordability,” she said. “In Hong Kong, the waiting time for public rental housing is very long, and many are forced to turn to private housing which is very unaffordable.\" Sociologist Tan Ern Ser said that in a society like Singapore, social mobility is always possible to all, but the probability of moving up is unequal across classes. He thinks the government has been making make public housing more affordable and attractive, with new housing developments, such as Bidadari, Tengah, and the Southern Water Front, for instance; while persuading Singaporeans to redefine success in less material terms. “I don’t think we could solve this problem of the bifurcation of public and private housing satisfactorily, but we could aim to live a ‘good enough’ life, prioritising what really matters: our mental and physical health, family and friends, and community life,” said Dr Tan.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore At a time when the sustainability of hawker businesses is in the spotlight, CNA speaks to one man who decided to turn his back on a teaching career to keep his family's pastry stall going. Sim Weijie (centre) was a teacher for about seven years. (Photo: CNA/Matthew Mohan) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Some of Sim Weijie's early childhood memories involved pastries. Standing outside his parents' bakery at Sims Vista Market and Food Centre with loose change jangling, Mr Sim would have a box of tau sar piah (filled pastry biscuits) in one hand and plastic bags in another. This would be his introduction to the family business. \"It was a family thing,\" he recalled. \"Everybody started from young, we came here and we helped out.\" During the Lunar New Year, Mr Sim would be mobilised to help make pineapple tarts, love letters and prawn rolls with hae bee hiam (spicy shrimp condiment) . If the Sim family were making goodies, the whole block would know it, he recalled. But as his path took him into teaching, little did Mr Sim expect that he would one day be continuing in the family legacy. Hung Huat Cakes and Pastries started off from a humble pushcart. Before hawker centres were developed in Singapore, Sim's paternal grandfather was a pushcart vendor who sold traditional min jiang kueh (folded pancakes with various fillings) in the Geylang area. After the government relocated street vendors like Mr Sim's grandfather into hawker centres, the business found a home at Sims Vista Market and Food Centre , where it remains today. Mr Sim's parents - his mother, Mdm Liau Cheok Wan was an apprentice at a traditional bakery, while his father Mr Sim Heng Hung was a carpenter - would eventually take over the reins from his grandfather. The bakery was right beside the carpentry factory, and that was how the couple met. After getting married, they decided to leave their jobs and run the business full-time. \"My mom has the background, and even though my dad wasn't trained as a baker, he loves eating all these things,\" said Mr Sim. \"So he is always thinking about new ways and things, so together then they started doing more and more pastries. A lot of recipes are actually created on their own.\" A post shared by Hung Huat Cakes & Pastries (@hunghuatcakesandpastries) And along the way things changed. Mr Sim's parents moved on from selling min jiang kueh, and expanded to selling different kinds of homemade pastries. These days, they are particularly well known for their Teochew mooncakes, pineapple tarts and kueh bangkit (tapioca cookies). But it was never on the cards that Mr Sim would follow in his parents' footsteps. \"Since young, my parents told me, you have to study … if not you’ll end up like me. They are the very traditional kind of family. So the mindset is always if you don't study, you end up doing things which are very tough. It’s a tough job, you wake up very early, you sweat it out, you work very, very hard, and things like that,\" he recalled. \"If you study hard, you get a better job, you sit in the air con ... But the funny thing is, now I ended up here.\" Mr Sim's journey to teaching had a few \"detours\" such as spending another year in junior college, he recalled. \"All these I believe added on to my life experiences. I had to experience a few ups and downs, failures and things like that, which I believe made me stronger,\" he said. \"I feel in a way indebted to very good teachers that I met, (and there were) quite a few of them. Even until today, I keep in contact with them.\" Inspired by these teachers, Mr Sim knew what kind of teacher he wanted to become. \"That ... experience forms a large proportion of my teaching belief, the way I taught, the way I spoke to my students and things like that. Without that ... I don't think I'll be able to do what I did in school as a teacher,\" said Mr Sim, who taught in a secondary school for about seven years. Being a teacher came with its highs and lows, said Mr Sim. \"To say that it's perfect, I'd be lying,\" he said. \"There were things that I really, really loved about the job, but there are also things that I really didn't enjoy.\" What he enjoyed the most was his interactions with students, as he was roped into the school's discipline committee. He eventually became a discipline master. \"That was the one thing that kept me going for very long,\" he recalled. \"What really fuelled me is really in this role .. I got to interact with the students, students from really very, very diverse backgrounds.\" Getting through to these students brought him satisfaction. \"I felt that I was in the right place, I'm doing what I'm good at,\" he said. \"You've got to have a lot of different tricks up your sleeve. The way you talk to different students ... It's really about the tone, the language and everything - you just really have to be very quick, very flexible.\" These interactions taught him a lot, said Mr Sim. \"As a teacher, if you're going in with the mindset that I'm here to teach, I'm just here to impart whatever I have to my students, then I think that's very wrong ... They have their own stories as well, and all these stories will teach us some things,\" he explained. But there were struggles, such as the heavy workload. \"While you are really trying to do your best as a teacher to engage the students meaningfully, you have so many other things. Projects, new initiatives, the admin, the sheer admin load and things like that,\" he said. \"As much as a teacher wants to give their 100 per cent for one student, they struggle, because they have so many people to take care of … It’s really a stop-gap. You are plugging gaps everywhere, you're firefighting everywhere.\" Dealing with some parents was also not easy, recalled Mr Sim. \"Another bigger issue that I feel is also the way general adults in Singapore look at teachers, especially when dealing with parents. That is a very, very challenging portion. Sometimes you just feel like you are like the customer service officer,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter what role you're holding.\" As time ticked on, Mr Sim felt that he had achieved what he had set out to do as a young teacher. \"(The goals were to be) the kind of teacher where I feel I am able to inspire. The kind of teacher where I feel I'm able to command a kind of respect not just from my students, but from my colleagues,\" he said. A feeling of being jaded also started to seep in. \"I wanted to be fair to my students. I didn't want to be the kind of teacher where I am already slacking, getting a bit laid back, and then at the same time, I’m just waiting to draw my pay every month, waiting for time to pass,\" Mr Sim explained. \"I didn't want to become that kind of teacher, I didn’t want to shortchange my job.\" At the same time, he saw that his parents needed help with the business. \"They were also thinking of retiring but at the same time couldn't bear to let go of the business,\" he said. And so he initiated a conversation about coming on board. \"It's something that I really want to preserve,\" Mr Sim said. \"And it is something that my parents spent so many years doing, it is a waste to let it go down the drain.\" While they were \"happy but yet shocked\", Mr Sim recalled how his mother was apprehensive at first. She felt that it was a pity he was giving up his job as a teacher and was also worried that working together might affect their relationship. \"My closer friends, even though they were shocked at first when I told them this was my decision … They understood, they knew that this is … something I really want to do,\" he added But the switch doesn't mean that he regrets going into teaching. Mr Sim said he would do it all over again, if given a second chance. \"The people I met, the experience I had, the friendship, the bonds that I built with my students and things like that, it is something really I dare say you can’t find many other jobs,\" he explained. \"So I think that's where teaching is really, really impactful.\" A trade which was sometimes under-appreciated over the past decades, Singapore’s hawker culture was added to the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2020. However, hawkers continue to face numerous challenges including manpower pressures and rising food, rental and electricity costs. Given such factors, it is more challenging being a hawker now than it has ever been, believes food writer Annette Tan. An added complication is the plethora of dining options which Singaporeans now have, she added. \"To be in the food business in any capacity, you need to have passion. There's no other reason why anybody goes into food, it is such a difficult business to be in,\" added Ms Tan. And despite various programmes in place to encourage the uptake of the trade, according to the National Environment Agency (NEA), the median age of hawkers is 60 years old. However, chairman of the Federation of Merchants’ Associations Singapore’s (FMAS) hawker division Anthony Low believes that more young hawkers are now more willing to enter the trade as compared to when he made the switch two decades ago. Mr Low left the Singapore Armed Forces 23 years ago to run his father’s ngoh hiang stall. He was 29 then, and no one else would take up the mantle then. He believes that the inclusion of Singapore's hawker culture into the UNESCO listing has helped to raise the profile of and highlight the contribution of hawkers. \"Now at least people recognise our effort and give us the respect,\" he said. \"It is not a dying trade.\" While there are youngsters who start their businesses from scratch, those who take on the mantle of a family business as a \"truly rare breed\", author of bestselling cookbook Wet Market to Table Pamelia Chia told CNA. \"I have not met many people who come from a line of hawkers, a lot of the young ones that I've come across are starting their own businesses from scratch instead of inheriting them,\" said Ms Chia, who is also the founder of Singapore Noodles, a newsletter with the mission of keeping Singapore’s food heritage alive. \"When you actually have have folks who truly understand the craft, who have clearly shown that they have taken the time to learn things from their parents, or from fellow hawkers, then I think it's very encouraging for the hawker scene.\" At the same time, if nobody takes over these family businesses, or are wanting to learn the trade, it can pose a \"huge issue\" for Singapore's hawker culture, she added. \"Like everything in life, the hawker centres have to evolve, and Singaporeans have to be willing to accept this evolution,\" added Ms Tan. \"The hawker centre will always be a part of our lives ... but the food that the hawker centre is serving will be different.\" The career switch meant that Mr Sim had to take a pay cut, and he also had other concerns such as whether the work would take too much time away from his family. \"I had a lot of family support, from my parents especially and my wife. We managed to find ways to mitigate some of these challenges,\" he added. The job is by no means easy. It can be physically demanding and involves long hours, Mr Sim added. During peak seasons, work begins at 6am and ends at about 10pm. \"It is like (a) 14,15 hours kind of thing ... You're standing most of the time. So I say the biggest struggle is actually physical,\" he said. \"(My parents) are both in their 60s. They do things so fast, so quickly, because they have a system. They are basically like machines … when I work with them, I am struggling to keep up with them sometimes.\" Working with family does come with challenges, he admitted. \"There will definitely be disagreements, but I think we've worked out a system. Sometimes to agree to disagree, sometimes to know who is the most experienced, who is the best person to make a decision,\" said Mr Sim. \"Sometimes (there is) stress to keep up orders, but ... mental health-wise, I think it's definitely better than before when I was a teacher.\" There is also a need to cope with rising costs, and added to this is the perception among a minority that hawker food must remain cheap regardless. \"I feel that this can be discouraging for hawkers. Some hawkers really, really use the best ingredients which are not cheap, and they really try their very best to ensure that their food quality is good,\" said Mr Sim. \"There are still a lot of people out there who are very understanding ... Most of the people they will tell you say: 'It's okay, we understand that your price has to increase, costs are going up. As you continue to sell good food'.\" What's been an added benefit is that Mr Sim is not starting from scratch. After all, he has been helping out at the stall for most of his life. \"It is not ground zero,\" he explained. \"I've always had a taste for pastries. So when I went overseas, I will go for pastries, different pastries shops. I like to try, I like to eat, I also have this very particular taste for pastries, and in a way (certain) standards. So when I make certain things that it's not up to my own standards, I rather throw it.\" His previous role as a teacher has also helped him in his job, said Mr Sim. \"As a teacher, you are doing everything. You are doing events, you’re doing management, you’re doing people relationship management,\" he said. \"Over here as a hawker, you do every single thing. Production, logistics, marketing ... cleaning up, taking the trash out ... I felt in the last few months when I started full time, there are so many things that I learnt. There is growth which is one of the things that makes up satisfaction for me.\" There is also a sweet sense of satisfaction that comes with growing one's own business as well as when people enjoy your food, Mr Sim said. And bit by bit, he is also breaking new ground. On top of making use of social media to market products, he has also introduced creations of his own. One of these new goodies is the Hokkaido Milk Mochi piah , a current bestseller. \"People really like it. The marketing portion is important. Getting the word out, the videos, the photos and everything. That is the thing that first attracts people. After that when they come down, it has to taste good,\" he said. Mr Sim hopes to eventually take over in the next few years, and for his parents to finally enjoy a well-deserved break, while helping out at the shop whenever they can. \"There are a lot of family businesses in Singapore but if you are talking about traditional food, pastries ... you’ll see less and less. Because of the nature of the work, the amount of commitment you have to put in, the hard work physically, the challenge. I probably say not a lot of people want to do it,\" he said. And skills and recipes are lost, as old \"masters\" of the trade retire and bakeries continue to close down, he added. The shop is \"part of the family\", he added. \"I cannot imagine not having this shop … This business is a place where my family members gather - my aunts, my uncles, my cousins come here and help ... It is a place and an opportunity to gather,\" said Mr Sim. \"It’s not just a business, It’s part of the family. It’s part of the family tradition, it’s a place where we gather, there are so, so many memories tied to this business. So this is one of the reasons why ... it is worth keeping.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Asia analysis analysis Asia Observers say Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is unlikely to cave in to demands to remove an entity partner with ties to Israel from the deal. But larger questions loom on the economics and whether the move will give Kuala Lumpur International Airport a lift in international rankings. This audio is generated by an AI tool. KUALA LUMPUR: Criticism and questions continue to dog Malaysia’s plan to privatise its national airport operator Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB), but analysts say there’s unlikely to be any U-turning on the move. “This train has left the station and the time to back out is no longer an option because a formal offer has been made (on the proposed privatisation),” said a Finance Ministry official involved in the proposed transaction. The official added that the international reputation of two of Malaysia’s largest state-controlled funds driving the deal, sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional and the Employees Provident Fund, were at stake. The involvement of the world’s largest asset manager, New York-based BlackRock Inc, in the multi-billion-dollar privatisation of the airport operator has turned the proposed transaction into a hot political potato for Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim because of the US company’s links to Israel. In mid-May, Khazanah and EPF announced they had formed a consortium with BlackRock-linked Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority to take publicly listed MAHB private with an offer of RM11 (US$2.30) a share. BlackRock holds significant investments in Israel and was also a big investor in companies that arm the Israeli defence forces. It announced in January it would buy GIP for US$12.5 billion in an acquisition that is expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year. Under the multi-stage corporate transaction to privatise MAHB, the four entities will form a special purpose vehicle, Gateway Development Alliance Sdn Bhd. Khazanah and EPF will have a 70 per cent interest in the consortium, with the foreign parties owning the remainder. With a share base of 1.66 billion units, the deal values MAHB at RM18.26 billion (US$3.9 billion). And with roughly 40 per cent of MAHB shares currently held by the public, according to advisory firm CGS International, it would cost the new consortium roughly RM7.3 billion (US$1.55 billion) to take the company private. The deal, estimated to take place in the fourth quarter of the year, must secure regulatory approval in Malaysia and other jurisdictions, such as Türkiye . But i t isn’t just politics that is stoking public consternation over the proposed privatisation of MAHB, which stands as the Anwar administration’s most audacious corporate exercise since coming to power in November 2022. Aviation experts and bankers are also questioning the economics of the privatisation plan. “I still can’t understand the rationale behind the privatisation because it is not going to guarantee results. There is a general view in the industry that there is no clear plan apart from this being very transaction-driven,” said Mr Shukor Yusof, a senior aviation analyst and founder of Singapore-based Endau Analytics. He added the management models of top airports, such as Singapore’s Changi and South Korea’s Incheon International, are options Malaysia should consider. Aviation analysts noted that both these airports are successful because they are not only functional but also serve as attractions. The wider investing community appears to concur. Typically, the value of shares in a company targeted for a privatisation and takeover creeps up to the target price of the proposed transaction. But that has not been the case for MAHB. On Friday, shares of MAHB were trading at RM9.87 per share, a sharp discount to the RM11 offer price in the privatisation deal. “Markets don’t lie and the share price is suggesting that there are a lot of concerns whether the deal will go through,” said a chief executive of a foreign bank based in Malaysia. The government’s defence of the proposed MAHB privatisation has been less than robust. Mr Anwar has accused the opposition of throwing baseless allegations. “There is nothing positive from them, only inciting hatred and envy,” he was quoted as saying by Malaysia's domestic media. Debate over the MAHB deal is expected to get heated again at the next Parliament sitting that begins on June 24. In a written response to CNA, Khazanah, which is often compared to its Singapore peer Temasek Holdings, defended the proposed privatisation plan, noting that the BlackRock-tied GIP was picked after a robust review of potential technical partners, including global airport operators. “We were looking for a partner that has a strong track record of value creation and one that goes beyond what current airport managers are doing and can achieve…GIP fits the bill and like most private equity funds, they will eventually exit after creating value, just as they have been doing with their other airports,” said a spokesperson from Khazanah. GIP does come with serious credentials. Ranked as one of the leading infrastructure managers in the world, GIP has a 17-year track record and currently has US$112 billion in assets under management. Apart from managing ports and airports, GIP also has extensive investments in renewable energy and oil and gas projects across the globe. But critics of the privatisation plan noted that the airports under GIP’s management do not rank highly in international rankings such as Skytrax. The London Gatwick Airport, in which the fund has a 49.99 per cent interest, is ranked 48th in Skytrax’s 2024 ranking, while the Sydney Airport, of which GIP owns 37 per cent, was in 55th place. By contrast, Singapore’s Changi was ranked second , after the Doha Airport, and South Korea’s Incheon was ranked third. Unlike the standalone airports GIP currently manages, MAHB has 39 airports in its stable, all of them in Malaysia with the exception of the Sabiha Gokcen Airport in Istanbul. The airports in Malaysia are in need of upgrades. The Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), widely seen MAHB’s prized asset, was 71st in the Skytrax 2024 airport rankings. It suffered an embarrassing technical outage that left passengers stranded in 2019 and, in 2023, the airport management was forced to suspend its aged aerotrain network that is now being replaced. Proponents of the privatisation plan noted that GIP would lend much-needed financial muscle and technical expertise to get MAHB back on course to compete with other international rivals. The move by the Anwar administration in March to replace the operating and land lease agreement of the previous 25-year concession with a fresh 45-year term that will only expire in 2069 will also allow for better financial planning and airport expansion programmes, government officials said. But there is concern that BlackRock’s participation could create other complications, particularly over the future prospects of the Sabiha Gokcen Airport in Istanbul. Türkiye suspended all trade with Israel last month over what President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said was a “worsening humanitarian tragedy” by the Israeli offensive in Gaza. Some bankers have speculated that unless ties between the two countries return to normal, MAHB could find itself in an awkward position when the concession for the Sabiha Gokcen Airport expires in 2023. CGS International noted in a report to clients in late February that MAHB could opt to brighten its chance for an extension by bringing a new Turkish investor as a partner in Sabiha Gokcen, where it now has a 100 per cent interest. Khazanah declined to comment on the prospects for the Istanbul airport.

    "article_content": "East Asia East Asia There were over 15 million livestreamers in China at last count. Those CNA spoke to believe the move will improve industry standards, while analysts say the government also gains from taxation and pushing down the jobless rate. China's massive short video and livestreaming sector has continued to expand, with the number of professional hosts surpassing 15 million in 2023. (Photo: Qian Yongjing) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: For four hours daily, Ms Qian Yongjing gets in front of a camera in her Shenzhen office and lays out how to excel at the workplace through good communication and high emotional intelligence. The 40-year-old livestreamer broadcasts on Chinese social media platforms like Douyin, Kuaishou and Xiaohongshu, where she has amassed five million fans and counting. She didn’t want to share her exact earnings, only disclosing that she earns six digits in yuan monthly. It is a relatively recent reality for Ms Qian. Like many others, the mompreneur with over 10 years of teaching experience in workplace communication was forced to pivot her business online when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020. Her team at Homeland, a Shenzhen-based content creation company she founded in 2015, went through much trial and error during the first two years of the transition. They needed to master the use of an online platform for conducting lessons and to analyse the demands of the online market. “We struggled a lot but we managed to push through. We believe this field (livestreaming) was not only vital during the pandemic, and it has been proven so,” Ms Qian told CNA. There were over 15 million livestreamers or “wangluo zhubo” in China at the end of 2023, according to the state-run China Netcasting Services Association. Despite this, the profession isn’t officially recognised in the country, which means those in that line of work aren’t eligible for government support in areas such as training and development. But this could soon change as China looks to give livestreamers the formal nod along with more than a dozen other occupations - most linked to high-tech industries. The move is taking place as the world’s second-largest economy looks to bolster the job market amid heightened youth unemployment , and galvanise economic growth against a raft of domestic and external challenges . On May 24, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security made public a list of 19 professions it plans to formally recognise. It was open for public review until June 7, after which amendments - if any - will be made before the occupations are included in the official roll. It is unclear how long the entire process will take. Based on previous records, notices for reviews were released in batches and revision works took three to five years to be completed. Roles like livestream hosts, generative artificial intelligence system operators, intelligent connected vehicle testers and intelligent manufacturing system maintenance personnel made the shortlist, in a nod to China’s high-tech push. But the inclusion of livestream hosts caught the most public attention, yielding multiple news reports and plenty of discussion on social media platforms. While some expressed scepticism, most of the comments were positive. An unofficial Sina News poll on Weibo revealed that 57 per cent of 1,756 respondents view livestreaming as a lucrative profession. “Stop working part-time or farming for a living, everyone should just be a livestreamer and enjoy benefits from national policies,” one commenter wrote, garnering 143 likes. Another user remarked: “There are so many livestreamers out there; regardless of the content, this is a natural step.” Others discussed the possible implications. “Besides purchasing equipment, you now have to pay taxes,” one user wrote. The ministry defines a livestream host as a person engaged in real-time broadcasting or interactive services through means such as audio, video, and graphic information. There are also seven listed job scopes, including scripting broadcast content. A record 11.7 million graduates are set to enter China’s workforce this year. Livestreaming has a reputation as one of the jobs with a lower barrier to entry. Netizens in China often quip that female graduates will work as livestreamers and males as food delivery men. “Livestreamers order delivery food when hungry and delivery men watch livestreams when they are tired, creating a perfect closed loop.” China has been constantly revising jobs on its official professions list over the past decade. The document has undergone two major revisions since its publication in 1999. The latest version in 2022 features 1,636 professions - about 400 fewer compared to the earliest edition. Additionally, a supporting document detailing skills and profession specifics has been updated three times since its publication in 2012. When unveiling the latest planned additions last month, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security stated that recognising new occupations can further enhance the professional sense of belonging of practitioners, allow them to benefit from relevant national policies while also enhancing employment. Having a profession formally recognised comes with several perks for both people currently in that line of work, as well as those seeking to join the field. It guarantees some form of official status and proper evaluation through certification by relevant agencies. This grants the individuals access to benefits such as vocational training and skills appraisal subsidies. Professor Liu Erduo, a labour expert from the China Institute for Employment Research (CIER), suggests the list helps inform people when searching for a new job, as they can reference which occupations have been added, updated or even removed. There is also a more practical reason at play. “When the occupation becomes legit, the authorities will monitor tax collection more closely,” he said. From a broader perspective, this could even reduce unemployment numbers, he noted. “Previously, these individuals could claim to be unemployed, but they can no longer do so when their professions are made official; they are out of the grey area.” President Xi Jinping sounded a clarion call late last month for authorities to place employment and job creation front and centre, according to a South China Morning Post (SCMP) report. “We must develop new business entities and new business models vigorously, actively cultivating new professions and developing new sources of job growth,” he said after a Politburo study session on May 27, reported state media according to SCMP. China’s surveyed urban unemployment rate came in at 5.2 per cent in March, down 0.1 percentage points from the previous month and from March 2023, indicating a generally stable employment situation, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. This year, the Chinese government aims to create over 12 million new jobs in urban areas and keep the urban surveyed unemployment rate at around 5.5 per cent. The two targets are similar to those set last year. Meanwhile, the youth unemployment rate was 14.7 per cent in April, according to official data. It covers those aged 16 to 24 and excludes students. The jobless rate hit a record high of 21.3 per cent in June last year when students were still part of the count. Analysts CNA spoke to did not see the inclusion of livestream host to the list as a surprise, as they noted the 15-million-strong workforce dedicated to this occupation. “Once there is a notable number of players in the field, the authority will consider adding it to the list,” said Prof Liu. Ms Qian, the livestreamer based in Shenzhen, believes the move could improve the overall quality of livestream hosts as they will be subject to tighter regulations and requirements. “Some livestream hosts will be weeded out even though the Internet is already a filter on its own,” she remarked. Similar sentiments were expressed by another livestream host, who wanted to be known as Chen. “The industry will be more legitimised as negative value-oriented content like showing off wealth will be removed by the authority,” said the 30-year-old accounting major graduate. She added that it is hard for parents to monitor what their kids are watching on the Internet. “When there are fewer individuals with inappropriate content, hopefully parents feel safer letting their kids view livestreamed videos.” Apart from plans to recognise new professions such as livestreaming host, 29 new work classifications - which are specialisations under specific professions - were also unveiled on May 24 by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. These include roles like providing shower assistance for seniors and coffee roasters. Under the sports facilities manager role, six roles related to snow sports, including snowboard repair engineer, ski track planner and skate technician, have been added. Laying out these specialisations will improve the employment process, says Mr Zhang Ruijia , who is in charge of the investment department at one of the largest ski facilities in Hemu village, located in Xinjiang’s Altay prefecture. “This will be more targeted because these jobs aren’t found anywhere else except for ski resorts and ice skating rinks,” said Mr Zhang, adding that previously, they could only put up general job advertisements and then train new hires for specific roles after they started working. He gave an example using one of the more established roles - a ski lift mechanic. \"It was much easier to hire staff for this since it is already a mature industry in China,” said Mr Zhang. “We could just list out the specific job as it is.” Mr Zhang - who works closely with vocational schools offering snow facilities-related majors - also pointed out that having a clear indication of professions helps students work towards their ideal career roles. Recognising more professions and types of work also presents better training opportunities for those roles, according to Prof Liu from CIER, as companies or individuals that provide training for the latest additions can have easier access to funding and faster approvals. Ms Yang Wenwen, founder of Xinlu Education Consultancy, which provides training for new livestream hosts online and on-site, echoes this. “Online training is easy, but those selling products need on-site networking,” she said. “With the profession recognised, it will be easier to obtain licences for physical locations.” Mr Lu Haoran, 29, a freelance videographer in China, points out that livestreamers could also benefit financially. “This helps them attract advertisers, especially those tied to the government,” he said. However, he thinks that the job description is too limited. “We typically use 'livestreamer' to describe people who sell products through livestreams. It does not encompass jobs like travel or food bloggers.” Mr Lu posts travel reels on Douyin and Xiaohongshu in his free time. He has over 700,000 followers and was featured in a programme by national broadcaster CCTV. Even so, he told CNA he would not consider pursuing a full-time job as an influencer even if the profession becomes official with all the potential benefits that entails, as he views it more as a passion project. While their activities can overlap with those of livestreamers, influencers are currently not on the list of formally recognised professions. The occupation is also not in the latest shortlist. Profit is also a factor. “It is too unstable,” he said, sharing that his current job earns him up to 500,000 yuan (US$69,000) annually. In comparison, the income from his tie-ups with advertisers on social media is around 7,000 to 10,000 yuan monthly. “Posting videos on TikTok doesn’t really earn you money,\" he quipped.

    "article_content": "Asia Asia Observers told CNA that pornographic content has been available on social media site X “for a long time” and that the uproar was merely in response to the firm’s recent policy move to officially allow such content to be posted. This audio is generated by an AI tool. JAKARTA: The move by Elon Musk’s X to formally allow consensual adult and X-rated content to be posted on its platform has drawn criticisms from several Southeast Asian governments, who say that such changes violate its local laws. And while some of these authorities have threatened to block X - the social media platform formerly known as Twitter - experts whom CNA spoke to say that such threats are merely “lip service” as it means restricting freedom of speech. Beyond that, the observers added that pornographic content has been available on X “for a long time” and that the uproar was merely in response to X’s recent policy move to officially allow such content to be posted. \"Pornographic content has been around for a long time until now on X. The difference is that in the past X did not explicitly allow its distribution, (and) now it is openly allowed. That's the fact, and X is not blocked,\" said Mr Ismail Fahmi, founder of Drone Emprit, a tool which monitors conversations on social media. In a recent update on its website, the San Francisco-based company said users \"should be able to create, distribute, and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it is consensually produced and distributed. Sexual expression, whether visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression\". However, X in its update stressed that such content should not be displayed as profile photos or banners, and users can opt out of viewing such content. It also prohibits content that promotes exploitation, non-consent, objectification, sexualisation or harm to minors, as well as obscene behaviours. Indonesia’s Communications and Informatics (Kominfo) Minister Budi Arie Setiadi on Wednesday (Jun 5) said X must abide by Indonesian laws and regulations - which among other things prohibit the dissemination of pornographic content - if it does not want to be sanctioned or blocked. \"All X policies that conflict with these rules and other applicable regulations will still be sanctioned, including blocking and/or fines,\" Mr Budi said, as quoted by CNN Indonesia. Director General of Public Information and Communication at Kominfo Usman Kansong meanwhile told the news outlet that the prohibition of pornography is also contained in various other laws in Indonesia, including the Anti-Pornography Law and the Criminal Code. \"If X violates rules related to pornography … Kominfo can take action from warning, taking down content to closing access,\" said Mr Usman. Meanwhile, Malaysia’s Minister of Communications Fahmi Fadzil said that X’s move “clearly” violated Malaysian laws and thus they were not acceptable. He told a post-Cabinet meeting press conference on Jun 5 that the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) will convey to X the government’s firm stance towards its latest policy. \"The MCMC chief operating officer Mohd Ali Hanafiah Mohd Yunus will ensure that all platforms, not just X, understand that certain activities, such as online gambling, dissemination of pornographic materials, and other prohibited content as per our national laws, are not tolerated on these platforms, including those happening on X,\" Mr Fahmi was quoted as saying by Bernama. Separately, an official from the Philippines’ Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) told local media that X’s policy change underscores the importance of having a law that will give local authorities more powers to regulate social media. “This is a cultural sensitivity issue. We really need to regulate social media because just because a Western brand thinks that this is okay, that doesn't mean it is okay for us,” DICT’s Undersecretary Jeffrey Ian Dy was quoted as saying by ABS-CBN News. The news outlet also reported that the DICT has been pushing for the regulation of social media platforms instead of an outright ban of such sites that violate local laws. And while observers whom CNA spoke to say that some governments in the region do prohibit the spread of pornographic content online, many do not resort to blocking such sites entirely. Responding to the Indonesian government’s threat to block X, Mr Enda Nasution - a social media activist who initiated the #BijakBersosmed movement which encourages the use of social media positively - said that such a hard-handed approach is not ideal. \"Blocking is not a solution, but the (Indonesian) government always makes it the first solution,” said Mr Enda. \"This is not the first time (threatening to block social media platforms), previous ministers of Kominfo have also threatened, but so far it's just lip service, no one has ever done it consistently.” He also questioned whether the Indonesian government would follow through on its threats to block X. \"Elon Musk is the golden boy, does the government have the courage (to block X)?\" said Mr Enda, referring to X’s owner, Mr Musk, who has visited the country several times and been warmly welcomed by government officials including President Joko Widodo. The Indonesian government has hopes that the chief executive officer of SpaceX and Tesla will invest in Indonesia. Just last month, Mr Musk launched SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet services in the country in a bid to boost connectivity in remote areas. Seeing the importance of Mr Musk to Indonesia, Mr Bimantoro Kushari - a researcher at Monash Data and Democracy Research Hub - said the Indonesian government must look at the political, diplomatic as well as economic implications if it wants to block X. \"Indonesia has strategic interests with the entry of another Elon Musk company, Starlink. Blocking X is certainly not a good step considering Indonesia's strategic interest in Elon Musk,\" Mr Bimantoro told CNA, adding that one viable solution is to take down pornographic content on X without blocking the platform. He added: \"If Kominfo wants all sexual content to disappear from the timeline of Indonesian audiences, then it takes extra work for Kominfo to detect these contents. It could be by creating an algorithm that is able to detect sexual content on X or other technical efforts.” Meanwhile, Assistant Professor Dr Mahyuddin Daud from the Department of Civil Law at International Islamic University Malaysia said that there is “nothing to stop the Malaysian authorities from putting a block on X”, although he opines that this may only be done as a “last resort”. “I believe that more democratic and self-regulatory measures may be taken to discuss with X to approach the matter in a win-win situation,” he said. “Perhaps for Muslim countries, X can make a qualification that local laws are to be respected and X's policy on pornography to be excluded in those countries including Malaysia.” Asst Prof Mahyuddin added that should negotiations with the social media platform ensue, X may consider having a “special country setting” for certain countries like Malaysia that cannot tolerate access to pornography. “In this regard, Malaysian netizens use of X may not be hindered and users may continue to use X with less worry about being exposed to illegal and harmful material,” he said, adding that recent data from Digital 2024 found that X had 5.71 million users in Malaysia as of early 2024. According to the We Are Social report, X users in Indonesia as of October 2023 reached 27.5 million people, the fourth largest after the United States, Japan and India. Mr Ismail, founder of Drone Emprit, said that X is still the leading social media platform for social discourse in Indonesia. Blocking X, according to him, will hurt Indonesians' freedom of speech rights. \"If X is blocked, there will be no more similar platforms to express opinions openly,\" said Mr Ismail. Other social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, Mr Ismail said, cannot be expected to be a means of delivering criticism. \"TikTok is mostly dancing, not much used to convey criticism. Meanwhile, Instagram and Facebook censor many posts, for example, posts related to Palestine,\" Mr Ismail added. Mr Enda - the social media activist - said that managing sexual content on X should be left to the wisdom of its users, adding that social media is not like television where the audience has no other choice but to watch whatever is being broadcast. On the internet, the users play a big role in deciding what content they want to consume. \"Internet users are assumed to be adults who can think and actively choose,\" said Mr Enda. He added that X also provides options for users who do not want to be exposed to sexual materials, adding that this goes to show that the consumption of pornographic content is partly the responsibility of social media users and not just the government. \"It's wiser that way (rather than blocking) it,\" said Mr Enda.

    "article_content": "East Asia East Asia Talk of a free trade pact among Japan, South Korea and China resurfaced at their recent summit. Analysts say pragmatism must prevail over ideology to close the deal. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: China, Japan and South Korea will all benefit if they can get a three-way free trade agreement (FTA) across the line, but they will have to overcome serious challenges stemming from geopolitical tensions and other issues, experts say. Talks for their FTA have stalled since 2019, but the elusive trade deal was cast into the spotlight again last Monday at a trilateral summit attended by Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. At the summit – the first in four years – the three leaders vowed to restart talks on the FTA. China’s Mr Li called for South Korea and Japan \"to deepen economic and trade connectivity, maintain the stability and smoothness of the industrial chain and supply chain, and resume and complete the negotiations of the China-Japan-South Korea FTA as soon as possible\". Three days later on May 30, China’s Ministry of Commerce said it stood ready to speed up negotiations. The Chinese side attaches great significance to talks on the FTA, which is expected to drive the steady recovery of the regional and even global economy, ministry spokesperson He Yadong said, as reported by state news agency Xinhua. Korean President Yoon, meanwhile, said the three countries had “decided to create a transparent and predictable environment for trade and investment, and to establish a safe supply chain”. At a trilateral business meeting held after the summit, business leaders agreed to establish a working group to conduct joint research on economic cooperation in the private sector. The three countries have economic heft. They make up about 25 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and have a combined yearly trading volume of over US$800 billion. China is the largest trading partner of Japan and South Korea, while Japan and Korea are China’s fourth and fifth largest trading partners, respectively. In restarting FTA talks, the East Asian neighbours will be building on existing trade pacts to try to deliver one that signals their strongest economic bonds yet, experts note. China and South Korea have an FTA signed in 2015. All three countries are members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which took effect in 2022. The RCEP is an FTA among the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Australia, China, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. A China-Japan-South Korea FTA will be recognised as “RCEP Plus”, going beyond the RCEP’s level of liberalisation. For instance, the three countries will aim to fully abolish tariffs on automobiles and auto components, which the RCEP did not, reported news agency Nikkei Asia. Japan will also seek reductions in industrial subsidies and less preferential treatment for state-owned enterprises, which were left out of the RCEP, Nikkei Asia reported. Commitments by the three countries to each other under RCEP are “relatively thin”, noted Dr Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore. The foundation works to advance sustainable global trade through research and education. A three-way FTA will allow them to be more focused, she said. “If there're only three of you in the partnership, you can tailor an agreement often in ways that are more ambitious in some areas, than if you're trying to do it with (15 parties).” Although China’s commerce ministry spokesperson He said the three countries’ economies are highly complementary and their industrial chains highly interconnected, Dr Elms said they are also competitors in many fields including agriculture, electronics and chemicals. Finding products for which to remove tariffs will be “a challenge”, she said, citing furniture, raw materials and services as potential areas to be opened up. While some experts say China is keenest to advance FTA talks due to its economic challenges, others believe an agreement will also serve South Korea and Japan. China’s eagerness to push for the FTA is not surprising, said Professor Syaru Shirley Lin, chair of the Center for Asia-Pacific Resilience and Innovation and research professor at the University of Virginia in the United States. “Closer market integration among these countries makes economic sense. Given China's economic challenges, reflected in the real estate slump, weak consumption and private-sector investment, and the pressure of deflation and growing debt, Beijing needs serious measures to boost its growth,” she said. China’s excess industrial capacity and cheap exports of solar panels, electric vehicles and steel are currently facing pressure from the US, which fears they will hurt its own domestic manufacturing efforts. The US has increased tariffs on some Chinese imports , including a 100 per cent tax on its electric vehicles, and wants to work with Europe on what it calls China’s overproduction. Dr Zhu Zhiqun, a professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell University, disagreed that China was more eager than Japan or South Korea. All three countries have a “collective interest” in making progress on trade and supply chain issues, he said. Summit host South Korea made a notable effort to jumpstart the trilateral summit. Earlier in May, its foreign minister Cho Tae-yul visited his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing to pave the way for the summit. While South Korean President Yoon has sought to strengthen ties with the US and Japan, Mr Cho reportedly stressed that it does not mean South Korea is drifting away from China . Given the need to balance geographical and market realities with US-China rivalry, the three countries will likely move cautiously if FTA talks resume, analysts note. The US remains “the most important ally and partner” for both Japan and South Korea, said Dr Zhu. “Yet, China is right next door and is their largest trading partner. It is not in their interest to have a confrontational relationship with China,\" he said. On the other hand, Japan and South Korea “perceive their asymmetric economic interdependence with China as a disadvantage” and this has prompted them to pursue economic diversification, particularly in light of growing US-China strategic competition, noted Prof Lin. “Consequently, in the negotiation process, Tokyo and Seoul will be more cautious and likely to demand that China address concerns about manufacturing overcapacity, subsidies, and preferential treatment for its state-owned enterprises — issues Beijing has yet to tackle,” she said. Data shows that both South Korea and Japan have reduced investment in China in recent years. In 2023, South Korea recorded a trade deficit with China for the first time in 31 years, importing US$18 billion more goods and services than it exported, according to Statistics Korea. Foreign direct investment by South Korean companies into China also slumped 78.1 per cent to US$1.87 billion in 2023 compared to the previous year, according to South Korea’s Finance Ministry. Meanwhile, net new money from Japan into China last year fell to its lowest in at least a decade, amounting to 1.31 trillion Japanese yen (US$11.91 billion), according to data from the country's Ministry of Finance. Half of 1,741 Japanese companies polled expect the Chinese economy to worsen in 2024, an increase from 37 per cent at the end of last year, a recent survey conducted by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China found. Experts also have mixed views on the likelihood of an FTA happening in the foreseeable future. Dr Elms does not hold high hopes. “This one’s going to take forever. I mean, a lot of them take forever, just because they're complicated,” she said. The latest vows by the three leaders will “not make a difference” to companies until the talks move to \"a genuine stage\" where there are real economic benefits on the table and a deal is \"very close to signing\", she added. Dr Zhu is more optimistic. “If the three countries keep the momentum, remove the remaining obstacles, and resist potential external interference, an FTA could be reached before too long,” he said. “Pragmatism must prevail over ideology or great power politics.” All sides will certainly have to ramp up efforts if they are serious about the FTA – meeting more frequently and having big teams engaging in discussions with greater intensity, for example, said Dr Elms. Once-a-year talks “would not bring about much change”, she said.

    "article_content": "Asia Asia A representative from a vendor hired by the road transport department is confident about the approaching Oct 1 deadline. But some are concerned that Malaysian authorities have not responded to their queries. All foreign-registered vehicles entering Malaysia from Singapore by land will be required to use a vehicle entry permit (VEP) from Oct 1. (Photo: CNA/Zamzahuri Abas) This audio is generated by an AI tool. JOHOR BAHRU: Mr William Khoo is worried that in a few months, he may no longer be able to drive his Singapore-registered car to Johor Bahru, where his child is living with his parents. Mr Khoo, who is in his 40s, is based in Singapore and works in accounting. He typically drives across the Causeway once a week to be with his family. However, he told CNA he is facing issues registering his car for a vehicle entry permit (VEP). At the end of last month, Malaysian authorities announced that from Oct 1, all Singapore vehicles entering the country will be required to have registered for the permit. The process involves the owner of the car registering his details at an online portal before fitting a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag on the car. Unfortunately for Mr Khoo, he is unable to complete his registration process as his car is already VEP-registered by its previous owner. Mr Khoo purchased the car in 2023 from a secondhand dealer and was not aware that the previous owner did not deregister himself with Malaysian authorities. He has tried to contact Malaysia’s Road Transport Department (JPJ) via multiple emails for more than two weeks, but has yet to receive a response. “There is no way we can reach out to the previous owner now (to ask the owner to deregister his VEP) because the dealership has strict privacy policies under the Personal Data Protection Act,” said Mr Khoo. “Of course we feel frustration. JPJ must have a better system to deal with issues like this, like for instance setting aside a specific department to deal with drivers who recently bought secondhand cars and are facing this issue,” he added. Following the news that Malaysia would be implementing the VEP, numerous drivers like Mr Khoo have struggled with new uncertainty and challenges. CNA received around a dozen emailed queries from readers highlighting issues they face in the registration process. This came off the back of the Malaysia government’s announcement confirming that the VEP initiative will be enforced from Oct 1 and an FAQ released by JPJ spelling out requirements as well as steps drivers need to take to complete the registration process. A Facebook post of CNA’s explainer on VEP triggered more than 650 comments and 1,800 shares, with netizens remarking on potential stumbling blocks and raising queries. Some, like Mr Khoo, had vehicles which were already registered for VEP under previous owners. Meanwhile, others had issues such as the VEP they applied for in 2019 was expiring but there was no option to renew it on the portal. A VEP application has to be renewed every five years. Some also indicated that they were not willing to apply because the process required drivers to submit sensitive documents such as a copy of the identity card and certificate of entitlement, citing privacy issues. Almost all these drivers told CNA that they have reached out to JPJ across various platforms including email as well as social media but they have yet to receive a response. Yet, a senior official representing TCSens - a vendor hired by JPJ to assist drivers with the installation of RFID stickers and also to handle in-person enquiries on VEPs in Johor Bahru - told CNA that JPJ has been overwhelmed with “thousands of requests” from Singapore drivers facing issues registering. The official, who declined to be named, maintained that his team and JPJ are confident they will address all of these queries in time for the Oct 1 deadline. “Certain users are worried, so they panic and they blame the system. But we will work with them to clear up these concerns,” he added. Malaysian authorities said that the purpose of the VEP was to tackle car theft and cloning syndicates, and prevent vehicles from leaving the country without paying fines for traffic offences. Malaysia initially wanted to implement the VEP from October 2019 under then transport minister Liow Tiong Lai. However, the implementation of the scheme has since been delayed several times due to technical issues with the portal and poor implementation at the land checkpoints during a pilot project which resulted in congestion. Like Mr Khoo, Singaporean Ben Lee is also unable to apply for a used car he purchased in 2022 for VEP because it was registered under a previous owner in the system. The 49-year-old, who is in technical sales, is required to drive from Singapore to parts of Malaysia like Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh once every two weeks to meet clients for his job. Therefore resolving the issue is crucial for his work, he said. “If you look at the history of how Malaysia keeps wanting to implement VEP, but then keeps postponing, it has been a flop, and this time might be a flop again,” said Mr Lee. He told CNA that he hopes the deadline is extended beyond Oct 1 so that it gives him more time to contact the car’s previous owner. “They might extend it one more time or maybe not implement it at all,” he added. Mr Seah Kim Por, a 71-year-old who is operational director for an electronics firm, told CNA that he had applied for a VEP in 2019, and that it was expiring in October 2024. He told CNA that the JPJ portal did not offer a section for users to renew the VEP application. He has sent multiple emails to JPJ and has not received any response. “I was one of the few diligent drivers who applied for it back in 2019 and now, because of this, I might have trouble travelling after October,” he added. “It should be much easier for me to extend it and not be left to worry about this. You want to implement something but don’t want to make it easy for those who already signed up early on,” said Mr Seah. Another Singaporean facing issues is Ms Nurliyana Salleh, who is a private-hire car driver. The 34-year-old told CNA that she is unable to register her car because it is leased from a rental company. “I don’t own the car so my rental company has to do it but they have not done so. I’m not sure how to proceed,” she said, adding that she enters Johor Bahru every week. CNA contacted some rental companies in Singapore to ask whether they would be applying for VEP on behalf of their clients. Current Leasing, a firm which rents out to private-hire drivers including from regional platform Gojek, told CNA that only 30 per cent of its hirers enter Malaysia, and it added that it plans to work with JPJ to ensure that drivers who need the VEP will not be inconvenienced. However, general manager of Current Leasing Shaun Lee told CNA that the process for applying has been difficult because the requirements are “neither robust nor versatile” and as a result, the company has been unable to complete the registration process for its fleet. Mr Lee explained that for instance, JPJ requires that each vehicle be tied to a TouchNGo e-wallet but this is challenging as the company would be encumbered administratively as they would be required to open an e-wallet account for each car. “This is not practical as it either means we have to create an equal number of e-wallets as the number of vehicles, or we simply use one e-wallet for all cars and risk not knowing how much each vehicle chalked up,” said Mr Lee. Some Singapore drivers have elected to travel physically down to the TCSens office in Danga Bay, Johor Bahru to seek help on issues they face. When CNA visited the TCsens office on Wednesday (Jun 12) morning, there was a crowd of around 40 people waiting for their turn after collecting a queue ticket. Another driver who wanted to be known only as Mr Leow told CNA the entire process had been “troublesome” as his application via the JPJ portal had initially failed, as he had logged into an old system used for VEP registration. He told CNA that he also faced technical issues with the new portal which was put forth by JPJ following the Ministry of Transport’s announcement in end-May. It reflected his registration status as submitted, when in fact his application also failed as it contained his vehicle's insurance which had expired, added Mr Leow. His application eventually went through after he updated his current car insurance details for resubmission. He then decided to travel to the TCSens office on Wednesday to get his RFID sticker installed physically in Johor Bahru, where he had to wait for around an hour before he was attended to. Mr Leow outlined that the entire process was \"complicated\" and \"confusing\" and can be better streamlined. The official from TCSens told CNA that JPJ is willing to provide solutions for these issues. He said that for the case of drivers with their cars tied to the VEP of a previous owner, they should try to contact the former owner of the dealer to deregister. Failing this, they should contact JPJ via email or any of the department’s social media platforms to request that the existing VEP be deregistered - by providing the necessary documents - so that they may reapply. “It’s important that we validate which person is the rightful owner of the car, there are cases where people who don’t own the car apply for a VEP and if we allow this to happen, it will compromise security,” he added. Additionally, for those seeking to renew their VEP which may be expiring soon, the official said that these drivers will receive an email a month before the expiry and they would be able to renew by following instructions from that email. He added that TCSens and JPJ were committed to ensure that it addresses all queries, and that it has many open lines of communications including via email, social media accounts and via its hotline. CNA has sent queries to JPJ and Malaysia’s Ministry of Transport on how it intends to address the issues some of these drivers face and whether it might consider pushing back the implementation beyond Oct 1 to give drivers more time to prepare. Malaysia automotive industry analyst Hezeri Samsuri told CNA that it might be more productive for drivers to come down to the TCSens office in Danga Bay, Johor Bahru to resolve these issues in person as JPJ might be unable to cope with the volume of emails and calls it receives. “Coming down in person is the best and quickest way to get these matters resolved,” said Mr Hezeri. He added that Singapore drivers who are not willing to apply for VEP because of the fact that they have to submit a copy of their identity card and COE, must realise that the Singapore government also requires Malaysian motorists to submit similar documents for its VEP and Autopass Card. Singapore’s Land Transport Authority requires foreign motorists willing to apply for VEP and the Autopass card are required to submit a copy of their identity card or passport as well as a vehicle registration certificate, in addition to other documents. “We surrender everything when we want to drive into Singapore as well so I don’t see what’s the fuss,” said Mr Hezeri. “VEP is part of Malaysia’s plan to monitor the quantity of cars in the country for urban planning, and also to safeguard our borders,” he added.

Refugee children after class at a non-governmental organisation in Selayang, Selangor. (Photo: CNA/Fadza Ishak) This audio is generated by an AI tool. KUALA LUMPUR: The TikTok video is simple and straightforward. Mr Sophian Mohd Zain faces the camera and goes on a three-minute rant about Rohingya refugees in Malaysia. “They came as illegal immigrants, then they stole citizens’ rights,” Mr Sophian said in the video posted on Jun 2, accusing these refugees of using their United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) card to live in Malaysia “for as long as they wish”. Many netizens in the comments section supported his rhetoric. “It is because Malaysia enables them,” one replied. A quick check of Mr Sophian’s TikTok accounts - of which he has several - reveals he has posted other videos slamming the immigration situation in the country, with some showing him speaking loudly to the camera in front of members of the refugee community. Mr Sophian told CNA he started posting videos about Rohingya refugees in Malaysia to raise public awareness on how they seem to be living in the country for many years, when their stay is only supposed to be temporary. “The government should immediately engage with UNHCR and urgently send these refugees to a third country,” the 49-year-old businessman said. Other negative comments on social media about Rohingya refugees in Malaysia often follow a few common threads: They are running small businesses illegally, eating into the country’s jobs and resources, and constantly growing in number. Mr Sophian rejected suggestions that his videos were xenophobic, saying that those who accuse him as such were putting “humanitarian rights before the rights of Malaysians”. “When Rohingya refugees work and do business, they are already snatching at the rights of locals,” he said. In contrast, a search for “Palestine refugees in Malaysia” on TikTok does not turn up such negative sentiments. The videos usually centre around Malaysia’s support for the Palestinian cause, and informal interviews with Palestinians living in Malaysia. At least two Reddit threads have called out what appears to be a difference in how Malaysians perceive Rohingya and Palestinian refugees. “Why do Malaysians put so much effort into helping Palestinians, when in your own region, the Rohingya … faced a considerable amount (of) xenophobia in Malaysia” one asked. Activists have taken notice too. Ms Lubna Sheikh Ghazali of Asylum Access Malaysia said the country championed the Palestinian cause but seemed to have “double standards” when it came to Rohingya refugees. “We seem to have collective amnesia and are selective about who deserves protection,” she was quoted by Free Malaysia Today as saying at a human rights forum on Mar 19. According to UNHCR figures as of May this year, Malaysia hosts about 189,340 refugees and asylum-seekers. When someone crosses an international border seeking safety, they often need to apply to be legally recognised as a refugee, which in Malaysia’s case is indicated by the possession of a UNHCR card. Asylum-seekers are people who intend to request for international protection, or are awaiting a decision on this request. Not every asylum-seeker will ultimately be recognised as a refugee. Some 88 per cent of refugees and asylum-seekers in Malaysia are from Myanmar, including around 109,230 Rohingyas. The remaining are from 50 other countries, including Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Syria. There are at least 620 Palestinian refugees and asylum-seekers in Malaysia, according to UNHCR figures, although some reports have indicated there could be as many as 2,500 of them in the country, with 30 per cent of these being students. Despite that, Malaysia is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and its related 1967 protocol, meaning refugees cannot work legally or go to government schools. Instead, refugees are considered undocumented or illegal migrants under the Immigration Act, and depend on non-governmental organisations (NGO) such as the Malaysia-based Refugee Emergency Fund for financial aid. While the UNHCR card provides a 50 per cent discount on foreigner fees for refugees receiving treatment at public hospitals, it does not offer any further financial benefits. But as the Israel-Hamas war erupted in Gaza near the end of 2023, a bipartisan parliamentary group on refugee policy called on the government to issue a “Special Pass” for all Palestinians in Malaysia to allow them temporary stay and work. Malaysia’s government - a long-time supporter of the Palestinian cause - then said it would cover the study fees of Palestinian students at public universities, while those studying at private institutes would receive discounts of between 10 to 100 per cent. On the other hand, a 2023 initiative to allow Rohingya refugees to study at the International Islamic University of Malaysia was made possible only through a grant from the Qatar Fund for Development. Meanwhile, authorities’ raids on illegal Rohingya settlements and businesses are prominently highlighted in the media. Dr Benjamin Loh, a senior lecturer in media and communication at Taylor’s University, told CNA that Palestinians in Malaysia are not perceived as refugees - despite their official status as such - but as educated people who will one day return to the Middle East to fight for their land. “But for the Rohingyas, there is this rhetoric that they are considered a low-class type of migrant,” he said, arguing that unlike the Palestinians, Rohingya refugees are seen as stateless people who ran from their country. “So, they are considered to add very little value as they only work in low-wage types of jobs. As a result of that, there is this sort of a very xenophobic view towards them, because they’re not seen as being beneficial to the country,” said Dr Loh. On May 24, the UN human rights office warned of “frightening and disturbing reports” about the impact of new violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine state, pointing to new attacks on Rohingya civilians by the military and an ethnic armed group fighting it. A spokesperson for the office cited the burning of the town of Buthidaung, as well as air strikes, reports of shootings at unarmed fleeing villagers, beheadings and disappearances. A 2022 study on the Malaysian public’s stereotypes of refugees in the country, conducted by researchers from the Asia School of Business, suggested that physical appearance also plays a part in the difference in perceptions. Dr Melati Nungsari, an associate professor of economics at the school, said while focus group participants were asked to share their thoughts about refugees in Malaysia in general, some of the participants started referring to looks. A total of 47 participants “widely sourced” from the general Malaysian public were interviewed across six sessions. Common negative stereotypes include the participants saying that refugees commit crime and are a burden to others. “Sometimes they'd say, ‘This group, because they're fair, they're somehow better human beings. Because this group is darker, therefore, they're not so good and they're dirty,’” Dr Melati said while sharing preliminary findings of the study at a refugee conference on Wednesday (Jun 12). Dr Loh echoed the study’s findings, noting that Middle Eastern refugees in Malaysia, with their fairer skin and blue eyes, are seen as more valuable to the country. “There's prestige to hosting such refugees, but not refugees who are dark-skinned and of that sort, even though everybody in this story is technically Muslim,” he said. Some netizens on the Reddit threads have attempted to justify the difference in perception between the Palestinians and the Rohingyas. One user said the Rohingyas were “economic refugees” unlike the Palestinian “political refugees”, although it has been widely reported that both groups are essentially fleeing persecution at home. The user also wrote that Palestinian refugees, after finishing their education, will “go back to their country to serve their people”. This is in contrast to the Rohingyas who wish to “stay forever” and “have dozens of kids”. Rohingya community leader Rafik Shah Mohd Ismail, 48, told CNA that many Rohingya refugees in Malaysia prefer to be resettled in a third country that grants asylum-seekers permanent stay, like the United States, Canada or Australia. But the process could take years as UNHCR must first filter out a large number of refugees amid a limited number of spots in these often unwilling countries, he said. “Some of the Rohingya refugees have been here for 20 to 30 years without getting it,” he said, noting that only those in “extreme difficulty” will get accepted. In 2017, UNHCR made only 2,379 resettlement submissions for refugees in Malaysia, with 2,061 of them successfully resettled. UNHCR said it assesses refugees’ needs and refers them for resettlement in close collaboration with the governments of resettlement and host countries, NGOs and civil society actors, and the refugees themselves. “Only a small number can be resettled, so UNHCR prioritises those with urgent or emergency protection needs and those who have been in long-term displacement,” it said. In January, Malaysia urged the UNHCR to expedite the resettlement of refugees and asylum-seekers living in the country, citing the “principle of burden and responsibility sharing”. A 2019 report by Malaysia’s Institute of Strategic and International Studies stated that Malaysia has carried a bigger burden and provided more opportunities to refugees than some countries that are signatories to the UN convention and protocol. The report for instance named Australia and Japan, which are “notorious” for their stringent policies on migrants and asylum-seekers. In 2014, only 6.6 per cent, or 13,768 people in Australia’s entire permanent migration programme was permanently settled on humanitarian grounds, while Japan rejected 99 per cent of asylum applications it received in 2015, the report noted. Mr Rafik also dismissed the notion that the Rohingyas were economic refugees, pointing out that many of them owned fishing boats and swathes of farmland back home before they were threatened with torture and murder and had their villages burnt down. In fact, many of them would prefer to return to Myanmar if their safety could be guaranteed, he said, warning that the current situation remains extremely volatile. “Some have tried going back in secret but ended up getting killed,” he added. Mr Rafik attributed the differing treatment of Rohingya and Palestinian refugees to how the latter’s conflict is covered widely in mainstream and social media, as opposed to the patchy flow of information coming from Myanmar. “Therefore, sympathy here tilts towards the Palestinians,” he said. “What Malaysians don’t know is that (the situation in Gaza) is almost identical to what is happening in Myanmar.” But Mr Rafik refused to call it double standards and to blame the Malaysian government, saying that the country has accepted the Rohingyas and has every right to decide how to handle the community in accordance with its laws. “I just ask for a little empathy and understanding from locals,” he said, pointing out that Rohingyas in Malaysia could be seen as dirty as they can usually only afford to live in overcrowded homes, and that they still needed to make ends meet even though they cannot work legally. “We are just refugees; we don’t want to be a burden to the locals.” Mr Charles Santiago, a former Member of Parliament (MP) and chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Parliamentarians for Human Rights, acknowledged the “racism” of some locals towards Rohingya refugees. Palestinians are “quoted very positively” in the media, while the Rohingyas are sometimes labelled as “dirty and filthy”, he told CNA. Mr Santiago said both Palestinians and Rohingyas are refugees who are escaping persecution and should be treated the same way. “Rohingyas are all by and large okay. The local community should support the Rohingyas, which is what happened many years ago. And now they have turned against them,” he said. “This is something the government has to address before it becomes a very real problem.” There are also signs that the same problems are festering in local sentiments towards Palestinian refugees. Dr Loh from Taylor’s University co-authored a study of social media comments that suggested Malaysians’ support for the Palestinians appeared to be rhetorical or limited. Data was collected from three social media sites - X, Lowyat.net, and cari.com.my - between Oct 7 and Dec 6 last year. Palestinian support in Malaysia, the study found, stopped short of accepting more Palestinian refugees and according them rights to live and study in the country. “The core of their argument was that they supported the Palestinian fight to protect their homeland and, thus, accepting Palestinians as refugees would be counter to that goal,” the co-authors wrote in a Fulcrum post published in February. “They argued that if Palestinians were allowed to become refugees, they would be no better than the Rohingya.” Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Malaysia saw considerable support for the Rohingyas, with political parties organising large rallies advocating for their cause. This came about after the largest exodus of Rohingya refugees began in August 2017 following a massive wave of violence that swept through Myanmar’s Rakhine state. But at the height of the pandemic, the Rohingyas were accused of spreading the coronavirus, while hate speech calling for violence against Rohingyas and other undocumented migrants spread widely online. When congregation sizes were restricted, a mosque in Johor put up a controversial sign saying Rohingyas were not welcome. A Rohingya activist was also falsely said to have demanded Malaysian citizenship, attracting widespread anger and death threats. The activist, Mr Zafar Ahmad Abdul Ghani, said he continues to feel unsafe living in Malaysia and urged the authorities to take action against online hate speech targeted at the Rohingya community. “I hope Malaysia can engage its ASEAN partners to find a solution for Myanmar,” he told CNA. Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim recently said that ASEAN member states need to unite in facing the crisis in Myanmar, considering the death toll there and the conflict’s impact on the region. While speaking at the 37th Asia-Pacific Roundtable in Kuala Lumpur on Jun 6, Mr Anwar also gave hints that he will push for ASEAN to be tougher on its member Myanmar, where pro-democracy guerrillas and ethnic minority armed forces are battling the country’s military. Dr Muhammed Abdul Khalid, a research fellow at the Institute of Malaysian and International Studies, said warm local sentiment towards the Rohingyas turned due to various socio-political factors, including the pandemic and economic pressures. “There is a risk that sentiment towards Palestinian refugees could follow a similar trajectory if not addressed proactively,” he told CNA. “To prevent this, it is crucial to foster continuous public education and awareness about the plight of all refugees, emphasising their humanity and potential contributions to society.” Dr Melati at the Asia School of Business said her study showed that while participants had xenophobic sentiments towards refugees, they also felt conflicted by positive thoughts, like how refugees were forced into their predicament and continue to be exploited in their host countries. The study found a roughly equal number of sentiments coded as positive and negative stereotypes. “So there's a lot of conflict, which to me shows quite a bit of possibilities for interventions,” she said, expressing hope that the general public could change their minds about refugees. “I was thinking about specific media campaigns to try and encourage not only positive portrayals (of refugees), but volunteering or something that gets people more into the refugee community is something that could really help in trying to reduce the negative stereotypes towards refugees.” One way the government could play its part, observers said, is to introduce policies that allow refugees to work legally. The former MP Mr Santiago said refugees provide readymade alternatives to migrant workers in certain sectors, noting that some employers already prefer hiring refugees as they do not need to fork out extra accommodation fees. “The government needs to engage the local refugee community and conduct an analysis in terms of what skill sets they have together with what we need,” he said, pointing out that some refugees can work in skilled jobs as well. Mr Santiago said the government should also try convincing locals that refugees can contribute to the country by working legally in a system that does not compromise national security. “If you don’t try, you won’t know,” he added. “It’s got to do with a law-and-order issue, but it’s time to look at refugees in Malaysia as a development issue.” Malaysia’s National Security Council, which handles refugee policy, has amended its directive that provides for the management of refugees and asylum-seekers in Malaysia. “Under this new directive, major changes have been approved including registering the refugees into (the) national system, access to employment opportunity, healthcare and also education,” said a government response issued in October 2023 and published by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. The response did not elaborate on the “major changes”, while Mr Santiago said the government has yet to outline policies based on the new directive “openly”. Malaysia’s Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said in March that the government will conduct a comprehensive study with UNHCR to allow refugees to work in specific sectors of the country. Human Resources Minister Steven Sim told parliament on Mar 26 that his ministry has the capacity to run training programmes that can help refugees upskill, in preparation for formal work only in sectors \"not favoured by locals\" and dominated by migrant workers. \"Therefore, job opportunities for the local workforce will not be affected,\" he said. Despite that, Mr Sim said any formalisation of employment for refugees will first depend on the issuance of official registration documents, a security initiative aimed at monitoring their whereabouts in the country. The Home Affairs ministry is still working on this initiative together with the Immigration Department, he said. \"Any implementation of training programmes for refugees will be done on a government basis and in accordance with prevailing laws,\" he added. \"At the same time, if the government agrees to this programme, it needs to consider the implication of incurring extra expenditure, given that the current training budget is set aside for Malaysian citizens only.\" Dr Loh feels the government is reluctant to give the sizeable Rohingya population employment rights, or evict all of them, for fear of pushback from locals or the international community, respectively. He cited how during the pandemic in 2020, the Sabah government scrapped a plan to issue a single identity card for foreigners living in the state as part of security efforts to monitor undocumented migrants, citing complaints from Sabahans who did not want to see it implemented. Sabah has long grappled with the issue of illegal migrants, mainly from the Philippines and Indonesia. “There was no pathway to citizenship for any of them, but it was met with so much public backlash that they just abandoned it entirely,” Dr Loh said. “There is a sense that the government is just so afraid to present anything that is seen as legalising or making this entire situation more formal.” Dr Muhammed said the government needs to have the political will to develop a refugee policy that not only respects human rights but also benefits the country's economy. Misconceptions among locals that refugees will take away local jobs, commit crimes or encourage other refugees to come to Malaysia, are often fueled by irresponsible political rhetoric and not based on facts, he said. “Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that legalising refugees and allowing them to work can generate positive economic impacts for the host country,” he said. “Refugees contribute to the economy by filling labour shortages, paying taxes, and stimulating demand for goods and services. These contributions can lead to job creation and economic growth, benefiting local residents as well.” Mr Abdel Halim Mansour Abu Namous, a Palestinian refugee who arrived in Malaysia in 2014, hopes the country introduces laws that facilitate employment for refugees. “I hope that the government recognises the rights of refugees in general so that we can live in stability,” said the 41-year-old, who runs a home-based business serving Palestinian food. “Unfortunately, here there is no future for refugees. We only struggle and strive to work for survival.” When asked what he feels about the negative sentiment towards Rohingya refugees, Mr Abdel Halim said he would rather not speak about this. “Generally speaking as refugees, it’s sensitive and we could be in danger,” he said. Mr Abdel Halim said he interacts with locals with “caution and morals” as they are the “owners of the country”. He plans to remain patient until he finds a solution for the future of his family, as he lamented the state of his homeland amid the current war. “In the end, I say thank you Malaysia for everything.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

(File photo: REUTERS/Stringer) NEW DELHI: The death toll has climbed to 54 from consumption of tainted liquor in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu, with more than 100 people still in hospital, a government official said on Saturday (Jun 22). Nearly 200 people have been treated since Wednesday for vomiting, stomach aches and diarrhoea, after drinking liquor spiked with methanol in the district of Kallakurichi, about 250km from Chennai, the state capital. Law enforcement officials investigating the incident have arrested seven people, said M.S. Prasanth, a senior district official, adding that follow-up action was being taken against liquor sellers and brewers in the district. Deaths from illegally produced alcohol, often called country liquor, are a regular occurrence in India, where few can afford branded spirits, despite public demands for a crackdown on the vendors. The state government said it was taking steps to identify those involved in the production of methanol, a toxic chemical normally used for industrial purposes.

    "article_content": "Asia Asia \"Dirty noodles” made from cassava originated in Yogyakarta and shot to international fame in 2017, thanks to former United States president Barack Obama. Mie lethek’s revival continues, but the owner of one of two remaining factories has no plans to increase production. This audio is generated by an AI tool. BANTUL, Indonesia: Enclosed by weathered walls, time appears to stand still at an 80-year-old noodle factory in southern Java. At one corner, a man guides an ox along a sunken circular path. Carrying a wooden beam on its shoulder, the ox slowly turns a one tonne millstone around a concrete basin filled to the brim with dried cassava. At another corner, workers place blocks of dough and noodles on the bamboo shelves of a wood-fired chamber, where they are steamed for 90 minutes. The two dozen workers in the factory, located in Bantul regency of Indonesia’s Yogyakarta province, use production techniques that have existed for thousands of years. The only sign of modernity are several hydraulic presses which turn the dough into noodles. These modern machines are safer than the factory’s manual press of the past, said factory owner Yasir Feri Ismatrada, 49. Before the old press was retired a few years ago, workers had to jump and hold on to its lever, using their weight to compress the dough inside. When the wooden lever became slippery, workers often fell and sprained their ankles or hit their head on the hard factory floor. The cassava noodles produced are called “mie lethek”, which literally means “dirty noodles” because of their dull brown colour. Compared to other types of noodles such as bihun or rice noodles , mie lethek is more savoury and has a chewier texture. Despite its rich history, mie lethek nearly disappeared from Yogyakarta’s food landscape when instant noodles became popular from the 1970s. Mr Yasir’s Mie Garuda factory was among those that had to close shop until mie lethek saw a revival in the early 2000s. By then, he was only one of a handful of cassava noodle makers who heeded the renewed interest and restarted the business; others had given up due to the complexity of the manufacturing process. Mr Yasir’s factory is now one of only two mie lethek factories in Indonesia still using traditional methods and techniques. Mr Yasir’s grandfather, Umar Bisri Nahdi, is credited as the creator of mie lethek. Mr Umar was preaching Islam in Bantul in the 1930s and 1940s when he noticed that people there were starving. At the time, the Dutch colonial rulers controlled virtually every type of food with the exception of cassava, also known as tapioca, which they saw little economic value in. The preacher, who acquired knowledge of noodle making from his wife’s family, who was ethnic Chinese, began to produce noodles from cassava to feed the poor. The noodles proved to be so popular that in 1940 – when Indonesia was still known as the Dutch East Indies – Mr Umar converted his house into a makeshift factory, employing locals in his neighbourhood to help out. Soon, mie lethek became a staple in most Bantul households and roadside vendors began selling them. With the arrival of cheap and ubiquitous instant noodles in the 1970s and 1980s, mie lethek manufacturers found themselves unable to compete. Mr Yasir’s family closed the factory in 1982. Two decades later, health and food safety concerns led to a turnaround in mie lethek’s fortunes. Mr Yasir revived the factory in 2002 after his uncles convinced him that \"the noodles we were making were healthy noodles\". Indonesia was also gripped with news of borax and formaldehyde poisoning. A series of cases where people died after consuming food laden with preservatives and additives prompted widespread interest in organic food. “Our noodles are completely organic. Our cassava (sourced from farmers) doesn't involve pesticides . We don’t use preservatives or additives and our (production) process is very traditional,” he said. Mie lethek continues to be a hit with health-conscious consumers. One of the establishments Mr Yasir supplies to is Mbah Mendes, a restaurant run by businessman Hanny Susilo. Mr Hanny said he was drawn to the noodles’ complex taste, labour-intensive production process and rich history when he set up his eatery exclusively serving mie lethek dishes in 2014. “This is a noodle that is unique to Bantul. Out of all the noodles out there, this is the hardest to make because it still uses traditional methods,” the 64-year-old told CNA at his restaurant in Yogyakarta city. Among the dishes the Obamas savoured during their 10-day trip to Indonesia was mie lethek which, until then, was not widely known outside of Yogyakarta. “Restaurants were fighting to get their hands on mie lethek,” Mr Hanny said. “If it weren’t because I know Mr Yasir personally, my restaurant would struggle to secure a steady supply of mie lethek. It was suddenly that popular.” Although demand is surging, it is hard for Indonesia’s two surviving mie lethek factories to increase production. “Because we do almost everything manually, the production process takes longer,” said Mr Yasir. Mr Yasir estimates demand is four times what he can produce but, to keep the noodles affordable, he has maintained its price at 80,000 rupiah (US$4.90) for five kilogrammes. He said he is not planning to increase output. One reason is that there are not many experienced artisans around today. He believes that replacing these skilled workers with machines and automating some of the processes would mean sacrificing quality. The ox-driven mills used to grind dried cassava into flour have also been recognised as a national intangible cultural heritage by the Indonesian ministry of education and culture for the past five years. This spurs Mr Yasir to do all he can to keep the age-old practice alive. Traditional methods are “quite laborious”, but “if we use machines… replace the millstone with metal ones for example, the taste will be different”, he said. “This is why we try to keep things the way they are.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

SINGAPORE: The closure of Thambi Magazine Store in Holland Village last month replayed a familiar scene in Singapore. A beloved place, fondly remembered by multiple generations, decides to shut down after several years of declining demand and insurmountable obstacles. Upon hearing about the imminent closure, Singaporeans would emerge from their social media activity caves to, well, indulge in more social media activity by filming, photographing and (albeit rightfully) bemoaning the loss of what they’d describe as yet another piece of Singapore's identity. Often, they’d also panic buy from the very places they had not patronised for decades. Because, as one would say in Singlish, “last chance mah”. Despite what appears to be a superficial engagement with the past, I believe that such last-minute action and reaction - and this is common throughout the world - is an indication of just how important the past, and heritage, is to people. There is another viewpoint though, and that is that the loss of Thambi and other places like the old Raffles Junior College Mt Sinai campus is inevitable and, in some ways, necessary. It suggests that one must keep moving forward, and being sentimental about the past does not do anyone any favours. This view also casts progress (often economic) and pastness (often cultural) as polar opposites. The past, couched in feelings of nostalgia, lacks purpose and usefulness. This is especially so of places that are neglected or lack novelty for financial gain. Nostalgia becomes an enemy that stymies society’s evolution. Such a view is of course simplistic and does not recognise the very real value that the past has for our everyday lives. Many individuals and organisations, like the Singapore Heritage Society, have advocated for preserving monuments, institutions and places that are deeply connected to our Singaporean heritage. Heritage, especially places of heritage, serves as active and constant connections to who we were and how we became to be. The emotions of losing a place, even a neglected one, cannot simply be dismissed as sentimentality. Rather, that sense of loss is partly about losing a sense of continuity, an anchor to something or somewhere. Thankfully, there have been many instances in the last few years where the past has taken precedence over a “development at all costs” or “carte blanche” approach to spaces and places in Singapore. The preservation of several buildings from the Old Police Academy along Thomson Road is very good example of such thinking. Whilst walking through Bras Basah Complex a few weeks ago, I also encountered the Toast Box branch that had taken over Music Book Room’s unit. The coffee joint has a music-inspired theme and kept key elements like Music Book Room’s signage and flooring. Some might criticise this as a token attempt at preserving the past, but I thought it was at least a nod towards acknowledging what has come before and, more importantly, what new things could emerge from the old. Thus, rather than destroying everything and starting from a blank slate, taking the time to see how past and present can co-exist offers more opportunities for society to express itself. Geographers often like to distinguish between the terms space and place. Space is the physical environment that individuals live in, but place is space made meaningful. More importantly, place only exists because individuals take the time to make it meaningful. Architecture, or the built environment, is one important way of making a place. Buildings, monuments, even small things like decorations, shrines, kiosks and stalls all contribute to how a place gains its character and meaning. Our memories and meanings of a place are embedded not just in tangible things like architecture, but also in the lives we have led in these places. Recently, when news came out that the old Raffles Junior College campus on Mt Sinai Road was marked for demolition, scores of alumni showed up. They were, of course, not just there for the building, but for the years of memories and experiences shared there. Yet, these intangible memories and experiences are difficult to remember, sense or feel if there is nothing tangible to tie them to. More than 2000 Rafflesians visited the old RJC campus at Mt Sinai. It was a carnival like atmosphere with many... This is why we need to preserve and sustain more places. And these should not just be places that are economically or politically important, but also those that embody the everyday lives of everyday citizens. More importantly, we must work harder to sustain the institutions we do not want to lose, rather than trying to document them when we hear of their demise. When preservation becomes physically impossible, then we need to be much more creative about the way we remember. Communities are strikingly clever when it comes to adapting and reimagining old places. A recent social experiment in Peace Centre - which saw the abandoned mall transformed into an arts haven complete with graffiti covering the entrance - was a joy to behold even if it was only for a short while. Peace Centre is an example of what happens when grassroots, people-centred initiatives work. A post shared by The Lady’s adventures (@musingsbythelady) But not everything can stay the same, and while Singaporeans mourn the loss of old institutions, we simultaneously forget the old in favour of the new. Like many, I am guilty of walking past Thambi whenever I visited Holland Village and never stopping to buy a magazine. To me, Thambi was an important landmark that was core to the character of the place , yet I did little to support its longevity. Yet the past can afford us many opportunities to become more creative, more expressive of our identities. In this spirit, I offer two possibilities for how we might be able to cherish a place. One, if it is a business we remember fondly, show some love by being a customer. Many older businesses survive on regulars rather than walk-ins. Two, because we never know when a place we cherish will disappear, perhaps it is time to turn our attention away from our phones and relish just being somewhere. Too often we are hunched over, desperate for a dopamine hit on social media, ignoring all that is around us. And what if you must use your phone? Where possible (and permitted), you could make use of your phone’s other camera - you know, the one that isn’t the selfie cam - and document what you see, feel and want to remember.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary The continued growth of subscriptions demonstrates a broader change in the consumer mindset, says Stripe’s Sarita Singh. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Need some new clothes for a wedding? There’s a subscription for it. Need a car for a couple of months? There’s a subscription for that. How about tailored meal kits for yourself - and your dog? You guessed it, there’s a subscription for those too. From Netflix and Spotify to mobile phones and even furniture and home appliances, it seems like almost everything can be accessed on a subscription basis today. So much so that the idea of owning things outright is starting to feel a bit old-fashioned. In the past, possessions were a big deal for our parents and grandparents. The pride of owning a home and the tangible sense of security from owning valuable items were important. For them, ownership wasn't just about having things; it was a testament to hard work, success and stability. However, as the subscription economy gains traction, this traditional view of ownership is being challenged. According to FT Strategies, a specialist media consultancy owned by the Financial Times, half of consumers say that subscriptions enable them to access products, services and a lifestyle that they otherwise would not have. Is the shift towards subscriptions today really the future of consumerism? Can subscribing actually replace buying? While subscriptions may have transformed the typical shopping experience, the concept is not new. In fact, the first subscription service as we know it launched in 1856 when sewing machine company Singer offered customers the chance to rent a machine for US$3 a month. Fast forward more than 160 years, our subscription options have grown far beyond sewing machines. In Singapore, for instance, tech subscription services such as Circular and ITEZ.SG allow customers to lease gadgets such as mobile phones, laptops and gaming consoles. A three-month subscription for a brand new 128GB Apple iPhone 15, for example, costs S$79 (US$58) a month. Customers can also subscribe to new or refurbished items such as dishwashers, refrigerators and vacuum cleaners with Levande by Electrolux. A dishwasher, for example, costs from S$72.99 a month. In Japan, accommodation service TsugiTsugi offers plans that enable guests to stay at any of its 140 resorts, inns or hotels nationwide during the subscription period, at multiple cost tier levels. This is fuelling the trend of “everything-as-a-service” where consumers and businesses can subscribe to services in all aspects of their lives, without huge upfront payments. But how far will this shift take us, and what could hold it back? According to UBS, the subscription economy is expected to swell to US$1.5 trillion by 2025, making it one of the fastest-growing industries globally. The continued growth of subscriptions demonstrates a broader change in the consumer mindset. That is, we increasingly value access and experience, over ownership. The newest generation of consumers is a big contributor to this trend. Gen Zs , generally defined as those born between 1997 and 2012, are quick to sign up for subscription models as long as they allow for personalisation and flexibility, according to research from Recurly . At the other end of the spectrum, Baby Boomers - those born from 1946 to 1964 - are particularly reluctant to commit to a subscription, according to a Deloitte report. The report also showed that financial incentives are the most important factor inducing customers to subscribe, followed by convenience and access to premium offerings. In a rapidly changing world where lifestyles and preferences evolve, consumers appreciate the ability to switch between different products or services without long-term commitment. By lowering barriers to entry, particularly for expensive items like electronics or luxury goods, subscriptions also help democratise access to goods and services across socioeconomic groups. As this subscription revolution continues to unfold, it's not just about convenience or cost savings. Another significant advantage is sustainability. Singapore generates about 60,000 tonnes of electronic waste annually, the equivalent to each person throwing away 70 mobile phones a year. Subscriptions allow consumers to reduce waste by accessing products only when needed, rather than purchasing items that may go unused or underutilised. This shift aligns with growing environmental consciousness and the desire to minimise our ecological footprint. But there are potential pitfalls and challenges. Customers can easily lose track of how many subscriptions they’ve signed up for, leading to unexpected charges and a ballooning monthly expenditure. Subscribers also need to feel they’re getting their money’s worth on a regular basis, or they’ll stop paying. With living costs on the rise, price sensitivity is also a growing concern. Businesses must strike the right balance: Charge too much, and you scare off potential customers; charge too little, and you risk devaluing your service or leaving revenue on the table. Companies that offer subscription packages typically do so on flat rates (monthly, quarterly, or annual fees) or usage-based (the more you use, the more you pay). Given current inflation trends, price cuts are not an option for most subscription services, as they too are grappling with rising costs. So how do businesses attract new subscribers? One strategy is to implement free trials. According to a study by Stripe in eight countries, 74 per cent of business-to-consumer (B2C) leaders believe that free trials are an effective way to gain new subscribers. So, what does the future hold for the subscription economy? As companies compete for subscription dollars, it’s likely consumers will see more innovation and better deals. We can also expect more personalisation, with AI-driven recommendations tailoring subscriptions to our individual tastes. Ultimately, the growth of the subscription economy reflects a fundamental change in how we view consumption and ownership, emphasising a desire for variety, flexibility, and a continuous flow of new experiences. In this new era, ownership might not hold the same weight it once did, but the essence of what it provided - security, stability, and a sense of achievement - remains as important as ever. It’s just that now, these goals are being achieved in different way. Sarita Singh is the Managing Director for SEA, India, and China at Stripe.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Apple’s deal with OpenAI acknowledges the company is behind on artificial intelligence, but make no mistake, it’s temporary outsourcing, says Dave Lee for Bloomberg Opinion. NEW YORK: Over the past year and a half, many have been desperate to share a stage with artificial intelligence wunderkind Sam Altman . Microsoft couldn’t wait to wheel out the OpenAI co-founder to show how ahead of the game it was; world leaders stood beside him to show how they were in the loop on the future; and conference organisers contorted their schedules to accommodate the most powerful man in the world of AI. Yet, while Altman was in attendance at Apple’s developer conference on Monday, he was a spectator like almost everyone else. It was disappointing for him, you might think, because it was arguably the most significant public moment so far in OpenAI’s short history: ChatGPT is on the cusp of gaining hundreds of millions of new users through the world’s most popular devices. Beginning later this year, iPhone, iPad and Mac users - if they own a sufficiently up-to-date model - will be directed to ChatGPT to answer complex queries that need “world context.” The news is being framed as Apple’s admission that it is behind on cutting-edge AI, turning to an outsider to fill in a feature shortfall. This is true, but only to an extent. This partnership - call it temporary outsourcing - demonstrates how, in fact, Cook may be the most powerful man in AI because he is pulling the strings on what will be the first truly mainstream AI device: The iPhone. Previously, I have argued that Apple has ample time to get AI integration right and should resist being forced to bombard users with AI functionality just because Wall Street demands a quick way to boost iPhone sales. By making many of these new features an opt-in beta - meaning only users who seek them out will use them, for now - Apple is smartly threading that needle. Part of Apple’s strategy is to draw clear distinctions between its own “AI” - which stands for Apple Intelligence - and the characteristics of existing AI - that is, artificial intelligence. Apple Intelligence mostly happens on its devices, making it inherently more secure and faster to respond than queries that have to be sent to the cloud. It can draw on “personal context about users, data it has purely because the iPhone is central to many digital lives - emails, calendars, text messages, pictures and apps”. This volume of insight is impossible for any other company to replicate, and you would likely not trust them to do so. “You should not have to hand over all the details of your life to be warehoused and analysed in someone’s AI cloud,” said Apple’s head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, during the keynote speech. (Apple’s cloud is fine, naturally.) OpenAI’s ChatGPT, on the other hand, is more easily copied - in time. Apple hasn’t quite managed it yet, but it will. For now, though, it has begrudgingly turned to OpenAI, though ChatGPT’s presence on Apple devices is presented more as a disclosure than an enthusiastic shout-out. Each time a piece of information is sent to OpenAI’s servers, the user will be alerted and must give permission. What’s more, the integration won’t mean any new direct customers for OpenAI because queries will be made free and without the need to sign up. OpenAI won’t even benefit from a tidal wave of additional data on which to build its technology; Federighi insisted “your requests and information will not be logged.” As an added kicker, Federighi mentioned that Apple would be looking to work with companies beyond OpenAI - a nod that sent shares in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. up because it was also said to have been in talks with Apple over integration of its ChatGPT competitor, Gemini. Apple’s shares, on the other hand, took an almost 2 per cent tumble on Monday, perhaps on account of a lack of surprises - a Bloomberg News report had already revealed everything of note that was announced. But the lesson for investors to take away is that Cook is the AI kingmaker. Apple gets to decide which company gets access to the more than 2 billion active Apple products and on what terms. Google’s willingness to pay US$20 billion a year to be the default search engine on the iPhone is a taste of how valuable capturing the iPhone user is - and that was just for online search. The prize of being the primary AI platform for AI users will eclipse that, which is why Apple will strive to provide it itself. Apple is a company that hates to ever admit it needs outside help. But it’s not too proud that it would refuse it completely when circumstances demand it, as they do now. But Apple’s frenemies never become its friends. OpenAI is on Apple devices because Apple was too slow, but make no mistake, Apple will want to make its partnership with OpenAI obsolete as soon as possible.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary After a spectacular showcase comes the challenge of getting consumers to embrace ambitious new features that may be slow or buggy, says Parmy Olson for Bloomberg Opinion. A person is silhouetted against a logo sign of the Apple Store in the Grand Central Terminal in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, US, Jan 4, 2022. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo LONDON: You have to hand it to Apple. After an embarrassing, tone-deaf ad last month that made the company look oblivious to AI’s impact on the world, its marketing department has now rebranded AI as “ Apple Intelligence ”. It’s a feat of superiority only the company could pull off. Customers of Macs and the latest iPhones will use it to rewrite emails, transcribe and summarise calls, generate images and, most enticingly, cross-reference information from Apple apps. “Will I get to my daughter’s play performance on time?” Apple Software Chief Craig Federighi asked in one demo at the company’s annual World Wide Developers Conference on Monday. Apple Intelligence would talk to his iPhone’s proprietary Calendar, Maps, Mail and iMessage apps behind the scenes to answer the question. After a string of mundane updates to its iOS and Mac OS software, these are the most exciting features in years, prompting praise from technologists on X. But will Apple Intelligence really work as seamlessly as it did in the pre-recorded demos, when it rolls out this fall? I’m inclined to believe we’ll see glitches and latency issues that will make it a tough sell to consumers - at least initially. The most sophisticated AI tools today process your queries on powerful cloud servers that require an Internet connection. Apple’s iPhone has a fraction of the power of those servers, but to make its AI service private and quick, it will run some AI queries via Siri “on device”, on a small language model Apple built itself to work on an iPhone. No internet connection needed. Apple Intelligence will also decide, on the fly, if a query like “Will I get to my daughter’s play performance on time?” requires extra computing power. If it does, it’ll access a bigger AI model that Apple made, via something called “Private Cloud Compute”, which is essentially Apple’s own servers. Anything even more complex will request a query to ChatGPT, via a partnership with OpenAI. Apple, admirably, has gone to great lengths to keep this process private, with query requests being end-to-end encrypted and inaccessible to others. The price for all of this could be speed. When Apple answers a query using its smaller on-device AI, it’ll do so with a latency of 0.6 milliseconds per prompt token, according to Apple’s blog post announcing the features, or faster than the blink of an eye. But Apple didn’t offer corresponding latency times for when the phone has to access its Private Cloud Compute for more complex tasks, and that’s a noteworthy omission. It’ll likely be slower, but by how much? Apple doesn’t say. As shallow as this sounds, consumers hate having to wait a few extra seconds for things they can do themselves, and if it’s simply quicker to look something up in their calendar or mapping apps, they might decide to avoid using Apple Intelligence altogether. On the other hand, while the on-device AI will be faster, it will also be more prone to errors. According to Apple, the smaller AI model is about as capable as GPT-3.5 Turbo, which OpenAI launched more than a year ago, and which doesn’t have a stellar reputation for accuracy. The hallucination rate for GPT 3.5 has ranged from 3.5 per cent to more than 15 per cent, according to different estimates, and that points to another omission from Apple. It didn’t offer accuracy rates for either of its new AI models. Remember that even the most sophisticated models coming from leading players like Google - think about the new AI Overviews - are still laughably error-prone. Apple could have disclosed some decent hallucination rates. Instead, it offered vague stats about how human graders “preferred” its AI over others. Little wonder then, that Bloomberg’s senior Apple reporter Mark Gurman has said the new AI features will be buggy and in “beta” when they launch this fall. Apple’s role at the centre of its customers’ lives and its access to reams of their personal information could end up being both a blessing and a curse. It is better positioned than most tech companies to make AI useful because is plugged so deeply into our daily existence. But that also means it can’t afford to make too many mistakes. Federighi’s example of making it to his daughter’s play is a case in point. Were Apple Intelligence to inadvertently make its user 30 minutes late, it wouldn’t be easily forgiven. Much the same happened to Apple Maps, where a flurry of mistakes in its early days sent people to competitors like Waze and Google Maps for years afterward. It doesn’t help that Apple has been slow on the uptake with generative AI, thanks in part to a smaller AI team compared with other large tech firms, and a history of management troubles at its Siri division. Apple’s more private approach is a welcome stance, and the company should be commended for sticking to its guns on using private, encrypted servers while others are playing fast and loose with AI in a battle for supremacy. But getting consumers to embrace its ambitious new features won’t be easy when the glitzy demos are suddenly made real.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary In calling a snap election, French President Emmanuel Macron has concluded that power often tames radical parties or demonstrates their incompetence, says Janan Ganesh for the Financial Times. French President Emmanuel Macron who called for a snap election after far-right leader Marine le Pen's National Rally (RN) trounced his liberal party on the European stage. (Composite photo: AFP/File/Ludovic Marin, AFP/Julien de Rosa) WASHINGTON DC: In the first-rate Stendhal novel that we call Emmanuel Macron’s life, the protagonist grows bolder and bolder as he rises through France. He marries who he likes, thanks. He joins Rothschild even as a banking crash turns public opinion against financiers. He sets up a party, gives it his own initials and wins the biggest directly elected office in Europe after jilting his mentor. His latest decision - to give the hard right an early shot at power - will be filed alongside those headstrong acts. It is no such thing. It is a work of cool logic. The last best hope against populism in Europe is to expose it to government. The pressure of office might force anti-establishment parties to moderate, as Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has done somewhat in Italy. Or it might reveal their incompetence and turpitude, as happened to former prime minister Boris Johnson in Britain. Sometimes, of course, it will do neither: Power will neither tame nor shame. (See Hungary's Viktor Orban.) But even then, these parties should at least become subject to the pendulum of politics. Time spent in government is time spent alienating voters with tangible decisions. Right now, in much of Europe, populists have a goldilocks level of success: Enough to foul the atmosphere, to spread the idea that simple answers to big problems exist if governments would but enact them, but not enough to have to prove this in office. The establishment has a record, and all records are flawed. Its enemies get to travel lighter. The contest between the two sides is, in Pentagon argot, asymmetric. Note how many of the hard right’s relative underperformers in the European parliament elections are incumbents at home (Orban’s Fidesz party) or proppers-up of governments (the Sweden Democrats). This is the gravitational force that drags mainstream politicians down. Government brings round-the-clock attention, not just the curated broadcast rounds at which British right-winger Nigel Farage excels. Above all, it brings the burden of making decisions that cost voters money. I could cite tax rises here, to fund lavish promises. Or higher interest rates from overborrowing. But few things would harm the populist cause more than having to manage immigration. Their plausible-sounding alternative to foreign labour in low-wage sectors - pay domestic workers more - would be tested against the public’s price-sensitivity. Even if voters don’t balk at higher social care or retail costs, the trade-off would become apparent at last. Never having to be tested, populist ideas have a spurious credibility. Only a spell in government would change that. What can be said against all this? “Donald Trump”, perhaps. High office didn’t temper the 45th United States president, did show voters his worst, and still he is favourite to be the 47th. All true. But Europe, for now, is different. Most of its democracies aren’t quite as divided or tribal as the US, where, eventually, the question of what day of the week it is will generate a 50-50 polling result. Gross misgovernment would still discredit a leader in most of the continent. Consider the irrelevance of Johnson in the UK election, even as a loudmouth on the sidelines. A better argument is that, once in office, populists might pervert the system to remain there, or do something so harmful as to outweigh the benefit of rendering them unelectable thereafter. (Such as leaving the world’s biggest single market .) Hence the cordon sanitaire of the German mainstream against the hard right. It is an argument to be reckoned with. In an ideal world, getting close to power would be enough for populists to lose voters. Macron wants France to contemplate a Rassemblement National (RN) prime minister this summer, and demur. But he wouldn’t have taken the decision to hold an election if he saw nothing constructive at all in an RN win. At some point, voters have to live with the consequences of their stated desires. A notion dear to the West is that progress is made, and the truth arrived at, through argument. (Socrates has a lot to answer for.) This underestimates the role of practical demonstration. The West didn’t experience a human lifetime of moderate politics after 1945 because it was talked into it. What counted was the folk memory, now almost extinct, of what happened when nations last voted for parties that defined themselves against the system. There might be no safe way of giving voters a controlled dose. But the status quo, in which populists are on television, on stage, but not on the hook for much, isn’t tenable. Macron’s election will be framed as another outrageous gamble. It might in fact be the most prudent thing he could have done.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Dad jokes aren’t just bad puns; they are also a way for dads to assert their fatherly privilege over their families without the toxicity that patriarchy can often imply, say these folklore experts. NOVA SCOTIA, Canada: “Dad, I’m hungry.” “Hi, Hungry. I’m Dad.” If you haven’t been asleep for the past 20 years, you’ll probably recognise this exchange as a dad joke. The term dad joke is credited to a Jun 20, 1987, editorial in the Gettysburg Times. Writer Jim Kalbaugh praised fathers’ telling of groan-inducing jokes to their children - or, importantly, to others in front of their children. The practice, Kalbaugh wrote, was “one of the great traditions of fatherhood worth preserving”. The term stayed remarkably dormant until the internet age. The first entry in Urban Dictionary was in 2004 by a contributor named Bunny. It debuted on Twitter in 2007 and joke compilation books were published under the theme starting in 2013 in the UK and 2016 in the US. The Oxford English Dictionary added it to its entry for “dad” in 2014. The popularity of the term speaks to its resonance. But why do so many dads embrace this form of corny joke telling? To better understand dad jokes, let’s start with what they aren’t. As folklorists who study humour, we’re used to analysing what are called joke cycles: Jokes that spread that share the same structure or topic. Elephant jokes and light bulb jokes are examples of joke cycles. (How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb? Only one, but the light bulb has to want to change.) But dad jokes don’t have a uniform structure. Nor do they centre on a specific topic, such as parenting. Furthermore, dad jokes are not transgressive. They are not sexist, racist, scatological, profane or political; they punch neither up nor down. For these reasons, they don’t involve any sort of risk of offending people. The dad joke is almost the opposite of stand-up comedy. In addition to being \"safe\", dad jokes are generally bad, lame, groan-inducing and so forth. But so are plenty of other jokes - all you have to do is turn on the TV and watch a sitcom to find them. So, what makes a dad joke a dad joke? It might be best to think of the dad joke not as a kind of joke but as a kind of performance, one that involves a teller - the dad - and an audience: His kids, friends of his kids, his spouse. Say a family is out to dinner. Over breadsticks, a daughter might say: “Dad, you need a haircut.” Then dad responds with an unexpected punchline: “I usually get them all cut.” Abruptly, dad has shifted the mood from casual conversation to joke. Because it’s a harmless quip, no one can recoil in indignation. The only rule broken is the taboo against telling a bad joke. The child feels vicarious embarrassment for dad’s display of lameness. For his part, the dad knows perfectly well that it was a poor joke - but he doesn’t care. There’s a reason they’re called dad jokes and not father jokes. “Father” retains the seriousness and stature of a patriarch and all of the power imbalances that accompany it: Physical dominance, discipline and dependence. In contrast, “dad” implies affection and care. He’s still a male authority figure, but without the toxicity that patriarchy can often imply. We see the dad joke, then, as an occasion for the dad to assert his fatherly privilege over his family and anyone else within earshot. It’s a win-win situation for the dad. If the joke gets a laugh, well, good. But if the joke doesn’t get a laugh ... that’s good, too: Dad has intentionally invited this possibility, which is technically known as “unlaughter” and refers to jokes that create embarrassing and socially awkward situations. In this case, the way he flusters his children is his reward. He’s commanding the room, as a patriarch would, but doing so in the gentlest, most playful way possible. Telling corny jokes, of course, is not limited to fathers: Most of us are guilty of going for the joke we know will be met with an eye roll and a headshake. Dad jokes are comfortable jokes for comfortable situations among friends and family. They might elicit a disapproving glare, but they ultimately bring people closer together. They represent a dad at his most annoying, but also at his best: Warm, silly and loving. Ian Brodie is a Professor of Folklore at Cape Breton University.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Hair salons are installing USB ports, extra sockets and quiet areas for calls in a bid to draw back customers, says Emma Jacobs for Financial Times. A public relations executive in the US posted her FaceTime conversation with a Gen Z employee who was having her hair washed. (Screengrab: TikTok/lucindybean) LONDON: It’s increasingly common for clients to call Neil Moodie’s hair salon in advance to check the Wi-Fi. “Everybody brings their laptop and does their work, especially when they get their colour done. [I’ve] had a couple of people do a Zoom meeting when they’re here with the camera on.” WFH - or working from the hairdressers - has its stresses. “It means our internet has to be perfect,” says Moodie, whose salon is based in Spitalfields, London. “Which it isn’t and it’s a nightmare.” As the WFH trend becomes more popular, some United Kingdom salons are incorporating desks and quiet areas for people to work remotely while enjoying salon services. Brooke Evans, owner of a salon based in Ironbridge in Shropshire, says that a significant number of clients work while their colour is processing. “With this in mind, we installed USB ports and extra sockets at every station from when we opened. Since then have added a coffee (and) bar area and extra seating for those clients who need a quieter area to work when making calls or video calls and just a more comfortable space to work at a laptop.” Working from the hairdressers recently went viral on TikTok after a public relations executive in the United States posted her FaceTime conversation with a Gen Z employee who was having her hair washed. The young assistant told Newsweek: “As long as you’re getting your work done, I don’t see the harm.” Her manager seemed to take it in good faith: “It doesn’t matter where she is to me, as long as her tasks are being delivered on time and delivered well,” she said. Hairdressers have added office tools in order to lure customers. Many businesses are struggling following closures during pandemic lockdowns and high energy costs. The increase in remote working is also presenting significant upheavals for salons, says Caroline Larissey, chief executive of the National Hair and Beauty Federation, observing that hair and beauty businesses in city centres and business districts are particularly affected, as they often rely on a regular clientele of office workers. According to the Local Data Company, the sector has experienced a sharp increase in closures since 2020 with a net loss of 1,721 to stand at 17,047 outfits. Millie Kendall, chief executive of the British Beauty Council, a trade body, says suburban salons are faring better. They can benefit from people sneaking in a cut and colour while working from home, typically at lower prices. After lockdown restrictions were lifted, the sector received a brief boost from clients seeking professional attention for their unwieldy locks. “It was amazing how many people came in after COVID-19 and got their hair corrected,” says Moodie. This was despite a small black market in rule-defying hairdressers cutting hair in their own homes, the back of salons and in gardens. But in the past couple of years, clients have been squeezed by the cost of living crisis, says Kendall. Plus, she says, shifts in attitudes to ageing mean that “women of a certain age are wearing their hair longer”, encouraged by the likes of actresses Sarah Jessica Parker, Helen Mirren and Julia Roberts. The fashion for embracing grey has also had an impact. This all comes on top of increased electricity bills. A survey last year by UK price comparison website Uswitch found that energy bills comprise 40 per cent of hairdressers’ costs, driving up prices. The rise of TikTok tutorials and the proliferation of good styling tools for home use has also dented hairdressers’ business. But hairdressers can be a hub for community as well as a space for remote work. A recent project led by King’s College London is working with salons to disperse information about breast cancer and heart disease to customers in south and west London. Kendall underlines the significance of the salon as a place for socialising. It’s “much more than a hair cut. If people have problems they talk to the hairdresser, they absorb a lot of trauma\". Long before the pandemic, American sociologist Ray Oldenburg identified the need for a “third place”, somewhere between home and the office to build community and exchange ideas. With the addition of Wi-Fi and charging ports, the hairdressers is a worthy contender.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Some Singaporeans were raised to see air-conditioning as a luxury rather than a right, even on hot days, says writer Imran Johri. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: As a child in the late 70s, one of my favourite sounds was the tink-tink melody of raindrops hitting the corrugated zinc roof of my kampung house. What started as scattered plinks would soon become a full-blown orchestra of a raging storm, slamming against the roof. Sometimes it would rain so hard, a gentle mist would sneak in from the grilles between the rafters and the walls. While it worked wonders for sleep at night, that zinc roof was no friend during the day, especially when it was hot. On blistering afternoons, our kampung house became an oven. Back then, our only cooling solution was an ancient metal standing fan, which only served to circulate hot air. When it got excruciatingly hot, my cousins and I would either head outdoors, under the shade of our giant rambutan tree, or lie topless on the cement kitchen floor. This all seems like a lifetime ago. Today, people would just switch on the air-conditioner. But should the air-con remote be the first thing we reach for on hot days? Temperatures have hit record highs across Southeast Asia in recent weeks. Anecdotally, Singaporeans said they were feeling the heat this April and May, months when hot afternoons are common. My own children have come back from school looking like they’ve spent the day at the beach - sticky and burnt. But even then, I discourage them from switching on the air-con the moment they come home . I was raised to see air-conditioning as a luxury rather than a right. To me and my siblings, we were only entitled to it at shopping malls. Indeed, this was a time when schools, buses and even public hospitals were not air-conditioned yet. But I know firsthand how unbearably hot it can get in a modern flat. My family eventually moved to a HDB flat that soaked up all the sunlight in the day and remained warm throughout the night. We invested in an armament of fans, from ceiling fans to box fans and standing fans. But on the hottest days, these did not suffice - and there was no reprieve in the form of rambutan trees or cool cement floors. It took a long time for my parents to decide that it was time to install air-conditioning. We were awe-struck. No more fighting over the rotational angles of fans at night, no more beads of perspiration immediately after a shower - it was going to be life-changing. But we made the rookie mistake of leaving the air-con on throughout the day, unaware of how much energy an air-con consumes. My dad had a jaw-dropping electricity bill to contend with for the next two months. This made my parents impose tight rules on air-con use. Soon, we stopped using the air-con units completely - and they fell into disrepair. Everyone in the family simply went back to using fans again. In the case of the uncomfortably hot weather that has arisen of late, the knee-jerk reaction would be to install air-conditioning in every space. This would be irrefutable in places where the lack of it could present a life-or-death situation - for example, more sensitive wards in hospital - but it isn't the only solution available for dealing with heat. In the context of the climate crisis, air-conditioning is truly a luxury we cannot afford. As one of the most energy-intensive household appliances , it may make today’s hot weather more tolerable, but contribute to a warmer future with its carbon emissions. Cooler heads must prevail - and practical solutions must be applied contextually. For instance, schools could loosen uniform rules for students and shift physical education class timings on hot days. Under my roof, the air-con is only allowed to be switched on for bedtime. Feeling hot in the day? Lie under the ceiling fan in your underwear, or take a cold shower. With extreme heat set to be more frequent , it’s best that we adapt to the environment, rather than make it more inhospitable than it already is.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary The scorching heat could prevent India, the world’s most populous country, from building the economy of the future, says the Bloomberg Opinion's David Fickling. Family members shift a patient suffering from heatstroke inside an emergency room at a government hospital during a severe heatwave in Varanasi on May 30, 2024. (Photo: AFP/Niharika Kulkarni) SYDNEY: It can often seem a triumph that India exists at all. By some miracle of human ingenuity and industry, a land area barely bigger than Argentina with less water than Colombia is able to support nearly a fifth of the world’s population. The scorching temperatures in the capital New Delhi this week are a warning sign, however. The magic spell that has sustained this achievement is coming close to breaking. That’s an issue not just for those sweltering on the streets of the world’s second-biggest city, but for the path to wealth that 1.4 billion people hope to follow. India has a far poorer natural endowment of land than Europe, North America and China, the continental economies that preceded it on the road to riches. Even the fragile benefits that its citizens have managed to eke out of this unpromising soil might now be slipping further away, as climate change exposes its deep fragility and washes away the foundations of growth. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pitch in the election that ended Saturday (Jun 1) is that his Bharatiya Janata Party has made the country the fastest-growing Group of 20 economy. “India is on the path to becoming a developed nation,” he told a rally this week in West Bengal, a region where the BJP has historically performed poorly. Even as he spoke those words, the country was struggling with the most basic tasks of survival. Delhi recorded its first heatstroke death amid temperatures recorded by one (possibly erroneous) sensor as high as 52.9 degrees Celsius . Nine died from the heat in the northwestern state of Rajasthan last week and 10 suspected heat-related deaths happened in just six hours at a single hospital in Odisha state in the country’s east. Even Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan was hospitalised with dehydration in the city of Ahmedabad this month. The problem with Modi’s promise is that much of the work needed to reach developed-country status is at the mercy of this weather. India has the world’s biggest farm sector after China, and economic growth is at the mercy of the southwest monsoon rains that drench the country from June to September. You can now add the effect of pre-monsoon heatwaves to that. Scorching temperatures from March to May blight crops, such as during a 2022 hot spell which reduced wheat output by about 4.5 per cent. Produce that has been farmed can end up spoiled, as heat and humidity and the lack of refrigeration leave it rotting before it can reach households. The price of vegetables has increased at double-digit rates in eight out of the past 10 months, piling pressure on living costs and forcing consumers to depend on cheaper, less healthy nutrition. The rains that mark the breaking of the heatwave can bring their own problems. Warmer air holds more moisture, raising the risk of downpours so severe that they flood fields and wash away crops. Hailstorms, which can destroy entire fields in a matter of minutes, appear to be growing more frequent: One recent study in Kashmir found 27 such disasters in 2022, compared to two in 2007. It’s not just plant life that suffers. While factory and office workers can go through the day in air-conditioned comfort regardless of the temperature outside, about 93 per cent of India’s labour force is in less organised jobs where no employer guarantees decent working conditions. When the mercury heads above 40 degrees Celsius, farmers and urban labourers have little option but to down tools or face potentially catastrophic heatstroke . That hampers the vast amount of construction work that development will require. Upper middle-income nations (the club which India would like to join) typically derive about a third of economic growth from fixed-capital formation - building things, in simple terms. India trails Vietnam and Bangladesh on this measure, and is light years behind China. As of late 2022, India was reckoned to have only about 30 per cent of the urban infrastructure it will need by the end of the decade. The sodden monsoon is already a soft period for construction work, since cement needs dry air to set properly. Three consecutive years of record heatwaves mean that the hot summer months from March to June are increasingly affected, too, further squeezing the period when building sites can operate effectively. India is responsible for very little of the carbon emissions that are rapidly making its climate unbearable - but it must take responsibility for the future. Cheap solar power has only recently started showing signs of being installed at the rates needed to hit the government’s renewable power targets. Despite higher costs, China connected about 4.5 gigawatts of panels for every gigawatt India did in the first quarter of this year. Public charging stations for the electric vehicles that could help clean up the choking pollution of India’s cities and reduce its dependence on imported oil are too few and far between. The 12,146 in operation to date are equivalent to less than 1 per cent of what the country will need by 2030. Every side of politics wants India to become the affluent nation its people aspire to. The bridge to that destination, however, is weakened with every scorching summer and exceptional monsoon. For a country that hopes over the coming decade to industrialise without carbonising, the risk is that it may end up in the worst of both worlds: Trapped in a carbon-intensive past, prevented by its own scorching heat from building the economy of the future.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary On World Environment Day (Jun 5), it’s worth reflecting how parents can impart environmental consciousness on their children - and what they can learn from their kids in turn, says WWF-Singapore CEO Vivek Kumar. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: It is easy to overlook the influence we, as parents, have on shaping how our younger generation views the world around them. As a father of two daughters, I have come to appreciate the considerable opportunity we have to instil climate-conscious values in our children. 2023 was the world’s hottest year on record and was 1.48 degrees Celsius w armer than 1850 to 1900 pre-industrial temperatures . The challenges facing our planet might seem distant, but they're closely intertwined with our own well-being. The extreme heat that struck swaths of Southeast Asia , including the Philippines and Thailand, killed dozens and brought schools to a halt. All parents wish the best for our children. That includes a safe and healthy environment and a good set of values we wish them to inherit from us. Every decision we make as parents sends a clear message to our children about the values we hold dear. It all starts at home, where simple actions speak volumes. On World Environment Day (Jun 5), it is worth reflecting how parents can model eco-consciousness for their children - and what they can learn from today’s generation of socially aware youth. Actions like recycling paper, switching off lights when leaving a room and choosing reusable containers over disposables may seem small, but they sow the seeds for positive change in our kids' minds. For example, although we live in a flat without a balcony like most Singaporean families, my wife grows plants like basil in a planter box. Our family uses basil leaves when cooking pasta, and my daughters now appreciate the plant not only for its visual pleasure, but also as a fresh and more affordable food ingredient. These everyday habits, passed down from parents to children, shape not just how we live today but also the kind of world we'll leave for future generations. However, digital devices and a busy schedule can create distractions for us. In our own home, we have to remind one another to switch off lights and to be mindful about using precious resources such as water. School programmes play a crucial role in shaping youths’ commitment to environmental stewardship. Collaborations with government agencies and non-profits further enhance the impact of these initiatives. When I visited Commonwealth Secondary School, which is among the 140 schools WWF-Singapore works with to develop sustainability programmes, I was amazed by how teachers and students have turned simple grass patches into rainforest and wetland habitats. Students also learn concepts of physics and chemistry through experiments in these natural habitats. Children are not just the recipients of knowledge; they are the driving force behind change. This rings especially true in today's digital age, where the younger generation is increasingly vocal about environmental issues. One inspiring example is a schoolgirl I met during a visit to the Henry Park Primary School, who was part of the Science Club. During our discussion on food waste, she kindly shared their invention with me: A small prototype to help fellow students in the canteen. The invention is a simple device equipped with sensors that alerts students if food waste reaches excessive levels. Despite having fewer resources and less experience than us parents, such a creative innovation showcases the potential of our youth to drive real change. Yet, it's concerning that only 21 per cent of Asia Pacific CEOs see climate change as a priority in 2024, according to an EY survey. Adults owe it to school children and other youth to take meaningful climate action. While we endeavour to impart climate consciousness to our children, our children have plenty to teach us too. My daughter is passionate about marine environments and spends considerable time reading about the topic. With her teachers’ support, she was selected as a young marine biologist to represent her primary school on a panel discussion organised by the Nature Society Singapore. As this was during the COVID-19 period of home-based learning, the session was held on Zoom and was open to the public. Her grandparents, family members and our friends joined the session and learnt much, while encouraging the children on the panel. Soon thereafter, my daughter urged us to let her take public transport. I believe her choices are the result of her teachers initiating the right conversations with students about the environmental impact of their transportation choices. When we engage with children about sustainability, we not only nurture their love for the natural world, but also enrich our own understanding of environmental issues through the child’s perspective. As we journey from one generation to the next, parents play a vital role in shaping our future sustainability leaders. Our everyday actions and conversations with our children, including the occasional reminder (more accurately, nagging) to demonstrate planet-friendly behaviours, lay the groundwork for a world where environmental responsibility is ingrained in daily life.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Local high-tech farms will not be able to compete on price alone, but we cannot simply lament that consumers aren’t willing to open their wallets to show support, says RSIS food security expert Paul Teng. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: When the “30 by 30” goal was announced in April 2019, no one could have anticipated how Singapore’s food security would be on everyone’s minds barely a year later - when the pandemic gave us the unfamiliar sight of empty supermarket shelves. Now, with the passing of the five-year mark, a serious question is being asked after a series of delays, failures or re-configurations of high-tech farms : Was the goal of producing 30 per cent of Singapore’s nutritional needs locally by 2030 a realistic one from the beginning – or merely the dream of planners? It was recently reported that indoor vegetable farm I.F.F.I had shut down and VertiVegies had abandoned plans to build a mega vertical vegetable farm. Both had been awarded funding under the government’s 30 by 30 express grant. Other agri-food casualties include aquaculture, with the Barramundi Group ceasing sea bass farming, and novel protein, in particular with the cultivated meat industry seemingly in limbo . Given these shake-ups, is the 30 by 30 goal looking increasingly unrealistic? Will mid-point corrections be needed and expectations lowered as 2030 looms? The 30 by 30 goal must be viewed as a transformation exercise for import-dependent Singapore. But its focus was not well articulated on the outset: Was this an aspiration or a plan? Till today, it is still unclear why the goal was set at 30 per cent of nutritional needs by 2030, beyond its catchy name. And without local production targets for specific food items, what would be used as measures of success? What was clear then was the rallying call for Singapore’s agrifood sector to do more with less, by leveraging technology. Admittedly, the vagueness allowed room for creativity and innovation. Some positive outcomes have been increased activity among agri-food start-up companies and technology developers, more research and development on agri-food production and productivity arising from the increased funding availability. Yet this vagueness also means it is difficult to assess progress and make course corrections in a timely manner. The Singapore Food Agency’s recent food statistics report showed local vegetable production fell by about 15 per cent and accounted for only 3.2 per cent of consumption in 2023. Could we have done better in focusing the 30 by 30 goal? Singapore had hitherto downplayed the role of agriculture in its food security but 30 by 30 could have been developed, launched and monitored with more specifics. Take the seminal Future Of Food series published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. One lesson is that technology-push approach to transform the food system cannot be considered in isolation. Technology is a known enabler to overcome constraints posed by land, labour and water in farming. But its value depends highly on the social, economic and physical environment in which it is deployed - one of the most important lessons learnt from the Green Revolution which has fed the world since World War II. A sobering realisation with high-tech farms and factories is that energy costs determine their economic viability and indirectly affect how produce is priced. Such farms tend to be of a corporate nature, in contrast to family- or individually-owned small farms that form the bulk of Singapore’s conventional vegetable and fish farms, and thus have high accountability to shareholders and bankers. Returns on high capital investments are less predictable and lower in farming than in other sectors, and requires some longer-term certainty in the sales of products and consumer acceptance. They will not be able to compete on price alone, but we cannot simply lament that local consumers aren’t willing to open their wallets to show support. The 30 by 30 is a story in which consumers are expected to accept novel products like indoor-grown vegetables and lab-cultivated meat. Only in late-2023 did realisation dawn that it is necessary to prepare society to accept new, potentially cleaner but more expensive products . The Communication Leadership in Future Food, or CLIFF, initiative was launched by non-profits, the Good Food Institute and Agri-Biotech Knowledge Centre. Should Singapore aspire to be more self-sufficient in food and more resilient in food security? The no-brainer answer is yes, but that doesn’t mean it is straightforward. As a small island, Singapore will always be dependent on food imports, even if 30 by 30 is achieved. So this should not be a food security play but a food resilience one. This nuance shifts the mindset and narrative: What does it mean to be resilient? How to secure this resilience? And importantly, where else do we need to invest and get buy-in within a larger system beyond Singapore? During the early days of COVID-19, then Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing stressed the importance of supply chain connectivity agreements that ensure the flow of food and other essential goods from partner countries. Food imports from Malaysia did not see major disruptions during the pandemic. The value of cultivating relationships was also illustrated in August 2023, when Singapore was exempted from India’s rice export ban due to a “very close strategic partnership”. So 30 by 30 needs to be part of a larger whole-of-system strategy that takes into account other ways to assure food resilience. What a resilient food future for Singapore should encompass will require more work ahead. But in the end, even if 30 by 30 is a dream, it is a dream worth pursuing.

CANBERRA: The Summit on Peace in Ukraine , hosted by Switzerland this weekend, is not a peace conference in the usual sense. Russia, which has dismissed it as irrelevant, won’t participate. And any summit aimed at ending the war can’t produce a final settlement without Russia’s involvement. Rather, the summit stems from a push by Ukraine to build wider support for “a path towards a just and lasting peace in Ukraine”. Specifically, it wants to build consensus around some basic principles for a future settlement. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s 10-point “peace formula”, first set out in November 2022, advocates some unobjectionable ideas. It also highlights the damage Russia’s invasion has inflicted on Ukraine, along with the dangers Russia poses to other countries. The plan includes: Nuclear safety (underlining the risks posed by Russia’s occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as well as Russian nuclear sabre-rattling ) food security (addressing the disruption of global food supplies caused by the invasion and the need for freedom of navigation from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports) and energy security (highlighting Russia’s attacks crippling Ukraine’s energy infrastructure ). It also involves the release of all Ukrainian prisoners and return of Ukrainian children deported to Russia (the subject of arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court against President Vladimir Putin), the restoration of Ukrainian territory to its pre-2014, internationally recognised borders, the full withdrawal of Russian military forces, and justice under international law, including a special tribunal to prosecute alleged war crimes and compensation for damage caused to Ukraine. Finally, it includes addressing environmental destruction caused by the war, security guarantees for Ukraine against future Russian aggression, and a multilateral peace conference with a binding treaty to end the war. Ukraine has developed the proposal through informal meetings over the past 18 months. Host Switzerland says around 90 countries have agreed to attend out of 160 invited. Many European leaders will be there; the United States will be represented by Vice President Kamala Harris. The summit is timed to follow immediately after this week’s G7 meeting in Italy. Ukraine hopes the G7 will build on its previous support for the war effort, particularly through action on reparations. This includes using frozen Russian assets for Ukraine’s reconstruction and defence. Upcoming NATO and European Union summits in July will also be critical for securing assistance and progressing Ukraine’s membership aspirations in those bodies. However, Ukraine’s main target audience at the summit will be countries of the Global South. It remains unclear how many of the bigger players, such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey and South Africa, will be represented - or if they will send officials rather than leaders or ministers. There are indications that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, among others, won’t be there, which will disappoint Ukraine. China, which has become more closely aligned to Russia since the war started, has also said it won’t take part, given Moscow’s absence. Zelenskyy, in turn, has accused China of working with Russia to dissuade countries from attending. The Ukrainian government says it will prioritise nuclear safety, food security and the return of prisoners and child deportees at the summit. These likely offer the best prospects for consensus. The government feels it may need to move onto the other points gradually. The Swiss have also downplayed expectations of major progress. They have suggested a second follow-up conference may be needed, in which Russia could be included. Another major objective will be to reinforce support for the idea that any settlement must entail restoring Ukraine’s recognised borders, which Russia previously agreed to in a 2004 treaty. To make this point, Ukraine invokes Article 2 of the UN Charter, requiring states not to use force against the territorial integrity of other countries. This principle has been reinforced over the years by numerous UN Security Council resolutions, notably on the Israel-Palestine conflict, that affirm the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force”. As I have argued elsewhere, the international community as a whole has consistently respected this stance on territorial conquest over the past 60 years. In addition, at least 141 countries voted in three UN General Assembly resolutions in 2022 and 2023 to condemn Russia’s invasion and demand that it withdraw from Ukraine. Just a handful of nations voted with Russia against the resolutions. Ukraine pursued the summit partly as a counter to proposals floated by some countries or individuals that imply Ukraine may have to lose territory permanently in any ceasefire agreement. This could include Crimea and the eastern Donbas region. For Ukraine, however, this is more than just territory. Before the war, several million Ukrainians lived in these regions. Many have since fled, but those who remain are being subjected to a brutal occupation regime. For the Crimean Tatars, that is their only homeland. Despite many countries backing Ukraine’s position in the UN, most of the Global South has been reluctant to apply diplomatic or trade sanctions against Russia. Some oppose the idea of unilateral sanctions (that is, not endorsed by the UN). Russia itself has been very active diplomatically in the Global South and is giving several countries military support, notably in Africa. As a result, many non-Western countries have hedged their bets. They do not want to get caught up in what they see as a fight between the West and Russia, backed by China. Many of these governments and their people are also sceptical about Western invocation of a rules-based order. This stems in part from the West’s past unilateral actions, such as the 2003 Iraq invasion. Western support for Israel (or at least lukewarm criticism) over the Gaza war has only entrenched such scepticism. Russia says a full withdrawal of its troops is a non-starter for negotiations. And without Russian participation in the summit - and with questions over buy-in from the Global South - expectations are modest for major practical outcomes. Some reports say a draft statement may not even cover questions of territorial integrity. Nevertheless, it will be a chance to put Ukraine’s plight back in the spotlight after months of focus on Gaza. It will also be a valuable step if the summit can strengthen global opposition to Russia’s territorial conquest. As historian Yuval Noah Hariri puts it, non-Western powers should act to protect the international order - not out of obligation to the West, but for their own benefit, to prevent a new age of imperialism.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Without a rethink of their current approach, it is unlikely that the carnage on Ukraine’s battlefields will end anytime soon, says international security expert Stefan Wolff. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pictured on a monitor as he attends the plenary session of the Summit on Peace in Ukraine, in Stansstad near Lucerne, Switzerland on Jun 16, 2024. (File Photo: Reuters/Urs Flueeler) This audio is generated by an AI tool. BIRMINGHAM, England: The Summit on Peace in Ukraine , hosted by Switzerland on Jun 15 and 16, ended with a final communique that was disappointing for Ukraine and its Western partners. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seemed to have high hopes for it, making an in-person appeal at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore earlier in June for leaders to support the summit. As the event at the Burgenstock resort in Switzerland began, Zelenskyy said: “I believe that we will witness history being made here ”. The summit did not live up to expectations. The content of the communique was weaker than could have been hoped, and even then, not all of the delegations signed up to it. With key countries absent from Switzerland and no agreement on a time or venue for a follow-up meeting, the future of this particular approach to achieving peace in Ukraine may well have come and gone. In line with the agenda of the summit, the communique focuses on three areas in which 84 of 100 attending states and international organisations came to agreement. First, they emphasised the importance of the safety of nuclear energy and nuclear installations and the inadmissibility of the threat or use of nuclear weapons. Second, they noted the importance of not weaponising food security and ensuring the uninterrupted availability of Ukrainian agricultural products on the global market. Third, they called for a complete exchange of all prisoners of war and the release of all deported and unlawfully displaced Ukrainian children and detained civilians. The communique also notes that those who support it “decided to undertake concrete steps in the future in the above-mentioned areas with further engagement of the representatives of all parties”. What exactly these steps are and when they will be undertaken, however, remains unclear. The communique also notes “commitment to refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all states, including Ukraine, within their internationally recognised borders, including territorial waters, and the resolution of disputes through peaceful means as principles of international law”. “The United Nations Charter, including the principles of respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states, can and will serve as a basis in achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” it added Notably absent from the communique was one key Ukrainian and Western demand, namely the complete withdrawal of all Russian troops from occupied Ukrainian territory. This could have been interpreted as a nod in the direction of other peace proposals that focus on achieving a ceasefire along the current frontlines, notably the Indonesian and Chinese proposals of 2023. Yet, Indonesia, while present with an envoy, did not join the final communique. China not only declined to attend but also launched a joint initiative with Brazil that presents a rival format for a future peace process. The Chinese-Brazilian proposal specifically focuses on the participation of both Russia and Ukraine and the need to discuss “all peace plans”. Interestingly, it mirrors some of the language included in the joint communique of the Swiss summit, including in its emphasis on an exchange of all prisoners of war, nuclear safety, and food security. Its immediate aim, however, appears to be “the realisation of a comprehensive ceasefire”, something that Ukraine and its Western partners have so far rejected. Nor does the Chinese-Brazilian proposal make any reference to the UN Charter or the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Chinese-Brazilian proposal, therefore, presents a more serious alternative to the Swiss peace summit. With the exception of Türkiye, none of the other major regional and global players in the war in Ukraine have signed up to the final communique. Saudi Arabia, at some point considered a potential venue for a follow-up meeting in the autumn, declined to join the communique, as did India. With South Africa not even in attendance, all the key members of the enlarged BRICS have signalled if not their opposition to the Swiss summit than at least their preference for an alternative format. The fact that there were relatively few attendees from Africa and Asia also indicates the broader failure of Ukrainian and Western efforts to enlist countries from the Global South in their peace initiative. While understandable, the exclusion, so far, of Russia from these discussions has led to a lack of a credible process that could lead to an end of the war in Ukraine. After the Swiss summit, it is abundantly clear that the Ukrainian and Western approach is unlikely to gather the necessary global support to generate true momentum towards peace in Ukraine. What is not clear, is whether this will be recognised by Kyiv and its partners. Without a rethink of their current approach, it is unlikely that the carnage on Ukraine’s battlefields will end anytime soon.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary India Prime Minister Narendra Modi may be back, but he no longer has an iron grip on power, says Andy Mukherjee for Bloomberg Opinion. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gestures as he arrives at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) headquarters in New Delhi, India on Jun 4, 2024. (Photo: REUTERS/Adnan Abidi) HONG KONG: India has its next prime minister , and the message from voters to financial markets is clear: “We have moved on from Narendra Modi. When will you?\" Modi’s Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fell short of a majority in the 543-member parliament. However, the BJP will still return to power with the help of coalition partners in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The challengers have put up an unexpectedly strong fight to weaken, if not end, Modi’s 10-year stranglehold on power. Its performance was enough to sink Indian stocks, which posted their biggest loss in four years. The rupee fell the most in a year. Investors had pumped money into the country’s assets just the day before, expecting a landslide win for Modi based on exit polls that I had earlier described as more noise than signal. Going into the election, many voters were asking the question, “If not Modi, then who?” The BJP manifesto had more than 50 pictures of its leader, and all of its promises were branded “Modi’s guarantees”. By contrast, the opposition never had a consensus prime ministerial candidate. Rahul Gandhi’s Congress Party was careful to not project its star campaigner as a possible choice, lest the INDIA alliance, an unwieldy coalition of more than two dozen parties, collapsed because of ego clashes. Besides, Modi has never lost an opportunity to taunt the Gandhi family - which has produced three prime ministers - as a dynasty that kept the economy in shackles before he arrived on the scene as a saviour. Modi, long separated from his wife, has no children of his own, a fact he has used to portray himself as an ascetic, even holy, figure. However, by denying a majority to the BJP, voters have clearly signalled that Modi’s magic has worn off. That would be true even if the 73-year-old becomes prime minister for a third time, and his coalition government lasts its full five-year term. His fading halo can no longer keep people distracted from everyday issues such as high unemployment in cities and depressed incomes in villages. So the question now is: “After Modi, who?” From COVID-19 vaccine certificates to fertiliser bags and posters at last year’s G20 summit in New Delhi, the prime minister’s face is everywhere in India. There are Modi “selfie points,” where people can stand next to a cardboard cutout of him and take a photo. He gave advice to students on managing exam stress and delivered a monthly monologue on radio. No matter which politician from his party contested the polls, it was always Modi’s personality cult on ballot papers. But this cult, perverse as it was in a democracy, is also non-transferable. As the political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot, who has studied Modi from when he was the chief minister of Gujarat state, said in a recent interview: “People like Modi have no successor, and it’s very difficult to succeed a man like Modi, especially when you don’t have any dynasty at the end.” Perhaps the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the umbrella Hindu right-wing organisation behind the BJP, will try to find Modi’s replacement in India’s most-populous state of Uttar Pradesh, which is critical to forming a government in New Delhi. Yogi Adityanath, the state’s saffron-robe-wearing chief minister, has acquired a reputation as a strongman. He is known for carrying out house demolitions, particularly of Muslim properties, as extrajudicial punishment following episodes of communal violence. He appeals to the hardliners as someone who can take forward Modi’s agenda of religious polarisation at a national level. However, before staking claim to the highest political office, Modi had also built up his image as an effective economic administrator in the 12-plus years he ran Gujarat, an industrialised state on India’s western coast. Adityanath will find it hard to replicate Modi’s “Gujarat Model” in Uttar Pradesh, which is more populous than Brazil and poorer than sub-Saharan Africa. Besides, this time around, the liberal and the left-wing parties opposed to the RSS and its Hindu-first agenda will be extra vigilant about allowing any fresh mythmaking around a political personality. NDA partners will do the rest if they manage to curb the role of Home Minister Amit Shah, who has been Modi’s number two for years. Shah’s control over federal investigative agencies - and the way he used them against political opponents - has made him India’s most-feared man. Alliance partners, now that they can name their price for supporting the BJP, will want to operate without having to constantly worry about the risk of jail or constant surveillance, as would the media. Anchors and editors politely nodded when Modi, during the recent election campaign, spoke of a 1,000-year vision and claimed that he had been sent by God. The next person to make such outlandish statements will hopefully be stopped before they reach high office. So who after Modi? Maybe nobody like him. Or at least that’s the preference of voters. Financial markets should just get used to it.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary AI presents new opportunities for candidates to connect with voters of all demographics, particularly in linguistically diverse nations, say these academics from Harvard Kennedy School. People watch election results on a mobile phone at a roadside tea stall in Ahmedabad, India, June 4, 2024. REUTERS/Amit Dave CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts: As India concluded the world’s largest election on Jun 5, with over 640 million votes counted, observers could assess how the various parties and factions used artificial intelligence technologies - and what lessons that holds for the rest of the world. The campaigns made extensive use of AI, including deepfake impersonations of candidates, celebrities and dead politicians. By some estimates, millions of Indian voters viewed deepfakes. But, despite fears of widespread disinformation, for the most part the campaigns, candidates and activists used AI constructively in the election. They used AI for typical political activities, including mudslinging, but primarily to better connect with voters. Political parties in India spent an estimated US$50 million on authorised AI-generated content for targeted communication with their constituencies this election cycle. And it was largely successful. Indian political strategists have long recognised the influence of personality and emotion on their constituents, and they started using AI to bolster their messaging. Young and upcoming AI companies like The Indian Deepfaker, which started out serving the entertainment industry, quickly responded to this growing demand for AI-generated campaign material. In January, Muthuvel Karunanidhi, former chief minister of the southern state of Tamil Nadu for two decades, appeared via video at his party’s youth wing conference. He wore his signature yellow scarf, white shirt, dark glasses and had his familiar stance - head slightly bent sideways. But Karunanidhi died in 2018. His party authorised the deepfake. In February, the All-India Anna Dravidian Progressive Federation party’s official X account posted an audio clip of Jayaram Jayalalithaa, the iconic superstar of Tamil politics colloquially called “Amma” or “Mother.” Jayalalithaa died in 2016. Meanwhile, voters received calls from their local representatives to discuss local issues - except the leader on the other end of the phone was an AI impersonation. Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) workers like Shakti Singh Rathore have been frequenting AI start-ups to send personalised videos to specific voters about the government benefits they received and asking for their vote over WhatsApp. Deepfakes were not the only manifestation of AI in the Indian elections. Long before the election began, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a tightly packed crowd celebrating links between the state of Tamil Nadu in the south of India and the city of Varanasi in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Instructing his audience to put on earphones, Modi proudly announced the launch of his “new AI technology” as his Hindi speech was translated to Tamil in real-time. In a country with 22 official languages and almost 780 unofficial recorded languages, the BJP adopted AI tools to make Modi’s personality accessible to voters in regions where Hindi is not easily understood. S ince 2022, Modi and his BJP have been using the AI-powered tool Bhashini, embedded in the NaMo mobile app, to translate Modi’s speeches with voiceovers in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Odia, Bengali, Marathi and Punjabi. As part of their demos, some AI companies circulated their own viral versions of Modi’s famous monthly radio show “Mann Ki Baat,” which loosely translates to “From the Heart”, which they voice cloned to regional languages. Indian political parties doubled down on online trolling, using AI to augment their ongoing meme wars. Early in the election season, the Indian National Congress released a short clip to its 6 million followers on Instagram, taking the title track from a new Hindi music album named “Chor” (thief). The video grafted Modi’s digital likeness onto the lead singer and cloned his voice with reworked lyrics critiquing his close ties to Indian business tycoons. The BJP retaliated with its own video, on its 7-million-follower Instagram account, featuring a supercut of Modi campaigning on the streets, mixed with clips of his supporters but set to unique music. It was an old patriotic Hindi song sung by famous singer Mahendra Kapoor, who passed away in 2008 but was resurrected with AI voice cloning. Modi himself quote-tweeted an AI-created video of him dancing - a common meme that alters footage of rapper Lil Yachty on stage - commenting “such creativity in peak poll season is truly a delight”. In some cases, the violent rhetoric in Modi’s campaign that put Muslims at risk and incited violence was conveyed using generative AI tools, but the harm can be traced back to the hateful rhetoric itself and not necessarily the AI tools used to spread it. India is an early adopter, and the country’s experiments with AI serve as an illustration of what the rest of the world can expect in future elections. The technology’s ability to produce nonconsensual deepfakes of anyone can make it harder to tell truth from fiction, but its consensual uses are likely to make democracy more accessible. The Indian election’s embrace of AI which began with entertainment, political meme wars, emotional appeals to people, resurrected politicians and persuasion through personalised phone calls to voters has opened a pathway for the role of AI in participatory democracy. The surprise outcome of the election, with the BJP’s failure to win its predicted parliamentary majority, and India’s return to a deeply competitive political system especially highlights the possibility for AI to have a positive role in deliberative democracy and representative governance. It’s a goal of any political party or candidate in a democracy to have more targeted touchpoints with their constituents. The Indian elections have shown a unique attempt at using AI for more individualised communication across linguistically and ethnically diverse constituencies, and making their messages more accessible, especially to rural, low-income populations. AI and the future of participatory democracy could make constituent communication not just personalised but also a dialogue, so voters can share their demands and experiences directly with their representatives - at speed and scale. India can be an example of taking its recent fluency in AI-assisted party-to-people communications and moving it beyond politics. The government is already using these platforms to provide government services to citizens in their native languages. If used safely and ethically, this technology could be an opportunity for a new era in representative governance, especially for the needs and experiences of people in rural areas to reach Parliament.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary The loss of the top two officials leading the development of Indonesian's new capital city Nusantara has thrown a serious wrench in the works for President Joko Widodo, says ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute’s Yanuar Nugroho. Construction of the ceremonial plaza in Nusantara on Mar 19, 2024. (Photo: Indonesia's Public Works and Housing Ministry) SINGAPORE: The Jun 3 resignations of the former head and deputy head of Indonesia’s Nusantara Capital Authority Bambang Susantono and Dhony Rahajoe, surprised many. Their abrupt departure raised questions about what happened behind the scenes and fuelled speculation about the future of Indonesia’s new capital. For now, President Joko Widodo has appointed in their stead his public works and housing minister and the deputy agrarian minister. The construction of the new capital city is one of the most ambitious projects in Indonesian history. There have been valid objections and criticisms from the start, and it has faced numerous challenges, including a rushed legislative process and the lack of public consultation of affected local communities at inception. There are also concerns over the environmental and social impact of development in the East Kalimantan region. Bambang and Dhony’s resignations just two months prior to Jokowi’s plan to celebrate Independence Day (Aug 17) in Nusantara exacerbate such negative perceptions. Further, they could affect not just public and political support but also investor interest. No official reason has been given for the resignations except “personal” ones. Both men are well-known, with proven track records and integrity. Bambang was vice then acting minister for transportation under President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, while Dhony, an architect, was linked to real estate developer Sinar Mas Land. In his farewell remarks, Bambang elliptically said that although people’s roles could change, the stance of those with integrity remained intact. This suggests that the resignations might have been for political reasons, not just technical ones like delays in construction. Bambang’s message to his staff before he resigned, pleading for them to “love and side” with the people (meaning the local communities), signals that a more serious clash probably did happen. The president, in damage control mode, has tried to allay fears about Nusantara’s future, claiming that it would go on regardless of the resignations and promising that a “big investment” was forthcoming. Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Panjaitan, soon after the resignations, assured that there was no problem with the Nusantara project, pointedly noting that the problem was with leadership. He added that Bambang could have simply executed the decision to clear land belonging to local communities even while the land’s status was unclear or unsettled. Luhut could have been referring to incidents like the one below, which illustrates two separate problems: Unclear land ownership and delayed investments due to this lack of clarity. On Mar 4, Indonesia’s Nusantara Capital Authority issued a letter to 200 residents of Pemaluan village, Sepaku, asking those living in RT05 (a housing group) to demolish their properties if they did not have a permit or were against spatial planning. The letter was withdrawn a few days later after catching public attention. This highlights the government’s rush to clear land fast for Nusantara and to quickly secure new investments. As confirmed by the Minister for Public Works and now Acting Head of the authority, Basuki Hadimuldjono, the suspension of such land transactions has made the status of land to be developed unclear for investors. As a result, investors are unable to buy (meaning own) land in the Nusantara and can obtain only Right to Build certificates. These problems with land-use and land acquisition for the Nusantara ’s development reflect the need for better governance and transparency. There are other lapses, including insufficient regulatory support. For instance, the clearance of 2,086 hectares needs a Presidential Regulation on the Handling of Social Impacts Plus - the \"plus\" meaning that the local people might be relocated or resettled. Yet this regulation has not been issued. The problem with land clearing seems to be the tip of the iceberg. Given Nusantara ’s complexity, some believe that the timeline and resources that were allocated for the first phase of the project were not realistic. Widodo has claimed Phase 1 is “80 per cent complete” and declared that he will move there by July but he has had to accept that the first batch of civil servants will not even be there until September 2024 (or later). For one, basic infrastructure, including fresh water in housing quarters, is incomplete or unavailable. Housing for the civil service (initially planned as 47 apartment towers) is incomplete. The planned number of personnel to be moved from Jakarta to the Nusantara has dropped from 11,919 to 1,740. (This could increase to 3,072 if some are willing to share apartments.) Compounding this, expected foreign investments have not been realised and the state’s budget is under strain. The socio-cultural and potential ecological challenges add to the difficulty. Although infrastructural development looks most promising, especially within the Central Government Zone, apparently some problems persist. In addition to the lack of clean water, services like electricity and waste management are not generally available, and some Nusantara zones face a flood risk. The transfer of the nation’s capital needs a presidential decree to officially announce it. However, even this decree is not ready, which opens up the possibility that the next president, Prabowo Subianto, could sign it after his inauguration in late October. Jokowi had wanted to sign the decree before Independence Day so that the celebrations could be held in Nusantara. Given this, the government has now announced a “hybrid” simultaneous commemoration in Nusantara (attended by Jokowi and Prabowo) and in Jakarta (attended by their respective vice presidents, Ma’ruf Amin and Gibran Rakabuming Raka). The mystery behind the two resignations remains: The government should not cover up or sugarcoat the reasons but take them as a wake-up call for better governance. If not, more uncertainty about Nusantara’s future among investors and other stakeholders could develop. Stronger leadership and clear vision to overcome present obstacles and achieve development goals can only happen if Jokowi or Prabowo quickly fills leadership gaps with individuals capable of handling political and operational pressures while ensuring better transparency and public participation.

SINGAPORE: Going into the inauguration, there were concerns that new Taiwan President William Lai Ching-te would act to provoke Beijing, given that earlier in his political career, Mr Lai described himself as a \"pragmatic worker for Taiwan independence\". Beijing stoked these concerns from as early as last year’s presidential election campaign by branding Mr Lai as a pro-independence \" troublemaker \" who would bring war to Taiwan. In his inauguration speech on Monday (May 20), Mr Lai projected a vision of a confident, international and forward-looking Taiwan that is determined to be a force for peace and prosperity, not just in the region but also the world. Mr Lai, whose election victory in January gave an unprecedented third presidential term to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), also emphasised the democratic values that Taiwan shares with many of its closest partners. These remarks built on the remarkable success Taiwan enjoyed under Mr Lai’s predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen. Under Ms Tsai’s leadership, Taiwan has enjoyed a more positive global profile and noteworthy economic growth, with the latest data showing a 6.51 per cent year-on-year expansion in the first quarter. Ms Tsai left office with a higher approval rating than the past two presidents. As Ms Tsai’s vice-president for the past four years, Mr Lai is looking to take advantage of the existing momentum. Stability, especially in relations with China, is a big component of the legacy Mr Lai inherits, and his speech spelt out a clear intention to maintain the status quo. Mr Lai stated unequivocally in his speech that he does not seek to change the status quo, where Taiwan enjoys substantive autonomy in all matters but does not declare formal independence or separation from a notional China. Mr Lai further emphasised that his administration is willing to accept working with any term for Taiwan that gives it sufficient dignity, peppering his speech with references to the \"Republic of China\" (ROC), Taiwan’s official name. At the same time, Mr Lai said the two sides of the strait were \"not subordinate to each other\" and called on Beijing to stop coercing and bullying Taiwan and to instead engage on terms of mutual respect while underscoring Taiwan’s engagement with the world, themes previously touched on during the election campaign. Leaders in Beijing are unlikely to heed this call and have indeed announced military exercises to \"punish\" what they claim is in response to \"separatist acts\". Importantly, unlike Ms Tsai when she became president, Mr Lai did not make indirect reference to the \"1992 Consensus\" in his speech. The supposed consensus - an unofficial understanding that Taipei and Beijing agree there is only \"one China\", but the two sides may disagree as to its meaning - was formally adopted as policy by the Kuomintang’s Ma Ying-jeou when he secured the presidency in 2008. Beijing has never acknowledged Mr Ma’s framing of the \"1992 Consensus\" in terms of \"one country, different interpretations\". Mr Lai’s DPP disagreed as to whether there was a consensus, but Ms Tsai in her inauguration speech in 2016 said she \"respect(s) this historical fact\" that quasi-official meetings occurred, and indicated a willingness to adhere to the broad spirit of cross-strait cooperation. Of further note is Mr Lai’s direct reference to China as \"China\" rather than \"mainland\" or \"the other side of the Strait\", which Beijing is likely to read as separatism. His predecessors generally avoided directly using the term \"China\" when referring to the country. Repeated references to the ROC and an explicit acceptance that Taiwan will work with whatever name proves most convenient to its partners indicates Mr Lai’s openness to compromise. However, Mr Lai’s references to \"China\" and avoidance of discussion about the \"1992 Consensus\" reflects an uneasiness about PRC efforts to re-define these concepts in terms of Beijing’s \"one China principle\". Undergirding Mr Lai’s cross-strait position is a greater sense of comfort in Taiwan about being Taiwanese. Across multiple opinion polls, roughly 90 per cent of respondents see themselves as Taiwanese in some way with about two-thirds exclusively so. Concurrently, more than 85 per cent of people in Taiwan consistently express a wish to maintain the status quo whatever their aspirations for Taiwan’s ultimate status. The most recent poll by Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council puts this figure at 88.8 per cent. That is probably as close to an actual consensus as feasible in a rambunctious democracy like Taiwan. The language in Mr Lai’s speech reflects these conditions, even if they form a reality that Beijing does not like to hear about. For all the international and cross-strait aspects of the inaugural speech, Mr Lai began his remarks referencing a need for the various political parties in Taiwan to cooperate. This acknowledges the fact that while the DPP holds onto the presidency, the KMT and the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) together have an 11-seat majority in the legislature. A divided government is probably Mr Lai’s first major challenge. Efforts by the KMT and TPP to railroad through an expansive \"contempt of the legislature\" Bill alongside a massive road construction Bill already led to confrontations in the Legislative Yuan the Friday before the inauguration. An estimated 30,000 people further turned up around the Legislative Yuan the day after the inauguration to protest these Bills, with further stand-offs being very likely in the days and weeks ahead. Mr Lai comes to office at a tumultuous moment. Beijing is becoming more strident about its territorial claims and prerogatives, whether in the South China Sea, East China Sea, Yellow Sea, or Taiwan Strait. Then there is increasing friction between China on one side and the United States and its allies on the other, in areas ranging from economics to security. Then there is domestic politics, with the KMT possibly coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party across the Taiwan Strait in some capacity. Opponents of Mr Lai and the DPP are likely to seize on any mistakes to label him as a destabilising troublemaker to isolate him internationally and domestically. The key test for Mr Lai is the degree to which he can navigate these waters calmly, resolutely, and effectively without lashing out in frustration, and in this regard follow the unflappable Ms Tsai.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary As the 2024 US presidential race heats up, China is once again being used as a political punching bag. RSIS’ Jonghyuk Lee weighs in on who China might be rooting for in a potential Biden-Trump presidential rematch. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The Biden administration on May 14 announced that it would quadruple tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports to 100 per cent. This decision highlights the persistent aggressive stance of the United States toward China, irrespective of whether Democrats or Republicans are in power. Come November, US voters are set to face a election rematch between President Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump . Recent polls show they are in a neck-and-neck race. Much of the world will be watching closely, as will China, who is often caught in the crossfire as candidates claw for voter support. After Mr Biden announced the tariffs, Mr Trump was quick to strike, saying: “China’s eating our lunch”. He added that there should be tariffs on \"much more than electric vehicles\". The incumbent fired back: “He's been feeding them a long time”. This back-and-forth suggests that China will once again be used as a political punching bag in the upcoming election. No matter who wins, their tough-on-China stance is unlikely to change significantly. The devil, however, lies in the details. In pivotal areas like Taiwan relations, global leadership and domestic narratives, Mr Trump may be slightly more favourable for China and President Xi Jinping. Mr Biden’s approach is firmly grounded in multilateralism and international alliances, while his predecessor's openness to negotiations, international isolationism and blunt domestic rhetoric offer China more opportunities to expand its global influence and bolster domestic stability. On Taiwan, Donald Trump's unpredictability presents a more complex challenge for Xi Jinping than Joe Biden's consistent support for the island. Mr Trump sees Taiwan primarily as a strategic asset in US-China negotiations, often hesitating to commit to its defence. In a July 2023 Fox News interview, he was asked directly if he would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack. He evaded the question. \"If I answer that question, it'd put me in a very bad negotiating position,\" he said . “With that being said, Taiwan did take all of our chip business,” he continued, highlighting his grievances with Taiwan instead. Former US National Security Adviser John Bolton also revealed in his memoir that Mr Trump regarded Taiwan as relatively insignificant , comparing it to the tip of a Sharpie pen. Such an ambiguous approach to Taiwan inadvertently emboldens China to adopt a more aggressive stance toward the island, especially given the perceived low probability of US military intervention under a second Trump administration. This was evidenced by a Chinese spokesman's statement in January that Taiwan could end up a “discarded chess piece at any time” if Mr Trump were re-elected. This perspective, however, assumes that the costs of defending Taiwan outweigh the benefits for Mr Trump. Is this assumption accurate, though? Does he genuinely regard defending Taiwan as merely a cost devoid of benefits for the US? Mr Trump’s strategic framework might perceive defending Taiwan as providing considerable long-term security advantages. By supporting Taiwan, the US prevents China from securing unrestricted access to the Pacific Ocean, a move that could significantly limit China’s regional influence. Some have suggested that this ambiguity is deliberate. By making inconsistent statements, he keeps adversaries guessing, compelling them to disclose their strategies first. However, this strains diplomatic relations and introduces uncertainty into international policy. Mr Trump's erratic approach forces Beijing to prepare for various scenarios. In contrast, Mr Biden’s unwavering stance on defending Taiwan allows China to formulate a predictable strategic response. Mr Xi could see potential in influencing Mr Trump through negotiations if China offers incentives that outweigh the strategic value of supporting Taiwan. Mr Biden's steadfast policy positions constrain such opportunities. Negotiating with Mr Trump, possibly linking Taiwan to other geopolitical considerations like Russia, could sway his support. This could potentially aid Mr Xi in his lifelong ambition: Taiwan reunification. When former president Trump was in power, he favoured bilateral agreements over multilateralism, resulting in a notable shift in US global leadership. This created a void that China swiftly exploited to assert its influence. For instance, in 2017, the US announced its withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, arguing it undermined the nation's economy and sovereignty. In 2018, the US withdrew from UNESCO, citing the organisation’s purported anti-Israel bias. Mr Trump also exited the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal and frequently criticised the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and World Trade Organization (WTO). China's efforts like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) have undercut US influence, financing extensive infrastructure projects and presenting itself as a credible alternative to American leadership. Moreover, China’s enhanced involvement in the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has bolstered its soft power and influence in global health and human rights policies. Economically, China's Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has deepened its integration into regional trade networks, especially following the US' TPP exit. When President Joe Biden took over, he asserted American leadership on the global stage, particularly in areas like climate change and public health, where China has sought to expand its influence. By rejoining international commitments that his predecessor withdrew from, Mr Biden aims to counterbalance China's growing global presence and advocate for a world order that reflects democratic values and human rights. His approach to China involves pushing back in both traditional and non-traditional security domains, aiming to limit China's influence, especially over the Global South. From Mr Xi's perspective, this renewed American engagement represents a significant challenge. While Mr Trump's isolationist tendencies boosted China's global stature, Mr Biden's strategy of active US engagement and leadership in global governance directly challenges China's narrative. Still, US foreign policy remains uncertain and can swiftly shift depending on the administration. If Mr Trump secures re-election and pursues isolationist policies, it may erode trust in the US commitment to international affairs again, providing Mr Xi with an opportunity to bolster China's alliances. During the Trump presidency, nationalistic rhetoric and confrontational language towards China polarised the relationship. In a 2016 campaign rally, he accused China of “raping” the US while criticising its trade policies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump repeatedly referred to the virus as the “Chinese virus,” which critics argued fuelled xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiments. More recently in February, he pledged to impose tariffs of more than 60 per cent on Chinese goods if re-elected. For Mr Xi, this confrontational rhetoric is beneficial. By portraying China as a victim of unwarranted American aggression, he can rally nationalistic sentiments, consolidate his domestic standing and divert attention from domestic issues such as an economic slowdown, a housing crisis, and youth unemployment. In contrast, the Biden administration takes a more diplomatic approach. Acknowledging the competitive nature of the US-China relationship, Mr Biden seeks areas of potential cooperation while addressing issues like human rights abuses and aggressive actions in the South China Sea. Though not always successful, he pursues engagement by dispatching officials like Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China. This strategy limits Mr Xi's ability to stoke nationalist sentiments against the US, as it is the US initiating engagement. By prioritising collaboration and toning down confrontational rhetoric, Mr Biden leaves less room for Xi to exploit anti-US sentiments domestically.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Boosting consumption has always been a lower priority for China’s leadership, compared to exports and investments, says former SCMP editor-in-chief Wang Xiangwei. This audio is generated by an AI tool. HONG KONG: In 2021, when China further relaxed family planning controls by allowing couples to have up to three children, the major policy shift was expected to trigger a “revenge” baby boom. In late 2022 when Beijing suddenly lifted zero-COVID controls, the authorities banked on post-lockdown “revenge spending” to drive economic growth. Late last year, the government unleashed a series of extra rescue measures to stave off an acute property crisis , raising expectations of “revenge” growth in home purchases. All those expectations have fallen flat. As one viral joke on China’s social media goes: “[Officials] thought we would seek ‘revenge’ but underestimated our compassion. We have already let go of grudges”. The sarcastic joke serves as a vivid illustration of one of the greatest challenges for China’s leadership: How to get the country’s reluctant consumers to spend. This has become a matter of high importance and urgency as the Communist Party’s Central Committee is scheduled to hold a long-delayed plenum in July to discuss a new growth model at a time of great uncertainties at home and abroad. How China rebalances its economy will also be closely watched by its major trading partners, including the United States and European Union. Both Washington and Brussels have ratcheted up the rhetoric and launched anti-subsidy investigations against Chinese companies which are flooding international markets with green tech products ranging from electric vehicles to wind turbines and solar panels. Their argument is that China should encourage its own citizens to spend more to absorb its rising production capacity. Indeed, in 2022, China accounted for 31 per cent of global manufacturing value added and 27 per cent of global real exports, but only 13 per cent of global consumption, according to a report co-authored by Larry Hu, head of China Economics at Macquarie Group. He expected the gap to continue to widen and the risk of trade tensions to increase over time. Ironically, China’s leadership has long recognised the importance of boosting domestic consumption, at least publicly. Over the past two decades, successive leaders have talked up the country’s supersize market with a booming middle class estimated at 400 million people and 140 million households, and rising. But during the same period, consumption’s share of China’s gross domestic product stalled at just above 50 per cent, compared to more than 70 per cent in major economies. Much has been written about why China’s consumers are reluctant to spend. The main reasons include their propensity to save and lack of adequate social welfare and healthcare. Little has been written about the fact that boosting consumption has always been a lower priority for China’s leadership, compared to exports and investments, the other two traditional engines of growth. This has much to do with the party’s ideology and its management philosophy. After the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949, Mao Zedong promised to build the country into a socialist paradise but directed a significant amount of resources to push for industrialisation and national defence, paving the way for China to possess all the industrial categories in the United Nations industrial classification – widely believed to be the only country in the world to be able to do so. The concept of consumption or welfare did not enter the equation, particularly at a time when most people barely had enough to fill their stomachs. Since China’s reform and opening up in the late 1970s, successive leaders have pursued the investment-led growth model supported by booming exports to build up the world’s second-largest economy. But they have long been averse to any whiff of welfarism which they believe encourages laziness. “Eating bitterness” is still the watchword, repeated by China’s leaders in public. This line of thinking has reflected a deep-rooted distrust of individuals and a firm belief that the greater good overrides the needs of those individuals. That helps explain why China’s leaders at the national level have strongly resisted suggestions to hand out cash or vouchers to its citizens to boost consumption during the three years of zero-COVID restrictions, which severely disrupted the economy. Instead, China’s economic planners have unleashed more infrastructure investments to boost growth. Visitors to China may be impressed by high-speed railways and modern airports. However, much of that infrastructure is losing money with capacity far exceeding demand. But prioritising these investments is what China’s economic planners have been trained to do and what they know best. As trade tensions with China’s major trading partners are set to worsen, the pressure on Beijing to spur household consumption is getting more acute. But the best option economic planners can come up with is to launch a nationwide drive of encouraging consumers to trade in their old goods including electric appliances and cars for new ones at subsidised prices. A far bigger headache is the falling confidence of China’s 400-million-strong middle class. Their wealth has suffered a severe beating due to the sharp falls in the stock market and real estate over the past few years. Unless China’s leaders undertake a fundamental rethink of its growth model and plan radical moves to spur consumption, consumers will most likely choose to mind their wallets rather than pulling them out for some “revenge spending”.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary The number of expatriates “decoupling” from China is increasing, but having too few international workers in the country can lead to missed opportunities, says Financial Times' Beijing bureau chief Joe Leahy. BEIJING: Most people by now are familiar with the idea of “de-risking” or “decoupling” as the United States and European Union try to diversify from China in strategic industries. Less well known is a more subtle form of decoupling that is afflicting corporate China, particularly international businesses in the country - a lack of expatriates. Foreign companies in China are reporting that the number of expatriates who want to live and work in the world’s second-largest economy is still low compared with before the pandemic and there are few signs that it will fully recover soon. Why should international companies care? After all, “localisation” - appointing local staff in the place of expatriates - is advancing in China as geopolitics makes the environment more complicated and more businesses shift parts of their supply chains to other countries. Localisation also suits those multinationals that are selling into the Chinese domestic market and need to better tailor their products for local customers - the so-called “in-China-for-China” strategy. But having too few international employees can also have unintended consequences for foreign companies in China. Without employees going back and forth from headquarters, opportunities can be missed in communications gaps. Exhibit one of the latter is how many foreign automakers were caught out by the sudden rise of China’s electric-vehicle manufacturers during the pandemic. For multinationals, ensuring a constant to and fro of employees between headquarters and their operations in different countries is important for instilling a global corporate culture too. “In an environment where you don’t have this very regular exchange of personnel for long-term assignments between headquarters and China - going in both directions - then it’s really hard to preserve the corporate culture,” says Sean Stein, chair of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. “And once the corporate culture starts to weaken, gaps between HQ and China start to expand.” Executives also say that by increasing the number of people in corporate headquarters with meaningful China experience, companies can reduce “friction” in communications with their operations there. Precise data on expatriates in China is scarce. Chinese authorities have said the country issued permits for 711,000 foreign residents last year compared with 846,000 in 2020 - the most recent prior comparison available. The European Chamber of Commerce in China’s business confidence survey published in 2023 found that 16 per cent of respondents did not employ any foreign nationals at the time and that expatriates accounted for 10 per cent or fewer of staff for 78 per cent of them. This was slightly more severe than the survey published the previous year. Both surveys, however, reflected the worst effects of the pandemic. Executives report that things have picked up since then but there is no sign of a return to pre-Covid levels or even the heyday era before the pick-up in US-China trade tensions from 2018. Whereas high-flying executives would once have gladly done a stint in China, today the posting looks more troublesome. Apart from geopolitical concerns, there is the extreme corporate competition in the country. In its recent business climate survey, Amcham China found that one-third of respondents reported that their profit margins based on earnings before interest and tax in China were below their global average while only 19 per cent were above the global average. Fixing the expat gap will be complex. Companies’ global headquarters will need to offer extra incentives both to high-performers outside China to do a stint in the country and to local staff in China to accept assignments outside. This is important partly because of the need to grasp promising opportunities but also compliance. In China, as anywhere, things can go badly off course when a global company loses close oversight of its subsidiaries. Expatriates will not by themselves solve this but they are one channel for instilling global compliance standards. After all, China’s corporate history is littered with foreign businesses caught up in disputes with their local partners, or embroiled in localised corruption cases. That is the kind of decoupling no company wants.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Malaysia’s climate action commitments are vital, but difficult to achieve. A three-pronged approach opens possibilities to be a low-carbon economy, says ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute’s Dr Vinod Thomas. File photo of an abandoned petrol station in Malaysia's Negeri Sembilan state on Jul 25, 2022. (Photo: AFP/Mohd Rasfan) SINGAPORE: Malaysia faces the integral challenge of greening the economy as the country strives to sustain economic growth and improve people’s well-being. To be sure, green growth is a global agenda and the burden rightly falls on the major economies and their disproportionately high carbon emissions. Malaysia’s responsibility in mitigating emissions becomes clearer at the regional level; the country constitutes 5 per cent of Southeast Asia’s population but contributes 15 per cent of Southeast Asia’s carbon effluents, marking a relatively high figure per person. Cleaner growth also enhances the investment climate: Notably, foreign interests are attracted to green investment , especially renewable energy in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia. Malaysia must accelerate economic transformation in line with its climate action goal of halving carbon emissions by 2030 (compared to 2005 levels). Climate action must not be viewed as inimical to growth but rather as essential for growth to be sustained. Southeast Asia, by one study, could lose 30 per cent of gross domestic product by 2100 from labour productivity loss, workers’ health deterioration, spikes in natural disasters, and agricultural losses under a “high emission” scenario. Climate policies and investments, or decarbonisation, bring the social benefit of averting such economic calamity. Decarbonising the economy also entails a social cost, even if the cost is estimated to be far smaller than the social benefit. Nevertheless, public policy must give due attention to adverse social impacts, such as the potential displacement of over 40,000 workers currently in Malaysia’s petroleum, chemical, rubber and plastic industries, when these industries are scaled down or even phased out. Economic policies must also provide training and safety nets for workers caught in the transition, and emphasise job opportunities in new, scaled-up green industries such as renewable energy. About 92 per cent of energy production in Malaysia is based on the fossil fuels of coal, oil, and gas. Energy production, comprising electricity and heat, is associated with nearly 50 per cent of carbon emissions. Significantly, transport is next, with 29 per cent (compared to a global average of 25 per cent), followed by industry, which encompasses manufacturing and construction. The phasing out of fossil fuels in electricity generation is the centrepiece of Malaysia’s 2050 net zero commitment. Recent five-year plans have embraced environmental sustainability, including the National Energy Transition Roadmap (2023-2050), National Energy Policy (2022-2040), Green Technology Master Plan (2017-2030), the Feed-in-Tariff mechanism introduced in 2015, and the Renewable Energy Act of 2011. A three-pronged approach across incentives, investments, and institutions would help Malaysia meet, or hopefully exceed, the goals envisaged in these plans. First, regulatory policies in industry and in transport need to tilt incentives more strongly in favour of low-carbon energy. Through pricing strategies that favour clean energy, market signals can nudge the consumer to opt for renewable energy supply. The implementation and scale-up of the Green Electricity Tariff launched in 2023 is a step in the right direction, in addition to the feed-in tariff that enables the purchase of renewable energy from the grid at a favourable rate. The full removal of fuel subsidies would also discourage fossil fuel consumption. Malaysia ranks 20th among the 25 big providers of fuel subsidies. The country has continued to subsidise liquid petroleum gas, natural gas, and domestic electricity, but is expected to cut petrol subsidies this year to lower the fiscal deficit. The renewable energy market can also be further deregulated to facilitate more choice and competition. For example, enabling direct third-party installation of domestic solar panels and direct sale of energy to consumers would make the renewable programmes more attractive. As recognised by the authorities, private contractors would be motivated to lease rooftops from households to install solar panels if they could supply to the grid and thus earn more revenue. Second, Malaysia should pursue the huge potential for green investment in electric vehicles (EVs), including motorcycles, and in hydrogen-based industries. Malaysia could set up to be an innovation leader, for example, in the use of battery-swapping technology in EVs to cut recharge times and improve battery life. The incentives for EV adoption, such as the road tax exemption and personal tax exemption relating to EV expenses, are justified. An EV revolution would be key to Kuala Lumpur’s 2030 goal of reducing carbon intensity to 45 per cent of the 2005 level. A breakthrough in hydrogen presents the biggest hope in renewable technology. Green hydrogen is a clean energy alternative that can generate immense heat while producing water as a byproduct. However, its commercialisation faces tough challenges, especially due to the high cost of producing hydrogen. The possibilities are already growing, with hydrogen being increasingly used in chemicals, textile fibre manufacturing, glass, electronics, and metallurgy. Malaysia has great potential in this area as positive experiences emerge, for example in Sarawak, where projects such as H2ornbill and H2biscus, in collaboration with Japanese and South Korean partners respectively, have made strides in hydrogen-based, export-oriented industries. Third, Malaysia needs to shore up institutional and financial support. Some key areas include education programmes and funding to equip the workforce for a low-carbon economy, and financing models, incentives and grants for green technology adoption and green technology R&D. The country needs clearer standards and regulations in renewable markets, and more stringent monitoring of green investments, to enhance transparency and accountability. The government could also address the formulation of a green taxonomy, which local banks have indicated would be valuable in establishing criteria for approving green loans. Finally, enhancing the accessibility and quality of data will be crucial for policy analysis, monitoring, evaluation, and future reforms. With its heavy reliance on fossil fuels, Malaysia faces a tough but essential road to decarbonisation. Nonetheless, the country is well-positioned to tap into emerging technological opportunities for low-carbon growth in industry and transport. Moving forward, Malaysia must boldly and swiftly spur green investments and pursue its carbon reduction goals. Vinod Thomas is a Visiting Senior Fellow at the ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute.

Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim at the PKR 25th Anniversary Special Convention at IDCC Shah Alam, Selangor on Apr 21, 2024. (Photo: Facebook/Anwar Ibrahim) This audio is generated by an AI tool. KUALA LUMPUR: As Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s People’s Justice Party (PKR) celebrates its silver jubilee in 2024, it can no longer claim to be a young party. Although it will always be significantly younger than other mainstream parties - UMNO (77 years), PAS (72 years), DAP (58 years) - its stable electoral presence and governing experience at the federal and state level has earned PKR the right to be considered seriously. PKR was born out of a major political crisis when its figurehead, Mr Anwar, was sacked as deputy prime minister in 1998 and jailed twice after. Crises never seemed to cease for PKR as the party was faced with arrests and detentions, violent clashes with authorities, party splits, and massive defections. “Crisis is PKR’s middle name,” one analyst said in 2021. After its first breakthrough in the 2008 general election, when it won 31 seats, PKR became a mainstay contender, subsequently becoming leader of the unity government with Mr Anwar as prime minister in 2022. This makes the question of succession topical as it gives a sense of how the party and by extension, the country, will evolve. Interestingly, Mr Anwar has been PKR’s president for only six years out of the party’s 25-year life, as he was in and out of prison. For the most part, Mr Anwar was the party’s informal advisor and de facto leader, and his wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, stood in his place for 19 years (1999-2018). Prior to PKR’s 25th anniversary celebration on Sunday (Apr 21), long-time PKR member Hassan Karim brought up succession as a core issue of consideration as the party decides its next 25 years. Mr Anwar will also turn 80 by the next general election, assuming the term runs its maximum course. To this, party leaders have often avoided directly answering, preferring to assure others that PKR has enough capable young leaders, in a party that has a life separate from any individual. However, there may be other reasons why PKR chooses not to discuss this. First, it is non-strategic to do so as it would weaken its hand as a governing party. As the leader of the unity government, PKR’s electoral chances heavily depend on its performance as government. And a government’s performance, especially a reforming one, hinges on continuity. That means for PKR to be successful in the next general election, it inevitably must position Mr Anwar as prime minister for a second term, as both a validation for its first and as a necessity for reforms to succeed. In other words, the need for governing continuity removes the question of succession within the party. Second, it is also potentially destabilising for PKR to openly contemplate succession. Any candidate alternative to Mr Anwar will only invite internal schisms and/or opportunistic pursuit by other allied parties - opening a can of worms. Other than Mr Anwar, it’s unlikely that any other candidate would be accepted by all parties within the Pakatan Harapan coalition and the unity government. Mr Anwar’s prior government seniority, global networks, sacrificial legitimacy, accommodative leadership, charismatic personality, and Malay and Islamic credentials made him acceptable to most parties. It was only Mr Anwar who could act as a glue for the ideologically opposites, PAS and DAP, to work together under the Pakatan Rakyat coalition (2008-2015), the first substantive coalition in Malaysian history which made critical electoral breakthroughs. It was also he who stitched together once-warring factions to form the unity government under the King’s ordain. Mr Anwar’s successor might not possess the necessary seniority or respect to hold the coalition together at a tenuous time, leaving it vulnerable to the opposition. Lastly, the theoretical question of succession must not be divorced from the emotive connection of PKR to Mr Anwar. The party was formed because of the injustice inflicted on Mr Anwar, and the party’s “eye” logo came from Mr Anwar’s “black eye” during his detention in 1998. Mr Anwar is seen as a symbol of sacrifice at PKR. His successor will only be successful if he/she manages the transition well, while preserving Mr Anwar’s legacy and larger-than-life personality. But it does not change the fact that it will always remain an emotive subject of discussion. At PKR’s special convention, the party launched an organisation framework (POP25) and election preparation framework (KEMAS16), aimed at ensuring its governance and keeping Mr Anwar as prime minister for a second term. This clearly sets aside the succession question for now. When the moment of succession comes, PKR will likely decide the way other mainstream parties do: Picking the candidate most accepted by party leaders, with the blessing of its predecessor. The only thing we know is that the new leader who will take over from Mr Anwar will likely go through unprecedented experiences as the party enters a new phase of evolution: A contested presidency, the burdens of a governing party, leading a younger leadership, and managing new dynamics in the coalition. A post-Anwar world might be different, but it will not erase Mr Anwar’s quarter-of-a-century imprint on the party.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary What was initially a by-election serving as a proxy to test the support for the unity government and Selangor state government has evolved into a classic identity politics poll, says political analyst James Chai. Pakatan Harapan's Pang Sock Tao (centre) is in a four-cornered battle for the Kuala Kubu Bharu seat in Selangor. (Photo: Facebook/Pang Sock Tao) This audio is generated by an AI tool. KUALA LUMPUR: Oddly enough, a by-election contest in the usually quiet scenic town of Kuala Kubu Bharu in Selangor is getting quite a lot of attention. The four-cornered fight between Pang Sock Tao of Pakatan Harapan (PH), Khairul Azhari Saut of Perikatan Nasional (PN), Hafizah Zainuddin of Parti Rakyat Malaysia and independent candidate Nyau Ke Xin has also given rise to “birther-esque” claims over some of the candidates’ educational background. It started with a TikTok user questioning the credentials of PN candidate Mr Khairul. The post, which garnered more than half a million views, questioned how Mr Khairul could have obtained a master’s degree just only a year after obtaining his diploma, especially during the COVID-19 lockdown period. While Mr Khairul and his alma mater, Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah (UMPSA), came out to confirm his credentials - an executive master’s degree in business management - it opened up an opportunity to question the credentials of PN’s opponent. Mr Fadhli Shaari, a former PN youth chief and the current information chief for Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS), a PN component party, publicly challenged PH’s Mdm Pang to publicise her primary and secondary school results, specifically the location of the schools. At first glance, this appeared like a fact-finding mission to establish the authenticity of their education credentials, as allegations of fake degrees and half-truths have persisted among Malaysian politicians. However, observers have suggested an alternative motive, positing this as a strategic political tactic targeted specifically at the Democratic Action Party (DAP) candidate, to question her credibility and loyalty to Malaysia. If Mdm Pang went to a vernacular school, took a non-national exam (e.g. Unified Examination Certificate), and/or did not score well in the Malay language, it would imply that she is not an “ideal” candidate. Remaining silent was not a choice for Mdm Pang, as it would be taken as she had something to hide. She publicised her results in full: Not only did she ace her Malay language subjects, she also took the national entrance exams and was a straight-A student. After Mdm Pang shared her results, Mr Fadhli apologised for raising questions about her educational background, but added: “This has indirectly revealed that the candidate graduated from vernacular schools ... I hope that this issue will continue until polling day for the by-election.” This gives rise to the possibility that for PN, it was never about the results, nor was it a fact-finding mission to legally disqualify Mdm Pang from the polls. It creates an impression that they wanted to show that Mdm Pang was an unsuitable candidate because of her background - that she was not “one of us” - even though she was a Malaysian straight-A student who took the national exam. Yang Berhormat Pasir Mas, Tuan Ahmad Fadhli Shaari bertanya tentang UPSR dan SPM saya... Inilah jawapannya. Saya... Research analyst, Aziff Azuddin, described this tactic as similar to Donald Trump’s “birther politics”. As Barack Obama’s popularity surged after the 2004 Democratic National Convention speech, conspiracy theories arose about his place of birth, reportedly started by the columnist Andy Martin. This issue resurfaced with new falsehoods every few years until it became that Mr Obama was a secret Muslim born in Kenya. It was finally peddled by Donald Trump in 2011, who built his base among conservatives in the Republican Party, propelling him to the presidency in 2017. Even though Mr Obama’s team shared his birth certificate documents - both short-form and long-form - multiple times to prove his citizenship, the conspiracy theories not only did not dissipate but expanded to other candidates such as US Vice President Kamala Harris and became an issue on major political platforms. This is because birther politics is never a factual query but an ideological one. It represents a “statement of values”, about a particular notion of allegiance and loyalty to a country. The seat in KKB fell vacant after three-term DAP assemblywoman Lee Kee Hiong died on Mar 21 from cancer. Malays make up nearly 50 per cent of the electorate, followed by Chinese (30 per cent) and Indians (18 per cent). Early voting started on May 7, and polling takes place on May 11. Though Mr Fadhli may view the questioning of Mdm Pang’s credentials as a clever strategy that successfully trapped her, it may turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory. DAP, one of four component parties in the PH coalition , understood what Mr Fadhli was trying to do and turned the vernacular education issue on its head by cornering PN to state its official stance. On this front, PN’s position is surprisingly disadvantageous. Only two months ago, the Federal Court declared vernacular schools constitutional after an unsuccessful challenge by several groups on the vernacular languages as medium of instructions. The rapid rise of non-Chinese students in vernacular schools - 15.3 per cent Malay and 2.75 per cent Indian - in the past few years have also discounted simplistic race-based criticisms against these schools. More importantly, it runs against PAS’ off-season courting of non-Muslim votes as its top-down party strategy. Since the last general election, its leadership, chiefly Dr Halimah Ali, has been tasked to reach out to the urban circles, including the English-language radio station BFM 89.9, to assure voters that PAS is a moderate force. PAS president Hadi Awang posted about his closeness to the Chinese community during last year’s Chinese New Year, including how his grandfather had adopted many Chinese children and how his daughter-in-law is Chinese. Mr Hadi’s grandchildren reportedly attend vernacular Chinese schools as well. Mr Fadhli’s strategy has also inadvertently affected Bersatu, Mr Khairul’s party, as the Malay indigenous party was supposed to be the moderating force for PN to appeal to urban centres in the west coast. DAP took this opportunity to pressure Bersatu president Muhyiddin Yassin to state his stance on vernacular schools, knowing that any answer would put them in a weaker position. What was initially a by-election serving as a proxy to test the support for the unity government and Selangor state government has evolved into a classic identity politics poll. Mr Fadhli’s strategy may turn out riskier than initially thought. PN’s decision to not field their non-Malay stand-in party, Gerakan, or a non-Malay candidate in KKB probably already cost them critical non-Malay votes. The seat has never been won by a Malay candidate before. Now this vernacular school tactic might worsen PN’s chances. The KKB by-election was supposed to be a fail-safe election for PN. It is not the incumbent coalition, and winning one seat would not change the federal and state government. PN could have used this by-election as an opportunity to win over the non-Malays by attracting protest votes and showcasing its moderate tendencies. Instead, it chose to repeat its old playbook. Whether this turns out to be a costly mistake will be seen in the by-election results. James Chai is a political analyst, columnist and the author of Sang Kancil (Penguin Random House).

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Relations between the two countries have evolved considerably over the last half century. It is in China's interest to have a stable and prosperous Southeast Asia, says Asian Studies professor James Chin of the University of Tasmania. This audio is generated by an AI tool. HOBART, Australia: Friday (May 31) marks a half century of formal diplomatic ties between China and Malaysia, established on this day in 1974. Ahmad Zahid bin Hamidi is currently on his first official visit to China as Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister, during which he will attend the 50th anniversary celebration in Beijing. Chinese Premier Li Qiang is also expected to visit Malaysia this year. This milestone is not only important for the two countries but for the whole region as well. The geopolitical environment was very different 50 years ago. China then was still formally supporting the Malayan Communist Party, which was involved in armed conflict against federal forces. Malaysia imposed restrictions on Malaysian Chinese citizens’ travel to China to prevent unwanted influence. Then Malaysian prime minister Abdul Razak Hussein decided to establish formal ties with China to cement Malaysia’s reputation as a non-aligned country . He also understood the political significance of being one of the first countries in the region to do so amid China’s rise as a regional power. More importantly, he had founded Barisan Nasional, a multiracial coalition in the aftermath of the 1969 race riots. Upon this diplomatic milestone, the two countries agreed on principles that would guide their relations henceforth, including the non-interference in each other’s domestic affairs. China agreed to recognise issues related to the Malayan Communist Party as such, signalling it would limit its support, and that Malaysians of Chinese origin did not also have Chinese nationality. Since then, overall ties have been relatively smooth. The communist threat waned with a peace treaty and ultimate dissolution of the Malayan Communist Party in 1989. The opening up of China under Deng Xiaoping accelerated trade ties and Malaysia began to relax its policy of allowing Malaysian Chinese to visit China. In a generation, China became Malaysia’s largest trade partner. Malaysia-China relations were said to have hit new highs during the Najib Razak administration. China played up the fact that his father was the one who opened up ties and he reciprocated by committing Malaysia to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature infrastructure Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Najib was also motivated by the fact that China was the only major power willing to welcome him after the West shunned him in the wake of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) corruption scandal, signing deals and offering significant foreign direct investment to Malaysia during the later half of the Najib administration. Fast forward to today, China is now the world’s second-largest economy and has been Malaysia’s top trading partner for more than a decade. If there is fear, it is in the economic arena and security area. Malay nationalists are afraid that the country will be too economically dependent on China for trade, investment and technology. Sections of the Malay establishment, which has typically been pro-West, are worried that China will replace the United States and the Western bloc as Malaysia’s key strategic partner in the near future. Others are concerned about ongoing territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea . In 2023, Malaysia protested against China’s new map staking claim over disputed maritime areas in Sabah and Sarawak. For years, Chinese fishing trawlers have been fishing in Malaysian waters off the coast of Sarawak, despite many diplomatic notes from Malaysia. Chinese naval vessels regularly sailed into Malaysian waters and attempts were made to build a small Chinese installation in one of the disputed islands. Even those who think Malaysia should just keep walking a middle path between the West and China know this is becoming increasing hard in the face of growing Chinese military power. From China’s perspective, Malaysia is probably the most important ASEAN country for geo-strategic reasons. Malaysia is the only country to straddle both sides of the South China Sea – peninsular Malaysia on one and Borneo on the other. The Chinese know that if there is going to be any confrontation over China’s claim to South China Sea, Malaysia will be directly involved. Thus, Malaysia is a high priority for Beijing to deepen ties with and assert influence on. Beijing has no military ambition when it comes to Malaysia, believing (correctly in my view) that inter-connected economic ties between the two would ensure that Malaysia will never confront Beijing openly. Over the long term, the BRI plan to build a high-speed train from Singapore to Kunming could link much of Southeast Asia to China. Malaysia is one of the few countries whose ordinary passport holders are currently allowed visa-free entry into China for short visits. Chinese nationals form the largest group under the Malaysia My Second Home programme, which allows them to live as permanent residents for 10 years. Xiamen University has established a branch campus ten minutes’ drive from Putrajaya, Malaysia’s seat of power. Thousands of Malaysians enrol in Chinese universities every year, a trend that will continue. As the two countries toast to their half-century ties, both sides are realistic about their future. Malaysia, like other Southeast Asian nations, is clear-eyed that there is no hiding from the Chinese shadow. No one gets to pick their neighbour, but confrontation can be kept to a minimum and areas of mutual concern navigated carefully. Beijing’s hard power has grown and its soft power will only gain traction in the coming years. China must know that aggressively flexing its economic power or military might in the South China Sea could turn Southeast Asians against it. China and Malaysia are here today after 50 years of hard work and the give-and-take that characterises most foreign policy. But will what got them here get them through the next 50 years? As the world’s centre of gravity shifts to the Asia-Pacific, it is in the interest of China – and India as major powers in this region – to have a stable and prosperous Southeast Asia. Pragmatism will continue to guide Malaysia-China diplomatic relations for the foreseeable future. James Chin is Professor of Asian Studies at the Asia Institute Tasmania, University of Tasmania.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Without adopting a comprehensive conservation plan for the animals, Malaysia risks international condemnation that it is gifting orangutans as a reward to major palm oil importers, says this foreign policy expert from University of Nottingham Malaysia. A Sumatran orangutan eats vegetables at the National Zoo in Kuala Lumpur on May 25, 2022. Following in the footsteps of China's \"panda diplomacy\", Malaysia has made the controversial decision to send orangutans to major economic partners. (Photo: AFP/Mohd Rasfan) SEMENYIH, Selangor: Malaysia plans to gift orangutans to major economic partners , as a way of improving its international image and building alliances. The “orangutan diplomacy” plan was confirmed by the nation’s plantation and commodities minister, Johari Abdul Ghani, at a biodiversity conference in early May. Malaysia made the controversial announcement days after the European Union, one of Malaysia’s biggest palm oil importers, agreed to ban agricultural imports that cultivate crops on lands that were deforested after 2020. Firms wishing to export to the EU would now need to provide proof, such as satellite images, that crops were not grown in such conditions. This could hit Malaysia’s palm oil industry, which has been accused of destroying the forest habitats of endangered species, including the orangutan . Without adopting a comprehensive conservation plan for the animals, Malaysia risks international condemnation that it is gifting orangutans as a reward to major palm oil importers. This could undermine the programme as well as the nation’s image. In Malay and Indonesian, orangutan means “person of the forest” . These great apes are found only in Malaysia and Indonesia. They have reddish fur, long arms, cheek pads, and, just like China’s giant pandas , opposable thumbs . They have human-like intelligence and have been known to employ herbal medicine to heal their wounds , communicate and use sign language. Unfortunately, orangutan numbers are dwindling. The WWF (formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature) states that there were more than 230,000 orangutans 100 years ago. But the current population is less than half that figure, and the primates are critically endangered . Undoubtedly, poaching and the illegal animal trade are partly responsible. However, the biggest culprit appears to be palm oil-induced deforestation where swaths of forest land, which contain orangutan habitats, make way for palm oil plantations. The plan to send orangutans to major palm oil importers is already controversial . Stuart Pimm, a conservation ecologist from Duke University in the US, described orangutan diplomacy as “obscene” and “repugnant”, while emphasising that unlike China’s giant pandas, orangutans do not have established state-of-the-art facilities and protected areas in their homeland. Malaysia is economically dependent on palm oil. Five per cent of the country’s 2022 GDP came from the sector, while palm oil exports are also a major source of Malaysia’s foreign exchange earnings . Palm oil is a highly versatile and cost-effective commodity. It is used to make cooking oil, lipstick, shampoo, detergent, soap, cookies, chocolate and many other everyday products. Johari concedes that his idea of Malaysia gifting orangutans to major palm oil importing nations is a diplomatic strategy to convince economic partners that Malaysia is committed to developing its economy while preserving wildlife. Malaysia also clearly wants to try and offset the bad publicity for palm oil and its industrial policy. The idea for orangutan diplomacy is inspired by the success of China’s panda diplomacy project. Legend has it that panda diplomacy began during the ancient Tang Dynasty (618-907), but only took off after US president Richard and first lady Pat Nixon paid an official visit to China in February 1972. Two months later, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing arrived at the National Zoo in Washington DC. Within a year of their arrival, the pandas attracted more than 1.1. million visitors, and were the zoo’s star attractions for years. As a soft power tool, panda diplomacy has been designed to build alliances with other nations. The programme moved towards becoming a conservation programme in the early 1990s, and Beijing has sent dozens of its bears to key partners across the world. There are three main elements that make panda diplomacy a success. One, the pandas have visual appeal . Giant pandas have what experts call kindchenschema, a clumsy and childlike set of characteristics that evokes empathy and sense of protection from humans. Two, pandas are exclusively found in China. When foreign citizens see pandas as adorable, friendly and peaceful, they associate them with China exclusively. Three, the initiative is tied to a high-profile conservation programme. While people have criticised the political aspects of panda diplomacy, the conservation component has won over critics. According to International Union for Conservation of Nature, giant pandas are no longer endangered , and panda diplomacy has played a crucial role in this. Could an orangutan diplomacy programme follow the same path? Orangutans have unique physical attributes and appeal , but there are major points of difference. For one, the Chinese government loans, rather than gifts, pandas to strategic allies, and did not appear to roll out panda diplomacy due to pressure from external factors. More importantly, China has worked closely with conservation groups, such as the WWF , to set up green corridors for pandas, and has won accolades from conservation bodies. In the end, Kuala Lumpur needs to be honest with itself: Can orangutan diplomacy reverse the misfortunes that may befall palm oil exports from Malaysia? It’s not likely. If forest management, conservation of wildlife, and the sustainability of palm oil production are concerning trading partners like Europe, then it may best if the Malaysian government addresses these issues before contemplating its own version of animal diplomacy. As it stands, orangutan diplomacy is looking more like a public relations disaster waiting to happen. Chee Meng Tan is an Assistant Professor at the University of Nottingham Malaysia.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Some Singaporean parents use corporal punishment to discipline their kids as they were subjected to similar treatment as children, says psychiatrist Lim Boon Leng. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A man was recently jailed for causing the death of his son by forcing chili into his mouth as a form of punishment. The tragic outcome of this heartbreaking event brings to attention the perennial debate on corporal punishment in our society. Many adult Singaporeans have harrowing stories of punishments they endured as children, ranging from caning to being forced to kneel or getting locked out of the house. While some view these punishments as badges of honour, believing they contributed to their character development, others have endured profound trauma that continues to haunt them throughout their lives. Corporal punishment in Asian cultures, including Singapore, is deeply rooted in our historical and cultural traditions. Values include obedience, respect for authority and strict discipline. Many parents continue to resort to corporal punishments as they were subjected to similar treatment during their upbringing. They believe the tough love from these harsh punishments is necessary for a child’s proper behaviour and eventual success. Conversely, “Western-style” positive parenting is often stigmatised as being too lenient and ineffective, leading to concerns that it will result in poorly behaved children. As the saying goes: Spare the rod and spoil the child. However, scientific studies have found that physical punishment increases the risk of broad and enduring negative developmental outcomes for children. Research indicates that physical punishment can lead to increased aggression, antisocial behaviour, anxiety, depression and lower self-esteem. Children subjected to physical punishment are more likely to experience mental health problems and engage in violent behaviour as adults. These findings highlight the long-term consequences of corporal punishment, suggesting it does more harm than good. Furthermore, no study has ever found that physical punishment enhances developmental health. Today, many parents defend the use of corporal punishment by claiming that they were raised with such methods and turned out just fine. However, this perspective overlooks the lasting psychological and emotional harm that many individuals endure as a result of these punitive practices. While a parent may believe that a physical punishment is justified, the thin line between discipline and abuse is often blurred. A child may perceive seemingly appropriate punishment as abusive and be traumatised by the experience. Also, just because someone appears to be functioning well does not mean they have not been adversely affected by their experiences. The impact of corporal punishment can present itself in many different ways, including difficulties in forming healthy relationships, managing emotions and coping with stress. Parents often resort to physical punishments out of frustration or a lack of alternative methods of discipline. We all recognise that parenting is inherently challenging, especially in a busy and competitive society like Singapore. In moments of stress and anger, it can be difficult to resist the urge to use physical punishment as a quick fix. However, it is crucial to recognise that these actions are more about alleviating our parental frustration than educating or guiding the child. Positive parenting provides a compassionate and evidence-based alternative to corporal punishment. This approach emphasises nurturing, guidance and non-violent discipline to create a supportive environment for children's growth. Positive parenting techniques include setting clear and consistent boundaries, using time-out and rewarding positive behaviour. Research has shown that positive parenting is effective. A meta-analysis published in the Psychological Bulletin revealed that positive parenting practices are linked to higher academic achievement, improved mental health and better social skills in children. Additionally, positive parenting helps to strengthen the parent-child relationship by fostering trust and open communication. I often recommend The Parenting Pyramid, developed by the Arbinger Institute, to parents as I find it to be a particularly useful approach to parenting. The pyramid emphasises that effective correction relies on effective teaching, which in turn depends on a strong parent-child relationship. The foundation of the pyramid is the parents' personal well-being, underscoring the importance of a healthy, positive mindset when parenting. Transitioning from corporal punishment to positive parenting can be challenging for parents who were raised with it. However, with the right support, it is entirely possible. Parenting workshops, community support groups and educational resources can provide parents with the tools and strategies needed to implement non-violent discipline. Health professionals, educators, and community leaders play a crucial role in promoting these resources and supporting parents through this transition. Finally, most instances of child abuse occur under the context of punishment . This tragic incident, where a father caused his son's death through punitive discipline, underscores this reality. As the judge stated, \"It could have been prevented if you (the father) did not adopt such a method to discipline your child.\" He added, \"This method of disciplining a vulnerable victim, or any such method ... should be discouraged ... at all costs.\" Dr Lim Boon Leng is a psychiatrist at the Gleneagles Medical Centre.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary From US and China defence chiefs holding rare direct talks and a surprise visit from Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Singapore hosted an important forum for communication in an era of complex geopolitics, say Nanyang Technological University’s Sarah Teo and Dylan MH Loh. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Global attention was on Singapore over the weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue, with two events generating the most buzz: United States and China defence chiefs held face-to-face talks for the first time in 18 months and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a surprise in-person visit to the annual security forum to call for support to end Russia’s invasion. In an era of complex geopolitics, such a forum opens an important space for communication - both in what organisers line up in the official programme and how countries choose to engage on the sidelines. An important function of dialogue - especially among contending parties - is to ensure that each side understands the other’s “red lines”. In this regard, the Shangri-La Dialogue certainly provided that. The meeting between US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chinese Minister of National Defense Admiral Dong Jun is significant as it is the first time that they have met in person, following a video call in April. In the context of the heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing, such face-to-face communication is important to facilitate more substantive interactions and reduce military risks. Indeed, the resumption of military-to-military dialogue between the two countries - particularly the creation of a “crisis-communications working group” by the year’s end - is encouraging, even if it is evident that fundamental differences persist. Two days after the bilateral, while addressing the conference, Admiral Dong was unequivocal on how Taiwan was the “core of core issues” for China, discoursing at length in his speech and in his responses to questions. At the same time, he stressed that the United States is testing China’s “red lines” with arms sales to the island. While these speeches often carry a performative element, they are nonetheless important in setting the baseline on what is unacceptable behaviour - which, in theory, would lessen the risk of miscalculation and inject predictability. Earlier in the conference, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared it would “almost certainly” be a red line if a Filipino is “killed by a wilful act” in the South China Sea, and “very, very close to … an act of war”. He was responding to a hypothetical question posed about the use of water cannons by China’s coast guard against Philippine ships in disputed waters, where the two countries have had numerous run-ins. In reality, however, the establishment of red lines can themselves be a point of contention because the other party may not accept or acknowledge their legitimacy. It was reported, for instance, that China briefed the media after Mr Marcos’s speech to push back against his claims. In the case of Taiwan, the United States believes arms sales are legitimate under its Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 and has continued to do so under successive presidents, even though China has repeatedly protested against them. The value and the risk of drawing red lines have to be weighed, lest countries back themselves into escalation. And that is why it is incumbent on all countries, if they cannot resolve issues, to properly manage them. Indeed, discussions at the Shangri-La Dialogue repeatedly stressed the expectation of responsible behaviour. Both major powers and smaller states have responsibilities towards maintaining the rules-based international order. Indonesia Minister of Defence and President-elect Prabowo Subianto emphasised that great power status demanded commensurate responsibilities, while Lithuania Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte spoke about the agency of small states to “achieve strength through unity”. But some challenges remain intractable. A peaceful and just end to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza remains distant even as they must be pursued relentlessly. So there must be a responsibility for all to also re-imagine solutions for peace and stability - the theme of the plenary session in which Mr Zelenskyy spoke - and a need for more countries to stand up and be counted in efforts against unilateral attempts to change the global and regional status quo. To many, a Ukraine peace summit or the call for inclusive dialogue may sound like more of the same - hardly a re-imagining of solutions. But there would be some room for countries to explore new approaches within the broad contours of such initiatives, such as alternative formats of cooperation that would circumvent existing political hurdles. What would be reassuring to countries in the region - and to Southeast Asia in particular - is that many of the speeches touched on the notion of “ASEAN centrality” and how the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) must remain a key component of the regional security architecture. The grouping has caught some flak recently for its perceived ineffectiveness in responding to regional challenges. Though there was a sense that regional stakeholders broadly agreed that ASEAN is a constructive albeit limited actor, member states can afford a rethink of its approach and shape what ASEAN centrality actually means. What it cannot afford is to take a backseat and lose its relevance as a partner. Successful solutions to the unfolding challenges are likely to be few and far between in the near term. But for the sake of durable peace and stability, it is imperative to keep trying.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary As TSMC and Foxconn expand their footprints across the world, other players will need to follow, says Tim Culpan for Bloomberg Opinion. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) is pictured at its headquarters, in Hsinchu, Taiwan, January 19, 2021. REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo TAIPEI: A splintering of global supply chains, driven by both political and business considerations, has hundreds of manufacturers and logistics providers debating where to go next. They’d be well advised to take their cues from two Taiwanese companies who’ve led the charge. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the world’s largest maker of chips, with clients including Apple, Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices. Foxconn Technology Group, whose flagship is Taipei-based Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, assembles those components into end devices. Apple’s iPhones and Nvidia’s artificial intelligence servers are among the most famous of Foxconn’s products, but its reach extends into industrial sectors including Tesla cars, factory-automation systems provider Siemens AG and even an Israeli satellite maker. Their size, technical dominance and global influence make these two Taiwanese companies irreplaceable - no other single business could jump in to fill the gap should either disappear overnight. That’s the concern policymakers from Washington to Canberra have in the event tensions between Taipei and Beijing escalate to the point of military conflict. But both firms are thinking less about war and more about how globalisation can extend their lead. “Instability in the Taiwan Strait is definitely one supply chain resilience consideration,” TSMC Chairman and CEO CC Wei said after its annual shareholder meeting this month. Yet the chipmaker also seen benefits from globalisation “because we can get the best from around the world.” Foxconn has also been touting the upside of its expanded reach. “Our diversified global footprint is an important part of Hon Hai’s competitive advantage,” CEO Young Liu told shareholders recently, noting that it has 205 sites in 24 countries. “In the current geopolitical situation, that advantage is even more important and obvious.” Two decades after joining the World Trade Organization, China’s position as factory to the world has shifted from being a win-win for clients and suppliers to a massive risk. Labour shortages, rising costs and stiff local competition have many looking elsewhere. Japanese and South Korean carmakers are withdrawing, United States power-tool maker Stanley Black & Decker shut its factory and Nike has moved away. TSMC and Foxconn don’t supply directly to all of these companies, but they’re only one step away. Almost every device on the planet is made with, or by, the goods that come out of their factories. TSMC, for example, not only controls most production of leading-edge chips, it’s the single-largest supplier of older (also called legacy) 28nm semiconductors that go into toys, and industrial and agricultural equipment. Foxconn, though best known for churning out consumer devices, is a major player in industrial manufacturing and factory automation. That means the site of new facilities from either company act as a guidepost for where the rest of the supply chain is already going, or ought to move next. Take TSMC. Although it doesn’t make cars, the company has chosen locations at the centre of the automotive supply chain. Volkswagen, BMW and Porsche all have facilities near Dresden, the site of TSMC’s forthcoming European fab. Co-investors in that factory include Robert Bosch, Infineon Technologies and NXP Semiconductors. As a result, anyone who wants to supply materials or equipment to TSMC will need to have operations near the German city. For its factory in Japan’s Kumamoto prefecture, TSMC is teaming up with Sony Group, Toyota Motor and automotive-electronics supplier Denso. This facility will serve Japan’s world-leading carmaking, industrial and consumer electronics industries. The expansion plan, announced in 2021, spurred suppliers Mitsubishi Electric, Sumco and Kyocera to outline new investments in the area. TSMC’s facility in Arizona is a different story. There’s no business case to be made for setting up there: The region lacks any related industries of note. But pressure from clients, and incentives from US governments at the state and federal level, left the Taiwanese company little choice. Even then, suppliers were quick to follow, including industrial companies LCY Chemical and Topco Scientific. Foxconn’s decision to expand in Mexico, India and Southeast Asia as well as numerous tie-ups with European industrial companies like Siemens, ZF Group and Stellantis show that its diversification is not only geographic but also sector-based. The company is pushing into factory automation, transportation and logistics, aerospace and alternative energy. Many of its current vendors built facilities in Shenzhen to enjoy the benefits of being close to China’s manufacturing heartland. This Foxconn effect was repeated over a decade ago when it set up near central China’s Zhengzhou city and suppliers followed suit. Now, because of their crucial role at the centre of industry, not only will the same entourage of vendors to TSMC and Foxconn need to tag along on their global journey, anyone else expecting to be part of international supply chains will have no choice but to follow, too.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Singapore fans could show more love for the Lions in national team matches, but what happens outside the game is also important, says local football fan Eddy Hirono. Singapore football fans with the SingaBrigade cheering on the Lions at the World Cup qualifying match against South Korea at the National Stadium, Jun 6, 2024. (Photo: Jerome Douglas) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: It’s not often Singapore’s national football team sells out the National Stadium . Of course, not all 49,097 fans at the World Cup qualifier against South Korea on Thursday (Jun 6) were there to watch the Lions. South Korean captain and superstar Son Heung-min would be used to booing from the opponent’s stands - he gets treated to more colourful language in the English Premier League week after week. But perhaps the cheering was a surprise: Support for his national side was audible from all sections of the stadium. There’s good reason the fans are called the 12th man. They are supposed to roar with every crunching tackle, applaud every shot and cheer every save, giving players a boost to forget their tired legs or to keep up their fighting spirit. Home advantage was especially important given that the odds were heavily stacked against the Lions. Singapore is currently ranked 155th in the FIFA World Rankings; South Korea sits on 23rd and already took Singapore down 5-0 in Seoul in November 2023. A win against the Asian giant may have been a fanciful possibility; a draw optimistic. Even a valiant, narrow defeat would have us fighting to the end. The Lions fell 7-0 . But still, I cheered. I was part of the SingaBrigade that night - a singing, chanting group of fans that aims to support the Lions and create an atmosphere at every Lions game. The group was in full voice, and our spirit never flagged, even as the goals went in one after another. We knew that the team would be disappointed. So more than ever, we needed to make ourselves heard and spur them on. However, it was a little disheartening to know that for every fan in our ranks who shouted their throat hoarse, there would be one or more Singaporeans diluting that fervent support a little, by cheering for the opponents. It was somewhat ironic as well, that those cheering on South Korea were jumping up and down, holding the complimentary plastic Singapore flags provided by the Football Association of Singapore. Perhaps from the pitch, both sides drank in the cheers for them. But take this not as a complaint about football fans in Singapore. Long after the South Korean team had left the pitch, there were Singaporeans in every section of the stadium who stayed behind to applaud the Lions, even after the heavy defeat. They saw first-hand the effort and endeavour of the players and saw fit to stay behind to celebrate them. Unlike in previous matches against more illustrious opposition, the Lions dared to press their South Korean counterparts and came close to scoring on a couple of occasions. Had the opposing goalkeeper not been sharp, midfielder Hami Syahin’s firm header might have hit the net. Maybe then we would have heard how the crowd would sound like celebrating a Singapore goal. Worth our applause too is Singapore’s head coach who did not shy away from taking responsibility for the defeat. Tsutomu Ogura, who only took over the reins of the national side in February, walked over to the SingaBrigade section after the match to thank us for the constant support. He then held a deep bow for more than 20 seconds to apologise for the team’s performance that night - it is an image that will stay with me for a long time. Compared to the last glamour tie we played (against a Lionel Messi-less Argentina in 2017), where some Singaporeans booed our own players, I could see shoots of positivity here. As a passionate fan, my wish is, of course, that Singaporeans will get behind our own players a little more in future games. Cheering for our home side should be our cause, even excited as we are to see our favourite club players in action. If we have to boo the opposition to be the 12th man for our underdog team, so be it. It does not make us rude or any less gracious as hosts. “As a fan, you can’t just support the opposite player, which I totally understand,” was Son Heung-min’s classy response when asked at the post-match press conference about boos from Singapore fans. But the beautiful game is ultimately just a game of 90 minutes. How about before and after those 90 minutes? The Korean Association in Singapore led the way, printing cheer towels that proudly read “We love Korea and Singapore”. Pre-match, my friends and I were in a karaoke bar outside the stadium, with some Korean fans at the next table. Sensing they might have felt a little awkward in a Mandopop-dominant setting, we made friends with them and sang a Korean song to break the ice. The day after the game and after booing Son, I met up with the leader of the Korean cheer team and brought him around Singapore to try curry chicken noodles, bak kut teh and some local desserts. We are gracious hosts, let’s be gracious too towards our own. Though our World Cup hopes are already dashed, some of the SingaBrigade will be in Bangkok, shouting themselves hoarse as usual when Singapore faces Thailand on Tuesday night. For the rest of us, let us cheer on the Lions through our screens. Eddy Hirono is an in-house legal counsel and a fervent supporter of local football.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Higher levies on electric vehicles from China provide some breathing space for EU car manufacturers, but risk slowing the green transition, says Chris Bryant for Bloomberg Opinion. BERLIN: Europe’s imposition of higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) - the precise amount varies by automaker and in some cases is as high as 38 per cent - navigates a very precarious route between protecting domestic industry and provoking a full-blown trade war. But the biggest losers are clear: European consumers and the green transition. Increased duties will make Chinese shipments less profitable: Analysts at HBSC Global Research estimate Chinese EV makers currently have around a 30 per cent cost advantage. Hence, Chinese producers may not be able to lower prices as much as they would wish. China has already cried foul and is likely to retaliate in some form, although the provisional duties may yet be revised lower. Currently, the EU imposes a 10 per cent levy on car imports, versus China’s 15 per cent. In the long run, the decision could prompt Chinese companies to locate more factories in Europe - a trend that’s already well underway, and fretful European politicians can chalk up as a victory. But in the meantime there’s a risk the energy transition slows, when it urgently needs to accelerate. When the European Commission began probing Chinese EV subsidies last year, I argued Europe should work on improving its own competitiveness and technological capability, rather than erecting new trade barriers. I wasn’t the only sceptic; one peculiar aspect of this trade fight has been the almost total absence of pressure from Europe’s car industry for greater protections. This partly reflects Germany’s concern that China could respond by increasing import duties on its very profitable gas-guzzling limousines and SUVs. But even French carmakers, who don’t sell as many cars in China, often haven’t sounded terribly vexed. The timing is certainly strange: Demand for EVs is softening in part because countries like Germany have slashed purchase subsidies. Automakers including Mercedes-Benz are rowing back on previously ambitious electrification targets, delaying battery factories and vowing to keep selling gasoline models well into the next decade. If European automakers don’t want to sell EVs or can’t do so profitably, it’s bizarre to punish a country that can. The manufacturer now threatened with the highest tariffs - SAIC Motor - has been one of the most successful in attracting European buyers via its MG Motor brand. While I’ve noticed a handful of BYD vehicles on the streets of Berlin, Chinese producers are a long way from obliterating local competition. Chinese-made vehicles account for around one-fifth of western European EV sales, but most of these are exported from China by Western automakers such as Tesla, Renault’s Dacia brand and BMW. In contrast, purely Chinese brands accounted for less than 3 per cent of the total western European car market in the first four months of this year, according to Schmidt Automotive Research, and lately their advance has shown signs of slowing. That’s partly because Chinese brands generally price their vehicles at higher levels than they do at home, possibly to avoid provoking Brussels. And while BYD, SAIC and their peers make technologically impressive vehicles, they still have a lot of work to do to build awareness and confidence among European car buyers. Chinese automakers “simply don't have the brand equity to compete with established OEMs (manufacturers) at this stage,” auto analyst Matthias Schmidt wrote on LinkedIn. Doing nothing wasn’t really an option for the Commission as the rules-based trading system is being widely ignored. There’s no question that China has heavily subsidised domestic producers, and the United States is now doing similar with the Inflation Reduction Act. Washington’s decision last month to quadruple tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100 per cent has all but closed off a potential export market, increasing the risk that Chinese autos wash up elsewhere. French President Emmanuel Macron can’t afford to look soft on the Chinese threat, with parliamentary elections now looming and the far-right gaining ground. Washington’s far more aggressive response is helpful in one respect: It makes Brussels’s approach appear comparatively moderate, and the Commission insists its response is “fully in line with relevant WTO (World Trade Organization) law.” While this might dissuade Beijing from excessive retaliation, I wouldn’t bet on it. Increased tariffs provide Europe’s automakers with a bit more breathing space, but they shouldn’t get too comfortable. Chinese EVs are a new force to reckon with in global automaking. If domestic manufacturers fail to invest, innovate and cut costs, no amount of tariffs will save them.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Increasingly cordial ties between Russia and North Korea should serve to refocus global attention on a peninsula that remains as dangerous as ever, says Gearoid Reidy for Bloomberg Opinion. TOKYO: When it comes to North Korea, Western interest tends to wax and wane: From the Barack Obama-era approach of tactical patience to the Donald Trump bombast of summits, fire and fury. These days, the spotlight is elsewhere. With the devastation in Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas absorbing most of the political oxygen in the United States, Pyongyang seems of so little concern to the average American that it no longer even figures on the list the country’s biggest enemies. In an annual Gallup poll asking respondents who is America’s greatest foe, just 4 per cent answered North Korea this year, down from 51 per cent in 2018, and behind even the US itself. Despite jitters after Pyongyang’s outright rejection of reunification earlier this year, the administration of President Joe Biden remains far more focused on Beijing than Pyongyang, and the missile launches that once caused terror across global markets now elicit snoozes. That might be one reason North Korea has resorted to floating excrement-laden balloons over the border, evidently in response to activist groups in the south sending packages with leaflets and other information. Although the metaphor-heavy sight of the two Koreas trading manure and K-pop music over the border makes for good headlines, it’s not likely to turn the global gaze back onto the very real risks that exist on the peninsula. But for a better view of why North Korea shouldn’t be ignored, look at a larger package that will be crossing over the North Korean border. Russian President Vladimir Putin is visiting the country Tuesday (Jun 18) and Wednesday, his first such sojourn in 24 years. Following Kim Jong Un’s trip to Russia last September, it comes as ties between the two strongmen are growing increasingly cordial. Both countries have much to gain and little to lose from better relations and are already so heavily sanctioned that the US and its allies have little leverage to punish them further. The two nations have an \"unbreakable relationship of comrades-in-arms and a long-standing strategic relationship and are steadily developing into the higher-level state relations\", Kim told Putin in a missive last week, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. The countries plan to sign an agreement on strategic partnership, including on security and economic cooperation, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said, according to state-run Tass news agency. Officials in Seoul have fretted about such a pact. Russia needs allies, and Kim has shown his willingness to help, as demonstrated by the North Korean weaponry found on Ukrainian battlefields. The US and South Korea both say Kim has already sent millions of artillery shells to Russia, needed to continue its assault on Ukraine. (North Korea denies this.) For its part, North Korea can use Russia’s presence on the United Nations Security Council to further its goals of weakening sanctions, helping it to advance its arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles. That’s already in motion: In March, Russia used its security council veto to reject a renewal of the UN panel of experts that monitors enforcement of sanctions on Pyongyang. Kim also needs Russian technology to help with its space programme, following the failure of a spy satellite launch last month, while Russian oil will also find a home in an energy-starved country. Under President Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea has stood firm against its neighbour. But it’s only a few years ago that his predecessor, Moon Jae In, sought to bring the nations closer together; the winds could shift again at the next election in 2027. Japan, meanwhile, is reported by South Korean media to have held secret talks with representatives of the Kim regime in Mongolia last month. The clock is ticking on any potential resolution of the abductions of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s - as well as possibly Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s leadership, one reason Tokyo may again be floating the idea of a bilateral summit. As it has many times before, Pyongyang will attempt to use these issues to drive a wedge between the US and its allies. Both diplomacy and tougher pressure on the man he called a “thug” have failed to deliver any progress for Biden. Between his government’s distractions and Trump’s potential return to the White House, North Korea has a window to maximise its meddling. In the meantime, Putin can help accelerate efforts to work around the sanctions. That’s one reason to welcome news of a soon-to-be-ratified trilateral security pact between Japan, Korea and the US. All three countries have prior records of being distracted while Pyongyang stays laser focused. Let Putin’s visit serve as notice that the battle lines are being redrawn.

The others include Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia, while Vietnam and Indonesia are considering. KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia is preparing to join the BRICS group of emerging economies, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in an interview with Chinese media outlet Guancha. The BRICS group of nations originally included Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, which gave it the acronym. The group last year began to expand its membership as it looks to challenge a world order dominated by Western economies, with Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates joining and more than 40 countries expressing interest. \"We have made a decision, we will be placing the formal procedures soon ... we are just waiting for the final results from the government in South Africa,\" Mr Anwar said, according to a video of the interview posted by Guancha on Sunday (Jun 16). A representative from Mr Anwar's office on Tuesday confirmed his comments to Reuters. During the interview, he did not provide further details on the application process. Mr Anwar's comments came ahead of a three-day visit by Chinese Premier Li Qiang this week, as part of celebrations marking the 50th year of diplomatic relations between Malaysia and China. Malaysia and China are expected to sign several deals during Mr Li's visit, including renewing a five-year trade and economic cooperation agreement. Meanwhile, among Southeast Asian nations, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia have previously expressed interest in joining the trade alliance while Vietnam had said they were “closely monitoring the process of BRICS membership expansion”. After participating in a BRICS summit in August last year, Indonesian President Joko Widodo made it clear that his administration was “reviewing and considering the country’s possibility of joining” the group, according to a government statement. And earlier in January, Antara news agency reported that Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said that her country continues to study the possibility of joining the trade alliance and is weighing the benefits that it will derive from the membership, adding that they will not rush the process. \"Our foreign policy is always carefully considered. No decisions are just made (without careful consideration). Therefore, for now, Indonesia is still studying the benefits that can be gained from joining BRICS,\" she reportedly said. Meanwhile, the Thai Cabinet last month approved a government draft letter that indicated Bangkok's intention to become a member of BRICS, South China Morning Post reported.

KUALA LUMPUR: Mr Danial Chu, who hails from Kunming in China’s southwestern Yunnan province, moved more than 3,000km from his hometown to Malaysia five years ago to study. Aside from a degree, the graduate from University Malaya, the nation’s top university, also earned a new skill: Fluency in the Malay language. “Although our nationalities are different, we can still be friends and have dynamic conversations,” the 24-year-old told CNA. Learning the Malay language is mandatory for all foreign students in their first year. Some like Mr Chu – who took Malay and Spanish cultural studies – were quick to master it. He recently secured a job and said he is positive about his career prospects in Malaysia. He also believes more students from China will choose to study there. “The tuition fees, the cost of living are not so high compared to those major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangzhou. Malaysia is quite cheap for them,” he said. Mr Chu is among a growing number of students from China who have applied to join Malaysian universities over the last five years. They made up about 38 per cent of more than 110,000 foreign students in the Southeast Asian nation last year. Meanwhile, the number of Malaysians furthering their studies in China stands at about 4,000. About 1,000 more Malaysians are studying at Xiamen University Malaysia in Selangor – the first overseas campus set up by a Chinese public university. This year, both countries have pledged to further deepen ties as they mark 50 years of diplomatic relations. Chinese Premier Li Qiang arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday (Jun 18) for a three-day official visit, marking his first visit to the country as premier. Some Malaysian students are also taking up Chinese dancing as part of their curriculum. Undergraduate Joshua Gundi from the Sultan Idris Education University’s faculty of music and performing arts said he sees learning Chinese dance as a “positive thing”. When asked what he likes most about it, he responded: “The attitude, how you carry yourself, it’s what I like about Chinese dance. The essence of it is what I like the most.” Faculty lecturer Fauzi Amiruddin noted that both Chinese and Malay dance have similar elements. “Chinese dance is more like (a) spiral, more like (a) figure of eight, more like breathing continuously, like water. Same like in Malaysia with Malay dance – the calmness, the groundedness,” he added. Analysts said these cultural exchanges will help ensure that the diplomatic ties between Malaysia and China, which are deeply rooted in people-to-people relations, will continue to flourish. “Going forward, you see these students when they get to know one another, I think the next thing they would do perhaps set up some enterprises. They will have some joint projects, joint collaborations together,” said Dr Oh Ei Sun, senior fellow from the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. “I think it will continue to drive this already very close bilateral relations,” he added. Another student, Ms Wang Yi, was practising a Malay folk dance called Zapin when CNA spoke to her. Ms Wang, who is from the north-central region of Ningxia, was among 44,000 students from China who applied for entry to Malaysia’s public universities last year. She secured a place at the faculty of creative arts in University Malaya. The undergraduate is trained in traditional Chinese dance, and said she enjoys how “jovial” Malay dance is. “Whenever the locals perform the dance, you can see that they are smiling from their hearts,” the 21-year-old added. “I like Malaysia very much. I wish to bring a part of its culture back with me.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

Radin Imran Mohd Yassin, 62, at the Johor Bahru Sessions Court on Jun 19, 2024. (Photo: CNA/Zamzahuri Abas) SINGAPORE: The immediate family members of the man who allegedly attacked a police station in Johor’s Ulu Tiram in May, leaving two cops dead and one injured were charged at the Johor Bahru Sessions Court on Wednesday (Jun 19), including for inciting terrorism. The five include the man’s parents as well as his three siblings. The alleged attacker himself was killed in the ensuing firefight in the May 17 incident. According to charge sheets, the family members have been identified as Radin Imran Mohd Yassin, 62; Rosna Jantan, 59; Radin Romyullah Radin Imran, 34; Farhah Sobrina Radin Imran, 23; and Mariah Radin Imran, 19. Local media had identified the 59-year-old Rosna as a Singaporean, based on her passport that was reproduced in the charge sheets, though Malaysia’s Inspector-General of Police Razarudin Husain had previously identified all those arrested in connection to the attack as Malaysians. Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs confirmed on Jun 24 that Rosna is a Singapore citizen. The Star reported that the five were brought to the Johor Bahru Court Complex in separate vehicles amid tight security. They arrived at around 9am, according to local media, and were escorted by nearly 30 police officers. Radin Imran – the patriarch of the family - faces four charges, including under Section 130G (a) of the Penal Code (Act 574), for inciting terrorism by promoting the ideology of violence associated with the Islamic State (IS). If found guilty of that, he may be jailed for up to 30 years and liable to a fine. He was reported to have propagated IS teachings among his family members – including the alleged attacker, 21-year-old Radin Luqman – between the end of 2014 and May 17, 2024. He was also charged with supporting terrorism by storing four homemade air rifles for IS activities, pledging loyalty to IS head Abu Bakar Al-Baghdadi and possessing a book linked to the militant group. Abu Bakar Al-Baghdadi was an Iraqi militant who was the first caliph of IS from 2014 until his death in 2019. The 34-year-old Radin Romyullah was charged with two offences, including swearing allegiance to Abu Bakar Al-Baghdadi and possessing an external hard disk that contained materials related to IS and its activities. Meanwhile, the three women were charged with one count each of deliberately omitting to provide information regarding crimes related to the ideology of terrorism. They allegedly committed this offence at the same location between April 2017 and May 17 and face a prison sentence of up to seven years and a fine, according to The Star. No bail was offered to the five accused and Sessions Court Judge Che Wan Zaidi Che Wan Ibrahim had advised the family to appoint a lawyer or represent themselves. The pre-dawn attack on the Ulu Tiram police station on May 17 left two cops dead and another injured. The two - Ahmad Azza Fahmi and Muhamad Syafiq - have since been posthumously promoted to the rank of corporal while the surviving cop was promoted to Sergeant. The families of the killed officers each also received compensation of RM216,632 (US$46,000) and RM213,586 respectively, which includes funeral assistance, the government's share of Employees Provident Fund contributions, and other benefits, according to local media.

(Photo: Reuters/Department of Information Malaysia/Azali Ariffin) KUALA LUMPUR: China and Malaysia signed a slew of deals on Wednesday (Jun 19), renewing a five-year economic co-operation pact and allowing exports of fresh durians, during a visit by Chinese Premier Li Qiang to mark 50 years of diplomatic ties . Li met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in the administrative capital of Putrajaya, following his arrival in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday. \"China is ready to work with Malaysia,\" Li said in a statement, adding that focus areas included development strategies, mutually beneficial co-operation, and exchanges to promote the building of a China-Malaysia community. After Wednesday's closed-door meeting, Li and Anwar witnessed the signing of more than a dozen pacts on co-operation in areas ranging from the digital economy to green development, housing, tourism, and communications, among others. The new five-year pact that runs until 2028 provides for strategic collaboration in areas such as trade and investment, agriculture, manufacturing, infrastructure and financial services, a statement after the meeting showed. The five-year programme was first introduced in 2013. China also agreed to allow imports of fresh durian from Malaysia after it meets sanitary requirements, the statement added. Malaysia, one of the world's biggest producers of the spiky, smelly fruit, was previously allowed to ship only the whole frozen fruit and its products to China, with exports valued at RM1.19 billion (US$253 million) in 2023. The two countries also vowed to review visa-free travel arrangements set to expire in coming months. China has been Malaysia’s largest trading partner since 2009, and the foreign ministry said total trade was valued at US$98.9 billion in 2023.

(File Photo: AFP/Mohd Rasfan) KUALA LUMPUR: China said it was willing to study a plan to connect Malaysia's US$10-billion East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) to other China-backed railway projects in Laos and Thailand, potentially expanding Beijing's Belt and Road initiative across Southeast Asia. Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who is on a three-day visit to Malaysia, said on Wednesday (Jun 19) the proposal would make the central line of a proposed Pan-Asia Railway, running from Kunming in China to Singapore, a reality. \"This will better promote the construction of new international land and sea trade corridors, enhance regional connectivity, and deepen the building of the ASEAN community,\" Li said. Li was speaking during a ground-breaking ceremony at a construction site for the ECRL - a 665-km railway that will link peninsular Malaysia's east and west coasts by the end of 2026. Malaysia's government said in March it would consider extending the China-backed project to its border with Thailand. Li is on the third leg of a trip that has included New Zealand and Australia, as China looks to expand its influence and investments in the Asia-Pacific region amid an ongoing rivalry with the United States. He met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in the administrative capital of Putrajaya, following his arrival in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday for a visit to mark 50 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries.

China has been Malaysia’s largest trading partner since 2009, and the foreign ministry said total trade was valued at US$98.9 billion in 2023. Anwar has pledged to remain neutral on China's geopolitical rivalry with the United States. Malaysia has announced large investments by companies from both countries this year, including from China's ByteDance and US tech giants Google and Microsoft. Anwar has said Malaysia considered China an important trading ally and accused some Western powers of \"China-phobia\", amid ongoing clashes between neighbouring the Philippines and China in the disputed South China Sea. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam. Anwar and Li on Wednesday agreed that China and relevant countries from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should independently handle the South China Sea issue, according to a report by Chinese news agency Xinhua. The two leaders also pledged to work towards an early conclusion of a free trade agreement between China and ASEAN, Xinhua reported.

    "article_content": "Asia Asia State officials say they have activated coastal patrols and are monitoring activities following news of oil pollution on local beaches. Pollution reportedly spread from the recent oil spill in Singapore to Johor beaches. (Photo: Facebook/Aznan Tamin) SINGAPORE: Johor has started coastal clean-ups and activated coastal patrols and monitoring activities in Kota Tinggi district following an oil spill in Singapore last week that released around 400 tonnes of fuel into the sea. Clean-ups began on Friday (Jun 21) morning at two beaches, Sungai Rengit and Teluk Ramunia, said state health and environment committee chairman Ling Tian Soon in a Facebook post. Earlier, he said related agencies will continue monitoring pollution from the incident at the waters off Pengerang from time to time, news outlet Malay Mail reported. Sungai Rengit and Pengerang are located east of Changi, tens of kilometres from areas in Singapore such as East Coast Park and the beaches of Tanah Merah that have been affected by the oil spill. The spill was caused by a Netherlands-flagged dredger, Vox Maxima, hitting and rupturing one of the oil cargo tanks of Singapore-flagged bunker vessel Marine Honour at the Pasir Panjang Container Terminal (PPT) on Jun 14. Mr Ling said that his department received information from Singapore’s National Environment Agency regarding the oil spill at 8.30am on Tuesday, according to news outlet Malay Mail. He added that the next day at around 9.30am, Johor’s Department of Environment also received information from the Pengerang Municipal Council that there was oil pollution on Kota Tinggi’s Sungai Rengit beach. A Facebook post by Mr Ling on Friday said that there were beach clean-ups taking place at Sungai Rengit and Ramunia. Johor officials have gone on-site to check certain areas affected by the oil spill. On Wednesday, Tanjung Surat assemblyman Aznan Tamin posted photos on Facebook of an inspection conducted with Kota Tinggi district officer Ahmad Nazir Mohd Nasir and state environment department director Mohd Famey Yusoff. Mr Aznan, who is also Johor education and information committee chairman, added that a special meeting would be held on Thursday to “determine intervention actions that need to be taken to avoid the situation from getting worse”. The oil spill affected Singapore’s shorelines at Sentosa, Labrador Nature Reserve, East Coast Park, and St John's, Lazarus and Kusu islands, among other areas. Several beaches in Singapore have been largely cleared of oil, but Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat said on Thursday it will take \"some time\" before the oil is completely removed. Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority has said it will seek compensation for costs incurred from the spill from the owners of Marine Honour, which has insurance coverage to meet the liability.

(File photo: REUTERS/Bazuki Muhammad) KUALA LUMPUR: Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) said its buyer BlackRock will not be involved in privatising Malaysia Airports after criticism in Muslim-majority Malaysia over the US firm's alleged ties to Israel. GIP, Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional and others are part of a consortium that has offered to take over Malaysia Airport (MAHB) in a privatisation deal that would value the airport operator at US$3.9 billion. The plan has come under criticism and protests from some ruling party and opposition lawmakers in Malaysia, a staunch supporter of the Palestinians, over GIP's ties to BlackRock's significant investments in Israel, which is fighting a war against the militant Palestinian Hamas group in Gaza. MAHB's planned privatisation is the latest focus on protests in Malaysia, following boycott campaigns against such Western brands as McDonald's and Starbucks over the war in Gaza. GIP said its existing leadership team will \"retain full control and responsibility for the strategic direction and operation of GIP and the companies in which we have invested\" after its acquisition by BlackRock, state news agency Bernama reported on Friday (Jun 21), citing a written reply from GIP head of transport Phil Iley. A GIP spokesperson confirmed the Bernama report. Khazanah did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Iley said the firm would provide MAHB with as much operational support and assistance as needed despite being a minority shareholder. \"If we are successful with our transformation, we would very much consider re-listing MAHB on the Malaysian stock exchange in the future,\" he wrote. Khazanah has said GIP would not hire staff to directly manage MAHB, while Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has described claims that 25 per cent of MAHB would be owned by a pro-Zionist company as baseless, without naming the company, Bernama reported. Under the deal GIP and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority would own 30 per cent of MAHB, while the majority stake would be held by Khazanah and the Employees Provident Fund, Malaysia's largest pension body. The fund did not respond to a request for comment on GIP's statement. BlackRock's US$12.5 billion acquisition of GIP is expected to be completed in the third quarter. MAHB manages 39 airports across Malaysia and an international airport in Türkiye.

(Photo: Reuters/Gianluigi Guercia) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A desire to diversify their options in the global economic arena is among the reasons why a growing list of Southeast Asian states are keen to join the BRICS group of emerging economies, say analysts, with Malaysia the latest to express interest . Experts CNA spoke to also believe that leaders of those countries may want to use their standing in the international community in a bid to appeal to their electorate. Dr Joseph Liow – Dean of the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore – told CNA that countries that have expressed interest in joining BRICS are attracted to its “collective potential”. “It is part of their own calculations of their national interests, and desire to diversify their options in the global economic arena,” he said. However, with more Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) states expressing interest in and considering joining BRICS, analysts have also raised concerns that this may lead to an overdependence on China. Thailand’s foreign ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura on Thursday (Jun 20) said that his country had submitted a formal request to join BRICS “a week ago”, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, in an interview with Chinese news portal Guancha posted on Jun 16, Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said that his country has “made a decision” to join BRICS and “will be placing the formal procedures soon”. Mr Anwar’s comments came before Chinese Premier Li Qiang made a three-day official visit to Malaysia from Jun 18 to Jun 20. Mr Li – who is China’s second most powerful leader after President Xi Jinping – is the first Chinese premier to visit Malaysia since 2015. And in January, Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said that her country “is still studying the benefits that can be gained from joining BRICS”. Others such as Myanmar and Laos have previously expressed interest in joining the bloc while Vietnam had said they were “closely monitoring the process of BRICS membership”. Meanwhile, Singapore and the Philippines for example, have yet to make their positions known. Mr Bhima Yudhistira, executive director of the think-tank Centre of Economic and Law Studies (CELIOS) in Indonesia said that countries are “influenced by the potential for cooperation in terms of investment, trade and infrastructure financing, especially by China and India”. “Most countries in ASEAN consider China and India as potential traditional markets,” he said. BRICS was established in 2006 and initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India and China, with South Africa joining the grouping in 2010. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were invited to become members from Jan 1, 2024. Together, the combined members’ economies are worth more than US$28.5 trillion, or about 28 per cent of the global economy. Meanwhile, Dr Alan Chong, Senior Fellow at Singapore's S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described BRICS as an “alternative leadership circuit when it comes to global governance”. Taking the example of Malaysia’s interest in joining the grouping, Dr Chong said that it can “be a way to get (the country’s) foreign policy lifted up in a very exceptional way”. He added: “Now, (Mr Anwar) is trying to use this international spotlight that he’s quietly cultivated all these years to good effect for Malaysia. And why not? He’s managed to resuscitate the stalled special relationship with China under the Belt and Road initiative, which is all good.” However, Mr Bhima warns of the implications of ASEAN countries joining BRICS, believing that it may give China a bigger role in the United States-China trade war as well as the conflict in the South China Sea. “Apart from that, in a geopolitical context, countries in ASEAN will avoid criticising China’s escalation of the conflict in the Taiwan Straits as well as sensitive issues such as Xinjiang/Uighur,” said Mr Bhima. Beyond that, Mr Bhima said that there may be concerns of an overdependence on China in various ways, especially from an economic perspective. “It is actually very risky, because China is experiencing slowing domestic demand for at least the next two to three years and still struggling with its property crisis. “China’s economy, which is expected to slow down, will also have an impact on the economic growth of countries in the ASEAN region,” he said. Dr Liow, meanwhile, said that politics within BRICS itself could prove to be a hindrance. “There are major obstacles as well, like the membership of countries whose own bilateral relationships face challenges, like China and India, or Saudi Arabia and Iran. Politics can easily come into the picture in a way that makes the potential (of the grouping) difficult to realise,” he said. While some Southeast Asian countries have expressed interest in joining BRICS, there are others that have kept mum on the topic. Mr Bhima, the economist, believes that it boils down to the relationship between the countries and those within the BRICS bloc. “Singapore feels that without joining BRICS, it has already become an investment and financial hub for many Chinese companies. (It) may also be concerned about the duplication of bilateral and multilateral agreements with China and other BRICS countries. “Meanwhile, the Philippines is more influenced by the issue of the South China Sea conflict, so it is keeping its distance from China,” said Mr Bhima. Dr Chong, the Senior Fellow at RSIS, said that while China may hold an “informal” voting power within the bloc, it would hope that “its association with Russia will not translate into a negative position within BRICS.” However, Mr Bhima believes that the bloc’s appeal will continue to see to its expansion for the economic benefits it may potentially yield. “Many countries will be interested in joining BRICS if major countries such as China and India offer real investment packages, lower various export barriers to BRICS countries, increase the knowledge exchange event between political party leaders, and provide more certainty about mega-project loans that are in line with the national agenda,” he said.

A view of the Causeway that links Singapore to Malaysia's southern state of Johor. (Photo: AFP) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: There has been much excitement about the proposed Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (SEZ) since a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Singapore and Malaysia in January. During his introductory trip to Malaysia on Wednesday (Jun 12), new Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong highlighted the potential of the SEZ, saying that it could unlock massive economic benefits for both countries. “People harp a lot on the competition (between our two economies), but really, we are complementing one another,” said Mr Wong. His counterpart, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, said that plans for the zone are very close to being finalised. Touted as a potential “Shenzhen of Southeast Asia”, details of the geographical scope of the SEZ in the southern Malaysian state are still being finalised, as are the specific economic sectors. A series of meetings are scheduled to take place this month between the Malaysia and Singapore working groups, which could provide more clarity. A full-fledged agreement is expected to be signed in September. When Malaysia and Singapore announced plans to work on the SEZ, questions were raised as to the types of industries and sectors that would dominate and thrive in this new zone. Johor is proposing 16 economic sectors as part of the zone, including electrical and electronics, medical, aviation and manufacturing. During a Johor state assembly sitting last month, chief minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi also said that the state government has proposed the zone span across six districts - Johor Bahru, Iskandar Puteri, Pasir Gudang, Pontian, Kulai and Kota Tinggi - encompassing a land mass of 3,505 sq km. This is more than four times the size of Singapore, and nearly double the size of Shenzhen. Both Shenzhen and Johor have abundant natural resources and land, as well as access to a young and growing workforce. Both are also strategically located, being close to major economic hubs - Hong Kong in Shenzhen’s case, and Singapore for Johor. With key parallels between Johor and Shenzhen, and with the development of the SEZ, it is possible for Johor to emulate Shenzhen’s success in the near future. Both Malaysia and Singapore are significant players and partners in the semiconductor ecosystem, and the SEZ will strengthen both countries’ position in the electrical and electronics sector. In 2023, Malaysia’s electrical and electronics sector secured RM85.4 billion (US$18.1 billion) in approved investments, nearly three times the amount in 2022. Meanwhile, Singapore’s electronics cluster accounted for 24.2 per cent of the country’s total fixed asset investments at S$3.1 billion (US$2.3 billion) last year. Additionally, with Penang already established as a semiconductor hub, the SEZ could further cement Malaysia's reputation as a leader in the electrical and electronics sector. The World Economic Forum in April highlighted Malaysia’s emergence as a new semiconductor powerhouse, noting that major players from Europe and the United States are setting up shop or expanding existing operations in Penang to build new global supply chains. Penang, dubbed the Silicon Valley of the East, has a strong electrical and electronics ecosystem with a longstanding presence in chip assembly, packaging and testing. However, it is not uncommon for skilled workers such as engineers to choose to pursue similar jobs in Singapore for better employment packages. Last year, Malaysia’s then human resources minister V Sivakumar, said that as of 2022, 1.13 million out of 1.86 million Malaysians who migrated abroad were living in Singapore. Once the SEZ is established, it could help to attract skilled talent to the hub, thus retaining talent within Malaysia. This can be supported by plans for a passport-free QR code clearance on both sides, facilitating faster clearance of people at land checkpoints. As supply chains become more integrated between Singapore and Johor, Malaysia could retain and grow its talent pool, depending on how companies set up their operations within the SEZ. Manufacturers seeking expansion opportunities in the region due to the ongoing geopolitical climate are likely to be attracted to the SEZ. This is likely to enhance its competitiveness against neighbouring countries like Thailand and Vietnam. Singapore has leading companies carrying out R&D and wafer fabrication work in the country, while Malaysia plays a critical role in the assembly and testing of chips. With land scarcity and rising costs in Singapore, the SEZ allows talent from Singapore to travel quickly to Johor, facilitating the exchange of ideas and best practices. Marketing the hub will showcase Johor’s expanded capabilities, from backend assembly to packaging, testing and potential upstream activities. Johor's robust infrastructure, including numerous large data centres , enhances its appeal. By mid-2024, Malaysia will host some of the world's fastest supercomputers, making it ideal for companies focusing on smart manufacturing and automation to optimise their processes. Currently, the data centres are mostly in Nusajaya Tech Park, Sedenak Tech Park and YTL Green Data Centre Park. An artificial intelligence (AI) project between YTL Power and Nvidia will also be hosted at YTL’s data centre park in Kulai, Johor. This project, along with the entrance of key data centre players will be attractive to manufacturers looking to establish operations in Johor or the SEZ. Singapore also offers access to multiple subsea cable landing points that connect to the global network. With the semiconductor industry racing to reduce its carbon footprint, a technology hub in the SEZ could potentially help alleviate some sustainability concerns. Companies can set up front-end fabrication facilities in Singapore, while having the assembly and testing of chips or logistics warehouse in Johor to reduce costs. The proximity between Singapore and Johor would also mean lower greenhouse gas emissions for a company’s carbon footprint. Singapore offers a strategic regional treasury centre, extensive R&D experience, and numerous free trade agreements, while Johor provides lower rental and wage costs, making production more competitive. The SEZ can promote this synergy to attract more companies to invest in both Singapore and Johor. For example, semiconductor companies could set up a sales centre in Singapore, while keeping its warehouse in Johor to keep costs low. This twinning model will benefit the economic growth of both Johor and Singapore. Johor has seen new investments due to its land, geographical location, connectivity and resources. It has also benefited from the supply chain diversification, as more companies have also set up bases in Johor. The SEZ will continue to propel this growth in Johor, and these companies that set up in Johor can also tap on the regional treasure centre opportunities in Singapore. This will also help further contribute to Singapore’s growth and development. A one-stop business service centre will open later this year in Johor to facilitate the application processes for various approvals and licenses necessary for Singapore businesses to set up in Johor. This centre is the first of its kind and will see the collaboration of all federal and state agencies related to investments, benefiting companies looking to have a presence in the Southeast Asia region. With the strengths of Singapore and Johor packaged together, both can use the SEZ and the existing ecosystem to draw investments into both regions.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary From natural light and air-conditioning needs to future resale potential and children, here are some things to consider before opting for HDB's new “White Flat” layout, says finance blogger and parent-of-two Dawn Cher. An artist's impression of a \"White Flat\" layout, which gives home owners more flexibility to design spaces to suit their needs and preferences. (Image: HDB) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Before I became a parent, I liked the idea of open-concept layouts in a home. Had the “ White Flat ” option for Build-to-Order (BTO) flats been available back then, I might have jumped at the chance. Those on the market for new Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats will soon be able to choose between the open-concept layout - with no walls separating the living and bedroom spaces - or stick with the standard BTO layout. It will start, as a pilot, with a BTO project in the Kallang-Whampoa area to be launched for sale in October. National Development Minister Desmond Lee said this change came off feedback from young Singaporeans, during the Forward Singapore exercise, for more flexibility to configure their homes based on their needs at different life stages. The appeal of open-concept layouts is clear to see, particularly for married couples without children. With flats generally becoming smaller since the 1980s, an open-concept design can allow home owners to use space more efficiently. It could potentially visually expand a 66 sqm 3-room HDB flat to feel larger than a boxed-in 90 sqm 4-room flat. Fewer barriers would let in more natural light and allow clearer lines of sight for a more modern feel. More young home owners also now favour a larger living space for hosting, an open kitchen or even a walk-in wardrobe. The White Flat layout can allow them to design their preferred layout from scratch and carve out dedicated bespoke spaces such as a home office or home gym set-up that took off during the pandemic. Quite a few of my friends chose to knock down a wall in their own homes such that one bedroom opens up into the living room, flowing seamlessly with the open kitchen and dining area. The new layout option would have appealed to them, to choose which walls to put up rather than which to tear down. Even if couples welcome children in the future, they can always build internal walls later and reconfigure the space again to adapt to their changing life stages and needs. Such open-concept and highly customised flats have their own downsides and challenges. An open kitchen looks great in magazines and on social media. In real life, cooking smells can easily permeate the entire open area, get onto the sofa and bedsheets - requiring more effort to clean and keep odour-free. This is the reason why my husband and I decided not to go for such a design. Noise will also travel more easily through the whole house without walls to soundproof the different areas. If more than one person is on the phone or having a work meeting at the same time, this could become disruptive. Another important consideration in hot and humid Singapore would be about cooling individual spaces without walls. Larger spaces require more powerful air conditioning systems. This will translate into a higher energy consumption and more expensive electricity bills. As a general guide, larger living areas require two to three times more power to cool than a 15 sqm bedroom. Finally, one should do well to remember that it may not be easy to sell a highly personalised flat. A house with a non-standard layout may severely limit the pool of ready buyers on the resale market , especially if the customised design is not to their liking or does not meet their needs without major changes. Future buyers will likely factor in the higher renovation costs into the negotiation process in their attempt to bring the offer price down. With kids, such an open-concept design would be impractical. The desire for flexibility will have to give way to the need for privacy. The lack of partition walls is not expected to make a big dent in BTO price, nor will home owners save that much on the cost of hacking a few walls. But adding a room generally costs more than removing one, according to interior designers. After buying a resale flat with its traditional walls mostly intact, my husband and I spent slightly over S$10,000 on renovation - hacking down some walls and putting up new ones - right before the pandemic. We created a home office space that doubled up as a temporary nursery so that caring for our newborn at that time would not disturb our older child’s sleep. We carved out a smaller storage room, a helper room and created a connecting door between the children’s room and the master bedroom. Without these customisations, our renovation bill would have been cheaper by at least 15 per cent. Open-concept layouts may be attractive to couples, even if the dual-income-no-kids lifestyle might be temporary for some. Their needs and preferences may change quickly once kids come along - I know ours did. Once that happens, open-concept layouts no longer become practical.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Singapore parents may sign their children up for camps and enrichment lessons during school holidays, but too many structured activities may do more harm than good, says Dr Cynthia Lim of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. Well-meaning parents may think that enrolling their children in enrichment activities will allow them to learn important skills and remain competitive in today’s fast-paced world. (Photos: iStock/JGalione, iStock/RichLegg) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: “I’m going for a robotics camp this week,” declared Justin, my 9-year-old neighbour when I asked him where he was off to one morning at the start of the June holidays. “I’ve signed him up for all sorts of camps and lessons - swimming, drums, art - to keep him occupied. Otherwise, I don’t know what to do with him in between the tuition classes,” shared his mum, Gillian. I wanted to ask her if Justin had time to play, rest and relax over the June holidays , but decided to hold my tongue. We know that many Singapore children are overscheduled during term time with school, tuition, co-curricular activities and enrichment lessons. These schedules seem to continue into their school holidays as well. Well-meaning parents may think that enrolling their children in these activities will allow them to learn important skills and remain competitive in today’s fast-paced world. While each activity or lesson can enrich a child's life, taken in total, they may do more harm than good. Structured activities are usually focused on outcomes. They tend to be didactic in nature, leaving little room for child agency and decision-making. Researchers from the University of Colorado reported that more time spent in structured activities resulted in poorer self-direction and executive functions for the 6- to 7-year-old children in their study. Executive functions include the ability to plan, achieve goals, and practise self-regulation and flexible thinking required in problem-solving. Ironically, these are the very skills that parents hope their children will acquire when they sign their children up for structured activities. Parents may respond “But my child enjoys these activities.” Do they really? Any new experience can be exciting in the first day or so, but would they rather run freely in the field, dig in the sand, build a tall tower or play silly games with mum and dad, than attend days of classes on end? There is much to be said for the benefits of unstructured, free play with no “purpose”. In his seminal work, The Playful Brain, Dr Sergio Pellis shares his research that the neuron connections at the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s executive control centre, changes during play. For healthy brain development, he recommends children play on their own terms, with rules they create and negotiate, ideas they can test, and mistakes they can reflect on and learn from. Children should play not for any outcome or purpose but for the joy of experiencing freedom to be and discover themselves. Free play is essential to a child’s mental and emotional well-being. Studies have shown that having downtime helps regulate the child’s nervous system, so they are better able to adapt to the environment, stress and life’s challenges. In fact, it is okay to allow children time to be bored, as boredom stimulates creativity and imagination. It is during these times that children explore their inner worlds and find their inner voice. As adults, we should invite them to reflect on what their interests are and follow their curiosity. Children can develop self-reliance by making a list of things to do in the holidays and plan for them. Adults can also suggest downtime activities like listening to music, reading a book, blowing bubbles or quiet time with yoga poses. Activities suitable for younger children could include looking for bugs outdoors, seeing patterns in the clouds or using recycled boxes to build a fort or anything they fancy. Activities like colouring, drawing, Lego construction, and Play-Doh, water and sand play are ideal for children to explore without adult direction, but with some supervision depending on the age of the child. Children can spend hours creating, building and coming up with stories with these open-ended materials. An encouraging word or a question to show interest in what the children are doing is sufficient to keep them playing independently with the adult nearby doing chores or work. The June break is a good time for parents to spend quality time with their children, to get to know their interests as well as who they are and who they are becoming. Renowned child psychiatrist Alvin Rosenfield recommends that parents do things with their children whose only purpose is the joy of each other’s company, what he calls being unproductive together. This signals to the child that he or she is loved unconditionally and appreciated for who he or she is. Sending children to many enrichment classes may result in an unintended subliminal message to them that they are not good enough, which may affect their self-esteem in the long run. Children may also feel a sense of neglect that their parents would rather have them attend a string of classes than spend time with them during the holidays. We want the best for our children and for them to become well-adjusted, resilient, creative and thriving adults. Let us give them permission, time, space, and freedom to play. As for my neighbour Justin, I recently saw him having a good time playing in the sand with other kids at a playground, with his mother seated in the shade nearby on her laptop. That brought a smile to my face. Dr Cynthia Lim is Head of the Bachelor of Early Childhood Education programme at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore With the number of child abuse cases in Singapore rising sharply, the need for foster families has never been greater. CNA speaks to a young couple about their adoption and fostering journey. Melvin Soon and daughter Ariel cheer as Alora practices walking on Jan 30, 2024. Joanne Ong stands ready to support Alora. (Photo: CNA/Eugene Goh) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: When Mr Melvin Soon, 31, said goodbye to his first foster child Benjamin, emotions ran high and he had tears in his eyes. “I looked at him, he looked at me and I said I don’t know whether after today we will see each other again. But remember that you were like our family,” he said. He watched longingly as the car that came to pick up the six-year-old boy drove away. “The both of them made it very dramatic,” his wife, Ms Joanne Ong, 29, said with a fond chuckle. In the span of six months, the couple had gone through highs and lows with Benjamin, who came to them from a challenging home environment. His departure was bittersweet. The goal of fostering Benjamin was to eventually reunite him with his biological family – but Mr Soon was heartbroken that the boy, whom he had grown close to, would be leaving. But going through the grief, sadness, and the knowledge that they may never meet again was worth it, said Mr Soon. “We are able to grieve the loss when they (foster children) eventually do go back. We can process those emotions,” he said. “They get a chance to experience the love, peace, joy and safety. That’s more important than our sad emotions when we have to part with them eventually.” Ms Ong, a freelance social worker, said she sees this grief as evidence of their connection with their foster child. “You gave it your best, that’s why you … feel sad,” she said. “We know that we have really loved and that means we also hope that the person has experienced it.” The couple has always wanted to foster children. About 10 years ago – before the couple met and started dating – they learnt about fostering and desired to provide a safe home for children from traumatic backgrounds. This conviction grew, and they signed up to be foster parents in 2021. They took in Benjamin in early 2022 for half a year. A few months after Benjamin returned to live with his birth family, the couple adopted their daughter Ariel in 2022. She was four years old then. Last year, they started fostering 10-month-old Alora, and the couple will be welcoming a baby boy in May. *The real names of the foster children cannot be used in this article as their identities are protected. According to the latest statistics, there were 596 foster families in Singapore in 2022 that – like Mr Soon and Ms Ong – care for children who had to be removed from their birth families. As of December 2022, there were 540 children in foster care. The number of children in foster care has gone up over the last decade. The number of cases investigated by the Child Protective Service has risen in recent years – from 415 cases in 2011 to 2,141 cases in 2021. Nearly 800 cases in 2021 were investigated for physical abuse and more than 440 cases for sexual abuse. According to the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), children may be removed from their birth families due to safety concerns. Fostering provides these children with a safe and stable family environment in a temporary care structure. The aim is for foster children to return to their birth families once the families are assessed to be able to resume care for them. In about 98 per cent of cases investigated by Child Protective Services, children either remained with their birth families or were reunited after being temporarily removed. For the remaining 2 per cent of cases, they are unable to return home because of reasons such as parents’ chronic incarceration, serious mental health conditions or the parents’ unwillingness to provide a safe environment for the child. Being a foster parent can involve different challenges because of a child’s past. Benjamin was old enough to know his biological parents and remember the things that happened to him. He wrestled with his emotions and lashed out at people, while struggling to trust the couple initially. Ms Ong explained that children from such homes may have had their trust broken by their birth families. “When they come to the foster care system, they are bringing along all of these past wounds that may not be entirely processed. “One of the challenges is that we are welcoming a child with a life story that is sometimes too much for them to bear for their age,” she said. Dr Cherie Chan, a clinical psychologist at The Other Clinic, explained the different emotions a child may feel when they are removed from an abusive home. “Sometimes even if the situation is objectively bad or dangerous, the child may still feel a mix of emotions such as relief and guilt for getting out of a difficult or abusive situation,” she said. “Most children do not get the full story of what is happening and things can occur very abruptly.” This can lead to feelings of anxiety and helplessness, as they are moved from an unsafe but familiar home – with their birth families – to a likely safer but unfamiliar environment. “These children may also feel a lot of shame and embarrassment for having to live with someone who may not know or understand them,” she explained. Ms Tham Yi Ching, a foster care worker at Epworth Community Services, said foster children may have different habits from their foster parents. They may feel disoriented and scared, and even have difficulty eating and sleeping in a new place. As part of her job, she makes regular home visits to support foster families. To make the transition easier, she suggested bringing the child on a house tour and making the room inviting to them. As foster parents, Mr Soon and Ms Ong try to build trust, provide a safe home and hold space for their children’s big, overwhelming emotions. “It’s journeying with them. You will experience a lot of moments like maybe a tantrum thrown at you, or maybe you feel super unappreciated,” she said. When Benjamin was angry, he would shout at them to go away, but when they went away, he would shout at them to come back, Mr Soon said. He would also sometimes tell them that he did not want to be with them and that he wanted to go home. “You need to realise they are going through a lot. They are transitioning to us and they are also grieving the loss of their natural home and family.” Once, after Benjamin spent the weekend with his birth family, Mr Soon and Ms Ong went to pick him up from the MRT station. “He was screaming at the top of his voice ‘I don’t want you, I don’t want you’,” Mr Soon recounted. “We had to work through it, and eventually he felt more comfortable and opened up to us more, and he was more calm.” Benjamin gradually learnt to manage his anger and communicate with his foster parents. “Those are the fruits. You slowly see them building trust with you again, and that’s beautiful,” said Ms Ong. “Those were points of breakthrough (and) we saw how it was worth it.” Looking back, Mr Soon realised he didn’t know what he would be getting himself into when he started to consider fostering 10 years ago after hearing about it in church. “You just feel like this is a very nice picture – a family, foster child, adoptive child. It was just ideas and concepts,” he said. “Eventually we welcomed the children to our family, and there are times when things are difficult.” They learnt to validate their children’s emotions and tried to help them understand that they were safe. Typical parenting methods may not always work. Mr Soon and Ms Ong had attended the mandatory training sessions and did their research, but still found themselves fumbling. “You can never fully be equipped, as with all parents. It’s a similar journey as parents (who only have biological children),” said Ms Ong. “You just try your best, but there will be certain things that will be unexpected that you just learn and grow from.” Mr Soon added: “It doesn’t come naturally. Sometimes you have to take a step back yourself and take deep breaths to not lose it. “(We’ve) got to be very aware of our own emotions also. “What we learn in books and in theory is one thing. Sometimes it might not turn out that way, or rather it takes a long time. We need to keep remembering that it’s a process.” As parents to foster children and an adoptive daughter, it takes time for their children to feel secure. He recalled a time when he was at his wits’ end with Ariel. Instead of scolding her or being stern, he asked her if she knew why it seemed like she was unable to change. “She said ‘I don’t know’. I told her it’s because something happened in (her) past and that’s why she keeps doing this,” he explained. “But I also said I’m so sorry that (she) had to go through this.” He calmed her down, explaining that she was in a safe space. That seemed to get through to her. “From time to time, she will tell me, ‘I don’t need to worry about this anymore, mummy and daddy will take care of me’,” said Mr Soon. Dr Chan said that being in a loving environment can help a child who has experienced trauma to learn how to experience life differently. Abuse or punitive parenting styles can cause hyperarousal – where the child is constantly on high alert – and over time, that can be harmful to the development of emotional regulation skills. “More positive parenting models can help increase emotional competence and regulation through modelling to the child how to manage difficult emotions and how to be together with the child in stressful situations rather than reject or neglect them,” she said. Mr Soon has learnt to be gracious with himself and recognise that everything is a work in progress. “You go into fostering or adoption thinking ‘I’m going to be this super trauma-informed father who knows how to love the child no matter what happens’,” said the 31-year-old chemical engineer. “But sometimes you fail, then you have to take a step back and realise you weren’t as good as what you think. It’s ups and downs, and next time you try harder again.” For Ms Ong, it is the “availability to learn and to love” that matters when fostering. \"They're not calling for perfect foster parents,\" she added. Dr Chan urged foster parents to join support groups and allow themselves to get financial and mental help. “Fostering in itself can both be tiring and extremely rewarding even if the foster child is under their care for a short period of time,” she said. “Giving themselves time for their needs will better allow them to reset, ground and ‘fill their bucket’ so that they may be able to be more present and giving to the child under their care.” Family and friends also have supported them in this journey, from taking care of the children to buying clothes and toys for them. When Alora was placed with their family, they did not have the items needed to care for a four-month-old. “We had zero, and within one month we had to get everything,” said Ms Ong. “People even come and drop by to pass us things,” she said. “I have never bought a single thing (for the children).” Alora’s needs are different from Benjamin’s and Ariel’s, given that she was not yet a year old when she came into the couple’s care. It involved a lot of practical caregiving. “Even though she’s the third child, they entered (our family) at different ages,” said Mr Soon. “Our parenting (journey) is a bit more jumbled up,” said Ms Ong. The couple noticed that, like Benjamin and Ariel, she had no fear of strangers initially. It was a possible sign that she had not formed strong attachments to her caregivers, but could also have been her young age. Now, she will cry if she’s uncomfortable with someone, or if her foster parents leave her. Mr Soon said that there may be insecurities that surface later in life. “We just have to watch out and don’t be complacent,” he said. “We have to be prepared for that.” When accepting Alora’s case from the fostering agency, the couple also had to consider the impact on Ariel. They declined to share the details of Ariel’s adoption, except that she was born overseas and likely also faced abuse or neglect. “Turns out, (Ariel) really loves Alora, so thank God. She’s like born to be a big sister,” said Mr Soon. “This is my baby! This is my foster sister! This is my sister, this is my meimei (Mandarin for younger sister),” the couple said, imitating Ariel’s proclamations about Alora. “That gives us confidence that when our biological child comes, she’s also equally ready to be a big sister,” said Mr Soon. It’s exciting to see how all these individuals can be a family without having biological ties, Ms Ong said. “We can still love each other. You see how Ariel loves Alora ... and they enjoy (being with) each other.” The foster care system in Singapore has come under the spotlight following a series of court cases about children who were abused by their birth families after returning from foster care. One victim was a two-year-old girl named Umaisyah. Her death went undiscovered for more than five years. She had been in foster care for about one-and-a-half years, but after she returned to her family of origin, she was abused to death. Her body was burnt and her remains hidden, until her uncle found them in a pot. Last September, her father was sentenced to 21-and-a-half years in jail and 18 strokes of the cane. The court heard that Umaisyah’s foster mother would continue to visit the girl even after she moved home. Ms Tham, the foster care worker, told CNA that the Child Protective Service will review the progress of a child’s birth family and assess when it is safe for the child to go home. Where progress has been made and reunification is assessed to be “timely and appropriate”, increased contact will be made through supervised meetings, outings and periods of home leave. The Child Protection Officer, foster care worker and foster parents will then prepare for a child to move home. “Foster parents can help to prepare their foster children by processing their emotions and talking about their worries, hopes for the upcoming change, and emphasising their strength,” she said. Dr Chan said foster children may feel torn between their two homes. There may also be feelings of guilt towards their foster parents if they are happy about leaving, or towards their birth parents if they want to stay on. “It is also important to remember that the child who was taken away will not be the same child that returns to the family of origin given their new experiences. “This may lead to stress and tension as the child learns how to navigate new family patterns,” said the clinical psychologist. MSF said regular safety checks and monitoring are carried out for at least 12 months after a child returns to their family of origin. But in some cases, these children have to be removed again and end up back in the foster system – Benjamin was one of them. Mr Soon and Ms Ong were asked if they could foster Benjamin for a second time shortly after they adopted Ariel. Ms Ong does not want to judge the situation with Benjamin’s biological family because they had unique circumstances that led to him being removed again. “It’s just sad that the child is always the one who gets affected,” she said. The couple could not take Benjamin back in because Ariel was still adjusting to life with them. When Benjamin was living with them, they made a similar decision not to expand their family so as to focus on him. “We didn’t want to introduce a new child to the family because we feel like it won’t be fair to the foster child whom we actually committed to look after,” said Mr Soon. Benjamin’s return to the foster system broke their hearts. “We just trust that whatever we have done with him in our family will bring him through in life, and trust that whatever seeds that we have sown will (bear) fruit eventually.” To be foster parents, couples must be married and aged 25 and older. They must have completed their secondary school education and be medically fit to care for children. Couples must also have a minimum monthly household income of S$2,000 (US$1,500) and a per capita income of at least S$700. Those who are retired can be financially assessed based on non-work sources of income and savings. If they are planning to foster children below 13, window grilles must be installed on all windows. The entire application and assessment process to become a foster parent takes about three months. During this time, there will be interview sessions and home visits by MSF or an MSF-approved agency. Couples are also required to undergo medical screening. Once approved, they have to attend the mandatory foundation and intermediate training courses. MSF provides foster parents with a monthly allowance of S$1,100 per child, and S$1,500 for a foster child with special needs. There are also subsidies for infant care, child care, student care and medical treatment. Besides financial support, foster care workers also guide and help foster parents through regular phone calls and home visits. Foster parents can request for respite care for brief periods, such as when travelling overseas. They are also entitled to childcare leave. MSF holds regular sharing sessions about fostering. You can find the upcoming ones here. Mr Soon and Ms Ong recalled a moment with Benjamin when his time with them was coming to an end. They had printed out photos of their time together and arranged them in what they called a “life book”. “What really amazed me and affirmed the call of fostering for us, was that he really could remember every single moment from the pictures we printed,” Ms Ong said. “‘Oh, I remember this, I remember this’, then he would add on some details, very minor details. ‘Uncle, Auntie, you remember?’ “Sometimes I forget, because it’s very small, very simple. But it meant something to him. So we realised all those ordinary moments you never noticed actually had an impact on him. “That’s when I realised – never underestimate every small, ordinary moment with them.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore A young drug abuser thought it would be \"just one time\" but it spiralled into addiction, then months in detention. What is behind the 20 per cent rise in new drug abusers aged under 30? This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: It all started with one puff taken out of curiosity and the allure of easy money. “What can happen?” Isaac Goh thought to himself. Even if the unknown substance given to him by a stranger was an illegal drug, it would “just be one time”. Isaac, then 18 and having just started an online business selling essential oils and aromatherapy diffusers, met the stranger after delivering an order to a hotel room. Upon receiving the products, the stranger – a middle-aged man – made him an offer. “He said he can take the whole carton of stocks that I have, but I will have to take one puff of whatever he gives me,” Isaac recalled. “Just one puff and I can earn money and clear stocks so I made the decision very quickly.” That was Isaac’s first encounter with Ice, also known as crystal methamphetamine. It was not his last – he kept in touch with the man who later supplied him with various drugs for free, such as Ice and ecstasy. Isaac was eventually arrested for drug abuse and spent six months in a drug rehabilitation centre. He relapsed, and a longer stay in rehabilitation was marked with tears and difficult confrontations with his demons, before he was finally drug-free. The latest statistics from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) showed that the number of new drug abusers under 30 years old has risen by 20 per cent in a year. Last year, 480 new drug abusers arrested were under 30, an increase from the 400 arrested in 2022. It is also the first time since 2019 that this figure has risen. Among those arrested last year were five 14-year-olds, the youngest abusers to be nabbed. While Singapore’s drug situation remains under control, it is “very concerned that drug abuse seems to be starting at a much younger age”, said CNB director Sam Tee. “Many consumed drugs at home or their friend’s home,” he added. Earlier this month, three teenage girls were arrested for abusing Ice . Two of them were 13 years old. Studies show that drug use can negatively affect brain structure and functions, with “much worse outcomes” for developing teens, said Dr Mythily Subramaniam, assistant chairman of the medical board (research) at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). “The earlier a person starts, the more likely it is going to be a more severe form of abuse … and the risk of relapse is greater,” she told CNA. There are also repercussions in other aspects of life, such as when young drug abusers lag behind or drop out of school. They may also withdraw from social relationships, Dr Mythily added. Common reasons why young people start experimenting with drugs include curiosity and peer influence. An IMH survey released last year showed that about a fifth of those who had taken drugs did so because they were curious about the illicit substances. This was followed by the belief that the drugs would help with their problems, and being influenced by friends. There are also increasingly “permissive” attitudes towards drug use, with young people being exposed to liberal views and misinformation online, experts said. A liberalisation of policies surrounding narcotics in some countries is not helping either. That said, illegal substance abuse and addiction are typical symptoms of greater problems. These may include mental health issues, trauma, immense stress and the inability to cope, as well as other complicating factors such as the presence of drugs in one’s surroundings. Some people feel pushed into a corner and start taking drugs as a result, said Mr Varian Monteiro, counselling therapist at Promises Healthcare. Illegal drug use can spiral – from the first puff to addiction, and potentially death. For Isaac, his tussle with drug abuse was mostly a reflection of the problems at home – he had a strained relationship with his father since he was young. “If he comes home, I’ll go to my room and hide,” he said, citing his father’s unpredictable temper and habit of controlling his every move. His parents also quarrelled frequently, with remarks such as “If it’s not for you, we would have divorced long ago”. It left him feeling like he was the source of their unhappiness. At the same time, Isaac was struggling with a break-up, as well as a loss of direction in life following the end of National Service and a sudden end to normalcy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He recalled spending a “very lonely” birthday in June 2020. Alone in a hotel room, the countdown to his 22nd birthday only threw up “a lot of existential questions”. He took drugs as a form of escape. With his own troubles at home, Isaac started seeing the stranger “as a father figure”, spending more time with him abusing drugs. This free flow of drugs also led him to take ecstasy. Isaac grew increasingly tired and found it hard to function at work as a COVID-19 contact tracer. He lost weight and at his lightest, he weighed just 50kg. In January 2021, he was sent to a drug rehabilitation centre. Six months flew by and Isaac was eager to reset his life. He made plans with friends to start a food and beverage (F&B) business but just as things were falling into place, a meeting with an F&B business owner at the end of August sent him back to square one. “The minute I reached his house and the door opened, all the drugs were there,” Isaac said. Isaac recalled the night of Sep 1 when he was arrested for a second time. It had felt like “a perfect night” after dinner and a game of Mobile Legends with his mother, until he heard knocking on the front door. When he answered the door, eight CNB officers rushed in. He was taken into his bedroom and asked repeatedly if he had anything to declare. He said no, thinking that if he was confident enough, he would not be taken away. But the officers came prepared. He told his mother that he had to leave with the CNB officers. “Mum told me ‘Okay, I will wait for you to come back.’ Then the officers asked me, ‘I give you one last chance. Your urine clean or not clean? Don’t make your mum wait for nothing.’” That was when he decided to come clean and admitted that he had taken drugs again. “Mum kept asking ‘why’ … a thousand emotions charged into that one word but I didn’t know what to say,” Isaac recounted. His mother watched as the CNB officers put him in handcuffs and led him away in a police van. Isaac was sent to the drug rehabilitation centre again. This time, he was there for nearly 10 months. Experts said relapse is a “real threat” for drug abusers of any age. The solution involves treating not just the addiction, but also addressing other issues and risk factors present in the lives of the drug abusers. “Many times, they are doing well in the hospital or recovery centre but when they go back to their home environment where they face the same challenges or a lack of social support, old habits return,” said Mr S B Viknesan, senior counsellor at IMH’s National Addictions Management Service. For young abusers, not knowing who to confide in about their difficulties and shame may fuel addiction. It is “nearly impossible to treat such young children without also involving the parents”, said Mr Viknesan. Noting that the “parental role in creating protective factors for their children cannot be underplayed”, he said the challenge is to work with both the child and the parents or guardians to come up with goals that are not too punitive or permissive. But slow progress or relapses should not be seen as failures, he added. Instead, they present learning opportunities. “A relapse is part and parcel of recovery. Sometimes people relapse due to unforeseen circumstances in their life … and (these can be opportunities for them to) learn, strengthen themselves and move forward,” he said. For Isaac, his second stint in a drug rehabilitation centre was a rollercoaster ride. “I guess the first time I went into the drug rehabilitation centre, I treated it like a holiday so I never really reflected. The second time was tough.” His first month was spent in an isolated cell due to the tightening of COVID-19 measures. “I walked into the cell and the moment the metal door closed with a loud thud, I felt so small. It’s like you just want to shrink and cry, and you don’t know whether it’s worth living anymore.” Besides his loneliness, Isaac also had to cope with the immense guilt. Letters from his friends were “unforgiving” and felt like “missiles directed at (his) heart”. “It was not pleasant,” he said. “I felt guilty, like everyone gave me chances but I let them down so quickly.” These emotions built up and erupted into confrontations when his parents visited him. That was when he began sharing his years of grievances with his father. Each visit was filled with “shouting and crying”, leaving Isaac and his father broken. A turning point came when a cellmate provided him with a different perspective that his parents were simply “discharging their duties as a father and a mother”, especially when they felt that their son seemed directionless and was not ready to fend for himself. “That really shifted the entire perspective, compared to what people always say, ‘That is his way of loving you’ but I couldn’t see how that is called love.” With that perspective, Isaac started reflecting on what he wanted in life and how he would communicate that to his parents. When he was able to, the visits became less emotional. He also began to understand that his father’s interactions with him stemmed from his father's upbringing and an unhappy relationship with his own father. The mending of Isaac’s relationship with his father was a big factor in helping him rebuild his life. “I would say drugs (abuse) is a behaviour that is caused by many other factors and you will never know why one uses drugs unless you look at every other thing in that person’s life,” said Isaac. “This is why drug rehabilitation has to be introspective … Only you know why you are using drugs.” The government announced last May that it was setting up an inter-ministry committee to look into how it can work with parents, schools, the community and other stakeholders to prevent the abuse of drugs among youth. Preventive drug education remains the first line of defence in Singapore’s overall drug control strategy. These include after-school engagement programmes at primary and secondary schools, as well as anti-drug video competitions targeted at the youth. CNB director Mr Tee said the bureau cannot stem the tide alone and needs the support of the public, especially parents. “Our youths are constantly exposed to liberal drug ideas and misinformation about the harms of drugs,” he added. Mr Viknesan, who is also a council member of the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), stressed the need to help young people understand that “drug use is harmful, despite mixed messages on social media”. Beyond that, there should also be an emphasis on how to deal with negative peer pressure, handling life’s stressors and destigmatising the act of seeking help. Youths who are at risk, such as those with behavioural and academic problems, should receive additional resources including those related to mental health, said Mr Viknesan. Experts also pointed to the important role played by parents. Studies have suggested that the likelihood of young children consuming drugs is 50 per cent less among those whose parents have early conversations about the harmful effects of drugs, said Dr Mythily. “I know these are tough conversations … but do you really think that a 14-year-old today doesn't know about drugs? We have to start having these conversations.” NCADA will be “reaching out to partners in the family sector, to raise awareness of how parents may effectively get involved (and) have meaningful conversations with their children”. “If parents vacate this space, and leave the topic of drug abuse to schools, it would be too late,” Mr Viknesan said. The key is to have open and honest communication. For example, parents can adopt an information-based approach where they lay out the risks associated with drugs and allow their children to make informed decisions, said Mr Monteiro from Promises Healthcare. “Parents sometimes use an emotion-focused approach, like ‘don't do it, bad things will happen’ but they never really explain or go in-depth enough for the child to understand,” he said. “Having a balanced approach, hearing what the child wants to say, and then coming from an information-based approach will be helpful.” “It's not assuming that the parent knows better, but just asking what have the peers been telling the child, what has the child learned from social media … so that it becomes a discussion, as opposed to ‘I’m telling you to do this’,” Mr Monteiro added. If a parent suspects their child is already using drugs, he or she should try to initiate conversation in a non-confrontational approach. The key is to provide a “safe, non-judgmental and unconditionally loving space” for the child to open up. “If the parent starts with chiding them, it shuts down the whole thing because there are reasons apart from experimentation or curiosity,” he said. Isaac, who is now working full-time as a project executive at social enterprise Architects of Life (AOL), was keen to share his story and help young people like himself. Apart from speaking to the media, he is also involved in an initiative by AOL called Triad Trails where ex-offenders lead walking tours around Chinatown to share how secret societies came to be in the area and their own life experiences. Sharing his story is a test of courage and resolve. The last time he did, he found himself overwhelmed by care and attention from former teachers and schoolmates – as well as other nefarious messages offering him drugs. “A lot of people contacted me to say, ‘You got take (drugs) one ah? I got. Come to my place.’” In such instances, Isaac is thankful for the supportive environment he now has around him – at home, in his workplace and a group of friends whom he can turn to. “In counselling, they always say as long as you keep your mind off something for 10 minutes – you can call someone or go get an ice cream – (it) will go away,” Isaac said. He has been told that overcoming addiction “is a never-ending journey”. “You can never say you are a past addict (because) that neural pathway has already been created in your mind,” said Isaac. “It’s just when (you’re) at the crossroads, which road will you take? Is it the road easily travelled, which is addiction? Or the road to a better life, which will take some work and energy, but (is more) worthwhile.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Will it bring relief to overworked staff – or spell economic doom? The right to disconnect refers to a worker’s right to disengage from work and refrain from engaging in work-related electronic communications such as emails. (Illustration: Rafa Estrada) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: He was in his second year on the job when he broke down, blacked out and woke up in the emergency department. On that day in 2017, design visualiser Eric – who asked that his real name not be used – had skipped lunch to do more work. One moment he was feeling upset in office; the next, hospital doctors were telling him that he lacked sleep and had low blood sugar. The diagnosis was chronic overwork. The prescription was two weeks away from his job. It was not the first time Eric, who is in his early 40s, had been stretched beyond his limits. Earlier that same year, his team was having dinner to celebrate the end of an intense month of projects when their manager called around 8pm, asking them to start work on a new assignment. The manager even drove to their dinner spot to take them back to office. Eric's managers had problems saying no to projects and routinely took on more than the staff could handle within work hours. This meant regularly working 10- to 12-hour days for months on end. He had brought his concerns to the human resources department multiple times, to no avail. Eric said he would be “100 per cent” behind a “right to disconnect” law. This refers to a worker’s right to disengage from work and refrain from engaging in work-related electronic communications, such as emails or other messages, during non-work hours, as defined by the European Union. It has lately come into public discussion with more countries enacting laws protecting the right to disconnect; and with our evolving understanding of the dynamics between work and mental well-being. In Singapore, where no such law exists, discussions on it tend to draw opposing reactions. Having the right to disconnect is either a surefire way for the country’s economy to lose its edge, or much-needed help to stop work from creeping into every corner of our lives. This can be hard to reconcile. But the questions raised in the process can be an opportunity to re-examine our relationships with our jobs, and to reach a more intentional agreement about what we expect of ourselves and each other at work. The right to disconnect, sometimes called the right to switch off, emerged in response to technology allowing us to be online at all hours, making the boundaries between personal and professional time and space even more porous. France was a pioneer in 2017 when it enshrined the right to disconnect in labour law. Companies there with more than 50 workers must negotiate with employees to determine the hours and conditions for sending or replying to electronic communications. In February Australia became the latest to introduce a law, allowing workers to refuse to monitor, read or respond to work-related contact after hours. The worker’s refusal must not be “unreasonable”, taking into account the reason for the contact, the level of disruption to the worker as well as their compensation, job role and personal circumstances, including caregiving responsibilities. Around these parts the right to disconnect is also recognised in Thailand, which wrote it into labour code amendments last year. The law specifies that remote workers can refuse communications with their employer after work hours or the completion of assigned work. The Philippines is also contemplating a law. Post-pandemic, Singapore is in the midst of renegotiating its social compact around work-life balance. New guidelines on flexible work arrangements will come into effect this year, though a right-to-disconnect law is not believed to be in the works. Recent polls have found that Singapore professionals are most motivated to resign or change jobs for not just higher wages but better work-life balance. Workers in Singapore worked an average of 44.1 paid hours a week in 2022, according to official labour statistics. But they reported themselves as working an average of 8.2 unpaid hours a week in a survey last year by ADP, a HR and payroll solutions provider. That put Singapore behind India (10.7 hours) but ahead of China and Australia. In Singapore, the only stipulations around work hours are set out in the Employment Act, and these do not apply to professionals, managers and executives (PMEs), said lawyer Clarence Ding, who specialises in labour and employment law. Instead, arrangements around PMEs’ work hours are largely a matter of contract and depend on the terms of their employment, said the partner at Simmons & Simmons. A typical line in an employment contract may read: “Your normal working hours are from 9am to 6pm from Mondays to Fridays with a one-hour lunch break. However, you will be required to work such hours as are necessary to properly discharge your duties and obligations, and you will have no entitlement to any overtime pay for such additional hours worked.” Tripartite efforts - by Singapore employers, unions and the government - so far have encouraged rather than required employers to act in the space of disconnecting from work, even as they acknowledge the benefits of rest. The National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) pointed to a tripartite advisory on mental health, updated last November, which encourages employers to set an after-hours work communication policy. Proper rest helps \"reduce burnout and improve productivity\" and work-life harmony is key to \"well-being and optimal business performance”, a spokesperson told CNA. The Singapore National Employers Federation said having a policy on after-hours communications can help to set reasonable and clear expectations for workers. “Certainly, such instances can be minimised, such as when employees ensure the timely delivery of their work targets to avoid instances of important tasks escalating into critical and highly urgent stages,” the federation said. “It is also important for fellow colleagues to respect co-workers’ established working hours and avoid routinely contacting them for work-related matters after working hours. At the end of the day, there needs to be understanding, mutual respect, and some amount of give and take.” On its part, the Singapore government has said it will continue to “raise awareness of the importance of setting after-hours work communication policy while managing both employees’ and business needs”. “At the same time, the tripartite partners are pushing for greater adoption of work-life harmony measures such as health and wellness programmes, and unrecorded time-off for personal and family matters,” Minister of State for Manpower Gan Siow Huang said in February. At the outset, it should be noted that different jobs have different room for allowing workers to disconnect after work hours. Member of Parliament (MP) Melvin Yong, who is also NTUC’s assistant secretary-general, was one of the earliest to moot a right to disconnect in parliament in 2020. Last month, during a debate on mental health, he called for tripartite guidelines to establish what disconnecting could mean for different sectors and different job roles. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) may find it more difficult. Notably, France’s right to disconnect does not apply to companies with under 50 workers, while Australia is giving companies with fewer than 15 workers an extra year before the law kicks in for them. “For most SME bosses who run their own businesses, there is often little or no clear segregation of work and life,” said Mr Lee Swee Siong, vice-president of strategy and development in the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) Council. “As such it is likely they will send emails and queries at night and on weekends.” Company size aside, some sectors present unique challenges. Take logistics: Mr Christopher Ong, managing director of DHL Express Singapore, said that as a 24/7 international service provider, workers may also have to go beyond official hours to tend to distressed customers or fix delivery issues. This is even as the company does not encourage after-hours contact by supervisors. Mr Ong stressed that any right to disconnect law should consider, especially for frontline and essential services, business continuity and manpower needs. A right-to-disconnect policy could also, ironically, be at odds with workplace flexibility, which has become the norm expected by many employees, said Ms Yvonne Teo, ADP’s vice president of human resources for Asia Pacific. Fixed start and end times would make it difficult for workers to log on at staggered hours. Individuals who told CNA that they supported the right to disconnect also questioned whether a law would be practical or feasible, given the nature of their work. For instance, Eric, the design visualiser, works with deadlines ranging from hours to days. Even with a right to disconnect law in place, overtime work would still be necessary to complete projects on schedule, he said. For Michelle – who also asked not to use her real name – her work day as a teacher at an international school officially starts at 8am and ends at 4pm. In reality, the 25-year-old arrives an hour in advance to prepare, works through lunch, sometimes has her first meal of the day around 4pm, and goes home to continue work. At night, students also contact her to ask for extensions or help with homework. “It can feel like work is never done,\" she said. The right to disconnect was mentioned in Singapore's parliament as recently as in February, when Nominated MP Raj Joshua Thomas urged the government to be \"very careful\" about any policy steps. “Singapore’s sole resource is our human resource, upon which all our success has been built,” he said. “If our workforce weakens, our competitiveness and attractiveness as an economy weakens. And this threatens our continued ability to sustain our way of life.” Labour lawyer Mr Ding said that employers could be forced to hire more employees to meet tight deadlines, leading to more inefficiencies and higher costs. ADP’s Ms Teo echoed these views, saying that Singapore’s talent may become too expensive for foreign investors, endangering the country’s status as a regional hub. These beliefs were not necessarily shared by experts on productivity and organisational behaviour. “I feel that, depending on how it is implemented, the right to disconnect might actually increase productivity,” said Dr Ivan Png, a National University of Singapore fellow at Stanford University’s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. “I think of it as similar to measures to enhance employees’ physical health. Healthier workers are more productive. Allowing workers to disconnect could enhance their mental health.” Dr Png said the right to disconnect would also force managers to “channel and organise their thinking rather than shooting off text messages and emails to their subordinates every few minutes”. He pointed to a measure introduced last year for maids in Singapore to have one rest day a month that cannot be compensated away . “Their mandatory day off is like a disconnect,\" said Dr Png. \"How did that affect productivity at home?” The right to disconnect also seems to clash with a more basic level of competition: Our beliefs and behaviours around individual performance at work, and the rewards we expect for doing more than others. It's up to employees to choose whether to respond immediately to after-hours communication, said Mr Lee, the ASME vice president. “If they don’t, SME bosses should not penalise them. But if the employees do (despite not having to do so) then naturally, the bosses will perceive them as dedicated employees. “I feel that whether there is a right to disconnect policy or not, such behaviour and corresponding perceptions will continue to play out,” he said. If you're a supervisor needing your staff to put in longer hours for a project, what’s the best way to inform them? Communication can make a difference. Positive psychology expert and speaker Yeo Sha-en, who founded well-being consultancy Happiness Scientist, gave CNA some tips: What if you're an employee who wants to turn down a work-related request because you have too much going on? Ms Yeo suggests breaking the conversation down into three parts: In parliament, Mr Thomas also pointed out that there will be employees who choose to forgo their right to disconnect. They might then expect recognition or compensation, which could lead to tensions and disputes. “An organisation must reward those that are more valuable to it, and that are more willing to do more than they have to,” said the NMP. \"Being in a global city, in a super-connected world, a contactable and responsive worker is invariably a more valuable worker.” Michelle, the English teacher, said her school actually advocates boundary-setting. Teachers are discouraged from sending emails past 5pm and setting up work email access on their phones. Once, a supervisor stepped in after she raised concerns about unsustainable demands by a student’s parent. Still, she feels that these are roles and duties \"seen as expected of teachers\", and that setting boundaries \"can sometimes come at a cost to parents’, students’ and even bosses’ perception of you”. And perhaps also our perception of ourselves. Singapore workers are likely to take work performance as an indication of self-worth, according to Dr Tan Hwee Hoon, who teaches organisational behaviour and human resources at the Singapore Management University (SMU). In a decade-long study called the Global Leadership and Organisational Behaviour Effectiveness (GLOBE), published in 2004, Singapore ranked the highest among over 60 countries on both performance and future orientation. This refers to how much society encourages and rewards people for improvement and excellence, as well as how much people plan, invest in the future and delay gratification. Singapore also ranked highly on uncertainty avoidance. “So we’re very much into being the best ... making sure nothing goes wrong,” said Dr Tan. Taken together, it's no surprise that Singapore workers find it hard to disconnect from work, she added. “We don’t say 'this is work, this is life'. We sort of assume that what happens in work also happens in life, and vice versa.” Singapore's political leadership has played and continues to play a “very big” part in inculcating these worldviews on work, according to Dr Tan. The demands for individual excellence can be traced to the need for – and culture of – national survival which drove Singapore’s rapid transformation from third world to first. Correspondingly, the fear that Singapore will slip in productivity and competitiveness if it adopts a right to disconnect can also be traced to our beliefs about personal excellence, according to the associate professor. “I think it’s from a belief that we need to be controlled … that we cannot think that we can be self-motivated,” she said. During a parliamentary debate on mental health last month, MP Carrie Tan drew a similar link between Singapore’s national story and modern workplace stresses. “The very narrative of our nation’s survival and success thus far has been fuelled by the notion of scarcity, which then fuels an endless culture of competition and sense of inadequacy,” she said. Quoting a popular National Day song, she added: “If you recall the lyrics, we are first called to ‘stand up for Singapore’ to do the best we can, only to be called a few lines later to also ‘be prepared to give a little more’. “I love this song, I love to sing it with pride. And increasingly, I recognise some irony. Are we perhaps the only country in the world where our best is still not enough?” At a fundamental level, the right to disconnect is about reaching a mutual understanding between employers and workers, said SMU’s Dr Tan. A law would be a “very blunt tool” and an easier way around difficult, protracted conversations that employers and workers likely need to have, in order to set joint expectations on work hours and deliverables. And while people will comply with a law, that's not the same as committing to its intent. The culture and values that make it difficult to disconnect from work are ingrained not just in individuals but also Singapore's institutions, and will take more time to change, said Dr Tan. The onus for such change should not be placed solely on individuals. But it can be helpful for workers to know that they need to advocate and set boundaries, and how to do so. Michelle, the teacher, noted that her school's efforts to implement a culture of disconnecting – even if unofficially – come in tandem with the majority of staff following suit. In design visualiser Eric’s experience, it takes courage, some risk-taking and a bit of luck. After his office breakdown, he thought of quitting but was persuaded by an HR officer to hang on. He started saying no and speaking up more at work. This did not go down well, and at one point Eric thought he was at risk of losing his job. But then the firm’s management changed, and the culture at his workplace has “drastically” improved ever since. Eric still works there. He has mostly been able to keep a routine of leaving work around 5.30pm to pick up his young son from school, have dinner together with his family, and put the kid to bed. After that, he looks at work again, voluntarily, from about 9pm. Eric now leads a small team of his own and is careful to be the kind of supervisor he would have wanted. That means letting his team know in advance if they need to work late that day, and explaining why the task is so urgent that for those extra hours – they cannot disconnect.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Deepfakes, disinformation and foreign interference, to name a few, have troubled voters all around the world in a bumper year for polling. What are the lessons for Singapore? A multitude of online threats await political parties, authorities and the voting population as Singapore’s next general election looms. (Illustration: CNA/Clara Ho) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: He might be educated, tech-savvy and plugged into current affairs but every now and then, 30-year-old Isaac Neo still has his doubts over whether something he's spotted online is real or fake. “I'd say I'm quite confident at identifying misinformation or AI (artificial intelligence) deepfakes, but ... it's becoming more difficult to do so,” he said. “Sometimes even reliable accounts that I trust can themselves get fooled by misinformation. AI-generated images are also getting more realistic.\" Mr Neo, who works as a security risk analyst, also co-hosts the Before The Ballot podcast discussing key national issues ahead of Singapore's next General Election, which must be held by November 2025 . Already, a first sliver of election-related misinformation has emerged, with a widely circulated WhatsApp message claiming that newly minted Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has called for polls to be held on Sep 6. In reality, the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee has not even been convened – at least as of Apr 18 – and this is a necessary step before an election can be called. Such falsehoods are among the multitude of online threats that voters, political parties and governments around the world must contend with in a record-breaking year for polling. While tech firms have introduced measures against malicious actors trying to disrupt election campaigns, it's ultimately down to voters to take precautions and discern for themselves, experts told CNA. They added that political players must move fast to address and counter such incidents, on top of efforts to foster familiarity and trust with the public. In 2024 alone, at least 40 elections will be held by countries making up over half of global gross domestic product, according to the World Economic Forum. Governments have pushed out new laws and guidelines to try and stem the tide of digital and AI-related threats, but concerns remain over the risk of voters being misled. In the United States, which heads to the polls in November to choose its next leader, a fake robocall impersonating United States President Joe Biden told thousands of people to not vote in the New Hampshire primary election. Late last year, deepfake audio clips of United Kingdom opposition leader Keir Starmer verbally abusing party staffers went viral. A general election will be held in July . Closer to home, Indonesia's Prabowo Subianto won a Feb 14 election after a campaign plagued by AI-driven disinformation . As early as in October, a video was doctored to show outgoing president Joko Widodo making a speech in Mandarin, in an attempt to portray him as pro-China and to stir up anti-China sentiments among conservatives and nationalists. In India, the world’s most populous country, deepfakes have also run rampant amid ongoing general elections , with a dead politician revived to praise a candidate on video and an audio hoax of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi resigning among others. Global examples of AI-driven electoral disinformation are “highly problematic” and something Singapore needs to be mindful of as a \"critical\" General Election approaches, said Singapore University of Social Sciences associate faculty Kasthuri Prameswaren. It will be the first election for a fourth-generation leadership led by a new PM , amid challenges on multiple fronts such as geopolitics, climate degradation, food and water security, an ageing population and social mobility and inclusivity. “There are various implications, such as increased polarisation in already divided societies, misleading of voters, disenfranchisement of voters and the weakening and discrediting of politico-administrative institutions such as the Elections Department, and even the delegitimisation of political actors,” she noted. Mr Benjamin Ang, who heads the Centre of Excellence for National Security at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) noted the rapid growth and spread of generative AI tools in the past 12 months alone. It indicates that online threats to elections are going to intensify in the coming years, said Mr Ang, who is also head of digital impact research at the think-tank. “At RSIS, we've studied some of the best practices in securing elections, such as (at) the Canadian 2019 federal election,” said Mr Ang. Some of these measures include the government working with and regulating social media platforms, forming standard operating procedures for critical election incidents, setting up a task force on election threats, providing neutral assistance and advice to all major political parties and improving citizen awareness of disinformation and foreign interference. In Singapore, the use of generative AI and deepfakes will increase, said Associate Professor Natalie Pang from the National University of Singapore’s Communications and New Media Department. She cited a recent extortion plot against some Members of Parliament, which involved pictures of their faces superimposed onto obscene photographs. “It’s deepfake AI porn for now , but it’ll evolve when the election is here.” The Workers' Party (WP), the largest opposition party in Singapore, told CNA it takes a serious view of the potential threats that could arise from abuse and misuse of information. It is also concerned about the rise of generative AI capable of producing convincing deepfake videos, which has \"elevated the potential for harm to a new level.” The WP cited a parliamentary question raised in April by its MP He Ting Ru, who asked whether existing electoral rules provide recourse for candidates and political parties who are the subject of manipulated, deepfake media or fake news released during the Cooling Off Day or Polling Day of elections. “We urge Singaporeans to refer to the official WP website or social media accounts if they are in doubt of WP-related information they come across,” said the party. The ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) and the Progress Singapore Party (PSP), which has two Non-Constituency MPs, declined to comment. The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) meanwhile told CNA that the best way to deal with online threats such as falsehoods and AI-generated content would be to expose them and let people make their own judgments. It's also important that the party's branding is strong and recognisable, and that it communicates its position on key issues clearly and frequently, a spokesperson said. “This is so that members of the public, whether supporters of the party or otherwise, will know what to expect from us,\" she added. \"And – more crucially – what to remove from consideration or take with a pinch of salt.” Mr Ang from RSIS said political parties need to respond to threats \"strategically – by knowing which ones to respond to and which to ignore – quickly, transparently and authentically”. But politicians who have spent years building trust on the ground and face-to-face with constituents, as well as delivering on promises, will be in a stronger position. With the abundance of cheap or free AI tools, political parties should also train their members to use AI responsibly, said Dr Carol Soon, principal research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies and adjunct principal scientist at the government's recently launched Centre for Advanced Technologies in Online Safety. \"And they should evaluate the integration and use of AI tools in their campaigning process,” she added. Social media companies have a responsibility here, since they control the platforms where information spreads, said experts. But there is a limit to what they can or will do, and a limit to what governments can make them do, because they are all owned by foreign entities, Mr Ang pointed out. In the lead-up to elections, popular short-form video platform TikTok works with fact-checking bodies, electoral commissions and civil society to create information resources for users. Labels are added to election-related content, to direct people to an in-app \"Election Centre\", and reminders are placed on relevant hashtags to encourage awareness of misinformation. During Singapore's presidential election last year, TikTok users were pointed to information from the Elections Department (ELD) via content labels and s earch guides. Widely used instant messaging service WhatsApp has in place measures such as a limit on forwarding texts. It has also launched public education campaigns in some countries, including a dedicated fact-checking helpline in India. In February, WhatsApp's parent company Meta said that in the \"coming months\", it will label AI-generated images on its Facebook and Instagram platforms. YouTube has also promised to introduce a requirement for creators to disclose when their content has been created or altered with AI tools. But Ms Kasthuri from SUSS pointed to the adverse impact of social media algorithms which repeatedly churn out similar content after recognising what users are inclined towards. “These coupled with a lack of effort to fact-check and a haphazard understanding of the political landscape is a key factor in how misinformation can wreak havoc on the electorate,” she warned. Dr Soon noted that tech companies’ content moderation policies are global in nature, and that localising them would require collaboration with stakeholders like the government. On that front, regulation – in the form of not just laws but also codes of practice, guidelines and frameworks – still plays an important role, she said. In response to queries from CNA, the ELD, a department under the Prime Minister's Office which oversees elections in Singapore, said a collective approach is required. That would mean combining efforts by government agencies, internet intermediaries and the likes of voters. The ELD pointed to existing legislation such as the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) and the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, or FICA. “We have also seen many instances in recent years where social media and communications technologies were used by entities to mount Hostile Information Campaigns (HICs) against other countries,” said the department. “These covert, coordinated and sophisticated online activities seek to advance the interests of the attacking country, for example by manipulating public opinion in the target country on domestic political issues.” ELD said the government continues to work closely with major social media platforms to ensure that content moderation and election integrity plans are in place during elections. “ELD and other government agencies conduct regular review of our electoral processes, including learning from overseas best practices, to ensure that our system and processes are effective and up to date,” it added. Last year, the ELD and other government agencies jointly issued an advisory to presidential election candidates, warning of foreign interference and cybersecurity risks. Ms Kasthuri, who specialises in politics in Singapore and Southeast Asia, stressed the importance of voter education in both campaign matters as well as how elections work, as a bulwark against misinformation. Assoc Prof Pang from NUS said that while the government and schools alike have been pushing to improve digital literacy, political topics and elections \"are much harder to tackle\". \"We have a culture where citizens may be unwilling or fear discussing them openly,” she said. “The irony is that they can become more susceptible to conspiracy theories and falsehoods circulating.\" Mr Neo, the podcaster, now has a rule of thumb when it comes to assessing whether a piece of information is reliable: Cross-check and confirm with at least two separate sources. As a creator of content that's political in nature, he feels more pressure to ensure the accuracy of his output. “This is why for each episode, we meticulously research before drafting questions for our guests; put sources for the information that we mention in our show notes; and when phrasing certain questions, try our best to make sure that even if taken out of context, it can't be construed as misinformation,” said Mr Neo. Other Singaporeans CNA spoke to were keenly aware that even without the added complexities of AI and deepfakes, the way content is cut and positioned already carries biases which can colour a consumer's perspectives. \"It's easy to fall for rage-bait headlines and hooks that are set up to drive outrage,\" said Ms Xu Hui Yan, 34, who works in marketing. She spoke of the importance of reading and watching in full for better context, and of having access to different information channels and viewpoints. “Falsities have no space in an election,\" said Ms Kasthuri. \"It misinforms the electorate and additionally, it also can encourage dirty politics, such as mudslinging or appealing to emotions, by over-enthusiastic party supporters. \"(These) should not be given a chance to detract from the real political contestation that should occur.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Look beyond record growth and challenges such as supply chain disruptions, increased competition and a manpower crunch are on the horizon. While local airlines have been riding a post-pandemic high, analysts caution that the good times may not last, with intensifying competition among other challenges. (Illustration: CNA/Clara Ho) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The greatest challenge in its existence. That was how Singapore Airlines' chief executive Goh Choon Phong described the COVID-19 pandemic in a staff memo in early 2020. That year, the national carrier, along with other airlines worldwide, was forced into grounding flights, enforcing hefty pay cuts and as a last resort, furloughing employees as the sector was ravaged by a once-in-a-generation event. But more than four years on, it would appear that this grave challenge has been met with aplomb. With demand for air travel roaring back with a vengeance, Singapore’s airline industry - comprising SIA and low-cost carriers Scoot and Jetstar Asia - now sings a different tune. From experiencing its first full-year loss in history during the pandemic, SIA in May reported a record profit of S$2.68 billion (US$1.99 billion) for the fiscal year ended March 2024. The reward? A bonus of almost eight months' salary for staff. For Scoot, signs of growth were evident when it received the first two of nine Embraer aircraft in April, with CEO Leslie Thng noting that this “reflects our confidence in the demand for air travel”. Jetstar Asia, meanwhile, expects passenger capacity to exceed pre-COVID levels by the end of 2024. A spokesperson told CNA the airline will continue to focus on expanding its network of routes, increasing fleet numbers and recruiting more manpower. “We’re excited about what lies ahead,” the spokesperson said. But it's not all clear skies. SIA Group’s financial statement in May gave some clues, pointing to increased competition from other airlines possibly leading to reduced revenue. “The airline industry continues to face challenges including rising geopolitical tensions, an uncertain macroeconomic climate, supply chain constraints and high inflation in many parts of the world,” the group - which comprises SIA and Scoot - further cautioned. Some of these came to bear last month when Scoot cancelled several flights citing a \"variety of operational reasons\", which included “supply chain issues”. Experts added that the loss of skilled manpower during the pandemic could have contributed as well. SIA also ran into issues of its own when flights to three Chinese cities were suspended in April, which analysts attributed to regulatory issues stemming from Beijing prioritising the recovery of its local airlines. And so while signs of growth paint an optimistic picture of the industry, they are also a consequence of limited supply - of flights and seats - leading to airlines charging higher prices amid increased demand, said Mr Alan Lim, director of Alton Aviation Consultancy. “We expect that there will be a reversion to the long-term mean in terms of financial performance,” he added, as other experts warned of a potential erosion of profit. Apart from SIA, Jetstar Asia has also cited strong competition as part of ongoing headwinds. The contest is especially intense in the Asia-Pacific region, said analysts. Mr Mayur Patel, head of Asia at aviation data consultancy OAG, pointed to a nearly 60 per cent increase in the number of flight routes operating in Southeast Asia, and a fourfold jump in the number of routes by low-cost airlines since 2011. This increased competition should in theory lead to lower fares. But that would also result in declining revenue for airlines, at a time when operating costs are rising in part by trying to add more flights, said Mr Patel. What all of this means is that airlines could still be pressured to hike ticket prices above pre-pandemic levels. In a CNA commentary , aviation analyst Brendan Sobie also said consumers should not expect air fares to return to 2019 levels. Airlines have little choice but to roll up their sleeves, said Mr Lim from Alton Aviation. “The key for local airlines now is how to continue sustaining this growth by differentiating themselves from their competitors – be it in terms of network, product, service, or cost competitiveness,” he said. “Airlines will need to take this period of strong profitability to optimise their operations and costs and set themselves up right for the next phase of post-pandemic growth.” Early this year, Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways drew the ire of customers when it cancelled flights over “chronic staff shortages”. And in April, India’s Vistara Airlines also cut flights due to a lack of pilots and crew. Singapore's airlines have not been spared from these manpower issues, which were amplified by the pandemic in more ways than one, said experts. “The perceived risk of potentially facing unemployment again if a similar situation occurs in the future, as well as the amplified importance of work-life balance due to COVID-19, add additional dimensions to this issue,” said Associate Professor Hsieh Cheng-Hsien from the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS). “Duties in the aviation industry, particularly airlines services, are very difficult to be done via work-from-home … it might be a reason some people left the industry during COVID and aren't returning.” Mr Lim also pointed to other industries jostling for talent. “The pandemic spurred growth in sectors such as e-commerce, logistics and technology, which have been able to attract workers with the promise of better working conditions, higher wages and more predictable schedules,” he said. Former cabin crew from local airlines concurred, telling CNA they'd left the industry due to the uncertainties of COVID-19, and chose not to return having found more stable full-time jobs elsewhere. Over the course of the pandemic, many found that they treasured more consistent working hours. “After a flight, I got a full-day rest with two nights at home before I went back to fly again, but the timings were not consistent, and it was hard to plan family activities around that,” said one ex-cabin crew, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The 30-year-old now works in the education sector. Another cabin crew who was formerly from SIA said that among colleagues she knew, about 60 per cent left the industry for good during or after the pandemic. But she has also heard from those still with the airline that SIA has had no trouble attracting new hires. Experts said, however, that not all carriers have the same pull as SIA, with its reputation and offer of competitive salaries and benefits. Then there is the matter of training for crew and pilots, which is no straightforward task. Former cabin crew told CNA they had to undergo four months of training before going on flight duty. “On-the-job” training, as found in other service industries, does not exist in their line of work. “(Training) is not just about customer service, but also safety, which encompasses a lot of things, such as knowing where the exits are, knowing the protocols in order to react quickly in an emergency,” said the 30-year-old former cabin crew. He pointed to the efforts of cabin crew in the turbulence-stricken SQ321 as an example of the complex and high-pressure nature of the role. For others such as pilots and technicians, training can take years to complete, which creates a “substantial lag” in the supply of manpower relative to its demand, said Mr Lim, the analyst. “The combined effect of these factors has created a significant manpower challenge for the aviation sector, making it difficult to replenish the workforce to pre-pandemic levels and meet the increasing demand for air travel and related services.\" Jetstar Asia said it has recruited more than 90 new employees, comprising mostly pilot and cabin crew, over the past six months. “We’re holding local recruitment drives, and partnering with local and overseas institutions to attract new talent,” the spokesperson added. On Tuesday, International Air Transport Association (IATA) director-general Willie Walsh said global supply chain issues affecting the delivery of new aircraft could well persist into 2026 . The issue is two-pronged, according to analysts. First is the increased demand for spare parts, with many planes left idle during the pandemic and needing maintenance. To reduce costs at the time, airlines retired and parked older aircraft. There is now a pressing need to reactivate some of these, but a lack of parts stands in the way, said Mr Alfred Chua, Asia air transport editor at trade publication FlightGlobal. “Without certain parts or systems, an aircraft might not be able to return to flying… This has also been compounded by a manpower shortfall in the aerospace sector post-COVID, which means there are fewer hands available,” he said. Second is the issue of supply bottlenecks, with many airlines vying for new planes. Aviation expert Shantanu Gangakhedkar, a senior consultant at growth advisory firm Frost and Sullivan, said aircraft deliveries are not made willy-nilly, with orders placed as far as 10 to 15 years in advance. With the pandemic disrupting production, there now exists huge backlogs of orders which need to be fulfilled before new ones can be made. Analysts described the supply chain for aircraft maintenance and production as complicated and sensitive to even the slightest disruptions. “The reactivation of parked aircraft and the fulfillment of new aircraft orders are gradual processes, and any delays in one part of the supply chain can have cascading effects throughout the industry,” said Mr Lim. “While manufacturers and suppliers are ramping up production to address the backlog, the complex nature of the aviation supply chain, which involves numerous specialised components from various global suppliers, means that resolving these issues will take time.” Safety issues with US aerospace firm Boeing have also added a spanner in the works, with production of its popular 737 MAX aircraft now capped and thus further limiting an already-tight supply. Another potential hurdle for airlines would be an increased emphasis on using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Singapore has taken the lead on the push towards the eco-friendly alternative, mandating that all departing flights use SAF from 2026. Last month, SIA and Scoot signed an agreement to purchase oil refinery Neste's Singapore-made sustainable fuel at Changi Airport. Singapore is also the first country to impose a sustainable fuel levy - meaning that passengers can expect to pay more for their air tickets. SAF is about two to four times costlier than conventional fuel, and getting a steady supply is the main challenge, said analysts. Despite Singapore having the largest SAF plant in the world in Neste, it's still not enough to fulfill the demand that's expected to ramp up in the coming years, said Mr Shantanu from Frost and Sullivan. “The industry needs to see how supply can be increased further, such as through in-house production, purchasing from other regions.\" Amid the raft of mounting challenges, opportunities do lie ahead for the airline industry, such as in the increased adoption and innovation in tech and artificial intelligence (AI). Reports have pointed to AI possibly playing a key role in improving flight operations and safety, customer service, baggage handling and even maintenance and repairs. In November last year, Changi Airport Group began trialling AI-based screening of passenger baggage, to help speed up the process and for better security. These innovations are a bright spark in the industry and can help improve passenger experience, manpower issues as well as overall operations and safety, said Mr Shantanu. Analysts concluded that as Southeast Asia develops and becomes more attractive to tourists, Singapore stands to gain as a hub providing connections and transit options. And with a strong aviation hub, local airlines in turn stand to benefit. \"Many travelers are choosing SIA for long-haul routes, such as from Europe to Singapore,\" said Mr Shantanu. \"And then they have an option to choose Scoot and Jetstar Asia as a low-cost carrier to continue their journey to other parts of Asia.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Taylor Swift and K-pop bands have proven that music artistes can transcend cultural and linguistic barriers. But are they the exception to the norm? How can Singapore’s music industry set artistes up for the same commercial success and longevity? CNA spoke to artistes and industry practitioners about the possibility of a Singaporean music superstar who commands Taylor Swift levels of success and adulation. (Illustration: CNA/Jasper Loh) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The year was 1990 and the explosion of indie music in Singapore sucked in one 18-year-old, who made up her mind that music was going to be more than her hobby. She was determined to make a living as a performer. But the plan wasn’t quite viable in Singapore. After releasing her debut album in 1993, she made only S$6,000 in her first year as a recording artiste – just about enough to feed herself, she said. So she moved to Taiwan under the advice of her then-label, Ocean Butterflies, who wanted to introduce her music to the region. They released her second album to the competitive Mandarin pop (Mandopop) market in 1994 – it became a hit and the artiste, a household name. Today, Kit Chan is arguably best known for the song Home, at least in Singapore. First presented to the Sing Singapore festival committee in 1997, she performed the classic at the National Day Parade the following year. The song has taken on a life of its own , enduring through generations. Chan, now 52, remains one of Singapore’s esteemed pioneer generation singers who made their mark abroad, paving the way for younger Singaporean artistes. Others have since found international acclaim – from Mandopop stars Stefanie Sun (Sun Yanzi) and JJ Lin to Sezairi Sezali, who became the first Singapore artiste to have a song, It’s You, hit 100 million streams on Spotify . Yet, they command a fraction of the commercial and cultural domination by the likes of US megastar Taylor Swift, or K-pop groups such as BTS and Blackpink. Blackpink became the first K-pop group to headline popular US music festival Coachella last April, amid their record-breaking Born Pink world tour. The band then brought the tour to Singapore in May , performing two sold-out shows, which saw Blinks fly in to catch their idols. Similarly, scores of Swifties travelled to Singapore in early March this year when Swift made it her sole Southeast Asia pitstop in The Eras Tour. One economist projected that the six shows by Swift would contribute up to S$400 million to Singapore’s economy in the first quarter of the year, benefiting the country’s retail, hospitality, and food and beverage sectors. What would it take for Singapore to produce a superstar of similar magnitude? It is not just talent, industry practitioners told CNA – Singapore has no shortage of that. Instead, a host of other factors may limit an artiste’s trajectory before they can even begin. For a start, Singapore is small. No matter how popular you are here, you cannot hit \"a critical mass\", Chan said. “But if you have a regional market, then somehow that critical mass does generate a sort of buzz and energy,” she told CNA. A country’s geographical location also affects the chances of success, depending on the language an artiste sings in. If they wanted a breakthrough in an international English market, Chan noted, they would probably have a “much bigger advantage” if they relocated to countries such as the US or UK. Singaporean artistes have geography “working against us” because it hinders their ability to tour, a significant aspect of developing a career as an artiste, added Singaporean singer-songwriter Inch Chua. The 36-year-old temporarily moved to Los Angeles in 2011 to learn about the music industry on a global stage. “In Malaysia or Indonesia, if (I am) an artiste who wants to tour, I can, at a scale that is manageable. I can drive three hours away and play in a new town to 50 people, 100 people. Then do that again the next weekend,” she explained. “I can’t do that in Singapore. If I did a show in Tampines, I would have the same people from Jurong coming. That immediately – on a practical, economic level – makes it difficult, because most artistes will unfortunately feel overexposed after a while … It’s not going to be financially practical for an artiste to then do only one show a month or every three months.” As a Singaporean artiste, the natural career trajectory would be to go regional, she believes. Take fellow artiste Sezairi, whose Indonesian fanbase enabled him to embark on a four-city tour in Indonesia in December to promote his newest album Self Soothing. His song It’s You went viral worldwide in 2021 due to people using it as a soundtrack to TikTok videos, and it was added to Spotify’s Global Viral 50 chart, which tracks songs generating online buzz. The song also achieved 12-times platinum certification in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, and gold certification in Taiwan. But the 37-year-old Singapore Idol alumnus doesn’t believe he is the musician he “fully wants to be” yet. To him, success means “sustainability”. Following the virality of It’s You, Sezairi admitted he did not have a plan on how to tour then, even within Southeast Asia, partly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While he felt it was a waste that he wasn’t able to visit every city where the song was “blowing up”, the experience taught him a lesson. “To the public, (you have) a number one song, but so what? You’re still sitting in your room. What is music all about? “It’s a multi-faceted thing – now you got a hit song, you got to go and promote it, you got to play in front of people, you got to make people spend money to see you, so that they will lock in this bond they have with you,” he said. Being able to develop a “touring circuit” would entail proper industry infrastructure for artistes to build their career, Sezairi believes. This could mean more money being put into places that encourage community building through music, so local artistes can hold at least one show a month, he suggested. Sezairi’s peak seasons tend to be May and June, as well as the fourth quarter of the year. But gigs are “very seasonal” for the star who sings in English, Malay and Bahasa Indonesia; he sometimes performs one show every three months, and other times, four to five times a month. His Indonesian counterparts with the same number of monthly listeners as him perform 15 to 20 gigs a month. If he could do the same, he would be able to hire, for example, a road manager and five musicians who would then also be working 15 to 20 gigs a month, creating a “trickle-down effect” on the industry. “Being in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines has taught me that (Singapore) always looks to shoot for A-tier,” he added. “But our industry doesn’t have the B-, C- and D-tier to be able to sustain the growth underneath this A-tier artiste – and that’s why we haven’t produced an A-tier artiste yet. “We start from E and want to go to A immediately.” These tiers are not measured by “financial gain” as D-tier artistes can earn a lot of money and sometimes more than those in the A-tier, such as by being a cover band, Sezairi clarified. “Rather, the metric is what kind of music you want to do. Because the hardest kind of music is your own music; when you want to be an A-tier artiste, you have to be ready to say, okay, this is me.” The support wasn’t always scant, according to industry veteran and founder of Snakeweed Studios Leonard Soosay, who has produced Singaporean bands he believes were “on par” with those from the West. These include indie acts Electrico, Ronin and The Great Spy Experiment. “There was nothing for a long time until Electrico came out and people listening didn’t know whether it was a British or American band that the radio was pushing so much. Then when they found out it was actually Singaporean, I think a lot of Singaporeans felt that sense of pride,” he said. “(These bands) really believed in the scene and in creating music that could take the scene further. They went to America and performed at SXSW (South by Southwest, a major US media and music festival) and did American tours. They did Japan, the UK … they spread Singapore music to these places. “And I thought, okay, they’ve opened the doors for more people.” The only drawback was money, added Mr Soosay. Many of these bands didn’t have the funds to sustain a “long, drawn out tour” in these bigger countries. The National Arts Council (NAC) then stepped in and started giving grants to these bands, which saw a “whole wave of bands”, like indie rock band Pleasantry, going to play overseas, he recalled. Mr Soosay had hoped this would continue for the next few generations – but he was told that funding would focus “more on the Asian region”. “Because (of that), I felt like the music couldn’t go to places that were actually the champions of this kind of music,” he said. In response to Nominated Member of Parliament Usha Chandradas’ parliamentary question in March about government expenditure on local artistes over the past five years, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong said the NAC supports various aspects of a musician’s work through a suite of grants and initiatives. These aspects include content production, international export, capability development and audience development. For example, the Market and Audience Development Grant supports musicians to “tour overseas and showcase at international platforms”, Mr Tong said. But more can be done, singer-songwriter Chua said. She admits to being a big believer in “artificial pumps”, such as the “concerted effort” to support and rally around local content during SG50 in 2015, then again in 2019 during the Singapore Bicentennial. She remembered feeling genuine love and support for local music before the pandemic “robbed” artistes . “During this short window of four years, it was a really great examination of what artificial pumps can do in terms of creating a culture or building a story. So, it’s about consistently doing it,” she said. Where such “artificial pumps” are needed, Chua noted that Singapore could learn from the global explosion of K-pop in the last decade . The grip that K-pop has on the world proves it is possible to transcend linguistic barriers. “When I first went to SXSW in 2010, K-pop was not a thing then. But I remember watching (South Korean multinational entertainment agency) SM Entertainment at a conference there, and they were heavily supported by their government in funding. Pushing (them) was like an economic investment in their country,” she shared. “(South Korea) was really smart. Their strategy, even from a political, government level, was to create cultural equity in the world. It was not about building a superstar; it’s an even bigger macro picture.” The South Korean government was “very consistent in supporting their culture for more than a decade”, added Chua. “And SM is now the juggernaut that it is today, bleeding into commercial goods in a variety of other ways.” Support of such magnitude might make it possible for Singaporean artistes to eventually crack the code in the international English market. This is the hope that record producer Josh Wei still holds. “I don’t think we’re there at the level where our pop songs are truly competitive with the best English songs in the world. We have glimmers of hope … but on the whole, I think there’s a lot to be done just on the creative (front),” he said. “We’re in competition with the whole West – you know, US, UK, Canada – all these top music markets. It’s hard to sustain a peak when the Singapore general population has all this choice to listen to whatever they want.” Mr Wei is convinced that the local music industry is “not developed enough to support past a certain point”: The point of export. “An act can become big – we’ve seen this – in Singapore and when it’s finally time to become big in America, or even in Malaysia, that’s the point of failure. We can’t seem to figure out the export part of local music,” he said. This inadvertently bleeds into conversations among upcoming artistes. Sezairi was told after winning Singapore Idol in 2009 that “English music cannot; you go Malaysia, you follow in the footsteps of (Malaysia-based Singaporean actor) Aaron Aziz”. “This is what they’re telling Chinese kids too. ‘You just look at JJ (Lin)’,” added Sezairi, a LASALLE College of the Arts graduate. “I spent four years in an arts college where this was the topic of conversation – who’s going to sell out and how we’re going to do it. Like, let’s listen to their music, let’s think about who’s their manager.” While it’s not entirely the fault of Singaporeans who have been “conditioned” by “post-colonial cultural imports”, it means “we have always wanted Western success because that’s the (art) we know and consume”, Sezairi noted. Another local singer Shareefa Aminah, better known as Shazza, recently spoke to CNA about reactions to her songs, after a video of her duet with Canadian pop duo Crash Adams went viral on social media, garnering over 20 million views on TikTok. Netizens expressed their surprise in the comments section of some of her songs that the songs were not by an international artiste, the 23-year-old shared. “That's great (and) I'm really glad they liked it. But also, why does it have to be international for it to be good?” Sezairi admitted to once harbouring this unconscious bias, but has since realised his blindspot made him neglect the power of Southeast Asia’s population. Top Indonesian artistes hit 10 million to 20 million monthly listeners on Spotify, matching the streaming numbers of US artistes, he pointed out. Chan, too, feels the tide has changed since the 90s when she first made a splash. Back then, Singapore was not yet “confident enough” in its talents, culture and even taste, unless it “got the nod from other countries”. “But we have no issue (now). We don’t need someone from another country and culture telling us what’s cool,” she said. In the long run, this might mean redefining success on Singapore’s own terms, rather than trying to measure up against the Taylor Swifts and Blackpinks of the world. Sometimes, the story that an artiste chooses to tell only resonates with a niche and small market. They don’t need to have “super mass market” popularity to be commercially viable, stressed Mr Kevin Foo, general manager of Sony Music Entertainment in Taiwan. Mr Foo, who is Singaporean, describes commercial viability as being able to finance one’s passion or art through an audience who will pay. He pointed to Singapore non-profit, The TENG Company, as one such example, calling it a “great cultural icon”. The arts company that reimagines Chinese music recently partnered with Shangri-La Singapore to produce music for in-room headsets under the hotel’s Music for Mindfulness experience. The music business, like any creative business, is foremost about “emotional connection”, added Mr Foo, who is also managing director of RCA Records, owned by Sony, in Greater China. Having worked with various Singaporean artistes like Linying and Charlie Lim, among others, at every stage from recording to distribution, he admitted to once thinking that all he needed was to get such artistes to sing in Mandarin to make it big in Taiwan. But he has since learnt otherwise. “There are all these cultural nuances. How you say one sentence, just because of the vocabulary (and) the words you choose, means something different to different people in different parts of Greater China … It’s not just about speaking the language; it’s about how you connect with the audience,” he said. Remaining authentic also means being clear about one’s career expectations, said Singapore independent rock band Cashew Chemists. The band’s guitarist Brian Chia told CNA that while they may not have found outstanding commercial success, it was because members had pursued goals outside of music, like full-time jobs. “Music was only one part of each of our lives. We don’t think any of us seriously envisaged us becoming a professional rock band,” said 35-year-old Chia, a freelance sound engineer. “We never felt like we were competing with other bands. We always felt free to experiment with our sound. We just wanted to play music that we would enjoy listening to.” Artistes like Cashew Chemists may stand to benefit the most from social media, which has “made music a lot more egalitarian” and “really changed the game”, said Chia. Music lovers now have more choices and have developed more unique tastes too. While the comparatively low barrier to entry could result in “many more Stefanie Suns and JJ Lins”, it also means fewer artistes “taking a whole market and more artistes developing their own niches and each having a more unique following”. On the other hand, singer-songwriter Chua believes the ease of self-publishing has also removed grinding in a more tangible way – a muscle that she calls “performance stamina”. Even though a good musician can come from anywhere, not everyone can be a good musician, she noted. In many ways, social media has amplified an artiste’s inborn tendencies, from a love for hard work to the desire for quick fame. Audiences must also become more discerning to see through the noise, but she sees this as a positive outcome. When audiences are challenged to figure out what they really want and like, they will eventually have a “deeper understanding of what they like and who they are”. Chua hopes to see a hunger for local content from people who desire to hear stories that are more relatable, as well as from artistes who want to create work “more contextualised to who we are as Singaporeans and to this part of the world”. And, she added, “for people to receive that very well”. This is why big labels remain relevant today, suggested Mr Foo from Sony Music Entertainment and RCA Records. Major labels have lived through the evolution of the music industry, so they know what worked, with the commercial success to prove it. And despite the changing medium, the goal remains to tell similarly resonating stories. “The label still plays a part with sieving out (talent), with the experience of A&R (artistes and repertoire), with developing artistes and helping them tell and magnify their stories … With a company as big as Sony, it’s really about being prepared to invest,” he added. For a Singapore artiste to break through in bigger markets abroad, it’s a bonus but not a necessity to have a Singaporean like Mr Foo heading such markets. Instead, it’s just about having somebody believe in their talent, said Mr Foo. Sezairi added that it’s “very important that the people who are most like you champion you”, so that when the artiste then gains momentum, they wouldn’t have to be someone else to succeed. And if Chan’s career is proof, commercial success should not be at odds with staying true to oneself. While she now considers herself “culturally, emotionally and mentally richer” for having chosen to sing in Mandarin, the decision wasn’t always so clear cut. “I was asked (by my first label, Ocean Butterflies) to reflect on this: Okay, you want to sing in English? Do you want to just be a part-time singer or sing as a hobby? Or do you want to be a professional and make a living, make a name, create your own brand as an artiste? Then you’d have to do it in Chinese,” she recalled. “Of course I couldn’t be 100 per cent sure, but that was what was offered to me. Literally, it was like, if you don’t sing in Chinese, we’re not interested in signing you.” Even though Chan wouldn’t describe herself to be “very ambitious”, entering Mandopop was the more practical choice if she wanted to make a living – which aligned with her goals and values. “I am a very principled person. It wasn’t really about how high or how far I could go. It was about the fact that I believe my work has value … and one of the ways to measure value is whether somebody is going to pay to watch me perform, to buy my CDs. It gives you a very practical edge,” she said. “We can all dream and it’s great to dream, but that (practicality) sort of anchors me and makes it possible for me to go on and on and on.” Chan noted it was initial commercial success – “extremely important when you’re starting out” – that enabled her to now enjoy the later part of her career. “I’ve paid my dues many times over. I’m very happy to say that I’m at this point in my career, in life, where I really work on projects that I just want to do, that interest me as a person, that still move me forward as an artiste; things that pique my curiosity, things that make me feel I could grow and learn,” she said. While Chan acknowledged she doesn’t have a “huge mass market” now, she has managed to retain a loyal fanbase in the region that has kept her career going. “I think being true to who I am and picking the right projects for myself has also defined me as an artiste. That is also important – being able to differentiate yourself from everyone else,” she added. “It eventually paid off for me to just sort of march to the beat of my own drum, because I think that is a reason for the longevity of my career.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Some Singapore MPs were among dozens of victims to receive letters that had images of their faces superimposed on obscene pictures. The number of people potentially at risk of image-based sexual abuse increases exponentially with the advent of generative AI, says a women's rights group. There has been an \"explosion of deepfakes\" in recent years, says Ms Sugidha Nithiananthan, a director at women's rights group AWARE. (Illustration: CNA/Clara Ho) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The letters were sent to their workplaces – in them, their face superimposed onto an obscene photo of a man and a woman in an “intimate and compromising” position. Contact this email address, or else, the letter threatened. Those who contacted the email address were ordered to transfer money to a bank account, or compromising photographs and videos would be leaked and exposed on social media. One 50-year-old victim transferred S$20,000 (US$14,700). Victims of deepfake porn can feel helpless and powerless, said Dr Hanita Assudani, a clinical psychologist at Alliance Counselling. “What has happened is somebody has used something that is part of me – my face, my pictures, my features – without my consent,” she added. “The intrusiveness is present. It depends on each individual, but the level of intrusiveness, the shock, the humiliation, the shame, and the social consequences of it can be very similar to somebody who experienced a sexual assault.” Some victims feel unsafe as their trust was broken, she said. “I’m definitely concerned about anything that will take away consent and power from individuals, violate people’s boundaries,” said Dr Hanita. There has been an “explosion of deepfakes” in recent years, said Ms Sugidha Nithiananthan, director of advocacy and research communications at the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE). She pointed to a report by identity verification platform Sumsub that said the Asia Pacific region has seen a 1,530 per cent increase in deepfakes from 2022 to 2023. “Mirroring trends in sexual violence, the non-consensual creation of sexually explicit material with deepfake technology is largely targeted at women,” she added. But it is not just low-quality, black-and-white photos printed on paper that are a concern. Once online, these deepfake images travel quickly and wide, being replicated on websites and platforms. A quick search on Google by CNA showed multiple results, including one site that offered to fulfil requests to generate deepfake porn images of local celebrities and influencers. Superstar Taylor Swift, social media influencer Bobby Althoff and actress Natalie Portman are among celebrities who have reportedly been victims of deepfake AI porn. In September last year, a man in South Korea was sentenced to more than two years in prison for using AI to create 360 virtual child abuse images . Some people who view such pornographic material eventually think about creating them. A report by Home Security Heroes, a US company focused on preventing identity theft, found that deepfake pornography makes up 98 per cent of all deepfake videos online. About 48 per cent of the 1,522 men surveyed had viewed deepfake pornography at least once, with “technological curiosity” being claimed as the top reason for doing so. Twenty per cent of respondents considered learning how to create deepfakes. “One in 10 respondents admitted to attempting the creation of deepfake pornography featuring either celebrities or individuals known to them,” the report said. Between March and mid-April, the police received more than 70 reports of victims receiving extortion letters with manipulated obscene photos. Among the victims were Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Members of Parliament Tan Wu Meng, Edward Chia and Yip Hon Weng. “With advancements to photo and video editing technology, including the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered tools, manipulated photographs and videos may increasingly be used for extortion,” the police said in April. Most of the victims’ photographs appeared to have been obtained from public sources, said the police. Mr Chia warned that with readily available tools, “anyone can create deepfake content within minutes”. \"This can pose a significant threat to our social fabric. Unchecked, this can affect our public standing and those we love.” The number of people potentially at risk of image-based sexual abuse increases exponentially with the advent of generative AI, said AWARE’s Ms Sugidha. “Anyone who has had a photo of them posted online could be a possible victim. “This makes detecting deepfakes particularly challenging, especially for individuals who have never shared intimate images and may not be actively looking out for such misuse, thus allowing perpetrators to evade detection,” she added. Associate Professor Terence Sim of the National University of Singapore’s Centre for Trusted Internet and Community said AI-generated porn is “certainly a very pressing issue”. “The bad guys are really coming up with ways to exploit this and then scam people,” he said. “Various kinds (of people) - celebrities, politicians, even your normal man on the street. Ordinary folks like you and me.” There is a range of tools that can be used to generate obscene photos and videos of varying quality. It is possible to create a realistic deepfake video using just one high-resolution picture of the victim and a video that you want to superimpose the victim’s face onto, sometimes known as a “driving video”. In a Talking Point episode, Prof Sim showed how he used AI-powered face swapping tool FaceFusion to create a deepfake of host Steven Chia within minutes. “All I need is an actor that sort of looks like the victim,” he said. If the “driving video” shows an actor in a compromising position, it can be digitally manipulated to show the victim’s face instead of the actor’s face. Assoc Prof Sim said that as of now, most deepfakes are of “talking heads”, which refers to a close-up that focuses on the face of a target. “You don’t even need the full body. It’s very easy for an actor to create this. “Imagine, I want to fake Donald Trump, I can just wear clothes like Donald Trump, put the Oval Office or US flag behind me. That’s fairly easy to do.” Installing FaceFusion manually requires knowledge of programming language Python, and is “not for the faint hearted”, he said. But an automatic installer can be purchased for US$20. Once installed, the user interface is quite intuitive. Upload a picture and a video, and the AI does most of the work. There are sliders and buttons to make adjustments to the deepfake video to make it as realistic as possible. Those that are easier to use will likely produce less realistic results, he said. Mr Yip told CNA last month that the images in the letter were not sophisticated and low quality. It was in black and white and not well-rendered. But it would not take long for someone to pick up the skills required to create a better deepfake, including online. Associate Professor Cheung Ngai-Man of the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) estimated that it would take about a week to learn what is needed to create a fairly realistic deepfake. Face-swapping does not require specialised equipment either. A computer with “more high-end” specifications would allow a user to render these images to be more realistic, he said, adding that such computers are quite accessible. The technology is continually advancing, with real-time generation of deepfakes getting closer to reality. In April, Microsoft unveiled its VASA-1 program, which produces “lifelike audio-driven talking faces generated in real time”. It only needs one photo and a one-minute audio clip to generate a realistic talking head. Some other audio AI tools require much longer audio input of 10 to 15 minutes. The accessibility and ease with which deepfakes can be created is a concern for AI experts. “The truth is that these kind of tricks or blackmailing threats have been there ever since Photoshop came about, in fact maybe even earlier,” said SUTD’s Assistant Professor Roy Lee. “What is getting us worried is how easy (it is). Last time you might need to be a Photoshop expert to basically do it right and make it look realistic. “Right now, it’s just at the click of a button … it’s making things easier and it’s making things more realistic because generative AI is improving its performance,” he said. Add the fact that photos and videos are disseminated far and wide on the internet, and the concern becomes greater. “With all the positive things that come with the internet and generative AI, there is always a flipside,” he said. “If you’re abusing it then it’s more widespread, it’s more realistic.” How can people protect against their faces being used in deepfake porn? “Remove all your stuff from social media,” said NUS’ Assoc Prof Sim. “That’s certainly one way.” But he acknowledged that it was not something everyone could do. For some people – such as celebrities, influencers or small business owners – social media is their livelihood. Asst Prof Lee said that as people become more aware of deepfakes, they may decide to stay off social media and not post pictures or information about themselves. Some of his friends who are more conscious and tech savvy have already done so. They also steer clear of using their faces as their WhatsApp or Telegram profile pictures. Others are willing to accept the risk of posting their pictures online. “It’s an individual choice,” said Asst Prof Lee. The group he is concerned about are those who post their pictures online without being aware of the risks that come with generative AI. But as society becomes more educated on AI, people may realise how common deepfakes are. “I believe that people will get smarter and … if there’s a video circulating of a friend in a compromised position, no one will believe that,” he said. “If you reach that stage as a society, you become more aware of information verification, be more savvy about how information is created and all - then there is less worry.” Experts are also working on improving the detection of deepfakes. One way to do so is for people to use “invisible watermarks” on photos and videos. If the video or photo has been tampered with, analysis will reveal that the watermark has been broken and the contents are not to be trusted. While this could work to help protect trusted media entities, it is less useful in the context of AI-generated porn since people are less likely to watermark their personal photos. Mr Cory Wong, director at Invictus Law Corporation, said there is no law at the moment that is specific to AI. “It’s still always criminalising the human aspect of it, like what you did with that AI-generated image.” Clicking on the “generate” button would not be an offence, he said. But if the image generated is offensive, then possessing it would be an offence, said Mr Wong. “You don’t just generate it in a vacuum,” he said. “You generate it and then you store it somewhere.” People who possess obscene materials can be jailed for up to three months, fined, or both. Those caught transmitting obscene material face the same penalties. Mr Chooi Jing Yen, a criminal lawyer at Eugene Thuraisingam LLP, said possession of an obscene deepfake video could also be an offence under the Films Act. Offenders can be fined up to S$20,000 (US$15,000), jailed for up to six months, or both. He also said that obscene materials do not necessarily need to be human. \"I don’t think that the mere fact (that) it’s AI-created means that it can’t be (obscene),\" he added. Depending on the specifics of the case, there could be other charges. “A single act can attract a charge under extortion, it can also attract a charge under Section 377BA - it’s not specific to AI but it’s an offence or insulting somebody’s modesty by showing them a picture,” said Mr Chooi. “The offence could also be under the Protection of Harassment Act, so there are a few routes to it. But extortion is probably the harshest one because it does carry a mandatory minimum prison sentence.” Laws specific to deepfake AI pornography will soon be introduced in other countries. Australia’s federal government announced in May that it will introduce legislation to ban the creation and non-consensual distribution of deepfake pornography. The UK’s Ministry of Justice also announced in April a new law that criminalises the creation of sexually explicit deepfakes without consent. The new law also means that if the creator has no intent to share it but wants to “cause alarm, humiliation or distress to the victim”, they will also be prosecuted. Asked if there is a need to develop legislation for AI-related crimes in Singapore, Mr Chooi said that the technology is still evolving. “You wouldn’t want to be passing laws every month or every few years because the space moves very quickly. You end up with a very piecemeal kind of situation and people are also all confused,” he said. Mr Wong said that having specific laws might be good, but there may be too many things to cover. “It’s really the use of AI or the misuse of AI that is the problem, and I think it’s very difficult to try to legislate every single thing,” he said. There is also the potential problem of under-legislation, where the law is too wide. “And then you realise that actually (the) law is a bit defective,” he said. “Right now, with the existing (laws) - whether it’s Penal Code, whether it’s Miscellaneous Offences Act - they are sufficiently wide to capture all this, then maybe give it a bit more time to see how we will actually criminalise AI-related offences.” If there is some AI misuse not captured within Singapore's current legislation, that would be the tipping point to push for more legislation, Mr Wong added. Another scenario would be where the maximum sentences under existing provisions do not seem proportionate to the crime, according to Mr Chooi. In such a case, lawmakers may need to look into introducing new laws. “I think generally that requires a certain number of such cases to surface first,” he said. “When we punish people, and people are prosecuted and sentenced, one of the aims is general deterrence, which is to send a message to the public,” Mr Chooi added. “If it’s not that prevalent then there’s no strong reason to do that.” In response to CNA's queries, the Attorney-General’s Chambers said it has not prosecuted cases related to AI-generated pornography in Singapore. “Such offences are relatively new, made possible by the recent evolution of AI technology,” a spokesperson said. Although people are certainly generating obscene images, the lawyers said they have not personally encountered cases where someone is charged with doing so. When asked why this is the case, Mr Wong said it first needs to be reported to the authorities. He gave the example of someone superimposing a face onto a naked body. “Let’s say I don’t even know about it, or if anyone who sees it knows this is probably fake, then they may not take that first step of reporting it,” he said. Last year, a TikTok user named Rachel opened up about her harrowing experience of people using AI tools to generate fake nude images of her, before sending these pictures to her and other online users. She had received a direct message on Instagram containing fake nude images of her. The anonymous user had used photos on her public profile and ran them through a “deepfake AI program” to create the obscene pictures. In a TikTok video, she talked about receiving the message and said she had ignored it. She then received dozens of messages containing AI-generated nudes of herself, this time from other users. In a later video, she can be seen crying and asking her abusers to stop creating such images, calling them “rapists”. When CNA searched for her TikTok username on Google, she appeared to have taken down her account. Several porn websites also appear on the first page of the results. Dr Hanita of Alliance Counselling said that when someone’s photo has been misused, they may not know whether a crime has been committed and whether the police can help them. People around them may not be able to empathise or relate. “Then you start thinking, is what I’m going through real? Is it a big deal? Because the crime feels very distant, they take my photo and use it another way. Is it real? “But I will say it’s very real .... I think the person may not know how to go about reporting the crime, what else to do.” Some victims develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety or depression. The police told CNA that victim care officers, who have received training from police psychologists, can provide emotional and practical support to those who have been assessed to need it. Dr Hanita said some victims may feel ashamed and want to keep things to themselves, or end up blaming themselves. “The first thing is to remember that this is not your fault,” she said. “It’s your image and however you choose to use it, it has been used in another way. “Even if you take a sexy photo of yourself and put it (online), you choose that this photo be used in this way – the social media way – not to be used in another way.” Friends and family members can support victims emotionally and practically, such as by going with them to report the crime and helping to collect evidence to hand to the police. “Don’t chide the person. Respect them, provide empathy, compassion for what they are going through,” she said. “That can be very helpful and powerful.” She called on people to work together as well, by reporting images or accounts that seem suspicious, even if they do not know the person involved. “As a community, that’s what we can do to step up vigilance. To know that this is not okay, it’s not funny … for somebody’s images to be used in a sexual manner, or to put them down or humiliate them.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Business Business The retail investor advocacy group described OCBC’s privatisation bid for its insurance arm Great Eastern as having created a “dilemma to minority shareholders where they are not given a choice”. The directors of Singapore's Great Eastern have been advised to recommend that minority shareholders accept a S$1.4 billion offer from the insurer's top investor Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC). (File photos: CNA/Calvin Oh and Great Eastern) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Citing “unhappiness” among minority shareholders of Great Eastern, the Securities Investors Association Singapore (SIAS) has posed questions to OCBC about the bank’s privatisation bid for its insurance arm. Describing the offer as having created a “dilemma” for Great Eastern’s smaller investors, the retail investor watchdog on Friday (Jun 21) urged companies that intend to delist in future to “provide an offer price which is truly ‘fair and reasonable’ to all shareholders”. OCBC, Singapore’s second-biggest lender, on May 10 announced a S$1.4 billion (US$1.03 billion) offer to buy the 11.56 per cent stake in Great Eastern that it does not own, with the aim to delist the insurer. The bank made an offer price of S$25.60 per share, which it said represents a premium of 36.9 per cent over Great Eastern’s last traded price of S$18.70. Last week, Ernst & Young – the independent financial adviser appointed to the deal – described the terms of OCBC’s offer as “not fair but reasonable” . However, it advised Great Eastern’s independent directors to recommend that minority shareholders accept the offer. Following that, OCBC said in a separate statement that its offer price was “final” and extended the closing date of its offer to Jul 12. The bank’s statement “omitted any reference” to the independent financial adviser’s opinion, said SIAS founder-CEO David Gerald on Friday. He added that the retail investor watchdog has since received “numerous inquiries” from shareholders of Great Eastern “seeking clarity and transparency” from OCBC. Several long-term shareholders have also previously told SIAS, as well as in the public through media interviews, that “they will not accept (OCBC’s) offer because they feel that (Great Eastern) has been trading below the true value for the longest time”, said Mr Gerald. A group of about 125 minority shareholders, led by former remisier Ong Chin Woo, told CNA last week that they are “disappointed” with OCBC’s decision to not budge on its offer price. As such, Mr Gerald from SIAS hopes that OCBC’s board can “respond adequately” to the concerns of these minority shareholders. Questions included in a letter addressed to OCBC’s chairman Andrew Lee and members of the bank’s board on Friday include if the bank had considered the independent financial adviser’s opinion when it decided not to raise its offer price. Mr Gerald also asked for the key factors that led OCBC to its offer price, how the bank justifies what is perceived as an “unfair” offer and if the bank has received feedback from its own shareholders regarding the potential reputational risks arising from this deal. In the media statement, SIAS described OCBC’s offer as an example that has created a “dilemma to minority shareholders where they are not given a choice to make a decision due to terms of the offer”. “For example, if the company has acquired more than 90 per cent share holdings, it will be suspended for a period of time and shareholders who have not submitted their shares, regardless or not if they are agreeable to the offer price, will not be able to trade and their monies are locked up for a period of time,” wrote Mr Gerald. OCBC said it had received acceptances for 1.74 million shares, or 0.37 per cent of Great Eastern shares as of Jun 13. This raises its stake in the insurer to 89.01 per cent, a sliver below the 90 per cent threshold before trading in Great Eastern shares may be suspended. For a company to remain listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), at least 10 per cent of its shares must be held by the public. Such a trading suspension was also highlighted by the independent financial advisor as a risk for shareholders. However, the exchange’s delisting rule requires delisting offers to be both “reasonable” and “fair” in the opinion of the appointed independent financial adviser – for which OCBC’s offer does not qualify. This means that the remaining minority shareholders of Great Eastern “are now faced with the decision to accept an offer deemed unfair by the independent financial adviser, or potentially could find their hard-earned money locked up in an unlisted company for a long period of time”, said Mr Gerald. “As SIAS monitors the investors’ sentiment on this issue, it is hoped by (Great Eastern’s) shareholders that OCBC reconsiders its position in light of the independent financial adviser's findings and the spirit of fair dealings by a financial institution,” he added.

SINGAPORE: Three men have been arrested for allegedly using fake gold ingots to cheat a woman of S$4,000 (US$2,900), police said on Friday (Jun 21). Police received a report at about 3.15pm on Wednesday that a woman was cheated of her money after two men handed her the gold ingots for \"safekeeping\". Preliminary investigations revealed that the victim was approached by the two men along Tras Street at about 1pm on Wednesday, claiming they had found gold ingots during an excavation at an unknown site in Singapore. The men said that they wanted to send the gold ingots back to China but were unsure of the legal process. They then offered the gold ingots to the victim for \"safekeeping\" in exchange for cash as collateral. The men also produced a document in old Chinese writings that resembled an old will, along with a small gold ingot, police said. The victim brought the two men to a goldsmith shop along Eu Tong Sen Street to verify the authenticity of the small gold ingot. The piece was verified to be genuine. The two men then took back the genuine gold ingot and handed over the other gold ingots to the victim, telling her to pay S$4,000 as collateral. When the victim went back to the same goldsmith shop to authenticate the other gold ingots, they were found to be fake. She alerted the police after realising she had been scammed and that the two men had left the area. Police established the identity of the two men and arrested them along Aliwal Street on Thursday. Further investigations also led them to arrest an accomplice and seize more items, including more than 80 pieces of mini gold-coloured ingots, a piece of paper with Chinese writings and six gold-coloured mini Buddha statues. The three men, aged between 52 and 62, will be charged in court on Saturday for conspiring to cheat. If convicted, they may be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore URA is re-evaluating its stance on the Chinatown shophouse mural following recent public feedback. (Photo: Instagram/seanpdunston) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is re-evaluating its position over a Chinatown shophouse mural depicting a young samsui woman smoking, due to recent public feedback. The authority had earlier given the landlord a deadline to erase the cigarette from the artwork. In response to CNA's queries on Saturday (Jun 22), URA said that all proposals for murals on conserved buildings must be submitted to both the building owner and URA for approval before works can begin. However, the mural on the conserved shophouse at 297 South Bridge Road was completed without prior approval and URA said it had informed the building owner to submit the mural proposal for assessment. \"After consultation with local stakeholders and relevant agencies, the proposal was not supported as the depiction of smoking on the unauthorised mural is not aligned with Singapore’s anti-smoking policy,\" said URA. \"In light of recent public feedback, URA is re-evaluating its stance on the mural.\" The mural's artist Sean Dunston told CNA he was thankful that URA was taking another look at its decision, and he hopes that the authority will allow the mural to remain as it is now. He referenced an email from the authority asking the landlord to delay any work on the mural until its review is completed. \"It’s important that the public feedback (URA uses) to regulate images seen in public be more even-handed (or at least less offensive than the art it’s criticising) and that enforcement of policy regarding art, in particular, be more nuanced and geared towards supporting art and discussion,\" he said in response to queries. Singapore is home to more than 6,500 conserved shophouses, built between the early 1800s and mid-1900s. While many have been adapted to new uses, it is important that works to them do not change their architecture, according to guidelines published by URA in 2022. Murals are allowed on end gable walls of shophouses and must be “appropriate to the character of the area”. “They should not contain profanity, negative racial or religious implications,” URA said, adding that murals at other parts of a conserved building can be considered but are subject to evaluation. Permission must be sought before murals are painted on any conserved building. These come under Category 3 works, described by URA on its website as \"minimal and localised\" work. The application does not need to be made by a qualified person - such as a registered architect or professional engineer - and can be made by owners and contractors. A Category 3 application requires a letter of authorisation by the owner of the building, as well as a proposal for the work, such as a colour photo or floor plans and elevations. The application is free. URA said on its website that applicants can expect a reply within 10 working days. If the proposal is in order, URA will issue permission for the work. No work can be carried out before this permission is given. After the work is completed, photographs of it need to be submitted to URA. If everything is in order, the authority will issue a letter for endorsement of completed works. Other types of work may fall under Category 1 or 2. Category 1 works affect key elements and \"have a significant impact on the architectural character and spatial integrity\" of the buildings. Applications for such works need to be made by a registered architect. Category 2 works affect key elements \"to a lesser extent\". Applications must be made by a registered architect or a professional engineer. Besides the painting of murals, other types of Category 3 works include the addition or repositioning of business signs and the installation of air-conditioners and solar panels. The initial order by URA to erase the cigarette came to light after Mr Dunston highlighted the incident on Instagram two days ago, sparking plenty of debate and discussion online. His post went viral, garnering more than 3,000 likes as of Saturday morning, with many people leaving comments supportive of his work. The artist wrote in the post that he was told to \"get rid of the cigarette\" by Jul 3 and that he was \"thinking of alternatives that would be acceptable to URA\". He also said that he was told by URA that it had received feedback on the mural from a member of public, who found the mural \"offensive\" and \"disrespectful\" to samsui women. The person also said that the woman depicted in the mural \"looked more like a prostitute than a hardworking samsui woman\". While \"heartbroken\" by URA's initial order to revise the mural, both the landlord of 297 South Bridge Road and Mr Dunston will respect and comply with the government agency's final decision, the landlord's representative, Shepherd Asset Management, told CNA. URA informed the landlord on Friday night - the day the debate over the mural first appeared in the public sphere - that it would re-evaluate its stance. \"We commissioned the mural design with the intention to depict an uncensored and unique perspective of the hardworking Samsui woman,\" said a spokesperson for Shepherd Asset Management. \"We are heartened by the recent outpour of public support for our mural, and we hope that our mural can continue to serve as a poignant reminder of the challenges faced by the Samsui women and their invaluable contributions they made to Singapore's early development.\" A post shared by Sean Dunston (@seanpdunston) Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

(Photo: Facebook/Sentosa) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: \"Good progress\" had been made with oil spill clean-up efforts on Sentosa's beaches, the resort island said on Sunday (Jun 23). An oil spill occurred on Jun 14 after a Netherlands-flagged dredger hit a stationary bunker vessel, causing oil from the latter's damaged cargo tank to spill into the water. Following the incident, oil washed up along the coast of several beaches in Singapore, including those on Sentosa island and in East Coast Park. More than 140,000kg of oil-soaked sand has been removed from the Siloso, Palawan and Tanjong beaches since Jun 15, Sentosa said in a post on Facebook on Sunday afternoon. The Siloso Beach shoreline is \"largely cleaned now\", it added. In an update on Jun 20, Singapore's authorities said that a \"large majority\" of oil deposits on the beach at East Coast Park had been removed and the beaches at Tanah Merah were largely cleaned up . They also said that the beaches on three Singapore islands - St John's, Lazarus and Kusu - as well as a \"large majority\" of Sentosa's Siloso beach had been cleared of oily sand. Since Friday, workers on Sentosa have started been clearing oil on rock bunds and breakwaters, said the resort island on Sunday, adding that it was a \"challenging and time-consuming task\". \"These areas are harder to access than the shoreline, with uneven surfaces and oil slipping into boulder crevices,\" it said. Sentosa said that it is working with experts using specialised cleaning methods \"to thoroughly flush out the oil and clear it from the lagoon\". Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said on Jun 20 that clearing the oil from the rock bunds and breakwaters would be a \"complex process\" . \"The rock bunds are not as accessible as beach shorelines and their surfaces are uneven. Oil that has slipped into the boulder crevices also needs to be thoroughly flushed out, and oil within the lagoon needs to be removed,\" she had said. Visitors to beachfront dining spots and attractions can still enjoy access to Sentosa's beaches, the resort island said on Sunday. CNA has contacted Sentosa for more information.

Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, in this screengrab from his Youtube video, urges Singaporeans to celebrate every kind of success and respect all forms of work. (Image: Youtube/Lawrence Wong) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Widening the definition of success and building a society that leaves room for experiments and pauses so that Singaporeans can strive to be the best possible versions of themselves. This is what Prime Minister Lawrence Wong hopes to achieve as he outlined his vision for the country, in a video message to Singaporeans on Saturday (Jun 22). \"My team and I want to build a society that allows space for u-turns, side steps, slowdowns, pauses, experimentations and outliers,\" he said. \"We want to broaden our concept of achievement. Beyond academic credentials, we are taking proactive steps to value the contributions of every worker in every profession and every field. \"I need your help to do more as a society. Let us make a commitment to one another,\" Mr Wong added, as he urged Singaporeans to celebrate every kind of success, respect all forms of work and never be afraid to try. In the six-minute-long clip, Mr Wong said that one topic that often came up in his interactions with Singaporeans is \"the Singapore dream\", and what success means for Singaporeans as a people. He recalled the 5Cs - cash, car, credit card, condo, country club - that success was perceived to be in the past. Such a narrow definition of success can lead to negative consequences, he added, as society becomes more frenetic and competition more toxic as people seek to outdo each other. It results in Singaporeans becoming more anxious and stressed, and passing it on to their children. This, he said, is not the society that he wants Singapore to become and certainly not one that he hopes future generations grow up in. \"I want to see a Singapore where every Singaporean matters, where everyone is valued for who he or she is. One where we can all strive to be the best possible versions of ourselves. One where our success is defined by how we help each other to do well collectively,\" he said. Mr Wong also admitted that looking back on his own career, he too felt the \"same pressure to compete and compare with others\". At one point, he was tempted to leave the government but he then met mentors who inspired him to stay in the public service and helped him find purpose in his work. Hearing similar feedback from young Singaporeans, he said some have told him that they don't want their self-worth and success to be defined by narrow metrics of academic and material achievements. \"So as we refresh our Singapore dream, let us also redefine what success should mean for Singapore. I have a few suggestions,\" he said. \"As a society we have become used to attaching prestige to some professions. We should open our minds and embrace the different ways people can flourish. \"We are happy for our young talents and super achievers but we should equally embrace our late bloomers and and those who get their second wind after a series of failures and setbacks.\" Using the healthcare sector during the pandemic as an example, he said that unsung heroes such as nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and radiographers should be celebrated as much as doctors. \"Success is about excelling at what we do today, persevering at it and doing it with pride instead of worrying about status or rewards,\" he added. While some will choose a slower pace of work to make more time for their families, others may aspire to move up the career ladder or pursue business ventures. Stressing that each path is different, he urged Singaporeans to appreciate what they have and revel in the success of others, as it is \"not a zero-sum race\". Redefining the metrics of success is a recurring theme for Mr Wong, who was sworn in as Singapore's Prime Minister last month, taking over from Mr Lee Hsien Loong, who is now Senior Minister. During an interview with the Singapore media just before the leadership transition, he spoke about \"embracing these different, multiple pathways of success\" in a \"society and system where every job is respected\". At the launch of the Forward Singapore Festival last October, he also said that the \"Singapore Dream\" is no longer solely about material success.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore A sous chef tells CNA that out of 10 eateries he's worked at, seven have had food safety lapses. F&B insiders give their take on why food poisoning cases still persist in Singapore and occur at all kinds of establishments. (Illustration: CNA/Clara Ho) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Hours after Ms Gillian Lim ate tofu fries from a street food kiosk in Singapore, her stomach started churning \"like a washing machine\". Then came the nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in what she described as the worst episode of food poisoning in all of her 31 years. Nearly everyone would have experienced some form of gastroenteritis from consuming spoilt food and beverages, or coming into contact with contaminated surfaces or people. Despite strict regulations and enforcement in Singapore, outbreaks have persisted, with cases cutting across all types of food establishments. In recent months, higher-end dining outlets have made headlines in this area, with outbreaks reported at Chinese eatery Peach Garden and Pan Pacific Hotel's Edge buffet restaurant . Statistics from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) since its formation in 2019 showed that the number of major gastroenteritis incidents have fluctuated from year to year. These are defined by the statutory board as \"incidents with significant severity and impact\". SFA recorded 60 such cases in 2019, 48 in 2021, 57 in 2022 and 44 last year. There were only 12 in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic putting a stop to dining in. SFA also tracks the number of people affected in foodborne outbreaks involving 15 or more. This is presented as an average per 100,000 population. There were 21.6 such cases in 2019, 25.6 in 2021, 21.2 in 2022 and 22.5 last year. Similarly, 2020 saw a lower than average number - 7.8 - due to the pandemic. All 2023 figures are provisional as they include cases pending investigations. \"The number of foodborne illness cases related to foodborne outbreaks has been kept low,\" said SFA in response to CNA's queries. \"In 2023, despite an increase in the number of both retail and non-retail food establishments, the number of foodborne illness cases and major gastroenteritis incidents were lower than in 2022.\" Cases publicised by SFA in the last five years showed that gastroenteritis outbreaks often occur for reasons related to poor food handling, personal hygiene or housekeeping, manifested through filthy premises, ill-maintained equipment or pest infestations. SFA mandates that all food retail establishments be licensed for operation . Food handlers must be registered and attend a course on food safety and refreshers. One of the most notorious food poisoning cases in Singapore involved the Spize restaurant back in 2018, when 45 people were hospitalised after eating bento sets at a company event. One died of sepsis and multi-organ failure after acute gastroenteritis. Strains of salmonella bacteria were found at Spize's now-defunct River Valley Road outlet, along with faecal matter on food and kitchen tools, suggesting poor hygiene practices. Seven out of 34 food handlers there were also unregistered and had not attended the basic food hygiene course. Last year, two Bedok outlets under Spize were fined for food safety lapses leading to another gastroenteritis outbreak. The restaurants did not properly separate raw and cooked food; and failed to provide hand soap for washing. Industry insiders with more than 10 years of kitchen experience told CNA that sub-standard food safety practices were common at their past workplaces. They declined to be fully named for fear of reprisal from former employers. One sous chef, Mr Lee, said that out of 10 eateries he's worked at, seven have had lapses that boiled down to a lack of manpower, time or funding. For instance, in smaller businesses with tighter budgets, washing and cleaning duties sometimes fall to the chef. This one person would have to prepare and cook the food as well as wash the dishes and kitchen, \"with very little time to properly clean up\", said Mr Lee, who's in his early 30s. \"During busy periods, the chef will be rushed to (put) out the food faster, which might (result in) mistakes ... for example cutting ready-to-eat food on a raw food chopping board.\" He has also witnessed employees being asked to wash kitchens during operating hours, while food is being prepared or cooked at the same time. \"There might be cross contamination when chemicals or soap accidentally go into the food,\" said Mr Lee, who started out as kitchen assistant 15 years ago. Another sous chef, 38-year-old Ms Goh, said businesses sometimes mass-hire part-time service staff using social media platforms, and with no clear indication of whether these hires will be handing food directly. As a result, those hired might not have undergone the mandated food safety course. The co-owner of a bistro, who only wanted to be known as Mr Singh, pointed out that \"not everyone comes into Singapore with a food handling cert\". \"Usually we get people from Malaysia. And to train them ... that's where you've got to keep being on the ground (and) hands-on most of the time for the first month or so, to switch them from how they used to do things back there to how we want to do things at my location,\" said the 37-year-old. \"Food hygiene is number one, Singapore is a small country, once you go viral on social media, it's a downfall.\" Still, well-trained employees are no guarantee of high standards. Mr Lee recalled how another chef - at an eatery he worked at years ago - would clean tables with the same cloth he used to wipe his shoes. \"Once I saw that, I stopped eating the food he made.\" Some eateries, including the Burger & Lobster at Jewel Changi Airport , have also been taken to task over infrastructural issues such as cracked kitchen tiles or peeling wall paint. Paint chips or flakes can fall into preparation areas and potentially contaminate food, said the Singapore Institute of Technology's (SIT) capability development lead of food technology Mabel Wang. Microbes can also hide in cracks and crevices; these are difficult to clean and lead to dirt, water and food debris accumulating, in turn fostering the growth of bacteria, mould or fungi, she added. A former owner of a Thai casual dining eatery in Singapore's north told CNA how his business was plagued by pests, despite daily efforts to clean and wash the premises. \"We were opposite a forested area, which resulted in many rodents entering the shop. This was despite having an ongoing pest control plan mandated by SFA,\" said the man, who declined to be identified. \"We had several sauces which contained fermented ingredients like fish sauce, and these attracted cockroaches as well.\" He shuttered his restaurant earlier in 2024, after three years of operations. Bistro co-owner Mr Singh also pointed to the importance of picking certified food suppliers. \"Food hygiene for me, it's a whole supply chain from your supplier to how you store to how you prepare; it's the entire process.\" A study published this year found that caterers, restaurants and in-house kitchens topped the list for gastroenteritis outbreaks in Singapore between 2018 and 2021. In that period, 51 foodborne outbreaks were from caterers, 18 from restaurants and 15 from in-house kitchens. Food courts and hawker centres only recorded one and two outbreaks respectively. In 2021, Singapore had around 4,800 restaurants and about 750 caterers, according to figures by the Department of Statistics. The study - conducted jointly by the SFA, the Ministry of Health, National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University - defined an outbreak as two or more cases of gastroenteritis symptoms linked to a food establishment. The way caterers operate can be directly linked to their higher number of gastroenteritis outbreaks, according to the study. This includes undercooking due to cooking in bulk and prolonged storage of food at ambient temperatures, it said, advising that food be cooked in smaller batches instead. Restaurants, on the other hand, typically have better access to resources and can invest in quality ingredients, modern equipment, and professional staff. But such larger operations can also lead to oversight on intricate processes, said SIT's Dr Wang. They handle big volumes of food preparation and service simultaneously, increasing the risk of contamination if protocols are not followed. They may also prepare and hold food in advance, unlike hawker and coffee shop stalls. These smaller businesses, meanwhile, may lack the resources to carry out regular hygiene maintenance, said Dr Wang. But the sous chef Ms Goh pointed out that hawkers have a better overview. \"They clean (the equipment) themselves, they know where to put it and maintain,\" she said. \"The hawker or the owner is a cook, a chef, a steward. He plays four, five roles by himself.\" In contrast, a restaurant chef would not know if the knife he was using was washed by the person who used it the day before. Hawkers also work in spaces visible to the public, which could encourage them to maintain hygiene standards, while restaurants typically have kitchens behind closed doors, Ms Goh noted. One business, How's Catering, shared with CNA the extent of measures it takes to ensure food safety. According to managing director Lyor Loh Chee Hua, among other steps, it designates kitchen spaces for specific functions; gets staff to ensure that delivered food is consumed within four hours of cooking; and sends samples to a lab to check for pathogens monthly. Samples will be from food, water, ice and surface and hand swabs. Weekly in-house hygiene refresher sessions are also held for kitchen staff. But the job is becoming increasingly challenging for the caterer, which was founded in 1991. Excessive heat in increasingly hot weather, for example, has in turn upped the risk of bacteria growth on food. Training employees also requires significant investment, but retaining them is not a given when faced with competitors offering more attractive salaries and perks, said Mr Loh, who also pointed to quota limitations on hiring. The Association of Catering Professionals Singapore said the same. \"The shortage of skilled labour and reliance on part-time food handlers, who may not have a vested interest in compliance, can contribute to food safety risks,\" a spokesperson said. Other businesses, like Mr Singh's bistro, pointed to how they engage companies to do deep cleaning at least every six months. Professional deep cleaning requires training as it involves using specialised equipment and detergent on top of identifying areas that need particular cleaning like degreasing. Director of One Heart Cleaning firm Lim Tze Wei described deep cleaning as going beyond superficial cleaning to reach neglected areas not visible to the human eye. His company counts local coffee franchises, Michelin-starred restaurants and hawker stalls among its clients. One particular restaurant, decorated with tall bamboo poles, takes eight hours to clean, said Mr Lim. Some businesses avoid the downtime needed for deep cleaning as it can be viewed as an opportunity cost, Mr Lim added. \"Ultimately, it boils down to whether they are open to spending the additional cost,\" he said. \"Let's say they don't want to do it during operating hours, they also have to station (an employee on standby) there, so the cost is on their hands.\" One Heart Cleaning's services cost anywhere from S$300 to more than S$3,000 per session, depending on the scale of the cleaning. In addition to cleaning, training and other food safety measures, businesses could also offer employees rewards or recognition for compliance, SIT's Dr Wang suggested. On a regulatory level, the government can continuously update and enforce food safety regulations, while conducting regular inspections and audits. The authorities can also facilitate collaboration between agencies, industry experts and academia to address emerging risks, and keep educating both consumers and businesses about food safety, Dr Wang said. But she concluded that it would be challenging to completely eradicate food poisoning in a country where food is a \"way of life\". For all the training and protocols put in place, human error can never be entirely eliminated, and mistakes leading to contamination can still be made, Dr Wang noted. Business owners agreed. \"At the end of the day, no matter how much you try your best ... sometimes there are certain things that are unseen,\" said Mr Singh, adding that diners' stomachs also have different thresholds for what they can handle. The veteran kitchen insiders shared with CNA some red flags, which they too look out for when dining out themselves. To Ms Goh, mould or dust in a restaurant's premises signal an area not well-maintained. A chef with stained attire also indicates poor housekeeping or hygiene. To Mr Lee, one or two cockroaches in a dining area is enough of a turn-off. \"There's a high chance the kitchen is already full of it.\" For patrons who still end up with food poisoning, the course of action is clear, according to Ms Lim. \"It was just pure misery,\" she said of her episode with the tarnished tofu fries. \"After that, I never ate from there ever again.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo TOKYO :Japan's banking regulator on Monday ordered the banking and securities units of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) to improve compliance measures after the securities watchdog found multiple breaches of \"firewall\" regulations. The penalties come less than two years after the securities arm of rival megabank Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group was indicted on market manipulation charges, for which it was ordered to halt the offending business line and improve compliance. The Financial Services Agency, which hands out such penalties, ordered each of the MUFG units to establish the causes of the breaches and submit business improvement plans to prevent recurrences. The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission recommended in mid-June that MUFG Bank and the group's two securities tie-ups with Morgan Stanley be penalised for the unauthorised sharing of client information. Its investigation found at least 26 occasions where confidential information had been shared between MUFG Bank and one of the group's two securities firms - Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities and Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. It also found that MUFG Bank had offered preferential lending rates to clients that did business with the two securities brokerages. Japan's \"firewall\" regulations prohibit banks and securities companies in the same group from sharing customer data with one another without the customer's consent. MUFG said in a statement that it fully accepted the penalties and planned to submit the business improvement plans to the FSA.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Vietnam’s gains from hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to pale in comparison to the expected benefits of courting other powers. However, sentiment can play a role in international relations, says ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute's Hoang Thi Ha. SINGAPORE: Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Jun 19-20 state visit to Vietnam, at the invitation of Vietnamese Communist Party General-Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, is intriguing for many watchers of Vietnam’s foreign policy. What does Hanoi stand to gain from welcoming Putin - who is now under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes against Ukraine? Isolated and condemned internationally for his invasion of Ukraine, Putin is seeking solace and support in Russia’s few remaining allies - with China , North Korea , Iran and Myanmar among them. His visit to Hanoi would bolster Moscow’s narrative that it remains a welcomed power in Southeast Asia. Yet the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute’s 2024 State of Southeast Asia survey ranks Russia near the bottom in terms of strategic relevance to ASEAN. Russian propaganda will likely tout this visit as a diplomatic victory over the US, to signal that Vietnam has not completely gone over to its side. Washington views Hanoi as a priority Southeast Asian partner in its Indo-Pacific strategy and has advanced US-Vietnam ties to historically unprecedented levels in recent years. Meanwhile, the gains for Hanoi from welcoming Putin are harder to discern. Vietnamese leadership, notably General-Secretary Trong, may perceive his “ bamboo diplomacy ” - which emphasises flexibility and balanced relations with all powers - as being further validated through Putin’s visit. Last year, Trong hosted both US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, deftly navigating Vietnam’s position as both a “frontline state” in the Indo-Pacific and a “well-behaved comrade” of China. Trong might view Putin’s visit as another feather in his “bamboo diplomacy” cap, hence his invitation to the Russian leader. Putin’s presence in Hanoi could also garner applause from a segment of Vietnamese society that holds a deep fondness for Russia. Many still feel nostalgic for the Soviet Union and grateful for its support to Vietnam during the wars against the French and Americans. Some are extremely enamoured with Putin as an anti-Western symbol and a strongman leader, a phenomenon coined locally as “Putin-mania” . Such pro-Russian sentiments have been stoked further by Vietnamese-language Russian propaganda prevalent on social media. Besides sentimental attachments and the leadership’s political consideration, tangible benefits for Vietnam from Putin’s visit are elusive. Bilateral trade stood at US$3.6 billion in 2023, half of the 2021 figure and a mere fraction of Vietnam’s trade with China (US$171 billion), the US (US$111 billion) and EU (US$72 billion). In 2023, Russian tourists, once among the top 10 sources of foreign visitors to Vietnam, dropped to only 19 per cent of the 2019 (pre-COVID 19 pandemic) figure. The prospects of furthering economic ties are dim, given the US tightening sanctions against Russia. The only exception may be in the energy sector, as Vietnam still pins its hopes on Russia’s continued participation in its hydrocarbon projects in the South China Sea amid China’s intensifying obstruction. Additionally, Vietnamese investments in Russian oil and gas reserves through Rusvietpetro - a joint venture between state-owned Zarubezhneft and Petrovietnam - are reaping profits with Russian tax concessions. In the arms trade, where Russia matters the most to Vietnam, Russia’s reliability as a defence partner is increasingly in question as its defence industry looks towards Chinese, North Korean and Iranian support to sustain its war machine in Ukraine. Even before the war in Ukraine, Vietnam had begun to diversify its arms supply, and this trend is likely to accelerate. Russian arms transfers to Vietnam have steadily decreased since peaking at around US$1 billion in 2014, plunging further after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to only US$72 million in 2022. Hanoi may also argue that Putin’s visit demonstrates its strategic autonomy amid Vietnam’s burgeoning relationships with the US and US allies, notably Japan and Australia. Vietnam recently upgraded its relations with these countries to Comprehensive Strategic Partnerships. So far, these powers have fostered warm relations with Vietnam as they appreciate its strategic value in their Indo-Pacific strategies despite Hanoi’s continued efforts to maintain good ties with Russia. These countries may quietly acknowledge that Russian arms remain crucial for Vietnam to maintain some modicum of deterrence against China’s ambitions in the South China Sea. Yet, as Hanoi rolls out the red carpet for Putin, the optics may be too stark for the above countries, which could potentially lead to their rethinking of Vietnam’s reliability as a strategic partner in the region. While Vietnam is not directly aiding Russia’s war efforts, its warm reception of Putin could be perceived as lending foreign legitimacy to his regime and undermining US-led international efforts to oppose Russia’s war in Ukraine. Indeed, Putin’s war against Ukraine blatantly violates fundamental international legal principles - respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity - which Vietnam considers sacrosanct. Big powers often apply double standards in international law because they can, often with minimal penalty. However, for small states like Vietnam, consistency in upholding international law serves not only as a matter of principle but also as a crucial defence against the arbitrary actions of more powerful nations. Kyiv will also feel the chill from Putin’s presence in Hanoi. Enduring a tumultuous history marked by repeated aggressions from larger powers and currently grappling with China’s looming threat in the South China Sea, Vietnam could arguably have shown greater empathy for Ukraine, a fellow small state facing aggression from a larger power. Yet, while engaging in summit-level talks with Russia, Vietnam has so far interacted with Ukraine only at the foreign minister level at the sidelines of ASEAN gatherings. Vietnam’s foreign policy for the past two decades has been lauded for its pragmatism. However, Putin’s visit to Hanoi underscores that pragmatism is not the sole or primary guiding principle. Factors such as risk aversion, path dependency, and sentimental attachments to a foreign power also influence the Vietnamese elite’s decisions, which are not always based on a rational cost-benefit calculus. While Russia’s value to Vietnam lies more in the past than in the present and future, Putin’s “memory diplomacy” still has some mileage in Vietnam.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary China is targeting pork imported from the European Union in a tit-for-tat trade spat, in response to curbs on its electric vehicle exports. Poultry and beef could be next, says Andy Bounds for the Financial Times. BRUSSELS: China has hit the EU’s soft underbelly in its fight over electric vehicle imports: Pork. Poultry and beef could be next - especially chicken feet and other bits that Europeans do not tend to eat, but depend on selling. It is a telling choice by Beijing. Food and drink are these days among the few products that China buys more of than it sells to the bloc, and they have been the first in the line of fire as Beijing retaliates over antisubsidy tariffs of up to 38 per cent on electric cars. This shift underlines how the EU-China trade relationship has been turned on its head since Beijing joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. China has moved up the value chain fast, becoming a research and development powerhouse at the centre of global supply chains. Its trade surplus with Europe has ballooned in advanced equipment such as batteries, solar panels and cell phones. The EU, meanwhile, still sells lots of cars and aircraft. But increasingly its strength is serving China’s 1.4 billion consumers with more traditional consumer fare: Cheese, wine and handbags. The trade defence team in China’s fearsome commerce ministry are not just experts at feisty rhetoric. They have laser sights trained on vulnerable areas of the EU body politic, where one shot can trigger howls heard very quickly in parliaments and therefore governments. The target chosen was an antidumping investigation into EU pork imports worth €2.5 billion (US$2.68 billion) a year, including offcuts that feature in Chinese cuisine. Farmers, a particularly vocal and influential pressure group with form on noisy protests , know they have few other alternative markets. Some animals are only profitable because the farmer can sell the “fifth quarter” - such as the head, tail and internal organs - to the Chinese. Chicken feet, thrown into the bin in many a French boucherie , are a particular delicacy. Beijing has already opened an investigation into alleged dumping of brandy that would mainly hit France, which pressed European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen to levy the vehicle tariffs. Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, a director of the European Centre for International Political Economy in Brussels, said the choice of pork, which impacts Germany, could be “a personal attack against von der Leyen”. He also expected “retaliation in dairy, cheeses and other food items that are typical export staples for France and Italy”. The trade surplus in food and drink was around €6 billion in 2023, a sixfold increase in a decade. In that time European farmers have increased their flocks to serve this burgeoning market as domestic subsidies are cut back. John Clarke, the former chief agricultural trade negotiator for the European Commission, said the Chinese were well aware of the sensitivities after more than a year of farm protests over falling incomes. He thinks drinks could come next. Removing these barriers will also come at a price. “When a European leader goes to Beijing to get the market reopened for steak they have to give a gift in return,” Clarke said. “We sell them the port of Piraeus (in Greece), they buy feta cheese and yoghurt.” The problem for Brussels is that there is not much the EU could block in return. It is almost totally reliant on Chinese solar panels and does not want to increase the cost of going green. It also needs Chinese-made batteries for its own electric vehicles. Under US pressure, the Netherlands has ended exports of advanced chipmaking machines, but cutting supplies of Hermès scarves is unlikely to bring the Chinese economy to its knees. Guillaume Derrien, economist at BNP Paribas, points out that the days of Europe just buying cheap Chinese toys are long gone. “They now import more phones and motor vehicles: These two segments accounted for 17 per cent of EU imports from China in 2023,” he wrote in a recent note. China has gone by the book with the pork investigation, which leaves it open to an appeal at the WTO if it determines there are subsidies. A more ruthless alternative would be to hit European products for allegedly falling short of food safety standards. China banned beef from many EU countries for more than 20 years after a foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001, for example. Some pork has been blocked since 2019 because of African swine fever. There are limits to how much China can use pork for leverage in trade disputes. “Food is too important to be taken hostage,” Clarke said. “It would be very short-sighted as they are not self-sufficient.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary Nanoparticles have been found in the brain, heart and lungs of humans, but there is no evidence that they can cross the placenta and get into the human embryo, say these researchers from Leiden University. Person holding microplastic gathered from the ocean in his hand. (Photo: iStock/Svetlozar Hristov) This audio is generated by an AI tool. LEIDEN, The Netherlands: The world is becoming clogged with plastic. Particles of plastic so tiny they cannot be seen with the naked eye have been found almost everywhere, from the oceans’ depths to the mountain tops. They are in the soil, in plants, in animals and they are inside us. The question is: What harm, if any, are they causing? When plastic trash is dumped in a landfill or the sea, it breaks down, very slowly. Sunlight and waves cause the surface of the plastic to become brittle, and particles are shed into the environment. Collectively known as “small plastic particles”, they range in size from 5mm or smaller (microplastics) to less than one-thousandth of a millimetre (nanoplastics). The smallest can only be detected with special scientific instruments. It remains unclear how microplastics and nanoplastics get inside living things, but several entry points have been suggested. For example, they might pass through the gut from food or drink contaminated with small plastic particles. Or they may be breathed in or absorbed through the skin. Our research suggests that, for some animals at least, nanoplastics are bad news. We injected plastic nanoparticles into chicken embryos. We found that the particles travelled quickly in the blood to all tissues, especially the heart, liver and kidneys. They were also excreted by the embryonic kidneys. We noticed, too, that plastic nanoparticles tend to stick to a certain type of stem cell in the embryo. These cells are essential for the normal development of the nervous system and other structures. Any damage to stem cells could put the development of the embryo in jeopardy. We suspect that the chicken embryo stem cells have substances on their surface, called cell-adhesion molecules, which stick to the polystyrene nanoparticles that we used. We are following up this finding, because when nanoplastics stick to cells and get inside them, they can cause cell death and even serious birth defects in chickens and mice. Similar studies cannot, of course, be carried out on people, so it is not yet possible to say what the implications of our animal research are for humans. What we do know is that nanoplastics are found in the blood of human beings, in other bodily fluids and several major organs and key body tissues. In recent years, microplastics and nanoplastics have been found in the brains, hearts and lungs of humans. They have been discovered in the arteries of people with arterial disease, suggesting they may be a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease. And they have been detected in breast milk, the placenta and, most recently, penises. Chinese researchers reported earlier this year that they had found microplastics in human and dog testes. More recently, another Chinese team found microplastics in all 40 samples of human semen they tested. This follows an Italian study that found microplastics in six out of 10 samples of human semen. Our fear is that microplastics and nanoplastics might act in a similar way to deadly asbestos fibres. Like asbestos, they are not broken down in the body and can be taken up into cells, killing them and then being released to damage yet more cells. But there is a need for caution here. There is no evidence that nanoplastics can cross the placenta and get into the human embryo. Also, even if nanoplastics do cross the placenta, and in sufficient numbers to damage the embryo, we would expect to have seen a big increase in abnormal pregnancies in recent years. That is because the problem of plastic waste in the environment has been growing enormously over the years. But we are not aware of any evidence of a corresponding, large increase in birth defects or miscarriages. That, for now, is reassuring. It may be that microplastics and nanoplastics, if they do cause harm to our bodies, do so in a subtle way that we have not yet detected. Whatever the case, scientists are working hard to discover what the risks might be. One promising avenue of research would involve the use of human placental tissue grown in the laboratory. Special artificial placenta tissues, called trophoblast organoids, have been developed for studying how harmful substances cross the placenta. Researchers are also investigating potentially beneficial uses for nanoplastics. Although they are not yet licensed for clinical use, the idea is that they could be used to deliver drugs to specific body tissues that need them. Cancer cells could, in this way, be targeted for destruction without damaging other healthy tissue. Whatever the outcome of nanoplastics research, we and many other scientists will continue trying to find out what nanoplastics are doing to ourselves and the environment.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary With cases against Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leaders, the ICC has its best ever opportunity for relevance, says Simon Kuper for the Financial Times. The office of ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan has warned against attempts to intimidate its staff (Photo: AFP/Luis ACOSTA) PARIS: It’s a quiet morning at the International Criminal Court (ICC), tucked in behind the dunes in The Hague. The day I visited there was only one suspect on trial, sitting in a small courtroom behind bulletproof glass: Mahamat Said, charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Central African Republic. Statistically speaking, Said was desperately unlucky to be here. The ICC was founded in 2002 as the world’s first ever permanent court for what are collectively known as “atrocity crimes”. It has since “jailed just five war criminals”, all from sub-Saharan African countries, writes Chris Stephen in his new book The Future Of War Crimes Justice. He says the ICC risks becoming “a nice idea that didn’t work”. Yet the court now has its best ever opportunity for relevance. Its chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has ordered Russian President Vladimir Putin’s arrest on charges of war crimes. Last month, Khan requested arrest warrants for I srael’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , its defence minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas’ three main leaders. Meanwhile, South Africa has brought a case before the ICC’s sister court, the International Court of Justice, accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza . Might The Hague finally become a serious force against atrocity crimes? Or could other courts better play that role? The ICC’s prosecutors haven’t always been bywords for efficiency. To quote from a recent bulletin about Uganda: “The Prosecutor opened an investigation in July 2004. On 1 December 2023, the Prosecutor announced that the investigation phase in the Uganda situation has been concluded.” No Ugandan suspects are in custody. But this isn’t entirely the ICC’s fault. Like most international institutions nowadays, it’s underfunded. If there’s a murder down the road in The Hague, 25 Dutch officials might investigate. The ICC might have a couple of investigators for multiple suspected mass atrocities in a huge territory where they cannot safely travel. It’s up to states to arrest suspects. And only 124 states, most of them peaceable or weak, are members of the ICC. The US, China, Russia and Israel are not. In theory, the ICC’s indictments could shame countries suspected of atrocities. Unfortunately, there is no “international community” with a shared voice that will put pressure on transgressors. Friends of Russia, Israel or Hamas can dismiss the ICC as biased. Russian officials threatened to fire missiles at it. Netanyahu, predictably, has called Khan antisemitic. The Guardian newspaper and two Israeli magazines report that Israel has waged a “nine-year ‘war’” against the ICC, including hacking and smearing of court officials. I left The Hague sceptical that the ICC will prosecute many more atrocities. But I’m hopeful that other forces will. That’s because the ICC matters less as a court than as the convener of a growing global movement against atrocity crimes. Perpetrators run a rising risk of being tried somewhere – just not in The Hague. Over two dozen countries now claim some form of “universal jurisdiction” to prosecute atrocities committed anywhere on Earth. The United States, with its mighty judicial system, joined their ranks last year. There are ever more universal jurisdiction trials, such as Switzerland’s recent jailing of a former Liberian warlord who had moved to Lausanne. Then there are national tribunals in former killing fields from Bangladesh to Colombia, which can prosecute far more local perpetrators than the ICC ever could. Now, the growing numbers of lawyers who work on atrocity crimes are advising Ukraine. Crucially, Ukrainians are gathering evidence while crimes happen, says Kip Hale of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group for Ukraine. One day, perpetrators might be tried. The model is the conviction of Khmer Rouge leaders in the 2010s for the Cambodian genocide of the 1970s. This was possible because Yale University and the Documentation Center for Cambodia had collected evidence. Another type of war criminal may start facing justice: The corporate executive. Sweden is prosecuting two former executives of the company formerly known as Lundin Oil, for allegedly aiding war crimes in Sudan. It’s the first case against corporate bosses since Nuremberg, writes Stephen. Countries suspected of committing atrocities also face blowback from at least some quarters. The accusations of Israeli genocide surely encouraged Spain, Norway and Ireland – plus Britain’s likely next government – to recognise Palestine. Putin, Netanyahu and the Hamas leaders probably won’t ever be tried for atrocities, but then the Khmer Rouge leaders didn’t expect to be. Regimes and the world can change unpredictably. Already, war criminals sleep less soundly than before.

    "article_content": "Commentary Commentary A handful of US retailers are paying store leaders six-figure salaries and providing stock incentives. The investment is paying off, says Andrea Felsted for Bloomberg Opinion. LONDON: After being on the frontline of the pandemic, then grappling with an edgy public and a spike in shoplifting, it’s been a tough few years to work retail. But for Walmart managers, at least, things are looking up. In January, the American company announced that it would significantly boost store managers’ pay. They will now receive annual stock grants of as much as US$20,000. Average base salaries were raised to US$128,000 a year, from US$117,000. The retailer has also changed the way it calculates bonuses: It will continue to evaluate sales, but the profit generated by a manager’s store will play a bigger role, motivating the leaders to improve performance. If a manager hits all targets, they could earn a bonus of up to 200 per cent of base salary. All told, a successful manager of a high-performing store could now pass the US$500,000 mark, according to Bloomberg News. That’s far more than the typical pay of a US store manager, which is around US$100,000 per year (though those running complex locations are frequently paid more). Although the announcement raised analyst eyebrows, it’s a smart move for Walmart – and given that the company’s influence as the world’s biggest retailer, could be good for society too. It made the change to hold onto key managers, who are especially important at Walmart’s Supercenters, which can be as big to 200,000 sq ft and stock more than 100,000 product lines. But the pay bump can help in other ways, too. Walmart has been attracting more higher-income consumers as middle-class families have seen their incomes squeezed by inflation. One of the simplest ways to keep them coming back is to get the retail basics right: Keep the fresh produce appealing, shelves stocked and aisles clean. Motivated managers can make a difference. Unsurprisingly, better paid workers tend to be happier workers, according to human resources analytics company Revelio Labs. There’s evidence this contentment can boost company and stock performance. In a 2012 study, Alex Edmans, Professor of Finance at the London Business School (then at Wharton School), found that firms on Fortune’s list of 100 Best Companies to Work for in America, which have superior employee satisfaction scores on factors including pay and benefits, outperformed peers by 2.3 per cent to 3.8 per cent per year from 1984 through 2011. A follow-up by Hamid Boustanifar, associate professor at the EDHEC Business School, and Young Dae Kang of the Bank of Korea found that the relationship still held: Companies on the publication’s list earned an excess return of 2 per cent to 2.7 per cent per year through 2020, with particular outperformance during tough times. In the case of Walmart, shares are up almost 30 per cent this year. Of course, the changes to mangers’ remuneration happened only six months ago. But there is a good chance that they contributed to its better-than-expected first quarter. Costco Wholesale is also known for paying wages above the industry average and offering generous benefits. Twenty years ago, some Wall Street analysts took issue with this approach. That now looks short sighted: The shares are at a record high. To be sure, the relationship between high worker remuneration and market success is not universal. For example, Target has long paid bonuses and awards stock to store managers – although it hasn’t disclosed how much. The retailer also offers benefits including free access to further education. Yet its shares have been overshadowed by a slump in demand for non-essential items, languishing at close to half of their 2021 high. But to really understand the power of a pay scheme like Walmart’s, you need to look beyond the financial markets. While everyone deserves a living wage, a job that delivers a large sum can be life-changing, helping a family get on the housing ladder or achieve a new level of education. And opening that pathway to employees who may not have a college degree is particularly transformative. To provide those opportunities – and to do so in a way that motivates an entire workforce – requires companies to put mindful policies in place. Employees throughout the organisation must be able to work their way up to store managers and above. Walmart says about 75 per cent of its store, warehouse club and supply chain managers started as hourly employees. Typically, a person can join a retailer as, for example, a shelf-stacker or cashier, perhaps part-time. They can go on to take responsibility for different sections within the store, before joining the management ranks. Across the industry, career moves happen every 14.5 months on average, and generate a 15.2 per cent pay uplift, according to the National Retail Federation. Indeed, some CEOs have moved from entry-level jobs to the C-suite. For example, Costco’s new CEO Ron Vachris started as a fork lift driver at age 17 in 1982 at Price Club, which later merged with Costco. Without such a pathway, high wages for store managers can create a feeling of us-versus-them among employees. For the same reason, some element of the greater management rewards must be shared throughout the store. Indeed, Walmart also recently announced a new bonus program for full- and part-time store staff, whereby, for example, a long-serving full-time employee could earn a bonus of up to US$1,000 a year. This means that every level within the store can earn remuneration above an hourly wage. Stock may also be part of these compensation plans – though that requires employees to take the rough with the smooth. At Starbucks, full- and part-time employees may be rewarded with “Bean Stock,” which turns into Starbucks shares over two years, as long as they remain with the company. It has paid out about US$2 billion-worth since 1991. However, Starbucks shares fell to their lowest level in two years last month, which can be demoralising for holders (on the plus side, as new grants are based on a specified dollar amount, rather than number of shares, this means current awardees get more stock). Yes, companies take a risk by offering workers more compensation – but the reward is worth it. When criticised in 2004 for being too generous, then CEO of Costco Jim Sinegal said: “I happen to believe that in order to reward the shareholder in the long-term, you have to please your customers and workers.” Two decades later, that thinking is paying off. It’s heartening to see more retailers following in his footsteps.

SINGAPORE: After more than two decades, the NEWater Visitor Centre will cease operations at the end of July. The visitor centre in Bedok will be closing its doors on Jul 31, said national water agency PUB in a media release on Monday (Jun 24). Since opening in 2003, the visitor centre has promoted water sustainability to visitors through interactive displays, tours, exhibits and workshops for free. PUB added that the Bedok NEWater Factory (BNF), adjacent to the visitor centre, will also close on on the same day when it reaches the end of its \"operational lifespan\". Launched in 2003, it is Singapore's oldest NEWater production plant. There are currently five NEWater factories - Bedok, Kranji , Ulu Pandan, and two at Changi. The Bedok factory will be replaced with a third one at Changi Water Reclamation Plant, which will have more than double the production capacity of the Bedok plant, said PUB. With the closure of the visitor centre, PUB said it would \"look into leveraging other sites and deepening collaboration with our partners to develop the next iteration of NEWater education\". \"Meanwhile, Singaporeans can visit the Marina Barrage's Sustainable Singapore Gallery to learn more about NEWater and the Four National Taps,\" it said. PUB chief executive Ong Tze-Ch’in said: “NEWater symbolises Singapore’s spirit of innovation in leapfrogging our natural constraints. Over two decades, Singaporeans young and old have made the journey to the NEWater Visitor Centre to learn about how we recycle used water endlessly, allowing us to overcome our lack of natural water resources. With its closure, PUB will explore new platforms for education on our NEWater story.” NEWater was first introduced to the public on National Day in 2002, and the first two NEWater plants were opened at Bedok and Kranji the following year. The quality of NEWater is well within standards set by the World Health Organisation for drinking water, according to PUB. NEWater is currently supplied to more than 850 non-domestic customers, including wafer fabrication plants, petrochemical refineries, power stations, and commercial premises, said PUB. During dry periods, PUB adds NEWater to Singapore's reservoirs. The blended water is then treated at waterworks before it it piped to households as tap water.

Clariel Griffin outside the State Courts on Jun 24, 2024. (Photo: CNA/Syamil Sapari) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A woman was fined S$9,200 (US$6,800) on Monday (Jun 24) for failing to wear a mask and using criminal force on a safe-distancing ambassador during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clariel Griffin, a 49-year-old Singaporean, violated COVID-19 regulations in September 2021 at Marina Bay Sands (MBS), along with her husband, British national Clive Ainsley Griffin . She pleaded guilty to one count of failing to wear a mask, and one count of criminal force to a public servant, with a third charge of public nuisance taken into consideration. Griffin and her husband had dinner and alcohol at the Dallas Bar in MBS with a group of friends on Sep 11, 2021. The group did not finish their drinks despite two reminders to do so, as consumption of alcohol was not allowed past 10.30pm. At about 10.30pm, the bar owner saw safe-distancing ambassadors patrolling the area to ensure no alcohol was being consumed past the permitted time, and told one of them about the issue he was facing. The Griffins left the bar, but were seen walking without masks in MBS by safe-distancing ambassadors. Despite being asked to put their masks on, the couple refused. At the time, wearing masks in public places was mandatory due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the ambassadors then took out her phone and recorded the incident. Various video clips were captured of Griffin's subsequent actions, the court heard. Griffin responded to the ambassador saying that she \"didn't give a f*** (about the regulations)\", and that she would not live her life like this. She then taunted the ambassador by asking her to record and \"catch (her)\" for not wearing a mask. During this incident, Griffin pulled down the ambassador's mask without her consent. The court also heard that Griffin continuously walked very closely towards the ambassador, forcing her to backpedal to avoid being walked into. The prosecution sought a fine of S$1,200 and one to two weeks' jail. Griffin's husband had also been fined S$1,200 for his role in the case. Griffin's defence lawyers Silas Siew, Cory Wong and Josephus Tan from Invictus Law asked that she be sentenced to probation instead. In the alternative, they asked for a fine to be imposed. The lawyers said that Griffin had been experiencing mood changes and anger management issues following treatment for cancer. They also noted that Griffin had no prior convictions and was at low risk for re-offending. For failing to wear a mask in public without reasonable excuse, she could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both. For using criminal force on a public servant, she could have been jailed for up to four years, fined, or both.

    "article_content": "Business Business FILE PHOTO: An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015.REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo AMSTERDAM :European Union antitrust regulators charged on Monday that Apple breached the bloc's tech rules, a charge that could result in a hefty fine for the iPhone maker which also faces another investigation into new fees imposed on app developers. The European Commission, which is also the EU's antitrust and technology regulator, said it had sent its preliminary findings to Apple following an investigation launched in March. The charge against Apple is the first by the Commission under its landmark Digital Markets Act which seeks to rein in the power of Big Tech and ensure a level playing field for smaller rivals. It has until March next year to issue a final decision. DMA violations could result in a fine of as much as 10 per cent of a company's global annual turnover. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager cited issues with Apple's new terms, saying that they fell short of complying with the DMA. Apple can avoid a fine if it can address the concerns by modifying its business terms. \"As they stand, we think that these new terms do not allow app developers to communicate freely with their end users, and to conclude contracts with them,\" she told a conference. She said it was up to Apple to decide how to comply with the DMA and not for her to tell the company what to do. Apple said it had made a number of changes in the past several months to comply with the DMA after getting feedback from app developers and the Commission. \"As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission,\" it said in an email. The Commission said under most of the business terms, Apple allows steering only through 'link-outs', meaning that app developers can include a link in their app that redirects the customer to a web page where the customer can conclude a contract. It also criticised the fees charged by Apple for facilitating via the App Store the initial acquisition of a new customer by developers, saying they went beyond what was strictly necessary for such remuneration. \"We are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99 per cent of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created,\" Apple said in its email. NEW CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS The EU executive said it was also opening an investigation into the iPhone maker over its new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app stores and whether these were necessary and proportionate. At issue is its core technology fee, the multi-step user journey to download and install alternative app stores on iPhones and the eligibility requirements for developers to offer alternative app stores or directly distribute apps from the web on iPhones. Apple rolled out the new fees in March in the EU, which include the core technology fee to major app developers even if they do not use any of its payment services, prompting criticism from \"Fortnite\" creator Epic Games and others. Vestager also criticised Apple's announcement last week that it would delay the launch of its AI-powered features of its AI-powered features in the EU which the company blamed on the DMA. Vestager said that it seemed that Apple suggested that its AI integration may be anti-competitive.

File photo of a kettle. (Photo: Unsplash/Lucas George Wendt) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A 33-year-old single mother admitted in court on Monday (Jun 24) to splashing hot water on her four children as she suspected one of them had stolen her money. The Singaporean woman pleaded guilty to one count of ill-treating a child in her care, with another three charges relating to her other children to be considered in sentencing. She cannot be named due to gag orders protecting the identities of her children. The court heard that the woman's children were aged eight, nine, 10 and 11 at the time of the offences in July 2022. On the morning of Jul 2, 2022, she asked her oldest child, an 11-year-old girl, to retrieve S$20 (US$14.70) from her wallet to buy bread for breakfast. The girl told her mother that there was only S$5 in the wallet. The woman was surprised, as she recalled having S$60 in her wallet the night before. She suspected that one of her children had taken the money, like they had previously, and instructed them to look for the cash. The woman watched and threatened to splash hot water on them if they could not find the money. As the kids were looking for the cash, the woman boiled water in the kitchen. She filled three-quarters of a tumbler with the hot liquid and went to the bedroom, where her children were. She splashed the hot water in their direction and asked them to return the money. The children continued to deny taking the money and their mother refilled the tumbler with hot water and splashed it at them again. She repeated this until she had splashed each child once. The children cried and ran around the bedroom apologising as they were scalded by the liquid. When the children stopped the search to prepare for school, the woman noticed that her nine-year-old son had burns on his body. She checked on her other children and realised they had similar injuries. She began to cry and applied medicated oil on them before calling her sister to come over. An ambulance was subsequently called by Singapore Civil Defence Force personnel. Court documents detailed the injuries on only one of the children - the 10-year-old girl who was the second oldest child. This girl sustained superficial partial thickness burns over 10 per cent of her body, including her left arm, stomach area and thighs. She underwent treatment and wound dressing that required general anaesthesia and had to go for serial wound inspections and dressing changes. The girl was last reviewed in October 2022 by the KK Women's and Children's Hospital's Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery. There was a soft scar of about 2cm by 1cm on her left arm, with permanent scarring likely. The prosecution did not object to the calling of a probation suitability report, as asked for by the defence. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tin Shu Min noted that while the victims were vulnerable and the offences severe, the accused has also taken efforts since to change her situation. Any sentence will also have an impact on her family unit, said Ms Tin. The offender's lawyer, from the Public Defender's Office, said his client had single-handedly raised the four children after overcoming a poor family background, an abusive ex-husband and persistent depressive disorder. \"She has overcome all of that to provide for her children, notwithstanding that she was a waitress with only PSLE education,\" said the lawyer. He said the woman worked hard and sought help from social agencies to upskill herself and care for her children. While juggling her finances and legal battles with her ex-husband, the woman still \"found time to love and care\" for her children, said the lawyer. He added that this was the first time such a thing had happened and that the woman has since suffered intense guilt and a low mood and has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The lawyer said the children love their mother and wish to be reunited with her, and that the relevant social agencies are also working towards reunification. He said the current charges resulted in the children being separated from their mother and being placed in three separate homes. The Child Protective Service has indicated that it would \"move towards reintegration\" if the woman is sentenced to probation, said the lawyer, pushing for probation as it is in the children's best interests. District Judge Tan Jen Tse called for a report to assess the woman's suitability for probation. However, he stressed that even if it was recommended, he was not bound to follow the recommendations in sentencing. And even if the prosecution and defence agreed that probation is the right sentence, he may not agree with them, he told the woman. She nodded. \"I suggest you continue your efforts to keep trying to improve and look after your children properly,\" said the judge. Sentencing was adjourned to August.

    "article_content": "Business Business U.S. Dollar and Japan Yen notes are seen in this June 22, 2017 illustration photo. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration LONDON : The dollar was slightly weaker on Monday but remained close to an almost eight-week high, while the yen languished near the 160 level, drawing verbal warnings from Japanese authorities as intervention fears grip markets. The yen weakened to 159.94 per dollar in early trade, its lowest since April 29, when the yen touched a 34-year low of 160.245, leading to Japanese authorities spending roughly 9.8 trillion yen to support the currency. The yen was last slightly firmer at 159.75 per dollar after Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda said on Monday authorities will take appropriate steps if there is excessive foreign exchange movement, and that the addition of Japan to the U.S. Treasury's monitoring list would not restrict their actions. \"We will firmly respond to moves that are too rapid or driven by speculators,\" Kanda said, but noted authorities had no specific levels in mind on when to intervene. The yen has come under renewed pressure after the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) decision this month to hold off on reducing bond-buying stimulus until its July meeting. It is down 1.5 per cent in June. \"I don't necessarily think that the act of breaking the psychological level is enough (for intervention) any more,\" said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex. \"Authorities have told us that they care more about the pace and disorderly moves as opposed to individual levels.\" A summary of opinions at the BOJ's June policy meeting on Monday showed some policymakers called for raising interest rates in a timely fashion as they saw a risk of inflation overshooting expectations. The yen, which is highly sensitive to U.S. Treasury yields, is down over 10 per cent against the dollar so far this year, weighed down by the wide difference between interest rates in Japan and the United States. Demand for carry trades, borrowing yen at low rates to buy higher yielding currencies, has also taken both the Australian and New Zealand dollars to 17-year peaks on the yen. INFLATION TEST AHEAD The spotlight this week will be on the U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - the Federal Reserve's favoured gauge of inflation - due on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters expect annual growth in the index to slow to 2.6 per cent in May. A soft reading is likely to bolster bets on a rate cut as early as September, which futures currently price as a 70 per cent prospect, CME FedWatch tool showed. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. unit against six peers, was last at 105.66, edging back from a nearly eight-week high of 105.91 it touched last week. The focus through the week will also be on geopolitics, with the first U.S. presidential debate on Thursday and the first round of voting in the French election at the weekend. \"You're going to see a lot of defensive positioning going into the first round of the French election and U.S. presidential debate,\" said Monex's Harvey. \"While there is a sense of calm which is weighing on the dollar this morning, political risk is still a decent source of strength for the dollar and we expect the dollar index to finish the week higher.\" The euro, which has been under pressure since French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap election earlier this month, was up 0.2 per cent at $1.07125 but was still down 1.2 per cent in June. France's far right National Rally (RN) party and its allies were leading the first round of the country's elections with 35.5 per cent of the expected vote, an opinion poll published on Sunday showed. RN lawmaker Jean-Philippe Tanguy, who is widely seen as the most likely candidate to head the finance ministry if the party wins and forms a government, told Reuters an RN government would stick to the European Union's fiscal rules. Meanwhile, spot yuan was trading at 7.2609 per dollar, within a very narrow range and close to its lowest in seven months, weighed by broad strength in the dollar and worries about weakness in the world's second-largest economy.

    "article_content": "Sport Sport Frankfurt, Germany : Slovakia and Romania meet in Frankfurt on Wednesday knowing victory will secure a place in the last-16 of Euro 2024, but in the tightest of pools, a draw could send both teams through. Group E is on a knife-edge, with all four teams on three points, though Romania (+1 goal-difference) sit on top on goals scored from Belgium (also +1), followed by Slovakia (+0) and Ukraine (-2). Romania will advance in the top two if they avoid defeat, while victories for Belgium over Ukraine and Slovakia will leave the Romanians sweating on advancing as one of the best third-place finishers. A draw in Frankfurt would give both teams an excellent chance of going through, but Romania forward Valentin Mihaila rejected suggestions that both teams might settle for a point from the start. \"You can't go into a match mentally as a player, as a team, with the thought of drawing,\" he told reporters. \"If it is 0-0 in the 91st minute and the tied score qualifies us both, yes ... but I don't want to do calculations. \"We have to go in with the mindset of winning the game and I think we can do that.\" Romania coach Edward Iordanescu could select the same XI that lost 2-0 to Belgium in their second pool game, though whether Mihaila starts ahead of Florinel Coman is a matter for debate. Coman got the nod in the opening 3-0 win over Ukraine. Slovakia impressed in a surprise 1-0 win over pool favourites Belgium in their opening game, but let a lead slip to lose 2-1 to Ukraine in their second with shades of Euro 2020. On that occasion they beat Poland 1-0, lost to Sweden by the same scoreline in their second fixture, and when they were routed 5-0 by Spain in their final match, finished third in the pool with three points and did not advance to the last-16. Ukraine, with three points and a -1 goal-difference, did finish as one of the best third-placed teams. \"We are happy that we managed the first match, but not happy that we did not manage the next one,\" Slovakia midfielder Juraj Kucka said of their current campaign. \"We want to win every match and now we know that we have to improve and change something. \"We are reminded of it (Euro 2020) but I don't want to think about it. This is a different tournament, a different team and a different coach (Francesco Calzona),\" he added.

    "article_content": "Singapore Singapore Work on clearing oil from the beaches' rock bunds and breakwaters has started. (Photo: Facebook/Sentosa) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Oil spill clean-up operations are expected to take around three months before affected areas such as beaches are progressively reopened to the public, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu on Monday (Jun 24). She gave an update on the clean-up operations and its challenges during a joint press conference with Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat and Minister for National Development Desmond Lee. The spill occurred on the afternoon of Jun 14 after a Netherlands-flagged dredger hit a stationary bunker vessel, causing oil from the latter's damaged cargo tank to spill into the water. Over the next few days, oil washed up along several beaches including Sentosa, East Coast Park, and Labrador Nature Reserve, as well as beaches at St John's, Lazarus and Kusu islands. Oil slicks were also spotted at Marina South Pier. Ms Fu said that more than 700 cleaning personnel have been deployed and much of the oil on beachfronts has been cleaned up. “About 550 tonnes of oil-soaked sand and debris from the affected beaches has been removed,” she added. More than 3,400m of booms have also been deployed to prevent oil from being washed ashore or into inland canals. “This effort would not have been possible without the tireless and coordinated efforts of our cleaning personnel from agencies and their service providers,” said Ms Fu. Ms Fu said that clean up efforts will be entering the next phase. \"The first phase of the clean-up focused on removing the oil slicks and contaminated sand from the surface of the affected beaches and deploying booms to avoid further contamination,\" she said. \"This is making good progress and approaching completion.\" In a joint statement on Monday by seven agencies involved in the oil clean-up effort – such as the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) – they said that based on satellite and drone images, no oil slicks along the East Coast and Changi have been observed since Jun 18. “The bulk of oil-soaked sand has been removed from most of the affected public beaches, with the exception of Tanjong and Palawan beach at Sentosa,” said the agencies. Ms Fu said the next phase will be \"more complex in nature\" and focus on difficult-to-clean areas like rock bunds, breakwaters, and oil trapped deeper in the sand. This is not straightforward as such places are not as accessible as beach shorelines and their surfaces are uneven. \"Oil that has slipped into the boulder crevices needs to be thoroughly flushed out ... We want to minimise the oil flushed out from contaminating other areas,\" said Ms Fu. \"We are also mindful of keeping our workers safe as they operate over rocky terrain which can be uneven, hard to reach as they are sea-facing, and very slippery.\" She added that agencies will test out various cleaning methods to find the most suitable one for respective sites, and refine their operations as they go along. Clean-up operations commenced on the rock bunds at Siloso beach on Jun 21. In the coming weeks, similar operations will be carried out at Sentosa Cove, Labrador Nature Reserve, and East Coast Park. \"We expect to take around three months to complete this next phase of cleaning, after which we will progressively reopen affected public areas,\" said the minister. \"For less affected areas, we hope to open earlier.\" Sea activities will only resume when the water quality is assessed to be safe for primary contact activities. For biodiversity sensitive sites, more time will be needed to assess the impact on wildlife, said Ms Fu. She cautioned that the oil spill situation remains dynamic and the public should be prepared for some uncertainty. \"It is possible for some stranded oil to resurface at a later stage ... Oil that has resurfaced in one location can also flow to and affect other areas, carried by wind, current, and tide. This may affect the completion of cleaning,\" she said. Once specialised cleaning is done, there will be a final phase of cleaning, where beaches will be combed to remove \"tar balls\" – small blobs of coagulated oil in the sand. The clean-up will likely be done with rakes and sieves, rather than shovels, to avoid removing too much uncontaminated sand, said Ms Fu. While the first two phases of cleaning will not directly involve volunteers, there are plans to do so in the final phase. \"We are planning to involve volunteers working alongside our cleaning personnel so that we can relieve our workers and to accelerate the reopening of our beaches,\" she said. \"We will ensure that this is conducted safely and that volunteers are properly equipped.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

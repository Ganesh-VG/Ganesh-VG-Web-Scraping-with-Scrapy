It was rebranded from CB Unicorn to Unicorn 160 as a result of which it gets revised styling, improved comfortability, and finally, an engine kill switch. The first Honda Unicorn when it was launched, created quite a stir with its refined performance and monoshock suspension. The Unicorn 160 is the spiritual successor and still has a strong fan following. The Honda CB Unicorn 160 carries forward the legacy of impressive Honda motorcycles over the years. It has raked in high sales figures over several years and was the first offering from the brand in the Indian market. The latest iteration of the Honda CB Unicorn 160 is a brand new product and the design template remains similar to the earlier version. There are some new parts added for jazzing up the look of this motorcycle now. The headlight looks and feels premium with its clear lens turn indicators for company.

The engine has been revamped extensively and is completely new with a longer stroke and also a counter-balancer for better performance at higher rev bands. The engine has higher displacement and the new design for the cylinder also enhances overall combustion-linked efficiency and management of heat. The compression ratio has also increased to 10:1 while the crankcase also comes with a brand new design with smaller fins positioned near the oil filter zone. The transmission is still the same trusted five-speed gearbox. The engine powers up swiftly while settling down smoothly at decent speeds. However, the engine has a better intake and does not sound down-charged at all. There is good throttle-based feedback while the bike now feels quick and agile. The redline is 9,000 RPM although the flatter feeling persists over 8,000 RPM.

The tyres are also in need of improvement while there is a softer suspension setup this time around. There is suitable damping for better ride quality without thuds and uncomfortable bumps around potholes. The combined braking setup functions decently in this case although you will have to push it for better feedback. The overall riding experience is still fun for enthusiasts. The Honda CB Unicorn 160 offers adequate comfort and quality. It remains silent and undisturbed while offering a smooth pickup. The overall seat comfort levels are better this time. The seat is also longer and brand new as compared to the previous Unicorn model. This is balanced between a feeling of firmness and softness although the lighter weight of the motorcycle contributes to its improved riding experience. The key features include a fully-digital instrument cluster along with vital readouts including an odometer, speedometer, dual-trip meters, tachometer, clock, and fuel-level indicator among others.

I am a nature-lover ( bird watching in particular ) and frequent countrysides in the plains and hills quite often. This bike feels like an allrounder which feels at home, whether in the lanes and traffic of the city, or, the roads and trails away from city. Decent mileage and negligible cost of maintenance, has been my experience with this bike. After all, this is what is expected of 'HONDA', by commoners like me.

The new-gen Scout is expected to arrive with some comprehensive upgrade though all details currently remain under wraps with even the short date reveal video not providing even a glimpse of the new motorcycle. The use of an early 20th-century camera with the original Scout suggests that the new iteration will be borrowing several cues from the original. However, Indian Motorcycles knows how to balance modern technology with traditional lines, both of which we expect to see on the new Scout. A post shared by Indian Motorcycle (@indianmotorcycle) The outgoing Indian Scout is powered by a 1,133 cc V-Twin, liquid-cooled engine developing 98 bhp and 98 Nm of peak torque. The Scout is heavily inspired by the original with the low-slung design, twin barrel exhausts, and a wide handlebar. Expect the design language to get evolutionary upgrades while the motor could be carried over with some tweaks. The Indian Scout nameplate dates back to 1920 and was one of the most popular offerings from the brand. It first arrived with a 606 cc engine, followed by a 745 cc in 1927. Expect more details on the new Scout to slowly trickle their way online ahead of the model's global debut. Representational Image."

    "article_content": "By Kingshuk Dutta 1 mins read Published on May 25, 2016 Follow us on There is something oddly macho about riding a motorcycle that tips the scale at 425kg and is the size of a 1-bhk flat in Mumbai. The motorcycle we are talking about is the Indian Roadmaster, and we had the pleasure of riding it. The Roadmaster is the biggest motorcycle in the Indian Motorcycles line-up at present. And honestly, we would be hard pressed to believe that there might be motorcycles bigger than this one. One of the most luxurious motorcycles of the 1940s, Indian Motorcycles resurrected the Roadmaster after 70 years or so and how! Riding the Roadmaster was one heck of an experience and we would love to ride it again. Allow us to elucidate. Looking me up The Roadmaster is basically a Chieftain dressed up as a bagger and gets a 'batwing' fairing, which give it an unmistakable touring cred. Our test motorcycle is draped in a lovely shade of Red and Ivory Cream. Not exactly loud and not too subtle either, just the right amount of flash. The fairing has shiny chrome housing for the headlamp. Flanking it on either side are two auxiliary headlamps and above it are the LED indicators. Rounding up the front is the beautifully crafted fender, with the war bonnet sitting proudly on it. From the profile, the engine shines out, done in chrome and the achingly comfortable seats, both for the rider and the pillion. The panniers can hold in a decent amount of kit and don't look out of place. The motorcycle might look odd without them though. Make no mistake about it, the Roadmaster commands magnificent street presence. Fit and finish Impeccable! The bigger a motorcycle, more the number of parts. And in case of the Roadmaster, it has a fairing, panniers, panels etc. but no rattle at all. The motorcycle is built to last long, rather a lifetime. The chrome on the switchgear doesn't feel garish. There is a premium touch to it. The Desert Tan leather seats are supple and you are comfortably ensconced. Even after hours and hours of riding, you are left without a hint of aches or soreness. Overall, there is not one bit that feels cheap or aftermarket on the Roadmaster, and it shouldn't too either. Features, features everywhere The Roadmaster is a really expensive motorcycle (specifics later). And in order to make your touring as effortless and comfortable as possible, it has a multitude of features. Starting from the electrically adjustable windscreen to 10-level heated palm grips, heated seats and a 200 watt audio system which has radio and can be used to play your favourite music via USB or Bluetooth, Yes! It is a motorcycle and not a car. No matter how long or short your ride is, you will always arrive with a huge smile on your face. In case, the road ahead is long, straight and relatively empty, you can always engage the cruise control as well. The combined capacity of the panniers, the top case and the two spaces in upper and lower fairings comes to a massive 144 litres. That is more than enough space for a weekend's worth of luggage for two. Another impressive feature is the key fob. In essence, the Roadmaster has a start button on the fuel tank, which can be used to fire up the motorcycle, with the key stored safely in your pocket. The Goliath cometh The V-twin Thunder Stroke 111 is a glorious engine. As is expected of a touring motorcycle, there is pull right from the start. 138Nm of torque is available at a mere 2,600rpm. The acceleration on the Roadmaster is scary, so much so that, you wouldn't have ever imagined a motorcycle this big to be so quick off the mark. Sure, it will not win any drag races, but it's no slouch either. The shifts are precise, and with enough riding, you can actually find the neutral in this, unlike in other American cruisers. The power delivery is smooth and there is no trace of any unwanted vibrations. There is enough grunt in the engine to cruise at speeds of 120kmph all day long. Even more, if you are brave enough to try it out. It handles better than we expected. Even at speeds of 10kmph, one need not worry about manoeuvrability. Not to say that there are no chinks in its armour. Firstly, you will need solid muscle if you want to draw it out of a parking lot; 421kg of dry weight is no joke. God help you if you tip it over. Secondly, if you get stuck in a traffic jam, your legs will get a thorough roasting. Like all Indian motorcycles, the Roadmaster too has an air-cooled engine which hates the thought of getting stuck in traffic. Final say Overall, the urban jungle is not the environs where the Roadmaster will thrive. It is best ridden on long, smooth stretches of tarmac. Though we have to say that there are few cruisers or tourers which can match the comfort and elegance of the way the Roadmaster goes about. All you need is Rs. 38 lakh and you can own one! Not much for a motorcycle which literally lets you live out of itself. (Photography: Surya Karan) Starts at ₹ 39 Lakh"

    "article_content": "By Preetam Bora 1 mins read Published on December 9, 2016 Follow us on The name 'Sixty' in the new Indian Scout Sixty is derived from its engine displacement; so the 999cc v-twin (or 60 cubic inches as the Americans describe it), has made the newest Indian the Scout 'Sixty'. It's the entry-level cruiser from Indian Motorcycle , and sits just below the Indian Scout. Does it have the same qualities as the Scout? We swing a leg over the Indian Scout Sixty . (Indian Scout Sixty - Looks identical to the Indian Scout) In terms of looks, the Scout Sixty looks identical to its bigger sibling, the only visible difference being the emblem on the fuel tank which misses the 'Scout'. While the Scout gets some chrome inserts in the engine exterior, the Scout Sixty's engine is completely blacked-out, that is the only visual difference. The bike retains the muscular, low slung silhouette with its chunky tyres and fat fenders adding extra muscle to the overall look. A single-pod instrument console displays a large, analogue speedometer with a small LCD screen displaying distance-to-empty readings, digital rev counter and trip meter. A fuel gauge is missed; but what you do get is a low fuel warning light. (Single-pod console doesn't get fuel gauge) The riding posture is identical to the Scout - you sit low on the bike, on the vinyl solo bucket seat and the foot pegs are spread out wide and set forward with the wide handlebar making a comfortable riding position. Mechanically, the only changes in the Scout Sixty are a slightly smaller engine and the transmission, which now has one gear less than on the Scout. (Indian Scout Sixty - Similar riding position to the Scout) The 999cc v-twin makes 78bhp of power, and 89Nm of torque peaking at 5800rpm. There's ample pulling power and impressive acceleration as you work through the five-speed transmission. The torque is spread out over a broad range of revs, so there's enough grunt when you open the throttle, making for entertaining performance. The five-speed gearbox clicks with precision and smoothness, and finding neutral is a 'no-problem'. The final drive is belt-operated so that means a smooth and noiseless ride and less maintenance. 999cc v-twin makes 78bhp power, 89Nm of torque But what really stands out is the refinement of the engine, which despite the marginal displacement drop, pulls cleanly and without any sense of clatter or vibration. In fact, in performance and handling, the Scout Sixty retains the similar characteristics of the Scout, without the maddening rush of power the bigger Scout is known for. But that doesn't mean the Scout Sixty is lacking in any way; whether you're a new rider or a seasoned motorcyclist, the Scout will certainly not disappoint. (Entertaining performance with refined engine) The suspension is a bit on the stiffer side and although handling is taut, the ride quality isn't exactly plush. Show a set of corners and it's evident that the Scout Sixty isn't meant for tackling corners aggressively, with the foot pegs scraping before the chassis loses its composure. The bike doesn't exactly wallow over a set of twisties, but the pegs limit the lean angle. At around 250kg weight, it isn't exactly a light cruiser either and the turning radius could become a bother in tight spots. But if you stick to what it's designed to do; languid cruising and the occasional weekend jaunt, then the Scout Sixty comes across as a very well put-together motorcycle. (Indian Scout Sixty - just a nice bike) It's the entry-level Indian , although at Rs 11.99 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), the Scout Sixty can hardly be called entry-level. For that kind of money, what it offers is a premium cruiser, for the weekend ride, or even the Sunday breakfast ride; if that is the kind of riding you intend to do. It may not be perfect, and it may have its limitations, but to me, the Scout Sixty leaves its imprint as just a very nice bike. (Photography: Surya Karan) Starts at ₹ 11 Lakh"

    "article_content": "By Preetam Bora 1 mins read Published on July 14, 2017 Follow us on Meet the new Indian Chieftain Dark Horse - this massive mass of black metal with a name that promises a lot of character and stamina, quite like a thoroughbred black stallion. Technically though, the only thing new is the blacked out look. The Chieftain Dark Horse shares the same engine and mechanicals with the standard Indian Chieftain , but the difference is in the name, and as it suggests, a blacked-out look to appeal to a wider audience of cruiser lovers. So, unlike the chrome-laden standard Chieftain, the Dark Horse gets a matte black finish, with limited chrome finishes on the exhaust mufflers, wheels and a thin chrome strip on the trademark valenced front fender. What the Chieftain Dark Horse has, is lots of road presence; it attracts attention, a lot of it, whether it's parked, or on the move. Motorists will slow down to take a good look at it, and during our time with the bike, crowds of admirers materialised out of nowhere at our suburban shoot location. Yes, the Dark Horse has the power and personality to make heads turn, and its long muscular body and massive appearance certainly lends it an aura of awe and admiration. The Indian Chieftain Dark Horse has tremendous road presence Its massive size and over 400 kg kerb weight may be a slight inconvenience in bumper-to-bumper traffic, but this is not where the Chieftain Dark Horse is at home really. If inter-state highway distances are what you have in mind, the Chieftain Dark Horse is an able long-distance companion. This bagger can accommodate 24 kg of luggage in its remote lockable saddlebags, and it offers all the amenities of a modern motorcycle - there's keyless ignition, cruise control, standard ABS, a push-button adjustable windshield and even a tyre pressure monitoring system. The 1811 cc v-twin engine is smooth and has a lot of low-end torque The best part though is the brilliant 1811 cc v-twin. The engine makes 73 bhp of power at around 5,000 rpm, but it's the massive torque of 138.9 Nm that is responsible for pulling this huge mass of metal. All that torque is available from as low as 1,000 rpm and the Dark Horse just pulls with a reassuring rumble from the v-twin. The engine isn't exactly free revving, but there's no vibration, no protest as the revs climb and you settle into a comfortable cruising speed. Sixth gear is an overdrive, for easy highway cruising, and will pull cleanly from as low as 70 kmph, to unmentionable triple digit speeds. Overtakes are a breeze with just a downshift propelling this gigantic motorcycle straight ahead, when some extra thrust is required. The cruise control does help out on a long, open road and the 100 watt, fairing-mounted stereo has enough power to make you enjoy your favourite music at highway speeds. The Chieftain Dark Horse has excellent highway manners and a refined engine Its size may be overwhelming at first, but the Indian Chieftain Dark Horse is easy as it gets, once on the move. The weight isn't felt at all, and despite its massive size and length, it's quite easy to manoeuvre within the city and is surprisingly well-behaved round a long, sweeping corner. Then there's the ride quality - it's got a supple and plush ride, and during our test ride, we were happy to note that it sailed over broken patches and road undulations with admirable composure. Of course, turning it around takes some planning and space, and tight parking spots aren't where you'd want to be on the Dark Horse, and the heat from the engine can get bothersome in rush hour traffic. The Chieftain Dark Horse offers an excellent cruiser but it's not affordable for everyone But if you're in the market for an all-American cruiser, you want to make a statement with your ride, and you want a bike with smooth, refined performance, great ride quality and plenty of low-end grunt, the Indian Chieftain Dark Horse has all those qualities and more. There are few other options in the cruiser market which can give you the feeling of a better-built, better engineered motorcycle than the Chieftain Dark Horse. The only thing left then, is your budget; so, if you have over Rs. 32 lakh to spare for your ride, by all means take a look at this bagger. We're certain the long road won't feel the same with any other steel horse. Starts at ₹ 29.99 Lakh"

    "article_content": "By Preetam Bora 1 mins read Published on March 30, 2018 Follow us on When I first rode the Indian Scout almost four years ago, I was blown away with its performance and handling. The Scout felt like a small cruiser compared to the rest of the behemoths from the Indian Motorcycle line-up. And when the Indian Scout Bobber was launched, it took the Scout platform to a whole new level, with more than just a slightly different flavour. The Bobber shares the same basic platform of the Scout but it gets more appeal, more road presence and is a guaranteed head-turner. But does the new Indian Scout Bobber have what it takes to be the near-perfect cruiser? We spent some time riding it, and came back surprised. Also Read: Indian Scout Bobber Wins NDTV CarandBike Two-Wheeler Design Of The Year Award One thing's for sure, if it's a beauty contest among the current crop of cruiser motorcycles, the Scout Bobber is certainly right up there with the very best. In fact, it was judged the best-looking two-wheeler at the 2018 NDTV CarandBike awards, and it's an honour it rightfully deserves. It's just a very beautiful motorcycle, and looks very, very attractive. The Scout Bobber looks more aggressive, more butch and more appealing than the Scout, thanks to the blacked out look. Gone is the shiny chrome, and in true Bobber style, it gets chopped fenders and fat new tyres, with deep treads to add additional muscle. Details like the new instrument panel, taillight and engine covers certainly make it look fresh and new. The headlight nacelle design is new, and the bar-end mirrors on our test bike look cool, but offer little practical visibility. The font on the fuel tank is now new, and employs bold block letters. The Scout Bobber also has revised ergonomics - the footpegs are now closer to the rider, as is the tracker-style handlebar. And although the rear suspension (with dual shocks) has been dropped by about 25 mm (more on that later), the seat height has increased. The number plate is moved to the left, and gives the tail the authentic 'bobbed' look. And once you swing a leg over the single pan seat, the difference in ergonomics is evident. And that is evident the moment you slot it into first and open the throttle. It pulls with urgency, the gearshifts are smooth and precise, and by the time you accelerate through the gears and reach sixth, the world around you slows down, as the V-twin lets out a muted rumble from the stock pipes. The Scout Bobber retains the same 1,133 cc, liquid-cooled, v-twin engine of the Indian Scout, and it puts out 94 bhp of power and 97 Nm of peak torque; not much you'd say, but the way the torque and power is let loose will have you grinning from ear to ear, every time you whack open the throttle. Not many cruisers have this kind of entertaining personality and that certainly is a big, big plus point. Hundred kilometres per hour will arrive before you even realise it, and the engine begs to be given the beans, and you could go further and further into very dangerous (and illegal) territory, if you give in to the Bobber's temptation. The front suspension is all-new too, and now employs a cartridge-type telescopic fork with 120 mm of travel. It feels communicative and you could go hard and fast around a curve, chuckling under your lid. That is, until the footpegs begin an intimate affair with tarmac, which will instantly jolt you out of your 'back to teenage' reverie. Well, yes - as long as you're riding on nice, smooth tarmac. But the moment you hit a rut on the road, or a small bump, the Scout Bobber will break your heart, as fast and unexpected as the way that first teenage crush dumped you. On rough roads, the relationship with the Bobber soon hits a rocky patch, quite literally. And for all the gorgeous looks and 'you drive me crazy' performance, you'll soon enough begin to worry about the state of your back and derriere, than to consider putting in some long, passionate hours in the saddle. The Indian Scout Bobber is a very, very good looking motorcycle - period! It's a head turner for sure and has enough performance to make your weekend rides very enjoyable indeed. It's more of an \"around town\" bike, and perfect for the Sunday morning breakfast ride, or the occasional coffee run to meet up with your biker buddies, rather than cover interstate distances. Yes, you could do the occasional long weekend ride if you're the adventurous kind, but the aggressive riding position and the stiff suspension may tire you out over a full day of riding. I'm not sure if I would like to indulge in such a long-term relationship with the Bobber, but it does feel special. In fact, I would go out on a limb and say that if I were to consider a stylish cruiser in my garage, I would probably keep the Indian Scout Bobber on my mind. But after almost a day's ride in and around town, the Scout Bobber busted my teenage dream and reminded me of the forty plus years I've walked this earth (maybe it's just meant for the hipster cool crowd and not just meant for me). At Rs. 11.99 lakh (ex-showroom), it still makes sense as the second or third bike, if you're the kind who prefers different flavours for different occasions, and have the bank balance and commitment for several simultaneous dalliances with two wheels. But for a daily ride, or even your primary ride, I'd probably look elsewhere and just consider putting a poster of the Scout Bobber on my bedroom wall and admire it from afar. Starts at ₹ 11.99 Lakh"

    "article_content": "By Kingshuk Dutta 1 mins read Published on September 7, 2019 Follow us on We have always known Indian Motorcycle to make macho, chrome laden cruisers which are comfortable mile-munching machines! But this time around, Indian decided to shift its focus on building a new range of motorcycles with the intent of them being sporty and fun! And the first step in this new direction is the Indian FTR 1200 . It is refreshingly different from any other Indian motorcycle. One look at it and you know it is a motorcycle for the purist! We were quite excited to ride this motorcycle and once we did, we did not want to give it back! Also Read: Indian FTR 1200 S and 1200 S Race Replica Launched In India (The design of the Indian FTR 1200 S has been inspired by the FTR 750, which is the company's Flat-track championship winning race bike) It is difficult to take your eyes off the FTR 1200! Even more so, when you read the badging on the fuel tank! The Indian FTR 1200 is a cross between a naked roadster and a scrambler and is nothing like the models that we are used to seeing from Indian. There is this unmistakeable air of sensuality around the motorcycle. We mean, look at the motorcycle! It is a beastly street tracker with an aggressive stance and excellent attention to detail. It is basically an homage to the company's FTR 750 race bike, which has dominated the American flat-track racing scene for the last two years and has a very sexy silhouette too. The lines, the contours and the fit and finish are in accordance with Indian's high standards. The golden USDs coupled with the sleek fuel tank and the sharp rear end along with the very sexy twin-exhaust make for a hip motorcycle. Round headlamp, chunky dual-sport tyres, exposed frame, you just can't get enough of the FTR 1200. It oozes raw sex appeal out of every nut and bolt. (Suspension on both ends is fully adjustable and have a travel of 150 mm, making for a plush ride) The FTR 1200 is loaded with rider assist electronics and features! The party piece is the 4.3-inch touchscreen instrument console which houses controls for riding modes, traction control and various settings for smartphone connectivity and display options. The FTR 1200 gets three riding modes which are Rain, Standard and Sport. (The 4.3-inch instrument console is a touchscreen. The bike gets three riding modes which are standard, rain and sport) The screen is intuitive and the best part is that it can be operated with the gloves on and on the move as well. There is a Bosch stability control along with a 6-axis inertial measurement system as well, which offers input to the lean-sensitive ABS and traction control. Other features include full LED lighting and cruise control. It doesn't end there! The FTR 1200 also gets fully adjustable suspension at the front and the rear. The front end gets cartridge type USD forks while the rear gets an IFP monoshock. Both units have a travel of 150 mm, as a result of which, the ride quality is better. But more on that later! (The FTR 1200 gets a 1,203 cc V-twin, which makes 120 bhp and 120 Nm of peak torque) The FTR 1200 gets a 1,203 cc V-twin engine which is liquid-cooled and pumps out 120 bhp along with 120 Nm of peak torque! The engine used is the one on the Scout but gets up to 80 per cent new components. There is a six-speed gearbox, which is a delight to use and super precise too. Thumb the starter and the motorcycle emits a bass laden V-twin burble which is quite distinct. There is a sense of urgency in the power delivery and even though the bike has a good old American V-twin, it is a rev-happy engine and its sweet spot lies between 5,000 to 8,000 rpm. (The FTR 1200 loves to be ridden hard! And it will reward you with grin-inducing performance) The bottom end grunt is there, no doubt, but if you want your eyes to gleam with joy, you need to keep wringing the throttle and believe me, you will love it! The throttle response is snatchy, especially when you are riding in the sport mode and at low speeds. But once you climb up the revs, the FTR 1200 is simply delightful. It is the most entertaining and makes you grin while pinning the throttle and exiting out of corners. The response is dialled down in the rain mode and the electronics settings are bumped in order to offer maximum safety net. In standard mode, the bike stays affable and has a fair amount of electronics intervention. (It is a great handling machine, the FTR 1200! It tips in easily and has solid stability too) The way the FTR 1200 handles, it is simply delightful. It loves being hustled through corners. There is enough clearance before you start scraping the pegs and even when fully leaned over, the motorcycle maintains its balance and stability. It is of course, the best handling motorcycle to come from Indian and its prowess is at par with few middleweight naked motorcycles as well. Plus, the grip from Dunlop tyres is commendable too. The other interesting bit is that the motorcycle gets a plush ride quality and the like we said earlier, it is fully adjustable and has a travel of 150 mm as well, making it easy for the bike to glide over bumps and potholes. (The twin exhaust along with the dual-sport tyres add a sens of muscle to the motorcycle) The design of the bike is such that the even though the look is sporty, the riding position is neutral. The flat, low handlebars coupled with the upright seating position will let you ride long hours in comfort. But the perennial problem of heating up exists, especially when you are riding in traffic, although, the engine is liquid-cooled. (The Indian FTR 1200 S will be an enjoyable motorcycle on light dirt trails, but it is definitely not an out and out ADV) The Indian FTR 1200 is no adventure bike. It is more of a cross between a naked roadster and a scrambler. Its on-road performance is delightful but should you want to go off tarmac, you best keep it to light dirt trails! The grip from Dunlop tyres is better on road than on dirt and in case you want to stand up and ride, the handlebar is too low for that. Should you want to indulge in shenanigans on dirt, the bike will more than happy to do so! (The Indian FTR 1200 S is priced at Rs. 15.99 lakh, which is the model we rode! Is it worth it? We think, yes) The Indian FTR 1200 is just too sexy! At least that's what we think! The 1200 S is priced at Rs. 15.99 lakh while the 1200 S Race Replica is priced at Rs. 17.99 lakh. The race replica gets a sexier colour scheme along with an Akrapovic exhaust and a few other accessories. The FTR 1200 drops jaws wherever it goes and can match any of the middleweight nakeds in terms of performance. Do we like it? One hundred per cent yes! Should you buy one? If you have the money and if you want to buy a rather niche motorcycle, the FTR 1200 makes a good case for itself! Last Updated on September 7, 2019 Starts at ₹ 15.99 - 17.99 Lakh"

Kawasaki sold the Ninja 400 in India as a CBU, and it was last priced at Rs. 5.24 lakh (ex-showroom), which was the same as the Ninja 500, when it was launched a few months ago in February 2024. The Ninja 400 had been on sale in India for a few years and was supposed to replace the Ninja 300, which is even older, but the 300 is manufactured in India and is priced sensibly, while the Ninja 400 and the Ninja 500 had the same price, which is why Kawasaki thought it best to discontinue the 400 in India and globally as well. Kawasaki offered significant discounts on the Ninja 400 leading up to its discontinuation, in a bid to sell off the remaining stock. Also Read: Kawasaki Ninja 500 Launched In India The Kawasaki Ninja 400 had a 399 cc parallel-twin, liquid-cooled motor.

Power output stands at 45 bhp at 9,000 rpm, while torque is set at 42.6 Nm at 6,000 rpm. The motor is paired with a 6-speed gearbox. Currently, the Ninja 500 goes up against the likes of the Aprilia RS 457, KTM RC 390 and the Yamaha YZF R3 in India. Starts at ₹ 4.99 Lakh"

    "article_content": "By 1 mins read Published on June 3, 2024 Follow us on Recent patent filings reveal that Kawasaki is working on two new hybrid models, one being a new hybrid Kawasaki Eliminator cruiser, and the second one possibly being a hybrid Kawasaki Versys. Patent applications filed by Kawasaki reveal the hybrid plans for these two models, particularly dwelling on how to package two powertrains and their energy reservoirs. The challenge will be to pack the combination of both an internal combustion engine, electric motor, fuel tank and battery packs in the same frame. Also Read: Kawasaki Ninja ZX-4RR Launched At Rs. 9.10 Lakh For the hybrid versions of the Versys and Eliminator, Kawasaki seems to have decided to change the layout of the components to better suit each bike’s shape and requirement. Kawasaki has already tackled the issue in the Ninja 7 Hybrid and Z7 Hybrid by placing the hybrid battery and related electronics in a box placed underneath the rider’s seat. This design allows Kawasaki to retain the conventional position of a fuel tank and airbox above the engine, while the electric motor is placed in the space directly above the transmission. But this design has one drawback. The placement of the battery makes the design of the hybrid motorcycles unconventionally longer and visually different from the petrol-powered variants. Also Read: Kawasaki Eliminator Launched In India At Rs. 5.62 Lakh The hybrid Kawasaki Eliminator will likely have similar proportions and design as the current petrol-powered Kawasaki Eliminator. The recent patent drawings for the hybrid versions of the Eliminator and Versys reveal that the design makes for the battery to be shifted from below the seat to new position above the engine’s cylinder head. This allows for freeing up the underseat area, allowing for more conventional proportions and styling. With the battery above the engine, which means fuel tank space is compromised, Kawasaki intends to make both the hybrid Elimiator and hybrid Versys models wider with two plastic fuel tanks, one on each side, and bolted outside the trellis-frame. Also Read: Top 5 Highlights Of Kawasaki Ninja 500 With Kawasaki surely but certainly moving towards introducing hybrid technology in more models in its current production line-up. The hybrid Versys and Eliminator models seem like a logical step in that direction and it could only be a matter of time before Kawasaki introduces more hybrid models, across its motorcycle line-up, and across different segments and engine displacement.

The Japanese auto giant has now introduced the 2025 Ninja ZX-10R and Ninja ZX-10RR bringing new colours to the litre-class sportbikes. The MY2025 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R and Ninja ZX-10RR get cosmetic updates while the hardware remains unchanged. Also read: Kawasaki Planning Two More Hybrid Models The 2025 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10RR is now available in a new single-colour paint scheme - Metallic Matte Graphene steel Gray. The new paint job has been developed in association with the Kawasaki Racing Team’s endeavour in WorldSBK. The new colour brings an all-black look to the full-faired motorcycle while the graphics are finished in green. The 2025 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R also arrives with two new colours - Metallic Flat Spark Black/Ebony and Lime Green/Ebony/Pearl Blizzard White on the KRT edition. Much like the Ninja ZX-10RR, the Ninja ZX-10R gets only aesthetic changes, while packing 3 bhp and 3 Nm less than the former. The 2025 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10RR is the more track-focused version based on the Ninja ZX-10R. The former is the closest you can get to the WorldSBK race bike in a road-legal avatar.

    "article_content": "By Preetam Bora 1 mins read Published on February 9, 2016 Follow us on The new Kawasaki Versys 650 is finally here - a bike many enthusiasts have been waiting for. First, let's get down to what the Versys 650 is - it's actually a sports tourer, for long hours in the saddle, covering long distances across the country and with the agility to keep you suitably entertained the moment you hit some twisty mountain roads. The name Versys is actually derived from two words - 'versatile' and 'system' - and the engineers at Kawasaki have certainly done justice to the bike's name. It's a motorcycle with multiple traits - easy to use for the daily commute, for the weekend breakfast ride (if you're so inclined), or even longer excursions to the nearest hills or the annual expedition covering large distances across the country. Looks and Design Aesthetically, the Kawasaki Versys 650 looks more or less similar to its elder sibling - the Versys 1000, with its tall stance that seems to murmur 'touring' instantly. Kawasaki says the Versys looks not only sporty, with distinctive Kawasaki identity, but its design is also functional - offering a balance of style, wind protection, aerodynamics and airflow management. Although offered in several colours and variants, including a 'Light Touring' variant abroad, in India, the Versys 650 will only be available in one ABS variant and one colour - the metallic black shade on the bike we are riding. The front section is dominated by the twin headlamps mounted on the fairing with a large adjustable windshield. The meters are simple and easy to read, but a gear position indicator is missed. The seat is flat and wide with ample support for a pillion rider. So, rest assured there won't be so many complaints from the significant other or the need to take frequent breaks when you set out on a two-up adventure on the Versys 650. Yes, the pillion seat actually is quite comfortable. Swing a leg over the saddle and you realise that it's quite a tall bike. The seat height (at 840mm) may feel a little daunting, especially for riders of short stature, but once you are perched on it, it feels cushy and comfortable. The pillion is still higher, so you have to step on the rear footpeg first to mount that tall pillion seat. The kerb weight is 216kg, so the Versys isn't exactly what you'd call a 'light' motorcycle. What you immediately notice are the friendly ergonomics - you sit upright, the handlebar is wide and the position of the footpegs is neutral - not set too far back, and not too far forward. Engine and Performance Thumb the starter and the 649cc parallel-twin comes to life with a welcoming, nice burble. Slot it into first and release the clutch and you are immediately impressed by the smooth and responsive throttle response, thanks partly to the digital fuel injection. The six-speed gearbox isn't exactly slick, the shifts settling in with a 'thunk', but the gearshifts are precise, without us ever encountering any misses or false neutrals. The engine makes 68bhp of power at 8,500rpm and peak torque of 64Nm at 7,000rpm. The figures may not be worth swooning over, but what is important here is that the Versys 650 has a usable power band, the power kicks in quite low in the rev range and is spread out over a wide band, offering a rush of acceleration when you open the throttle. In fact, the Versys 650 feels quite quick and powerful, accelerating through the gears. If you're over enthusiastic on the throttle, second gear is good enough to lift off tarmac and salute the skies, so a word of caution is advised. The mid-range is what impressed us the most - as is the throttle response. There's enough juice to hit triple digit speeds before you realise you still have a couple of shifts left to hit sixth. There's no surge of acceleration at the top of the rev range, but you wouldn't need to be wringing the throttle wide open anyway, there's plenty of torque and power kicking in at lower revs and that's what makes the Versys 650 a joy to ride within the city and in traffic. Lively acceleration, relaxed cruising speeds and a windshield that's quite effective in keeping the windblast at bay is all you need to cover kilometre after kilometre and hours on hours on the road. Ride, Handling and Braking At 216kg, the Versys 650 isn't exactly light, but the steering is neutral and it feels quite effortless once on the move. The chassis is brilliant and what shines is the exceptional suspension set up. The ride is plush, yet taut enough to glide effortlessly over broken road, potholes, speedbreakers and the like. The long-travel 41mm front fork is a high quality Showa unit, with separate functions for each tube, with adjusters at the top of the fork for easy adjustment. Combining both long travel and stiff springs, you can adjust both ride height and rebound damping (if needed) for riding in different conditions. The rear suspension is an offset monoshock and it works well too. What's unique is that it comes with an easy remote preload adjuster, so if you need to carry a pillion and/or luggage, you can quickly adjust the settings without needing any tools. The default setup works great though and we didn't need to tweak any settings over the different road conditions we rode the bike over. Although marketed as a dual-sport machine, the alloy wheels and street-oriented tyres of the Versys 650 do have some limitations, at least when it comes to hard-core off-road riding. But that's something the average rider will seldom be doing. But it's got 170mm ground clearance and the bit of off-road conditions we threw at the bike, the Versys 650 came out trumps, even with street tyres. Of course, replacing the stock tyres with dual sport rubber would certainly make the Versys 650 a lot more capable when the tarmac ends. Handling is superb and despite the tallish stance of the bike, it gives you the confidence of a sport bike, urging you to push farther, tighter into corners. It's an eye opener really, how brilliantly this bike handles on tarmac. Braking is top notch too and the inclusion of ABS (missing on both the ER-6n and the Ninja 650 - which share the same engine), offers sure-shot and confident braking, shedding speeds with ease. Verdict The Kawasaki Versys 650 is a great bike to ride around the city - riding in traffic isn't much of a wrestle, considering the bike looks quite tall and imposing. The seat height is not too tall for the average Indian and you get very good visibility in traffic. It's quite nimble to handle and is actually quite a fun bike from stop light to stop light. Then, of course, you can very comfortably tour on this bike - go on those long, long rides across different cities, different states, and yeah, across the country too. And while you're at it, the Versys 650 can quite easily take on rough terrain - so Ladakh, Spiti, shouldn't be a problem at all. But we'd definitely recommend some dual sport tyres for some added traction, if you're going to be venturing out to where tarmac is rare. The Versys 650 could very well be all the bike you need - for your daily commute, for the weekend ride, and even for the long haul with your significant other as pillion with luggage. At Rs 7.3 lakh (on-road Delhi), you can look at the Benelli 600 GT and even the Honda CBR 650F as options. And of course, there's the Triumph Tiger 800 , but that's quite a few lakhs more expensive. Overall, the Versys 650 is a fantastic motorcycle and we think it's worth all the money you will pay for. (Photography: Anshul Uniyal) Last Updated on February 9, 2016 Starts at ₹ 7.77 Lakh"

    "article_content": "By Preetam Bora 1 mins read Published on June 5, 2017 Follow us on You could be fooled into believing it's an all-new motorcycle, the new Kawasaki Ninja 650 . It now gets styling inspired by its bigger supersport sibling, the ZX-10R, and that itself is a very good thing indeed; the 2017 Ninja 650 looks much, much, better than the earlier model. And yes, it looks like a proper sportbike now, with a completely redesigned front fairing and fuel tank. Overall fit and finish on the bike is excellent; the new five-spoke wheels are lighter, the underbelly exhaust is shorter, helping centralize the mass. The handlebars aren't clip-ons but designed to look like clip-ons; clearly underlining the sport touring creds of the Ninja 650. 2017 Kawasaki Ninja 650 gets styling inspired from ZX-10R The face has been completely redesigned, with a new adjustable windshield and new headlights. There's a new LED taillight, and the instrument panel has been revised too, and gets a part-analogue, part-digital treatment with easy read outs for almost everything you need. And then, there's a new pressed-steel gull-arm swingarm; opinion is divided, and we're not sure it really complements the overall look. But in all, the new Ninja 650 certainly looks premium, more stylish and more in line with the \"Kawasaki Ninja\" name. 2016 Kawasaki Ninja 650 gets sportier, sleeker design Thumb the starter and there's no drama; give it a fistful of revs and there's no roar; no intake whine, no deep exhaust note. But slot it into gear and open the throttle, and the commuter-ish motor seems to wake up. The parallel-twin does have some buzz in higher revs, but speeds build quickly through the gears. Acceleration is rapid, and the rev limiter lights up much before there's any protest from the parallel-twin engine. There's no music from the exhaust, but the Ninja 650 is no slouch either; triple digit speeds and beyond arrive quickly even before you realise you're going that fast. New Ninja 650 is 19 kg lighter than the 2016 model A new trellis frame, new swingarm and lighter wheels make the Ninja 650 shed weight - almost 19 kg over the earlier model! The new steering geometry with a sharper rake and shorter trail, makes the bike more precise and more willing to turn. Yes, the new Ninja 650 is a good handler, and unless you're pushing the bike to its limits, or to the Dunlop tyres' limits, to be more specific, handling is quite predictable and the bike is willing to turn in with enthusiasm. Part of that credit also goes to the stiffly sprung suspension; the 41 mm KYB fork at the front is non-adjustable, but the rear shock is adjustable for preload. Brakes, now with standard ABS, are excellent, and offer sure and certain stopping power. 2017 Kawasaki Ninja 650 is eager to turn, and more precise The 649 cc parallel-twin engine may have been carried forward from the previous model, but it's got new components - there are lighter aluminium cylinders, new injectors, smaller throttle bodies, new camshafts, a revised airbox and exhaust, and the engine has been retuned. On paper, it makes less power than the outgoing model with 67 bhp, but the 65.7 Nm of torque comes in lower in the revs. All in all, it has better acceleration, and more midrange power, and it's more agile, more fun and more versatile. New Kawasaki Ninja 650 is a versatile commuter and tourer The Ninja 650 may be a middleweight, but it feels like a small bike, and it doesn't have the intake roar or exhaust note associated with a high-performance motorcycle. It feels at ease handling traffic, and is equally comfortable on the highway, if you're in the mood for occasional long distance touring. If you're looking to upgrade from a smaller bike, or you're new to motorcycling, at Rs. 5.69 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), the Kawasaki Ninja 650 could well be all the bike you need.

    "article_content": "By Preetam Bora 1 mins read Published on July 3, 2017 Follow us on The Kawasaki Z800 always holds a special place in my heart; no, not the new Kawasaki Z900 , but the Kawasaki Z800, which is what the Z900 replaces. It's a bike which had a sweet personality - smooth, refined, in-line four performance, as well as a very tractable engine which sounds equally engaging. And it's one bike which introduced me to rapid acceleration and hairy speeds, and made it all seem easy, effortless, and forgiving. Now in 2017, Kawasaki has introduced the new Z900, and it replaces the Z800, gets a new, bigger engine, new chassis, and most importantly, sheds a lot of weight. The Kawasaki Z900 has muscular looks and aggressive road presence The Kawasaki Z900 has those same aggressive and muscular lines as the outgoing Z800. The overall silhouette is pretty much similar to the Z800, but look closely, and the differences become obvious. First up, is the new steel trellis frame, painted a nice green, which stands out against the dark grey shade of our test bike. The Z900 also has a slightly curvier body than the Z800, but one thing which remains intact is the road presence. The mass is forward biased, and all that muscle makes this Kawasaki look very aggressive, and ready to sprint even when standing still. It's not drop dead gorgeous, at least to me, but keep looking at it, and the Kawasaki Z900's looks begin to grow on you. If muscular attitude and road presence is what you seek, this has dollops of it. Kawasaki Z900 gets a full-digital instrument panel The all-digital instrument console has good readability with a large speed display, fuel gauge, trip meter, and fuel consumption as well as range. The digital rev needle, though takes some getting used to. At idle, the Z900 is quiet, and has that typical, Japanese in-line four hum. The seating is comfortable, the handlebar is flat and wide, falls comfortably to your hands, and the sculpted tank feels naturally recessed to grab with your knees. Our test ride involved a fair bit of riding in traffic, and what is immediately noticeable is that it's an easy bike to handle. The loss in weight (over 20 kg over the Z800), makes it quite nimble, and it is apparent when you manoeuvre it through traffic, or back it out of a parking spot. The Kawasaki Z900 is easy to ride, thanks to the light clutch and slick gearshift The slip and assist clutch is light on the fingers, the gears click into place with precision, and the addition of a gear position indicator is certainly very welcome. But what is more welcome is that the 948 cc in-line four engine doesn't really heat up much to make things uncomfortable, whether you're stuck at a stop light or in bumper to bumper traffic. The gearing is low, so sixth gear pulls cleanly from as low as 40 kmph, and there's ample low to mid-range grunt for easy city use. There's no need to really downshift much, unless you want the in-line four to sing to you, which it does, as soon as the revs begin to rise. The Kawasaki Z900 weighs 20 kg less than the Z800, has a new engine, and makes more power A slight twist of the right hand and things can get very, very, fast in very short time. Cross 5,000 revs, and the Z900 comes into a different element; all that sixth gear 40 kmph talk is forgotten, and it pulls and pulls and pulls, accelerating briskly and speeds rising to unmentionable levels. There's no sense of the power beginning to taper off, and I had to back off from the throttle, before things get hairier, and the wind blast got to me. The loss in weight and the new frame suitably complements the Z900's performance. It isn't exactly light at 208 kg kerb weight, but show it a corner or two, and the Z900 sticks to its line and will respond to your smallest inputs, whether you're leaned over or making mid-corner corrections. In all, the new Kawasaki Z900 is fast, stable and agile, and those qualities will certainly help improve your riding skills. The Kawasaki Z900's 948 cc in-line four engine is smooth, lively and revs freely In terms of rider aids, there's just ABS, and that's it; no traction control, no riding modes and no ride-by-wire. All that is in your right hand, so careful with that! The Kawasaki Z900's 948 cc in-line four motor makes just over 123 bhp at 9500 rpm, while peak torque of 98.6 Nm kicks in at 7500 rpm. I'd wager there's a steady flow of torque from even lower revs, to give it that easy going vibe. But open the throttle, and the Z900 transforms from well-heeled gent to proper street hooligan! Remember though, there's no traction control, so an overeager right hand may have you going too fast for your own good on a straight, and on a curve, things may very quickly change from dramatic to dangerous. But the brakes are excellent; the bite and progression gives you the confidence to shave speeds in hurry, and the standard ABS makes sure things remain well under control. The Z900 has muscular, aggressive looks backed by superb performance Prices for the base variant Kawasaki Z900 starts at a very competitive Rs. 7.68 lakh (ex-showroom) and it ups the naked game with a smooth, lively, engine, beautiful handling and great all-round road manners. Yes, there are no electronic rider aids to speak of, and the lack of a windscreen or fairing will have the wind blast get to you, long before you start exploring the bike's top end performance, or touring potential, if you're so inclined. On our road test, the Z900 returned just over 15 kmpl on combined highway and street riding, so range on the 17-litre fuel tank will be limited to just over 250 km, which is actually not that bad. It isn't perfect, but it's easy to use in traffic, and has enough performance to delight you every time you take it out for a spin.

    "article_content": "By Seshan Vijayraghvan 5 mins read Published on February 22, 2023 Follow us on Before Kawasaki went on to sell fast, powerful and premium motorcycles in India, the brand was known for some very popular small-capacity bikes. Right from the Boxer and Caliber to the Wind 125 and the 4S Champion the company launched several entry-level models under its partnership with Bajaj Auto from the 80s. However, that partnership is now history, and since 2017, India Kawasaki Motor has struck out alone, focussing largely on premium motorcycles. Having said that, the Japanese two-wheeler brand has now decided to return to its roots, and venture into the entry-level motorcycle space in India again. This time, with the Kawasaki W175 . Interestingly, Kawasaki has chosen one of the most popular segments as its entry-point – modern classic bikes. Now, Royal Enfield has been dominating this segment for the longest time, however, in the last few years several new players have entered this space. Brands like Jawa , Yezdi , and more recently even TVS came in with the Ronin . And now, with the W175, Kawasaki hopes to get a piece of this lucrative pie. We spent a day with Kawasaki’s new contender to find out what the bike has to offer. The Japanese brand venture into the entry-level motorcycle space in India again with the Kawasaki W175. Visually, the W175 takes its inspiration from the W Series models of the 1960s, which in turn were inspired by British vertical-twin standard motorcycles of that era. The bike’s retro design is highlighted by the tear-drop-shaped fuel tank, which also comes with gold pinstripes and W insignia, elements that are exclusive to this Candy Persimmon Red paint scheme. At the same time, the single-piece flat seat, and the classic pea-shooter exhaust again underscore the bike’s ‘classic’ design lineage. The W175's design is based on W Series models of the 1960s, and features several retro elements like the round headlamp and peashooter exhaust. The same retro theme has been used to design the round headlamp, taillight and indicators. However, we wish Kawasaki had offered LED units instead of halogen bulbs to match up with the current trend. Also, while the fit and finish of the switchgear are good, some of the other plastic bits could have been of better quality. The bike does miss out modern elements like LED lights, Bluetooth connectivity or dual-channel ABS. In terms of features, Kawasaki has simply focused on offering the bare minimum. So yes, you do get an electric start button with an engine kill switch and a part-digital part-analogue instrument cluster. So, there is an analogue unit for the speedometer, while the small display gives you read-outs for the odometer, trip meter, fuel level and clock. So, no tachometer or Bluetooth connectivity is on offer. Additionally, the design itself looks quite dated and features individual warning lights for the high beam, battery health, neutral position and indicators. The bike comes with a part-digital part analogue instrument cluster, an electric starter and spoked wheels. Continuing with the modern classic theme, the W175 also comes with 17-inch spoked wheels at both ends, and we think Kawasaki should have considered offering alloys at least as an option. Suspension duties are handled by telescopic front forks and hydraulic-type dual spring rear shock absorbers. The bike also gets a single-unit disc brake up front, and a drum unit at the rear, paired with a single-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS). The Kawasaki W175 by a 177 cc single-cylinder, air-cooled engine the is mated to 5-speed gearbox . Powering the motorcycle is a 177 cc single-cylinder, air-cooled, 4-stroke engine that is tuned to put out 12.8 bhp at around 7,500 rpm, and develops a peak torque of 13.2 Nm at 6,000 rpm. Now, on paper, these power figures might not sound all that impressive, but then again with a kerb weight of 135 kg, this is quite a light motorcycle. So, what does that mean? The W175 is quite refined, however, the bike could do with a bit more of low-end torque. Well, from the get-go the W175’s performance feels perky and nimble. But if there is one thing that it doesn’t lack, that’s refinement. In fact, there are minimal vibrations even when you are doing triple-digit speeds. Yes, it can cross the 100 kmph mark. The motor is mated a 5-speed gearbox and the shifts are smooth and precise. In fact, finding neutral is also extremely easy, which means it won’t be very intimidating for newer riders. All that said, we do feel that the motorcycle could do with some more low-end torque. That would have made the bike feel a lot more energetic and fun to ride. The W175 offers good ride quality and even the handling is nice despite its skinny tyres. Coming to ride quality, the W175 can handle most undulations on the road with ease. However, the suspension is tuned to be a bit on the softer side, which means it’s tuned for comfort rather than outright agility. Having said that, despite its skinny tyres, the bike handles quite nicely, and you do not lose confidence even at high speeds. As for the brakes, they are quite progressive, but the single front disc unit could do with a bit more bite. Kawasaki offers the W175 in two colour options - Ebony and Candy Persimmon Red, and they are priced at Rs. 1.47 lakh and Rs. 1.49 lakh (ex-showroom, India) respectively. Yes, the price is a bit steep for a 177 cc motorcycle, but the W175 looks nice, comes with a very refined engine and has the potential to be a good beginner’s motorcycle. The Kawasaki W175 has the potential to be a good beginner’s bike, but the Hunter 350 and Ronin do it better. The only problem is both the Royal Enfield Hunter 350 and TVS Ronin, which are priced similarly, can do all that, and much more. Plus, in a segment where the “no replacement for displacement” adage seems to hold true, the W175 will have a tough task ahead.

    "article_content": "2 Variants 998.0 CC 15 KM/L 17.0 L 6 Speed Dual Semi-floating/Disc Self Start Alloy Wheels Sports Kawasaki’s Ninja H2 is priced on the higher end of the spectrum and is the slightly restricted avatar of the H2R which was also unveiled in India. This premium hypersport motorcycle gets the powerful 998 cc four stroke, liquid cooled in-line engine that dishes out massive power of 197 BHP at 1100 RPM along with 133.5 Nm of maximum torque at 10500 RPM. It also gets a 6-speed return transmission along with inverted front forks and gas-charged shock rear absorbers for better handling. There are dual semi-floating 330 mm disc brakes in front along with single 250 mm disc rear brakes. There is high-tensile steel used for the trellis with the swingarm mounting plate frame as well. Explore an in-depth overview of the Kawasaki Ninja H2 specifications and features, offering comprehensive details on its engine, fuel efficiency, mileage, brakes, max power, and tyre. Additionally, gain insights into the bike's advanced safety features. 998.0 CC Petrol 15 KM/L Dual Semi-floating/Disc 142.00 Nm 197.00,227.00 bhp 120/70ZR17M/C (58W)/ 200/55ZR17M/C (78W) Pros Cons The Kawasaki Ninja H2 offers a street-legal supercharged beast that has backslapping performance and monstrous torque. With top-spec chassis, suspension and brakes, the Ninja H2 leads the charts when it comes to the top-end performance superbikes. The only downside is that it's very expensive! The price of the Kawasaki Ninja H2 is definitely on the higher-end of the spectrum at Rs 41.79 lakhs (for the top model). It is more of a hindered manifestation of the older H2R which was first unveiled in India. The new Ninja H2 is certainly the most powerful production of soad-legal superbike. It was revamped over the last couple of years, the biggest modification being its power figure. It has not only gone through a power hike of almost 31 hp, but also endowed with a ‘self-healing’ paint-job. The new version is all set to providing a unique riding experience. The Ninja H2 is Kawasaki’s flagship super sport model within the portfolio of the Japanese manufacturer. This bike stays true to the bold tagline of the brand, “build beyond belief” with the aggressively honing appearance, complete with the outstanding mirror finish on the body. This machine is purely an epitome of Japanese craftsmanship and has been beautifully crafted at the front with finned cavities at a place where headlights are normally located. The LEDs within the central cluster of the headlight come in the form of fangs for lending to the beast-like appearance of the bike. The single-pod console facing the rider adds to the sportyness of the bike. The appearance of the bike seems to be based on an otherworldly concept. The sleek finishing endows a high-end appeal to the bike. The trellis frame is painted greens and perfectly complements the single-sided swing arm and the raked tail section. The exhaust headers of the bike endow a flowing touch, a hint of grace to the overall look of the bike. Ninja H2’s engine is a massive power house. The inline four-cylinder, supercharged, BS6 compliant 998.0cc engine can dish out a massive output of 197 BHP at 1100 rpm, besides a maximum torque of 133 Nm at 10500 rpm. The maker has impressively increased the power by keeping the engine BS6 compliant at the same time. The H2 also received an upgraded ECU, spark-plugs, intake chamber and air-filter, meaning the bike stays ahead in the competition, even with rivals such as the 214 hp Ducati Panigale V4, also a very powerful and potential road-legal superbike. The Ninja H2 delivers an unmatchable power in terms of manoeuvre, speed and acceleration. The self-healing paint job on the bike provides enhanced protection from minor scratches and small scuffs with the application of heat. Overall, this bike has been powered with additional figures for making it ride faster and smoother than before. The Kawasaki Ninja H2 has a kerb weight of 238kg and remains more agile than some of the competing superbikes. This bike has been equipped with Stylema callipers from Brembo, first seen in the Ducati Panigale V4, and Bridgestone tyres. It also got a brand new TFT screen that has Bluetooth connectivity. The heavy kerb weight may not make its presence felt most of the time in good hands. This machine is rather nimble and fun to rear when ridden by an experienced rider. Gear shifting has remained precise all the while and there is ample power on tap. The thrust response is similar for the third and fourth gear speeds, however, the power archives a whole new level beyond 4000 rpm. However, locating the neutral can be a major issue in some situations. The Kawasaki Ninja H2 has a well-built stance and superior ergonomics that come with softer hip-supporting pads behind the only seat for the rider that this bike has. The seat offers good thigh and back support while accelerating swiftly and moving at higher speeds. However, the posture of riding is rather aggressively designed with the body being hunched over the fuel tank to reach the handle bars. The bent shoulder and back could be painful making riding beyond a few kilometres almost impossible. AS a result, riders may not find this bike suitable to take on long hauls. The impact from potholes and bumper could also be punishing for someone riding on this heavy beast. The Kawasaki Ninja H2 is endowed with a powerful unit having a dual overhead cam styling alongside the dual-speed centrifugal supercharger. Handling and controlling have been made easier with the throttle-by-wire mechanism. There are other technological features available in this bike such as a KEBC or engine-braking control, ABS or ‘anti-lock braking system, ESD or ‘electronic steering damper’, KTRC or traction control, KLCM r launch control and KQS or ‘Kawasaki Quick Shifter’. The fuel economy of the Kawasaki Ninja H2 is 15 kmpl. This is mostly achieved when ridden on highways and the normal city mileage is around 9 kmpl. The fuel tank capacity of this bike is 17 to 19 litres. The Kawasaki Ninja H2 is not perceived from a value-generating outlook. It is one of the most powerful and fastest bikes sold in India that comes across a host of cutting-edge features and high-tech specifications. It further endows oodles of speed, an insane engine, excellent aerodynamics and ergonomics and of course the beast-inspired design. This bike is particularly made for the connoisseurs and the sizable price tag and low mileage won’t count. The after-sale service is pretty good and you will get immediate assistance from the staff. The maintenance cost is high and this is expected from a superbike as massive as the Kawasaki Ninja H2. Some of the on-road rivals of the Kawasaki Ninja H2 having the same class are the Kawasaki Ninja ZX, Ducati Panigale V4, BMW S 1000 RR and Suzuki Hayabusa. As mentioned earlier, the Kawasaki Ninja H2 is not viewed from a value-added perspective. It is ridden for fun and mostly on the race track. It is not the kind of a bike that you would take daily to your workplace. It is not a city commuter, but a massive superbike. Kawasaki Ninja H2 price starting from 34.99 Lakh. Kawasaki offers Ninja H2 in 2 variants. Kawasaki Ninja H2 is available in 1 different colors namely Mirror Coated Black.

This is one of the best options for buyers in a particular segment. Here’s finding out more about this dynamic marvel. The Kawasaki Z1000 was developed with a concentration on both aerodynamics and performance during the design process. The bike has a rugged appearance because to its aggressive design, which combines swept-back lines with sharp angles. Because of its fuel-injected engine, the Z1000 is one of the most powerful motorcycles now available. In 2014, a new iteration of the Z1000 was made public, and this iteration featured a wide variety of enhancements and improvements. The most noticeable modification was the new head lamp assembly, which is an LED-specification unit. The Kawasaki Z1000 was introduced to the public for the first time at the 2013 EICMA, which took place in Milan, Italy. The 2014 iteration of the Streetfighter has received a number of improvements, both mechanically and aesthetically. The most noticeable improvement that has been made to the Z1000 is the installation of a brand new headlight assembly. This new headlight assembly features LED technology and is the first of its kind to come from a Japanese manufacturer. The new 'Sugomi' style that Kawasaki has implemented makes the 2014 Z1000 appear to have a highly menacing and combative demeanour. The Z1000 is Kawasaki's most potent and advanced streetfighter ever produced. The design is one of the most aggressive and sharpest in its category and is defined as the \"Sugomi\" design, which states that the motorcycle looks like a predator ready to pounce on its victim. This design also ranks among the most aggressive and sharpest in its category.Although the front and back of the motorcycle have very little in the way of bodywork, the motorcycle nonetheless gives off the impression of being fairly robust. There is just one version of the Kawasaki Z1000, which is a sports motorbike that competes in the superbike class and serves as the company's flagship model. The 1,043 cc, 4-stroke, 4-cylinder, 16-Valve, liquid-cooled, DOHC engine that is found in the Z1000 is responsible for the production of 140 horsepower at 10,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) and 111 Nm of torque at 7,300 revs per minute (rpm). The Z1000 comes equipped with a 6-speed manual gearbox (the maximum speed of the Kawasaki Z1000 is 258kilometers per hour), rear disc brakes, and front double disc brakes that also include a dual-channel ABS (anti-locking braking system). The Kawasaki Z1000 is an amazing motorcycle and its performance is no exception. The Kawasaki Z1000 is a motorcycle that features an innovative and cutting-edge design. Sugomi is the name of the design concept that contributed to the bike's extraordinarily powerful appearance. In addition to that, it has a stance that is comparable to that of large cats. This design was created with the intention of evoking animal instincts. It has the appearance of a ravenous huge cat and even imitates the behaviour of the dominant male in the South American rain forest.The chassis is constructed using a twin-tube frame composed of aluminium, which provides an exceptionally robust foundation. The frame is made up of five different elements, the first of which is the steering stem, followed by the left and right main frames, and then the two cross pieces. The suspension system works well on level ground as well as uneven terrain, and it is sensitive to the inputs that you give it.The engine on the Kawasaki Z1000 from 2010 has been improved, and it now has better horsepower. In addition to that, it has a fully-adjustable front fork and a horizontal back-link rear shock, all of which are housed in an aluminium frame with twin tubes. Cast 5-spoke wheels and big petal brakes are two more elements of this bicycle.The engine of the Kawasaki Z1000 is a four-stroke unit that has a displacement of 1043 cc and produces 138 horsepower. Because it also features a 6-speed gearbox, it is an outstanding candidate for use as a sport-touring vehicle. Both the handling and traction of the bike are very good on city streets. The information contained in the instrument cluster is not only easy to read but also vital to the riding experience. The Kawasaki Z1000 is one of the best motorcycles to ride. With its naked design, the bike offers stunning handling and best-in-class performance. Though heavier than its competitors, the bike's twin spar aluminium frame provides extra comfort. In addition, the new frame is 30% stiffer than its predecessor. This makes it a great choice for commuters who want extra power without the extra weight.A more aggressive stance is created by the idealized dimensions of the riding position, which sees the front of the vehicle reduced while the back of the vehicle is raised. Riders are in a better position to fully capitalize on the Z1000's potential for sportier street riding as a result of the more aggressive riding position, which is matched by the bike's more direct throttle response and handling. Brand-new, form-fitting bodywork conveys the sense of a predator that is crouched and ready to pounce. The Z1000 has a more direct and sporty street-riding performance, which is hinted as by its slim and musculatured design. The extremely stiff aluminium frame has a high degree of mass centralization, which allows for precise turns while still maintaining a comfortable level of control. A narrow structure between the wheels is possible thanks to the aluminium twin-tube frame design's frame beams that go above the engine. The engine itself serves as a stressed part in the frame, making it both lightweight and extremely robust. The frame provides a feeling that is both hard and rooted, as well as good stability and turning that is both light and nimble.The suspension of the Z1000 is designed to mimic that of a race bike. It has large springs on the front and rear, preload adjustability in the left fork tube, and compression and rebound damping in the right fork tube. Compared to cartridge-type forks, the Z1000's damping piston is large, allowing for less pressure on the front suspension. The bike's ABS system helps it maintain its traction and stability at all speeds.The Z1000 isn't as big as most bikes of this class, but it offers comfortable riding position and easy manoeuvrability. Its low seat and compact body are more ideal for city riding than cross-country touring. However, it's still not ideal for long-range touring. It's not too heavy, and the handlebars are wide, which makes the Z1000 feel like a big dirt bike. A bit of leverage is required when pushing the throttle hard. The name Kawasaki has always been synonymous with producing motorcycles of exceptional quality, and the Z1000 lives up to that reputation. Because it comes with so many impressive extras, this motorcycle is widely considered to be among the very best choices now available. It features anti-lock brakes (ABS), electronic traction control, and a gearbox with six different speeds. A big tachometer and a digital display that provides information on the current conditions and settings of the bike are both included in the analogue and digital instrument cluster that this model comes with. The Kawasaki Z1000 is an excellent choice for riders who are interested in purchasing a dependable yet reasonably priced motorcycle. You can expect roughly 9 kmpl in terms of the average mileage. The Kawasaki Z1000 isn't your average motorcycle. It's a niche bike that's designed for truly passionate riders. But is it good value for money? Let's take a look. When you first sit on the Kawasaki Z1000, you'll notice just how comfortable it is. The seat is specially designed to provide great support while also being comfortable to ride for hours on end. This is important, because the Kawasaki Z1000 is a long distance touring bike – perfect for long rides in the countryside or through city streets. However, the pricing may seem exorbitant. However, if you consider the engine capacity and sheer power and performance, it makes for a proper fit. Motorcycles manufactured by Kawasaki will be offered for sale in India by the India Kawasaki Motors Pvt. Ltd. (IKM) dealer network, which will also be responsible for providing any after-sale servicing that may be required. Since 2009, Kawasaki has been in a partnership with Bajaj Auto Ltd. (Bajaj) regarding the distribution of Kawasaki motorbikes and the provision of after-sales service through Bajaj's dealer network (Probiking). This partnership has lasted for a total of eight years. However, an amicable decision led to the successful alliance with Bajaj in India ceasing to exist as of April 1, 2017. This will allow IKM to strengthen and promote the Kawasaki brand experience to customers through enhanced marketing activities in conjunction with Kawasaki Global marketing. The sales and after-sales service activities for Kawasaki motorcycles will be started through IKM's own dealer network in India. One of the most formidable rivals for the brand new Kawasaki Z1000 is the Suzuki Hayabusa at Rs.16.41 Lakh onwards, Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R at Rs.15.99 Lakh onwards, Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX at Rs.11.98 Lakh onwards, Suzuki Katana at Rs.13.61 Lakh onwards, Ducati Monster at Rs.12.49 Lakh onwards, and others. Overall quality and fit-finish are great, and the Z1000 comes with outstanding detailing. Take note of how well the belly pan conceals the bike's shape. It has a pair of sleek stainless steel exhausts that stare out determinedly from either side of this new, masculine motorcycle, as well as stylish wheel border decorations. Kawasaki naked bikes from Japan are meeting the future head-on. The Z1000 doesn’t just look beautiful, but also packs a powerful punch. Apart from this, the Z1000 is nearly perfect, featuring an 'equator' wide, user-friendly powerband and a consistently silky feel. The Z1000 delivers its performance so smoothly and effortlessly from so low in the powerband that it makes even Honda's outstanding competition, the CB1000R, feel like it's nearing the end of its useful life. Given its explosive performance, traction control would be a welcome addition to the Z1000, if there is anything missing from this powerful Kawasaki. The engine is rubber mounted, and slots in as a stressed part of the frame. In front, the Z1000 comes with distinct function upside down telescopic forks, with preload adjustment via the left fork, and compression and rebound damping on the right. In the back, you'll find an aluminium swingarm, an adjustable monoshock, and a horizontal layout. Front and rear wheels measuring 17 inches are shod with sticky rubber that contributes to the Z1000's excellent handling and traction. For a superbike in the litre class, it consistently impresses riders as surprisingly light and agile. This motorcycle has a neutral steering feel and can be directed with relative ease. Confidence is maintained even at high speeds through corners because to the bike's firm setup, which aids handling. Unfortunately, the Z1000's suspension isn't quite up to the task of handling India's rough roads, and the ride quality may be jarring at times. It's best to sit up and wait a few seconds until the road smooths out and the motorcycle has settled down if you find yourself in such a predicament. This bike isn't built for racing through rough turns. Kawasaki has delivered a compelling package with the new Z1000, a naked superbike that instils a sense of assurance thanks to its legendary ease of use. The Z1000 is one of the most forward-thinking signs that the next generation of Japanese naked superbikes is here. It's too bad Kawasaki skimped on electronic aids and doesn't bundle traction control with the potent Z, but to be fair, neither does any other serious competitor in India. Overall, the Z1000, at a not so cheap price, nevertheless, is hard to beat if you’re in the market for an in-line, four-cylinder litre class naked superbike in India.

Share your experience about Kawasaki Versys 650 Complete Package By Veeraraghavan N @ Dec 26, 2019 10:55 PM 4.0 Always wanted an easy to ride and entertaining bike and Versys 650 fits perfectly. After doing much of market research on which bike to be brought with under 10 lakhs price range, I picked up Versys 650. I have picked Suzuki V-Strom and Versys and preferred V-Storm over Kawasaki since it was having traction control and tubeless type on spoke wheels but there was no dealer selling premium Suzuki bike in Kochi and nearest one was in Calicut and 4000 Kms service interval made me to rethink the option of V-Storm. Between that, FB post from Triumph Kochi came to my attention and they were offering good discounts and EMI schemes on Tiger XR. I made a visit to their showroom and felt good on showroom experience where you get a good premium feel as customer which was purely missed in Kawasaki showroom. Took a test ride of Tiger and felt good other that the heat management, on the same day called Kawasaki guy and took the test ride of Versys on same route and very much impressed with its performance. Since Tiger is considered the benchmark in adventure touring segment and Versys was matching Tiger performance at-least by 80% and with price difference of around 6 lakhs, I zeroed on Versys, booked the bike same day. Will surely consider Tiger for future upgrades. Coming on to ownership of Versys, service is not that great with Kawasaki, parts are very expensive and not available when required. Seat height is not a problem for me since I'm 5.11. Long distance is easy on the bike since the suspension and riding position is very good which keep you going miles after miles. The bike is amazing and keeps you engaged during your ride which makes big smile on your face. If you are looking for bike to show off with loud exhaust note, high speed flyby etc. then Versys may not be your machine. This bike is made for long distance touring on highways only.

    "article_content": "636.0 CC 23.6 KM/L 17.0 L 6 Speed Dual Disc/Disc Electric Start Alloy Sports Kawasaki India has launched the all-new Ninja ZX-6R in India at a price tag of Rs 11.09 lakh (ex-showroom). Globally unveiled in June 2023, the motorcycle gets updated styling, mechanical upgrades, and new tech, along with an updated version of the 636 cc inline-four engine. The new ZX-6R is available in only one variant and can be had in two colours- Lime Green and Metallic Graphite Gray. Visually, the new ZX-6R features all-new styling, with the most noticeable change being the new headlamps that give it a sharper appearance. Towards the rear, it gets the signature Ninja series taillamp. In terms of features, the motorcycle gets a new TFT full-colour instrumentation with smartphone connectivity via the Kawasaki Rideology app. Ride modes in the motorcycle include Sport, Rain, Road, and customisable Rider modes. In terms of cycle parts, the motorcycle gets a 41 mm Showa inverted fork setup along with a bottom-link Uni-Trak monoshock unit at the rear. Both ends are fully adjustable for preload, compression and rebound damping. The braking setup for the new bike includes dual semi-floating 310mm discs with 4-piston calipers at the front and a single 220mm petal disc with a single-piston caliper at the rear. The braking setup is mated to the Kawasaki Intelligent Anti-Lock Brake System (KIBS) ABS system. Other rider aids on the motorcycle include traction control, slipper clutch and a quick shifter. On the powertrain front, the liquid-cooled, inline-four, 636 cc engine in the ZX-6R now gets a whole bunch of mechanical upgrades which include new exhaust headers, new cam profile and a redesigned exhaust system. The updated powertrain churns out 122.3 bhp and 69 Nm of peak torque, marginally lower figures than its predecessor. The engine is mated to a 6-speed transmission. Explore an in-depth overview of the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R specifications and features, offering comprehensive details on its engine, fuel efficiency, mileage, brakes, max power, and tyre. Additionally, gain insights into the bike's advanced safety features. 636.0 CC Petrol 23.6 KM/L Dual Disc/Disc 69.00 Nm 122.00 bhp 120/70ZR17M/C (58W)/ 180/55ZR17M/C (73W) Pros Cons The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R flaunts a really attractive and eye-catching design. This is a signature Kawasaki look and there are some cool components. These include the large ram air intake positioned between the layered fairing design and headlights. The look is still a lot similar to the Kawasaki Ninja 400 although some more differentiation may have been ideal. Quality and fit and finish make this one of the most attractive supersports models in its segment. The size of the thing and its premium nature are not lost on riders. The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R corners nicely without any steering damper. Sometimes you may think you require one while navigating bumpier portions of roads with aggressive acceleration. The bike feels composed enough on most surfaces. The softer setup also functions since you need not always reach huge speeds for enabling the suspension system. Braking too hard or pushing through bumpier corners will bring forward the slightly under-damped nature of the suspension. Racing on the track will require tweaking of the adjustment screws for a littlemore firmness. The street performance and ride quality are excellent although brake fade may be a common affair after navigating several laps on a racetrack. The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R offers reasonable comfort and quality. The riding position is just like a pure racetrack bike and the foot pegs are not as high as the 10R. Yet, the clip-ons are quite on the lower side, meaning that the wrists are positioned lower than your backside. Core strength is vital for riding this bike! The ergonomics could have been tweaked better for ensuring that initial level of comfort. However, after some time when you are getting used to the motorcycle, the suspension setup will please you with its quality. Showa is known for its suspension systems and completely adjustable units are found in several sports bikes nowadays. The damping on the bike is nice if you are using the stock settings. Small potholes and bumps are neatly tackled while you have to be cautious over deeper potholes. This will help you safeguard the rims and avoid lower back hassles too. The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R comes with a quick shifter that is super-smooth and the electronics include three-stage traction control, ABS and a couple of power modes. There are Bridgestone Battlax S22 tyres along with two full-LED headlights, slipper clutch and adjustable levers. Other technologies include KTRC or Kawasaki Traction Control, KQS or Kawasaki Quick Shifter and KIBS or Kawasaki Intelligent Anti-Lock Brake System. Other features include an LED tail light, big analogue tachometer, smart instrument cluster, gear position indicator, warning lamps and a multifunctional LCD display setup along with a fuel gauge and remaining range display. The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R offers mileage of 23.6 Kmpl. The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R comes with a 636 cc four-cylinder in-line engine that churns out 126 bhp and 70.80 Nm of peak torque at 13,500 and 11,500 RPM respectively. There is a 6-speed gearbox that is paired to the engine and this comes with revamped gearing as well. Kawasaki has also stated that the motorcycle now offers improved low-range and mid-range power. While cruising on the highway or city rides are seamless, it is the race track where this powerful sports bike truly belongs. If you consider the Rs. 10.49 lakh (ex-showroom) price tag of the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R, then value based aspects go out of the window. A sports bike with a top speed of 260 Kmph and a massive 636 cc engine and that too on Indian roads? While it may be impractical for some, many riders will go for the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R for the sheer joy of premium biking, complete with power, performance, sportiness and a bevy of top-class rider aids nad features.

Powered by a 1,043 cc liquid-cooled, four-pot motor that develops 140 bhp at 10,000 rpm and 111 Nm of peak torque at 8,000 rpm, the bike has a lot of electronic aids including ABS, cruise control, three-level traction control, Kawasaki Cornering Management function, quickshifter and more. The Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX certainly looks the part, flaunting its drop-dead gorgeous superbike looks with elan. There is the new styling template as part of the 2021 update, complete with the brand new single-sided muffler. The brand new exhaust setup has a 4-into-2-into pre-chamber into-1 system.

There is an LED tail lamp along with red LED bulbs and even a smoked lens which enhances the appearance of the tail cowl. The Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX comes with a bunch of technologies and rider aids for enhanced riding pleasure. There is the KQS (Kawasaki Quick Shifter) which supplements the exciting engine. This enables clutchless up shifting and downshifting for rapid and swift acceleration/deceleration. The Kawasaki Cornering Management Functionality also helps greatly in tracking chassis and engine parameters throughout corners. This includes corner entry, apex and exit. Engine power and brake force are neatly modulated for enabling smoother transitions to braking from acceleration and back. This helps riders corner smoothly while KIBS (Kawasaki Intelligent Anti-Lock Brake System) helps in ensuring high-precision controls for regulating brake presure for sportier riding. KIBS integrates corner braking management, modulating brake force for riders. The Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX offers ample riding comfort and convenience with smart features like electronic cruise control. This enables activation of a desired speed by pressing a button. The rider will not have to continually apply throttle thereafter, lowering right hand stress while covering long distances. This also helps in relaxed cruising and higher riding comfort. There are Bridgestone Battlax Hypersport S22 tyres which enable lighter handling and superior grip throughout both wet and dry terrains. This naturally enhances rider pleasure and confidence alike. There is greater comfort afforded by the wind protection feature. This comes from the full-fairing bodywork and a new windshield that has four positions. It can be adjusted by hand. The Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX comes with several features including electronic cruise control, KQS (Kawasaki Quick Shifter), KIBS (Kawasaki Intelligent Anti-Lock Braking System), all-LED lighting, Kawasaki Cornering Management, wind protection and a 4.3” TFT colour instrument console. The compact digital instrument cluster looks stylish and the new metre comes equipped with added features.

The Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX also gets integrated riding modes including Road, Sport or Rain. There is a manual Rider setting too. The Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX offers mileage of 17 Kmpl. With superior technologies and features, it goes without saying that the Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX performs splendidly. The 1043 cc liquid-cooled four-stroke engine has strong pulling power all throughout the rev band. Engine responses are superb with the strong mid-range and heady exhaust/throttle note. Electronic cruise control also contributes towards ensuring smoother power delivery. The engine makes 140 bhp at 10,000 rpm and 111 Nm at 8,000 rpm. If you take the huge sticker price into account, then the Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX will not seem much of a value proposition, particularly on Indian roads. However, true riding enthusiasts and superbike lovers will consider the sheer speed, performance, power and refinement on offer. There is a truckload of smart features and a really appealing design as other plus points. True superbike connoisseurs may find this a value addition to their collections.

The bike has gained the reputation of a sports bike considering some of its key tech features and pricing. The local sourcing of the wheels, panels, wiring, brakes and tyres led to reducing the price and cost of the bike.

Yes, there are no electronic rider aids to speak of, and the lack of a windscreen or fairing will have the wind blast get to you, long before you start exploring the bike's top end performance, or touring potential, if you're so inclined. It isn't perfect, but it's easy to use in traffic, and has enough performance to delight you every time you take it out for a spin. The 2021 Kawasaki Z900 ups the naked game with a lively, smooth engine, impressive handling along with all-round road manners. However, the bike does not feature any type of electronic rider aid, and neither does it come with a fairing or windscreen, and long before the rider starts to explore the touring potential, and top end performance of the bike, it will have the wind blast get to the rider.

The pillion seat is positioned higher; however, it does not come with a backrest. The riding stance is not comfortable enough, with the rider having to bend forward to reach the handlebar. The massive fuel tank gives good support to the knees. The footpegs are positioned a little backward than was necessary. Overall, it can be said that the bike is designed for enthusiasts, rather than daily commuters, as it might be a little uncomfortable for long drives.

Even though it comes with an aggressive design to attract young enthusiasts who want to get the feeling of a race track, better performance is expected in terms of mileage and comfort. Despite all the shortcomings, it has much to offer. It gives the feeling of a superbike and there are very few reasons to not buy this machine. The bike has much potential to offer value to its buyers. Kawasaki Z900 is a high maintenance bike, and in five years it is expected that the total maintenance cost of the bike would be around Rs. 9,09,425.

No heating issues, highway rides returning 22kmpl, doesn't get too much of attention hence safe to park in public, no issue faced whatsoever till date. Though i upgraded from a 200cc to 948cc after riding it i feel like more power could've been handled. Feels solid and planted at all speed, braking is by nissin and does a fantastic job rear brake is useless. Multiple riding modes, full led lighting, tft digital tachometer with awesome riding dynamics what more could anyone ask for. Coming to the cons, wind blast after 120 kmph are dangerous. Stock tyres are total waste. Leds should have been more brighter as currently they don't help at all at night. The biggest con being better dealerships very few are reliable others are there to rob you off your money. Overall every time i lay my eyes on the bike i feel very happy.

    "article_content": "By car&bike Team 5 mins read Published on June 21, 2024 Follow us on If there is one thing that makes any movie flick cool, it’s got to be motorcycles. And what could be better than a motorcycle chase scene? A full movie that revolves around motorcycles. From the wind in the hair feeling, to the sense of freedom, to the undeniable want to do something wild, can always be associated with motorcycles. It is one of the best ways to make yourself feel all alive and kicking. On that note, today being World Motorcycle Day, we have put together a list of movies that are based on motorcycles. That said, a new movie ‘The Bikeriders’ has been released in the theatres today featuring close to 40 vintage motorcycles. The Bikeriders (2024): The movie revolves around the ex-World War II men who put together a motorcycle club to have a good time and enjoy bikes but later get involved in fights with other men only leading to more and more chaos eventually leading to bike gang wars. Directed by Jeff Nicholes, ‘The Bikeriders’ features Tom Hardy, Jodie Comer, Norman Reedus and Austin Butler. If you are an avid motorcyclist, do watch the above trailer, and if you like it, make sure to book tickets for the movie soon. Also Read: World Motorcycle Day 2024: Iconic Motorcycles Sold in India Over The Years Besides that, since you are a fan of motorcycle movies as you are reading this, here is a list of the top six movies that are based, themed or feature motorcycles enough and more times to make you want to go watch it more than once. We hope you enjoy the list. Biker Boyz (2003): If you love the adrenaline of underground drag racing on bike bikes, Biker Boyz has all of that along with a fine mix of action, emotion and biking brotherhood. The movie revolves around the son of the leader of an urban biker gang and the leader himself fighting to retain the title of the fastest drag racer. One of the cool scenes in the movie is when Smoke, played by Laurence Fishbone, does a solo run in the rain on his custom long-wheelbase Suzuki Hayabusa. The Place Beyond The Pine (2012): ‘Luke’, played by Ryan Gosling, is a motorbike stunt rider who turns into a bank robber while using his superior riding skills to get away. He decides to be able to provide for his son he didn’t know about with his former lover. Along with action-packed scenes, the movie has been acclaimed by critics for the plot, drama and also the performance of the artists. A definite watch we say. Torque (2004): If you are aware of the above movie, then, you for sure would know of the movie ‘Torque’. The movie revolves around a biker who has returned to his hometown where he gets framed for the murder of a bike gang leader’s brother. The movie has a mix of fully-faired, street-naked, motocross, chopper bikes and more. The film also has a bike chase scene that features an MTT Y2K turbine-powered motorcycle ridden fearlessly on the street. Also Read: Bollywood Movies With Best Motorcycles Chase Scenes Tron: Legacy (2010): This movie needs no introduction. Everything from the soundtracks to the virtual world graphics to the whole vibe of the movie is just too good. Sam, son of Flynn, is transported into a virtual reality world called ‘the Grid’, where he is a user and has to compete with programs on multiple scenarios to fight his way back into the real world. While the movie begins with a cool scene of Sam riding a classic Ducati Sport 1000, in the virtual world, he competes with other programs in a contest while riding a Tron Light Cycle featuring a smooth bodyline with hubless wheels, neon highlights and is capable of high levels of speed. Burn Out (2017): This one is a French movie that probably never got into the limelight. If you love motorcycle chase scenes, racetracks and high speeds, you ought to enjoy this film. The lead actor in the movie is trying to build a career in motorsports, but ends up giving up that dream and instead is forced to become a drug courier guy to clear the debt on his son’s mother. The hero uses his precision motorcycle riding skills to transport the drug while being chased by criminal gangs when not by the police. The World’s Fastest Indian (2005): Based on real events, this movie is the story of a man named Burt Munro, played by Academy Award winner, Anthony Hopkins, who never let the dreams of youth fade. A periodic film shot to replicate the late 1960s captures the strong determination of Burt to perfect his classic Indian motorcycle to set the fastest land speed record in his class at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. Despite all odds and struggles, the New Zealander competes on his bike, but witnesses an unlikely conclusion towards the end of the movie but undoubtedly remains a legendary must-watch movie in the riding community."

With respect to charging times, the electric SUV can be charged from 20-80 per cent using a 7 kW AC charger in 4 hours, 10 minutes. This reduces to 2 hours, 50 minutes with an 11 kW charger. The model is compatible with a 100 kW DC fast charger and can be juiced up in just 26 minutes for 20-80 per cent of charge. The C3 Aircross also gets a 1.2-litre three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine paired with the 48-volt mild-hybrid technology in the form of an electrified double-clutch automatic transmission. Also offered is a standard turbo-petrol variant featuring the same 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine. Citroen also provided the first look at the SUV’s interior which features a minimalist design. The clutter-free dashboard features a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, a small digital instrument console tucked behind the steering wheel instead of a bulky, conventionally designed one. The Citroen C3 Aircross for Europe will be available in five- and seven-seater iterations, much like in India. The SUV offers a boot capacity of 460 litres in the five-seater version, which will increase further with the rear seats folded. Coming to the Indian market, the C3 family here is based on the heavily localised CMP platform that allows the brand to share several components, powertrains, and more across models. The C3 Aircross in India shares little with its European sibling and is currently only offered with a 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine. Citroen also recently launched a limited-run special edition of its SUV - the C3 Aircross Dhoni Edition - with only 100 units being offered. Starts at ₹ 9.99 - 14.27 Lakh"

    "article_content": "By Sidharth Nambiar 3 mins read Published on May 17, 2024 Follow us on Mahindra revealed that it is closely examining hybrid technology for the Indian market. The automaker, however, also reaffirmed its focus towards developing electric vehicles for the Indian market with a Rs 12,000 crore investment and revealed that it will only start developing hybrid products according to consumer demand. It also talked about the difficulties associated with building a hybrid powertrain from scratch, and the lack of subsidies for hybrid products, while emphasizing that it is looking for ways to localise the technology. Also Read : Mahindra To Launch 16 New Models In India By 2030; Will Include 7 EVs Mahindra has reaffirmed its focus towards EVs and plans to invest Rs 12,000 crores Speaking at the press conference, Anish Shah, Group CEO, Mahindra Group said “From a consumer demand standpoint, if they (hybrids) become a bigger factor, we would be ready for that. We view hybrids as an extension of ICE. If there are significant changes in hybrid technology, that make it much more like an EV, then that's something we would go with much faster. At this point in time, we feel good about the focus on EVs, we are ready for hybrids, and are looking at hybrid technologies closely.” Mahindra’s announcement comes amidst a global shift from EVs to plug-in-hybrid vehicles. The slow adoption of EVs has prompted manufacturers to shift their focus to PHEVs. Manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz, General Motors and Hyundai Motor have invested large sums of money into developing new plug-in-hybrid products, which they believe will facilitate a smoother transition to EVs.

The manufacturer plans to introduce seven new electric SUVs for the Indian market by 2030. The carmaker has said that its first Born Electric SUV is set to arrive in the last quarter of FY2025 (January to March 2025) with subsequent models to follow. Mahindra, however, still plans to produce ICE vehicles well into the decade with an investment of Rs 8500 crores and plans to introduce 9 new SUVs in India by 2030 – 3 facelifts and 6 all-new models.

The Thar 5-door or Thar Armada as it might be called, was spotted testing in a near-production guise in Pune, close to the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) facility. The all-new Mahindra Thar Armada is expected to arrive by August this year. Also Read : Mahindra XUV700 AX5 Select Launched; Gets Panoramic Sunroof, Push-Button Start/Stop The latest spy shots reveal the production parts in place for the Mahindra Thar 5-door.

The model will also come with front and rear centre armrests, a sunroof, a rear wiper, and rear AC vents. The longer wheelbase on the Mahindra Thar 5-door will bring an extra row of seats and an extra set of doors, while also liberating more room in the boot.

Built by Mahindra and Jayem Automotive, the Bujji recently caught the attention of none other than Anand Mahindra, Chairman, Mahindra & Mahindra. Also Read : Mahindra Thar Gets New Deep Forest Green Colour Option The Kalki 2898 AD movie team shared a video on social media showing Anand Mahindra getting into the driver’s seat of Bujji. The video shows Bujji at the Mahindra Towers in Mumbai sharing parking space with Anand Mahindra’s Scorpio-N. The mission was to invade Mumbai. But at Mahindra Towers in Worli, #Bujji ran into its cousin—my scarlet ScorpioN—and negotiated a peace treaty 🙂 Shabaash, @nagashwin7 for producing a landmark Indian Sci-Fi film… My good wishes are with everyone who dreams THIS big….… https://t.co/rRlANKLIWN pic.twitter.com/iO3LwjAaXl Bujji has been getting a lot of attention on social media for its massive size. The car, unlike many CGI models seen in movies, is a real life, fully functioning vehicle and is expected to play a pivotal role in the upcoming sci-fi flick. The specially built vehicle measures 6,075 mm in length, 3,380 mm in width, and 2,186 mm in height. It has a kerb weight of six tonnes.

Propelling the rear spherical wheel are two Mahindra electric motors with a combined output of 125 bhp. It also gets a 47 kWh battery pack. The specially built vehicle can hit a top speed of 45 kmph. Bujji features a canopy, hub-less wheels and special-purpose tyres, which have been provided by Ceat. The custom-built tyres are designed to handle the instant torque and cornering effort when going off-road. The tyres have the lowest aspect ratio, which improves the braking ability thanks to a wider profile and larger rim fitment. The block design pattern on the tyres also ensures better traction, while the steel braided rubber offers better stability and puncture resistance."
